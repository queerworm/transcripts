00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,552
Man on recording:
<i>Everything that you conceive</i>
<i>of yourself as being</i>

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,429
<i>is an illusion.</i>

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,724
<i>There is no self.</i>

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,185
<i>Take a deep breath in.</i>

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,438
( inhales )

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,317
Recording:
<i>Allow yourself to</i>
<i>experience everythingness</i>

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,069
<i>and nothingness.</i>

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,073
<i>As you breathe out,</i>
<i>let go of fear.</i>

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,703
<i>You can choose</i>
<i>to leave the familiar...</i>

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,621
I'm fine.

11
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,665
Recording:
<i>...or stay in the safe</i>
<i>oblivion</i>

12
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,834
-<i> of pain, ignorance... </i>
- Donna.

13
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:46,672
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Recording:<i> ...and</i>
<i>a blank page.</i>

14
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,341
- Gordon: We need
a lot of shrimp on ice.
- Bosworth: $2,000?

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,302
- Gulf white, preferably.
- And not frozen 'cause
people will know.

16
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,305
But two grand for shrimp?
What, are you gonna try
to drown someone in 'em?

17
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,932
-<i> It's crazy. </i>
- Anyone who means anything
throws a lavish party.

18
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,309
At COMDEX,
lavish equals shrimp.

19
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,562
- Did we get
a decent booth location?
- I'm on hold right now.

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,939
- Well, how much
is that gonna cost?
- 18 grand.

21
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,357
Whew.

22
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,903
You're not gonna ask me
50 questions?

23
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,738
You gonna
blow the balls
off the numbers?

24
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,657
Yes, sir.
Yes, hello.

25
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:17,118
That's correct.
27th through the 2nd.
I'm sorry, can you hold?

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,329
Maylene, this phone
is clicking now, too.

27
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,289
- Can you get someone
in here to fix it?
- Yes, sir.

28
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,959
Hello, sorry about that.
What is it?

29
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,256
C-23. Thank you.

30
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:35,429
Commodore, Tandy,
Cardiff Electric.

31
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,557
- ( laughing )
- Gordon: That is huge,
that is huge.

32
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,851
- ( laughs )
-<i> It's so big, I'm telling you.</i>
<i>I've been there.</i>

33
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,313
( groans )

34
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,485
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

35
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,990
You're not upset
about COMDEX?

36
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,867
What?

37
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,327
Why would I want
to go to COMDEX?

38
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,162
It's just
for salesmen, right?

39
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,999
They can just turn it on
to see what I did.

40
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,251
True.

41
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,713
You know, I'll miss you
while I'm there.

42
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,634
Yeah, me, too.

43
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,511
( both laugh )

44
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,221
You tell
Gordon yet?

45
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,682
I keep putting it off.
You think he'll be upset?

46
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,518
Gordon Clark?

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,687
COMDEX.

48
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,982
- Pretty amazing, huh?
- Debbie:<i> I'll take</i>
<i>your word for it.</i>

49
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,318
Well, it's hard to explain
if you haven't actually
been there.

50
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,653
I mean, I don't want
to oversell it or anything,

51
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,780
but it is spectacular.

52
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,032
There's gonna be over
a thousand booths this year.

53
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,575
All the heavy hitters
show up.

54
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:42,412
You got Steve Jobs, Bill Gates,
Mitch Kapor, you know?

55
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,373
IBM takes over
two hotel floors,
and the party scene--

56
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,043
the party scene
is unbelievable.

57
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,671
Donna and I were there in '81,
we started at the penthouse

58
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,380
and worked our way down,

59
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,717
hitting every corporate party
with decent booths.

60
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,385
You got us rooms
at the Norwick, right?

61
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,554
'Cause staying there
is key,

62
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,222
otherwise you spend
the whole week waiting
in line for a taxi.

63
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,601
Trust me, I know.
I learned the hard way.

64
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,062
<i>Wait, are you going, too?</i>

65
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,857
Joe said
he only needed one room.

66
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,734
You're going
to COMDEX without me?

67
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,570
I'm sorry.
It was arranged the week
you were out sick.

68
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,032
- I forgot to tell you.
- Bullshit you forgot
to tell me!

69
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,658
Cameron's
not going either.

70
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,326
Oh, well, if
Cameron's not going,
then all right, then.

71
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,370
Look, it's not like
your role is essential.

72
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,789
Yeah, I only<i> built </i>
the damn thing, Joe.

73
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,416
COMDEX is about selling it
and that is<i> my</i> area of
expertise.

74
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,418
What about the demo?
What if there's a glitch
in the system?

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,337
Like when you
debuted the Symphonic?

76
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,092
I was trying to avoid
bringing it up,

77
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,386
but the fact is,
people still remember
what happened in '81.

78
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,098
I can't afford
to have the stink from that
distracting potential buyers.

79
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,101
But if I need
any troubleshooting,
you're my first call.

80
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,936
I didn't kill myself
all these months

81
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,813
for you to get all
the glory with the Giant.

82
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,691
You plan on seeing me
at booth C-23 on Monday.

83
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:05,453
( panting )

84
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,623

<i>What are you</i>
<i>doing here?</i>

90
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,092
Donna, hey.
Uh, um...

91
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,885
- How long have you
been out here?
- Not long.

92
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,472
I was just, um...

93
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,141
( sighs )

94
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:13,480
- This was a mistake.
- No, no. I just--

95
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,651
- I thought after Lubbock that--
- I shouldn't be here.

96
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:23,323
Could you just forget
you ever saw me?

97
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,493
Of course.
You don't have to worry.

98
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,537
But you really
can't show up like this.

99
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,706
I know, it won't--
it won't happen again.

100
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,084
I promise.

101
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,629
Donna...
I want you to know

102
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,881
I think you're
an amazing woman.

103
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,432
Everything
all right over there?

104
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,019
<i>Noticed you guys had to</i>
<i>dig up your back lawn</i>

105
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,521
a while back,
resod everything.

106
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,691
Just wanna make sure
there's not some sort
of ugly weed

107
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,526
I need to look out for.

108
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,697
Oh, uh, no.
The heat killed off
some patches.

109
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,532
We just didn't
water enough.

110
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,575
Oh, yeah.
( chuckles )

111
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,712
Gordon:
<i>Donna?</i>

112
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,922
I need to talk to you.

113
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,060
Look, I know
we promise

114
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,979
to discuss any
purchases over $50,

115
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,773
but before you explode,
this was an emergency
situation

116
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,192
and I had
to act fast.

117
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,568
What do you mean,
emergency?

118
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,237
Joe's trying
to box me out of COMDEX

119
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,239
and I don't have to tell
you what a snake he is,

120
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,781
but there was only one
room left on the Strip

121
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,950
and flights to Vegas
were shooting up.

122
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,247
I had to put the $455
charge on our credit card.

123
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,751
I just--
I have to be there.

124
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,296
Whatever
you need to do.

125
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,757
( stammers )
Oh, are-are you sure?

126
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,093
Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,678
Donna,
you're the best.

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,931
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

129
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,515
Oh, I gotta figure out
what suit I need to bring.

130
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,768
<i>Look, I know you think</i>
<i>I look good in blue,</i>

131
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,520
but I don't want
to risk anyone thinking
I'm with IBM, you know?

132
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,943
- Morning, Maylene.
- John...

133
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,695
Now, sweetheart,
you know I can't
talk business

134
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,406
till I get
my "ker-fee" in me.

135
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:35,163
Nathan, well, I didn't
realize you were coming by.

136
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,207
Can I get you
anything?

137
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,667
Cup of joe.
Maylene knows
how you like it.

138
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,086
I'm fine right here.

139
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,097
Wh-- what
brings you by?

140
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,350
A little while back
you asked me for money
for this PC project.

141
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,812
Oh, you told me to shove it,
if I remember correctly.

142
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,982
Thank goodness you did.
I was able to shift
some things around--

143
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,650
I've reconsidered.

144
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,486
I see.

145
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,030
I thought if my
old pal John Bosworth

146
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,698
wants something
from me,

147
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,076
I should
give it to him.

148
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,583
A little early
in the day for a drink,
ain't it, John?

149
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,012
You havin' fun,
Nathan?

150
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,972
Hey, Boz,
we just got a--

151
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,516
Who the hell do you think
you are, waltzing in here
like this?

152
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,768
- What?
- What is your name again?

153
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,147
- Cameron.
- Get the hell
out of my office, Cameron.

154
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,607
Why do you think
I have a damn secretary?

155
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,860
- Don't make me
say it again!
- All right.

156
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,033
My God, John.
You're a bit jumpy
today, aren't you?

157
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,621
If you don't mind,
I got a meeting.

158
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,130
My main concern
is differentiating this
from the other PC compatibles.

159
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,715
<i>Press will want to lump it in</i>
<i>with all the others.</i>

160
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,717
Well, Cameron's
operating system

161
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,260
<i>is unlike</i>
<i>anything else</i>
<i>on the market.</i>

162
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,346
Cameron?

163
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,641
Uh, yeah,
it's interactive.

164
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,977
Um, I can just
show it to you.

165
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,729
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

166
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,358
No, you want this
machine to stand out

167
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,194
from every other machine
on the floor, you gotta stop
talking about the machine

168
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,072
and you gotta start
talking about the people
that made it.

169
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,241
They bled for this.

170
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,909
The future's coming
whether we like it or not,

171
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,703
but it ain't written anywhere
that it includes any of us.

172
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,873
And getting there ain't free.
There's a cost.

173
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,584
People who put up the money,
they like to take the credit,

174
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,670
but the credit belongs
to them that built it.

175
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,511
This machine
is the future.

176
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,681
Make them see that.

177
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,018
( inhales deeply )

178
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,279
John Bosworth,
you're under arrest.

179
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,781
Can we do this
outside?

180
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,950
- We're gonna
do this right here.
- What the hell's going on?

181
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,493
- Sit down, sir.
- Make sure no one
touches these computers.

182
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,828
Everyone, please be calm
and stay where you are.

183
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,956
<i>We're gonna be shutting</i>
<i>this company down.</i>

184
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,624
<i>Once we have</i>
<i>what we need,</i>

185
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,460
<i>you'll be searched</i>
<i>and cleared to leave.</i>

186
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,795
No company property
will be allowed
to leave the premises.

187
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,297
For now,
just sit tight.

188
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,466
We'll have you outta here
as soon as possible.

189
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,176
<i>Step back from</i>
<i>your keyboards, folks.</i>

190
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,304
<i>Stop typing, please.</i>

191
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,649
Man:
<i>Stay where you are.</i>
<i>Heads up.</i>

192
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,293
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

193
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,304
They think
John did it?

194
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,390
Go try that door
over there.

195
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,601
( knocking )

196
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,356
( clicking, banging )

197
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,943
- Ow. Ah--!
- Do you have a key
to this room?

198
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,279
- Yes.
- ( knocking on door )

199
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,784
<i>( knocking continues )</i>

200
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,786
Come on.

201
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,513
Sir, take your personal
belongings and get out.

202
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,266
- But I--
- Now.

203
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,435
Agent:
<i>Get that out of here.</i>

204
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,859
( typewriter keys
clicking )

205
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,529
He's not in.
I'll tell him
you stopped by.

206
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,322
Oh, no, thank you.
That's fine.

207
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,740
I'll just--
I'll catch up
with him later.

208
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,662
Oh, as long as you're here,
I need you to sign
his goodbye card.

209
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,539
Goodbye card?

210
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,917
You didn't hear?
You two seemed so close.

211
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,131
- Was he--
was he transferred?
- Resigned.

212
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,593
Would've been nice
to have a little notice.

213
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,641
Did he say
where he was going?
Is he leaving Dallas?

214
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,809
He didn't say
and I didn't ask.

215
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,689
<i>( clicking resumes )</i>

216
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,858
( voices overlapping )

217
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,823
- Do you know anything?
- Let's go back to your place,
figure it out.

218
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,451
All right,
I'll see you there.

219
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,633
They're looking for evidence
of hacking, computer crime.

220
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,969
Bosworth couldn't do that.
He knows maybe three people
who could.

221
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,888
Are you
a part of this?

222
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,475
Bosworth
came to me, okay?

223
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,935
He asked if I knew
about the 414s,
about hacking.

224
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,062
It was so easy.

225
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,440
They were practically--
like, the bank has no
security whatsoever.

226
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,609
- ( scoffs )
- I'm sorry.

227
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,736
We were gonna
put all the money back
in Cardiff's account

228
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,904
as soon as we
made some sales and we
came back from COMDEX.

229
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,782
I mean, we thought
he'd never notice.

230
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,742
Everybody out.

231
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,452
Gordon:
<i>It's all a misunderstanding.</i>

232
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,120
Joe:
<i>It's not</i>
<i>a misunderstanding.</i>

233
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,955
We'll be laughing
about this in 24 hours.

234
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,999
Gordon,
you're wrong.

235
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,963
- ( sighs )
- What's going on?

236
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,966
- Did you know about this?
- I didn't know anything
about this.

237
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,426
Yes, you did.
You were involved.

238
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,928
- I was not involved.
- Yes, you were.

239
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,389
- You were involved
from the--
- I did it.

240
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,309
I was trying
to save the company.

241
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,436
We were completely
out of money.

242
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,979
You two are perfect
for each other.

243
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,731
- You're both psychotic.
- If I hadn't done this,

244
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,399
we would've been
shut down weeks ago.

245
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,109
All your work
would've been shelved.

246
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,363
Don't act like
you threw a bake sale.
You robbed a bank.

247
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,657
It was
Cardiff's money.

248
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,074
Once we sold
the computer,

249
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,909
we would've made it
back and then some.

250
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,371
You should've come to me.
We could've made a plan.

251
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,414
Now all of our careers
are in jeopardy.

252
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,668
Your careers?
I could be going to jail.

253
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,838
Oh, my God, you two.
I'm so stupid.
God, I'm stupid.

254
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,549
Stop including me in this.
I'm just as upset as you are.

255
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,676
No, you're gonna come out
on top of this somehow.

256
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,554
Every time something terrible
happens, you seem to benefit.

257
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,514
IBM finding out
we reverse engineered
their PC,

258
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,599
Cameron losing her work
on the BIOS.

259
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,727
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

260
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,771
He crashed it
for publicity and
let you twist in the wind.

261
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,816
<i>Did he fail</i>
<i>to mention that to you</i>
<i>during pillow talk?</i>

262
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,026
Is that true?

263
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,529
I'll bet you're the one
that turned Boz in.

264
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,365
- Now you're top dog.
- Joe, answer me.

265
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,536
Yes, I did it.
For publicity, which we got.

266
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,996
I'm sorry you had a bad day
for the sake of our project.

267
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,542
- "A bad day"?
- Are you really in a place
to cast judgment right now?

268
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,627
And why the hell
are you attacking me, Gordon?

269
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,713
-<i> She</i> stole the money!
- I put my life into that box.

270
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,882
- Like I didn't?
- You gave it a name
and a handle.

271
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,633
You didn't build
a damn thing.

272
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,635
He's right.
You only destroy things.

273
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,596
You've never
created anything.

274
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,514
I created both of you.

275
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,604
<i>( garage door whirring )</i>

276
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,528
So, it's over?
Everything?

277
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,072
We're back to--

278
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,866
we're back
to where we started?

279
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,535

280
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,913
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>this is happening again.</i>

281
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,124
Any openings at TI?

00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,252
<i>Donna,</i>
<i>what do I do?</i>

283
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,547
Gordon, I'm sorry.
I-- I just--

284
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,591
I can't deal
with this right now.

285
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,426
<i>Donna...?</i>

286
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,428

I have a meeting.

00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,944
I heard he took the money
to pay off gambling debts.

292
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,695
Horse racing.
He's an addict.

293
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,948
Jail should be
a good place to
work on that.

294
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,866
That's why you don't hire
some ancient good old boy

computer business.

That's just what
I'm calling you about.

306
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,821
I wanted to give you
an opportunity to get in early.

307
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,658
A small order now,
before COMDEX, before
the prices skyrocket.

<i>Ah, I think we're</i>
<i>gonna stick with IBM.</i>

309

<i>Well, not one</i>
<i>they've announced yet.</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Everybody's talking about it.</i>

313
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,298
- Is there a release date?
-<i> I hear early next year.</i>

314
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,425

-<i> Sure. You bet.</i>

Why don't you
go to sleep,
sweetheart?

319
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,454
You look terrible.

320
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,457
No, I want to wait
until Gordon gets home.

321
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,252
- Has he called yet?
- No.

322
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,256
This kinda thing been
happening a lot since--

323
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,383
Since he dug a hole
in our back yard?

324
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,386
Mom, this kind of thing
has been happening since
the day we met.

325

I'm just asking,
sweetheart.

326
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,640
Work okay, at least?

327
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,105
Hunt is leaving TI.

328
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,899
Oh, my goodness.
What happened?

329
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,902
- Did he get fired?
- No, he resigned.

330
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,737
- No notice.
- Well, they love him
over there.

331
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,364
Why on earth
would he do a thing
like that?

332
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,830
Mom, I think
I made a mistake.

333
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,418
When we were
in Lubbock...

334
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,504
Something like this
was bound to happen.

335
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,465
Mom, I didn't
sleep with him.

336
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,342
Then what are we
really talking about
here, honey?

337
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,428
I don't know.
I don't know. I just--

338
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,932
I thought-- I thought
he wasn't interested,

339
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,893
but then he was
here last night,
outside the house.

340
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,437
- And?
- Well, nothing, really.

341
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,272
He got all
flustered and left,

342
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,275
and I think he'd been
out there for a while.

343
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,402
Does Gordon know?

344
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,865
Mom, what am I
gonna do?

345
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,118
Your daddy
and I love you,

346
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,912
and we love Gordon
because you love him,

347
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:26,040
but here you are,
miserable,

348
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,793
continuing to hold up
this entire household

349
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,420
while he's off
God knows where.

350
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,589
We will continue
to support you

351
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,591
and help you
any way we can,

352
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,802
and we'll do so
gladly until we die.

353
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,304
But, Donna, you need
to think long and hard

354
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,850
about why we keep
ending up back here.

355
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,935
And you need
to figure out
what is best

356
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,522
for<i> you</i> and for
your children.

357
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,026
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

358
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,979
<i>( engine starts )</i>

359
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,107
<i>( tires screech )</i>

360
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,618
( sighs )

361
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,297
What are you
doing?

362
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,092
Hey, honey.

363
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,724
Is that
the Giant?

364
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,310
Yeah, and I also got milk.
I noticed that we were out.

365
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,313
Gordon,
did you steal that?
Isn't that evidence?

366
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,985
No, no, no.
If it was evidence,
they would've seized it.

367
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,613
Gordon, this is not good.
I don't know what
you're thinking, but--

368
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,449
Donna, I need you
to stop looking at me
and thinking,

369
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,244
"Here we go again.
It's the Symphonic
all over again."

370
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,370
- 'Cause it's not, okay?
- Gordon--

371
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,041
Look, Donna, it's not.
I promise.

372
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:36,170
Look, this--
this right here,
this is shit.

373
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,755
( bangs )

374
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,339
Okay, you were right
to pull the plug.

375
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,926
You were right
to tell your dad
to stop giving us money.

376
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,720
You knew?
How long did you know--

377
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,430
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I was angry

378
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,058
for a long time,
but I'm not anymore.

379
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,435
You were right.
Okay?

380
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,106
Are you worried about me?
Is that what this is?

381
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,608
Let me do the worrying
this time, okay?

382
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,444
I got this.
I have a plan, all right?

383
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,946
I'm gonna find
Cameron and Joe

384
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,489
and we're gonna
do this together, okay?

385
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,992
I need them.
I can't do this
on my own.

386
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,785
You can't do what
on your own?

387
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,329
Go to COMDEX.
I'm gonna go to COMDEX

388
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,414
and sell the Giant,
just like we'd always
planned.

389
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,749
Damn Nathan Cardiff.

390
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,793
That's crazy.
That's insane.

391
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,505
I love you,
but Cameron is some sort
of wanted criminal now.

392
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,299
- And who knows where--
- I know it's crazy.

393
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,050
I know, but you're
crazy, too.

394
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,845
No, no, you forget that,
but you are.

395
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,847
We were both crazy
and then all of a sudden,

396
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,432
you decided you needed
to be the sane one.

397
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,686
- Yes, because--
- That you needed to take care
of me, but you don't.

398
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,396
Look, be crazy
with me.

399
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,941
I need you to be
behind me, Donna.

400
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,319
I need you
to support me
on this.

401
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,363
I am behind you, Gordon.
You know that I'm here for you.

402
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,825
Thank you.

403
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,204
Listen, the coders think that
Cameron went down to Austin.

404
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,997
If I leave now,
I can make it there
by morning.

405
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,750
Then Joe, then back here
to pack, then COMDEX.

406
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,752
I'm gonna sell
a computer.

407
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,421
My own computer,
just like I always said
I was.

408
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,674
<i>I can promise you</i>
<i>that.</i>

409
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,259
<i>( garage door whirring )</i>

410
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,635

<i>( line rings )</i>

413
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,529

00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,114
<i>Sweetheart,</i>
<i>what's wrong?</i>

415
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,991
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

416
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,748
The girls and I
need to come and stay
with you for a while.

417
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,293
<i>Okay. Have you talked</i>
<i>to Gordon about this?</i>

418
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,464
Can you just come
pick them up first thing
in the morning?

419
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,092
I'm gonna talk to Gordon
when he gets home

420
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,426
and I don't want them
to be here when I do.

421
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,101
( game beeping )

422
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,189
I got next game.

423
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,524
<i>"What Do You Got</i>
<i>Against Love" playing</i>

424
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,943
God, I would've
paid money

425
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,404
to see you break into
Cardiff Electric.

426
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,488
Does Joe know
it's in your garage?

427
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,741
No, I came
to you first.

428
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,327
Look, I know that we've
had less than an ideal
working relationship,

429
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,537
and I'll take some
of the flak on that.

430
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,373
Yeah, and you've been
kind of a dick to me
outside of work, too.

431
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,376
Well, let's
focus on what we do
have in common.

432
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,753
What if we
take the Giant
to COMDEX anyway?

433
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,256
You know? And orders
start coming in?

434
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,507
I mean, Cardiff
won't turn down
that kind of money.

435
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,093
He'll be forced
to reopen the department.

436
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,719
Why do you even care
if I come?

437
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,806
Because you
are responsible
for half the machine.

438
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,392
We're the talent,
not Joe.

439
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,106
No, I'm in
enough trouble
as it is.

440
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:46,193
Okay, okay.
Well, it was
worth a shot.

441
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,862
And I want you to know
that even though that we've
had our differences

442
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,866
and I'm not entirely clear
on what the function of
your special OS is,

443
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,077
I'll try and do it
justice at the demo.

444
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,745
I know what you're doing.
It's not gonna work.

445
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,372
Okay, well, let me
make sure I got it.

446
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,083
It's better than MS-DOS
because it does things

447
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,584
like ask you
how your day is going

448
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,420
and corrects you
if you make
a command wrong.

449
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,422
( snaps fingers )
Oh, wait, no,
I know what I'll say.

450
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:10,508
It's like having
your mother inside
your computer.

451
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,970
How's that?

452
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,514
( thumps )

453
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,892
Come on, Joe.
We know you're in there.

454
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,518
Open up.

455
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,646
<i>( rings doorbell )</i>

456
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,315
He's probably hiding.

457
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:27,109
Well, what should
we do now?

458
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,652
Take this as a sign
we shouldn't be involved.

459
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,446
Wait, wait, come on.

460
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,572
Do you have 30 grand on you?
'Cause I sure as hell don't,

461
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,116
and right about now
the checks for our booth,

462
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,576
our suite, and our trip
have just bounced.

463
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,537
And if we're really
being honest with each other,
he's not a bad talker.

464
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,875
You have a key.

465
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:49,131
Shit, he cleared out.
He's gone.

466
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,468
He's not gone,
this is just
how he lives.

467
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,387
On purpose?

468
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,808
God, I know nothing
about this guy.

469
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,188
Other than
he likes glass.

470
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,940
I'm gonna call Donna.
I don't want her to worry.

Gordon:
<i>I don't remember.</i>
<i>It's been--</i>

00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,108
Cameron:
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>I wanna hear about it.</i>

482
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,611
Honestly,
I don't even remember.

483
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,945
I'll tell you
my first time.

484
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,031
- Okay.
- Okay...

485
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,783
it was, um,
the Apple II.

Oh, God, jeez.
I feel so old.

487
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,787
- I'm good.
- All right.

488
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,625
Uh, my mom's new boyfriend
got it for me for Christmas.

489
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,670
Some pathetic attempt
at winning me over.

490
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,965
But by New Year's
I had disassembled it

491
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,967
and reassembled it
four times.

492
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:43,347
How long did it take you
to disassemble your mom's
new boyfriend?

493
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,432
He hung in there
till Easter.

494
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,393
( both laugh )

495
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,813
You never really
mention your family.

496
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,066
There's not
much to say.

497
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,820
Okay.

498
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,781
Well, it was a few weeks
before Christmas

499
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,993
and I saw the Altair
on the cover of
"Popular Electronics"

500
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,786
and I just
had to get the kit.

501
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,456
But I was in school
and up to my ears
in student loans,

502
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,667
and I'd just spent
my last nickel

503
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,877
on getting
an engagement ring
for Donna,

504
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,422
which cost serious money
I didn't have.

505
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,675
Oh, let me guess.
A big diamond.

506
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:23,512
Me and Donna used to
write each other these
little love notes,

507
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:27,516
but they were encrypted.
We--

508
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,935
we developed our own
polyalphabetic cipher...

509
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,979
( chuckles )
Geeks.

510
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,441
Anyways, I designed
the ring myself

511
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,859
and I incorporated
the cipher into it,

512
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,737
and the only way
to break our code

513
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,655
was with Donna's
engagement ring.

514
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,451
( laughs )
Wait, you proposed
to your wife

515
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,826
with a decoder ring?

516
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,995
- I know.
- Gordon, wow.

517
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,749
I was 23, you know?

518
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,377
Anyways, she likes puzzles,
and it was nice, you know?

519
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,755
It was platinum
with sapphires and stuff.

520
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,758
Anyways, I was gonna give it
to her over the holidays.

521
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,009
Well, Christmas Day comes

522
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,805
and I go to get the ring
and it's gone.

523
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,599
You shoulda seen me.

524
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:11,893
I mean, I tore that apartment
upside down looking for it.

525
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,104
And Donna comes in
with my present

526
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,897
and she's
yelling at me

527
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,401
to stop ransacking
the apartment and open it.

528
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,195
And there it was,
the Altair computer kit.

529
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,115
And I knew she hadn't borrowed
the money from her parents

530
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,034
because she hadn't even
told them about me yet.

531
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,413
Would you believe

532
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,873
that she found
the engagement ring

533
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,752
and pawned it
to get me the Altair?

534
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,713
- Aw.
- And she said to me,

535
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,133
"You can buy me a ring
once we've sold our first PC."

536
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,720
Yeah.

537
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,931
It's hard to imagine
you and Donna ever
being my age.

538
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,851
I got it for her.

539
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,894
What,
the decoder ring?

540
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,730
Yeah, last week.

541
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:00,275
I knew we were
gonna nail it at COMDEX
and sell the Giant.

542
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,235
So I had the same
jeweler in Berkeley

543
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,071
make one up and send it
out to the office.

544
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,116
It's hidden
in my garage right now.

545
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:11,077
I'm gonna give it to her
when I get back next week.

546
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,540
Wow.

547
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,795
I hope we sell
the Giant.

548
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,297
We will.

549
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,553
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

550
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,682
Jesus.

551
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,020
What are you
doing here?

552
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,816
I'm not gonna stay.
I just came to ask
you a question.

553
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:43,318
You came all the way
to New York to ask me
a question?

554
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,820
It's easier to tell
when you're lying

555
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,321
when I'm looking
right at you.

556
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:52,870
- Let's have it.
- Is IBM developing
a portable PC?

557
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,996
We are.

558
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,249
So you could crush
my machine?

559
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,209
Crush<i> me?</i>

560
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,670
I had nothing to do with it.
The team's down in Boca.

561
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,296
For once, can you
tell me the truth?

562
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,964
It may come
as a shock to you, Joe,

563
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,342
but you're not
the center of the universe.

564
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,011
Even if I knew you were
making a portable,

565
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,513
you think I could
alter the course

566
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,140
of the aircraft carrier
that is IBM,

567
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,184
make them build one
just so I could hurt you?

568
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,687
You're out
of your mind.

569
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,188
If it makes you
feel better,

570
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,357
we're at least a year
away from market.

571
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,615
Now, if you wanted
to ask me about computers,
you could've called me,

572
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,033
so why don't you have
a seat and let me know
why you're really here?

573
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,870
- I got what I came for.
- Sit down!

574
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:47,382
Now... let's
start again.

575
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,096
You've been in Dallas
since April.

576
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,643
Where were you
before that?

577
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,774
After you deigned
to tell me the truth,

578
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,777
I drove across the country
to figure out...

579
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,905
am I her son
or your son?

580
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,161
Even if she was dead,
she must've lived

581
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,747
an entire life
after you sent her away.

582
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,376
Places she'd been,
people who knew her.

583
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,086
I talked
to everyone I could,

584
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,923
trying to find
the part of her
that was me.

585
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:31,176
Oh, Joe.

586
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,137
Do I remind you
of her?

587
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,682
Is that
why you hate me?

588
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,686
I love you.

589
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,357
And I loved
your mother.

590
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,943
You let me think
she abandoned me

591
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,778
and then told me
she was dead

592
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,071
23 years
before she was.

593
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,365
I'm not going
over this again.

594
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,201
I sent her away because
she almost killed you.

595
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,538
And, yes, yes,
I lied to protect you.

596
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,456
She let you<i> fall, </i>
for heaven's sake!

597
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,166
At least she
took me up there.

598
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,002
Because she was high.

599
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,462
She wanted me
to be a dreamer.

600
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,048
Your mother
wasn't a dreamer.

601
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,468
She was lost.

602
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,972
A real dreamer,
someone that matters,

603
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:19,975
makes something
out of nothing.

604
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:25,271
And that only happens
with hard work.

605
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,109
You understand that.

606
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,195
You always have.

607
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,199
You're more like me
in that regard,

608
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,744
and thank God.

609
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,921
Now, if you move back,
I'll find a place for you.

610
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:52,007
You'll be back
on track soon enough.

611
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,759
At IBM?

612
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,013
People have
short memories.

613
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,098
Not me.

614
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,980
<i>Joe, you and I</i>
<i>both know</i>

615
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,776
you have to come back
down to earth eventually.

616
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,320
You're here now.

617
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,783
The hard part's over.

618
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:25,082
I need to be the primary
on the portable.

619
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,792
Run the whole thing.

620
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,466
That's what you want,
I'll figure it out.

621
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,892
I'm glad
you're back, son.

622
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,818
<i>( door lock clicks )</i>

623
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,699
What are you
doing here?

624
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,785
We came to look
for you last night.

625
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,497
Did you sleep
in my bed?

626
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,332
Yeah, you know,
you should really
get a couch.

627
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,834
You know,
me and Donna have--

628
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,794
Stop, I just came here
to get my things.

629
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,296
You're leaving?

630
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,049
I'm going back to IBM

631
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,802
to build a portable PC
that will actually see
the light of day.

632
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,220
- Are you kidding me?
- It's what I should've
done from the start.

633
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,557
You go back to IBM,
you go back on everything
you stand for.

634
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,309
That'll be<i> you </i>
failing us.

635
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,021
- I just told you I was wrong.
- ( Gordon laughs )

636
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:32,065
I finally get it.
I finally get how
you operate.

637
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,317
- Great, get out
of my apartment.
- Gordon:<i> No, no.</i>

638
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,402
Throughout this whole thing,
you needed to be in control,
make every decision.

639
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,571
You have everybody
at the company bow
to your will.

640
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,825
But when you're finally faced
with a real opportunity

641
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,494
to be a visionary
and lead in a battle
that's worth fighting for,

642
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,245
you're just
gonna move on.

643
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,581
You know, you can spin
a good word, Joe,

644
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,916
even though you're
not an engineer

645
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,501
and you are certainly
no visionary,

646
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,211
but I never thought
you were a coward.

647
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,630
And you never know
when to shut your mouth!

648
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,758
Gotcha.

649
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,802
Bring that fire
to COMDEX and we'll kill.

650
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,847
- COMDEX?
- Think about it.

651
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:07,225
How many companies
had their CEO hauled off
in handcuffs last week?

652
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,602
There's over a thousand
exhibitors there.

653
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,564
It's nearly impossible
to stand out in all
that noise,

654
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,901
but people will be lining up
to see the train wreck
that is Cardiff Electric,

655
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,071
and when they do,
we blow them away.

656
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,035
But we don't have
the Giant.

657
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:28,121
I stole it, took it.
I got it back.

658
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,873
You--

659
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,376
you stole it?

660
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,879
You're crazy.

661
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,463
You're damn right.

662
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,008
Eight months ago,
I was a miserable
sales engineer

663
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,634
whose favorite
part of the day
was clocking out.

664
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,137
Yesterday, I broke into
a crime scene

665
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,974
to steal
the state-of-the-art computer
that<i> I</i> helped create.

666
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:51,269
Cameron, the brilliant
programmer, months away
from a college degree

667
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,147
<i>and a promising</i>
<i>career in software,</i>
<i>she dropped out,</i>

668
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,942
<i>ended up hacking</i>
<i>into the computers</i>
<i>of a national bank.</i>

669
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,319
John Bosworth,
Texas good ol' boy,

670
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,322
president of the
"I Hate Joe MacMillan"
fan club.

671
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,952
John Bosworth hatched a plan
to embezzle thousands
and thousands of dollars

672
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,161
just to keep
this project alive.

673
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,496
You-- you made us
all crazy,

674
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,833
so don't act like you
suddenly found sanity.

675
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,045
We have the Giant.
It is ready to go.

676
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:20,673
The only thing
we need is money.

677
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,634
I'm sorry?

678
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,471
We-- we-- we need--
you know...

679
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,141
we need
your money, Joe.

680
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:33,311
This is all I have.

681
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,980
What?

682
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,316
These clothes, that car,
that's all I have.

683
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,444
I'm sorry, Gordon.

684
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,363
I guess someone was
buying my act after all.

685
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,201
How much
is the car worth?

686
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,423
- Such a beautiful car.
- Let it go.

687
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,970
Look, I'm telling you, Donna,
I'm on a roll.

688
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,055
They're both on board.

689
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,224
I got Joe
to sell his Porsche

690
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,476
so now we've got
enough money for COMDEX.

691
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,189
What's this?

692
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,033
I'm going with you.

693
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,535
You are?

694
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,288
Oh, Donna.
What about the girls?

695
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,208
They're at my parents'.
I guess I am crazy.

696
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,261
Good news--
Donna's coming.

697
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,097
Wonderful.
The more the merrier.

698
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,391
We've gotta make
one last stop before we go.

699
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,896
( raps )

700
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,275
Get inside.

701
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,785
Pretty stupid idea
you coming.

702
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,123
Barry's
your lawyer?

703
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,417
No.

704
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,254
No.

705
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,048
Barry does paperwork,
but he's my friend.

706
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,093
Put up my bail before
I even thought to ask.

707
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,764
They're never
gonna believe
you did this alone.

708
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,642
You don't have
the technical knowledge.

709
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,229
Did you know
that damn bank

710
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:42,107
was using a DEC-20
running TOPS

711
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,150
for their dial-in
account management
timesharing system?

712
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,861
I kid you not.
Turns out, if you
do it quick enough,

713
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,696
before the exception
handlers are invoked,

714
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,823
you can control-C
out of the user program

715
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,159
and then you're
left sitting with
a terminal session

716
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,161
on an account which has
some pretty interesting
privileges,

717
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,123
including
running Kermit.

718
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,624
( chuckles )

719
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,751
Oh, I had
a good teacher.

720
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,214
Now, why'd you come?

721
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:09,592
- We're going to COMDEX.
- ( chuckles )

722
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,429
No kidding.
How did you manage that?

723
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,681
It's kind of
a rogue operation.

724
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,892
Well, that's just
as it should be.

725
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,523
I'll be all right.

726
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,567
Oh, come on, now.

727
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,244
Go to COMDEX.

728
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,537
Knock 'em dead.

729
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,790
Do that for me.

730
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,212
Get the hell
outta here.

731
