Over 500K.

111
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,627
Why does backgammon
have to be half a meg?

112
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,588
It's a square
with some circles
and some triangles.

- Color is good.

"Parallax" crashes
all the time.

119
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,566
Because you installed
a big-ass version
of backgammon.

120
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,860
Okay, look,
backgammon cannot be
the only reason

121
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,571
that we're having problems,
but until we figure it out,

122
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,491
Yo-Yo, just recode it

I think we should
unplug the cabinets.

127

Figure out
a better power solution.

128
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,515
Maybe rewiring everything
more carefully will help
with the lag.

the network offline?

a lot of fun to do--

166
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,283
But personal computing
is only the latest chapter
in Cardiff's history.

167
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,118
In fact, you yourself
were instrumental

168
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,412
in the change
to the business model,
weren't you?

169
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,206
Uh, yes.
Yes, I was--

170
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,335
But now Cardiff
is closing up shop?

171
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,463
Uh, well,
not closing exactly.

172
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,924
I guess we didn't expect
so much success so quickly.

173
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,260
We've been acquired
by a large overseas company.

174
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,387
Chip:
<i>But you will stay on</i>
<i>as president, then?</i>

175
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,514
( whispers )
Hi, could you just--
could you tell him...

176
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,059
Actually, I think
it's time for me to move on.

177
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,145
( whispers )
I need to go
to the power company.

178
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,981
- I need to leave.
- Oh, so, sayonara,
9:00 to 5:00, huh?

179
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,442
Uh, I've given
serious thought

180
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,902
to starting my own
investment firm...

181
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,821
out of my garage.

182
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,074
Interesting.
Why the garage?

183
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,953
Because, Chip,
uh, good ideas

184
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,621
don't come out
of a boardroom, do they?

185
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,081
-<i> ( Chip laughs ) Very good. </i>
- That was good.

186
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,416
- Gotta go.
-<i> Well, Gordon, again,</i>

187
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,502
<i>thanks so much</i>
<i>for being with us.</i>

188
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,462
We've got a lot more
to talk about in the world
of business,

189
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,464
and we'll do that
when we come back
right after this.

190
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,049
Thanks.
Thank you.

191
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,092
- Thanks, Gordon. Good job.
-<i> ( bell rings )</i>

192
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,136
Man:
<i>Okay, we're back in two, guys.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

193
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,898
( panting )

194
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,201
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

195
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,747
Hello?

196
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,875
All right.

197
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,504
Yeah.

198
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,508
Yeah, that's good news.

199
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,719
Thank you.

200
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,853
Ah.

201
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,776
- Who was that?
- My attorney.
The sale went through.

202
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:13,654
- Really?
- They're giving me my share.

203
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,576
- ( laughs )
- That's fantastic, Joe.

204
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,620
I gotta go up
and pick it up tomorrow.

205
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,414
This is good.

206
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,638
You earned this.
You deserve it.

207
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,890
Don't doubt that
for a second.

208
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,813
Just-- just going
back there,

209
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,189
seeing those people...

210
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,817
I know.

211
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,944
You want me
to cancel tonight?

212
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,695
We don't have to have
all these people over.

213
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,823
- No, no.
- We can just
talk it through.

214
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,201
It's a good
distraction, yeah?

215
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,455
( exhales )
10 miles.

216
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,583
- I can tell.
( laughs )
-<i> Okay.</i>

217
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,968
Okay, so I am male.

218
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,596
Uh, I am
in entertainment.

219
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,432
Um, a singer
sometimes, right?

220
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,435
- I'm dead.
- Well, allegedly
you're dead.

221
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,937
Oh, allegedly.
Okay.

222
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,023
Damn it.

223
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,941
Um, okay, let me think.

224
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,237
I am-- oh, oh,
what's his name?

225
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,865
- From "Taxi,"
Andy Kaufman?
- Man:<i> Ah.</i>

226
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,326
- ( cheering )
- Finally!

227
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,828
I was Andy Kaufman.

228
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,582
And I was Big Bird,
so I guess we make
quite the couple.

229
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,584
- ( laughing )
- Evan told me
on the way over here

230
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,085
that you two met
at a planetarium?

231
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,752
You tell it.

232
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,674
All right, well,
um-- well, we knew
each other in school.

233
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,384
We were just friends,
though.

234
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,677
We met in
a rhetoric course.

235
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,220
We argued all the time.

236
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,390
Well, 'cause you were
wrong most of the time.

237
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,185
I mean,
we kind of lost touch
after school.

238
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,480
And as you guys know,
last year was a rough
year for me.

239
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:57,110
Anyway, this assignment
came through from
"Texas Monthly"

240
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,280
to go profile
Fiske Observatory,
to live up there for a while,

241
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,533
and getting out of town
seemed like a good thing
to me at that point,

242
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:08,580
so I did, and I started
writing about their
SETI program.

243
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,831
Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence.

244
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,584
- Group: Oh...
- Yep, yep.

245
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:17,130
And so there I was,
searching the skies,
waiting for contact.

246
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:21,008
- And Joe...
- Woman:<i> Then Joe</i>
<i>walked through the door.</i>

247
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,219
( laughing )

248
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,804
- What do you do, Joe?
- I worked at IBM
for a long time

249
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,933
and then I was
in personal computers
here in Texas.

250
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,728
- And then I got out of it.
- How come?

251
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,230
I needed
to reevaluate.

252
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,651
At the time,
I thought I was unhappy
with the project,

253
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,488
but in hindsight
I realized I was just
unhappy with myself.

254
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,827
So I guess that's
what I've been working on.

255
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,581
Well, Joe is being
very modest.

256
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,333
What he didn't tell you

257
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,628
is he took this
tiny regional company

258
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,589
and turned it into
a national competitor
for PCs almost overnight.

259
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,049
- Wow.
- He's driving up
to Dallas tomorrow

260
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,218
to collect his share
of the company sale.

261
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,680
- But that's not
the whole story.
- No, it-- it's not.

262
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,307
But the outcome
is the same.

263
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,227
So what are you gonna do
with all that dough?

264
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,229
I'm going to start
my own company.

265
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,649
Man:
<i>That's great. Here?</i>

266
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,527
No, in California.

267
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,069
- In Silicon Valley.
- Woman:<i> What?</i>

268
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,321
Oh, you're moving?

269
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,782
Nothing is written
in stone.

270
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,659
But we're
really excited.

271
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,745
My point is,
the past is past,

272
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,498
but tomorrow
is tomorrow.

273
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,340
- This is ridiculous.
- I wonder how often
the power goes out at Atari.

274
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,675
<i>( electric buzz )</i>

275
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,553
- Oh, finally.
- ( scattered cheers )

276
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,057
Okay, what is that?

277
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:55,395
Uh, Cameron fixed
our power problem.

278
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,689
Yeah, we just ran
extension cords

279
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,440
to the outdoor
sockets next door.

280
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,031
Okay, please
tell me that you asked
the Andersons' permission

281
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,533
to siphon off their meter.

282
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,702
Donna, the Andersons
are loaded.

283
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,454
Think of it
as trickle-down
electricity.

284
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,291
This is a bigger problem
than you might think.

285
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,919
Dallas Power &amp; Light
knows that we overrode
our circuit breaker.

286
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,880
City Planning is probably
on its way with a notice

287
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,757
saying that the house
isn't zoned for commercial use.

288
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,550
We're facing
all kinds of fines,

289
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,343
so it would be really great
if we stop breaking more laws

290
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,969
on top of the ones
we've already broken.

291
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,847
Donna, power is power

292
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,473
and we can handle
the fines, okay?

293
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,308
The only real issue
is the lag

294
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,853
and we can fix that
with more network
equipment and PCs.

295
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,146
I'll call my guy tonight
and see if he has any more
XTs in the warehouse.

296
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,482
- Problem solved.
- Okay, that's a patch,
not a fix.

297
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,318
Yes, which is what we need
to hold us over until we can
fix it for real.

298
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,280
Power company
on line one.

299
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,450
Do you want me?

300
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,993
( sighs )

301

303
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,836
Shoot, Eddie Murphy
should've won for
"Beverly Hills Cop."

304
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,464
I don't know
who that Salieri is.

305
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,883
That's the whole point.

306
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,885
He's not Mozart.

307
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,888
- Two Shiners.
- Walker Red, rocks.

308
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,015
- Put it on his tab.
- Yeah, we're unemployed.

309
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,605
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Stan.

310
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,398
Don't worry
about those guys.

311
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,400
They're not
actually unemployed.

312
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:28,028
Larry's interviewing at Tandy
and Ed's likely going to EDS.

313
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,031
He's probably just pissed
'cause he'll be at a place
called "Ed's,"

314
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,617
but he won't own it.

315
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,786
Get it? Ed's?

316
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,914
Yeah, no,
I got it, Stan.

317
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,125
But you have to understand
that we weren't intentionally
trying to damage it--

318
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,544
Hey, they just got
"Dig Dug II" at the arcade.

319
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,088
- Research trip.
- Look, I know that we use
a lot, but-- yes, I'll hold.

320
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,549
( overlapping voices )
Amazing! Hey, guys, wait up.

321
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,217
-<i> Ready to do it? </i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>

322
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,970
- Donna?
-<i> Shotgun!</i>

323
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,305
- Do you want
to go with them?
- What? No.

324
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,641
No, I have to take care
of this anyway.

325
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,559
If you want to go,
you don't have to wait
for them to ask.

326
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,561
You can just go.

327
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,814
Oh, yeah?
Then who's gonna deal
with the power company?

328
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,608
I don't know.
Let them send a bill.
It'll take care of itself.

329
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,736
That's great.
That's a really amazing
system you've discovered.

330
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,615
- Do you have a problem?
- Yeah, Cameron, I do.

331
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,701
You made this a place
without a boss,

332
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,911
and that sounds really nice,
but what that translates into

333
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,538
is a bunch of crap
falling through the cracks

334
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,373
that I end up
having to deal with.

335
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,833
God, well,
if you're so good
at dealing with it,

336
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,167
then why don't you just
keep being the savior

337
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,669
we all supposedly
need so much?

338
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,296
Because I don't want
to be the mom here.

339
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,007
Look, I do that at home.

340
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,217
I came here
to do what I love,

341
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,511
- and I don't love dealing
with the power company.
- Donna.

342
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,430
And I don't love
managing the checkbook
to make sure we don't overdraw

343
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,182
and I don't love playing
wet nurse to a bunch of coders

344
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,893
who act more like
kindergarteners--

345
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,354
Then don't do those things!
Nobody asked you to!

346
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,399
- Jesus.
- Damn it.

347
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,236
I did everything I could
to keep things going,
but Nathan--

348
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,697
Nathan wanted to sell.

349
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,908
You know, I fought
for everyone's jobs,
I really did.

350
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,701
You don't have
to apologize

351
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,286
- for making out like
a bandit in the sale.
- Oh, God.

352
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,539
Man, I'd have done
the same thing if I
were in your shoes.

353
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:06,002
Before you took over,
I was updating systems
software packages.

354
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:11,173
After you, we built
two machines in two years
from the ground up.

355
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,384
The Pro was just a Giant
with a bag on the side of it.

356
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,763
The Pro was amazing.
Giant was amazing.

357
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,974
I would never have gotten
the opportunity to do any of it
if it weren't for you.

358
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,102
Gosh, you remember
that one night

359
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,311
when you couldn't
find the music?

360
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,439
- What?
- Remember?

361
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,983
We were three weeks deep
on debugging the Pro.

362
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,152
It was maybe 4:00 AM.
We're in the kill room.

363
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,321
You couldn't focus
because you were convinced

364
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,617
somebody was cranking
"Dream Weaver" in
the parking lot.

365
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,159
- So you go out
to check--
- What?

366
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,954
yeah, you go outside,
you check,

367
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,372
you come back in,
you take a ceiling tile out,

368
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,625
and you climb up
into the ceiling.

369
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,920
Remember?
Come on, it was amazing.

370
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,546
Yeah.

371
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,799
Yeah, I...

372
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,342
sort of.

373
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,595
When was this?

374
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,847
I mean,
I think it was you.

375
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,599
Jesus, we were all
so coked out of our minds

376
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,767
trying to hit
those deadlines.

377
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,143
Who knows?

378
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,067
You know, Donna,
I'm feeling really good
about it.

379
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,570
I mean, this really is
the best way that this chapter
could've ended.

380
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,155
- Can I have--
- Here, cream, two sugars.

381
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,657
- Oh, thank you.
- Now I got time.

382
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,951
And time is such a valuable,
precious resource.

383
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,995
- And now I got
boatloads of it, you know?
- Yeah, that's great.

384
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,704
I can start this
investment thing and--

385
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,456
- Oh, my keys?
- Couch.

386
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,249
- Try the cushion
by the lamp.
- Thank you.

387
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,543
But you know what
I'm gonna spend it on
first is our kids.

388
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,253
And I know I've been
saying that for a long time,

389
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,213
but this time
I really mean it.

390
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,549
I mean, did you know
that Joanie can sing all
the lyrics to "Hey, Jude"?

391
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,384
I mean, I'm sorry,
isn't that incredible?

392
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,345
- Wait, where are the girls?
- It's absolutely phenom--

393
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,264
- they're dressed
and in the car.
- Oh, good.

394
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,433
- Oh, my God.
- What?

395
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,060
The closing--
Gordon, it's today.

396
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,728
- I completely forgot.
- It's okay, it's okay.

397
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,106
Look, I'm just gonna go in.
I'm gonna sign my name.

398
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,275
- It's not a big deal.
- And collect an incredible
amount of money.

399
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,194
You really did it.
You worked so hard.

400
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,072
- I'm really proud of you.
- Yeah.

401
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,828

timed out 15 minutes ago

Well, I've seen users
do it longer.

They're paying
five bucks an hour

about what they're doing
over spring break?

a mistake to burn a truck

into the woods.

You know, honestly,

432
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,395

Although that wasn't
much fun either.

435
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,534

437
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,747
The new owners didn't even
want the machines,

438
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,209
they just wanted the patents
so they could build
something better.

439
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,796

wasn't that bad.

440

Oh, it's his last day
at Cardiff.

496
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,280
( laughs )
Oh. Wow.

497
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,075
Love to see a wrecking ball
swing through that place.

498
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,870
Oh, here we go.

499
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,915
How do you know
this guy again?

500
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,626
You know, he plays "Parallax,"
sells secondhand equipment.

501
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,463
Fine, he's a fence.

502
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,554
<i>Mamacitas.</i>

503
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,930
The gear is here.

504
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,562
Do you mind if I...?

505
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,816
You said XTs,
I got XTs.

506
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,360
Yeah.

507
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,488
What's with
Mrs. Garrett?

508
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,199
- Excuse me?
- She's cool.

509
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,911
They're both
pretty banged up.

510
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,997
I mean, this one
doesn't have either
of its video cards.

511
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,626
- Yeah,
but we have more, right?
- They're not hard to find.

512
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,794
I'm just saying
that the price should
come down a little.

513
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,004
This is retail,
not wholesale.

514
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,132
Oh, well, technically
they're stolen.

515
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,801
Donna, what is
wrong with you?

516
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,595
You want the XTs or not?

517
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,179
Do you mind
if I plug these in?

518
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,890
- I brought a power inverter.
- Yeah, I do mind.

519
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,686
Yeah, okay,
we'll take them.

520
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,187
Three grand.

521
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,441
( laughs )
Aw, 500.

522
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,988
These things list
for 7,500 each.

523
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,449
Yeah, we're not
paying list.

524
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,242
That's pretty ballsy,

525
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,287
the two of you
out here alone.

526
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,250
Yeah.

527
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,085
Okay.

528
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,300
Here you go.

529
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,940
You ladies look me up
post-Armageddon.

530
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,779
Especially you,
Mrs. Garrett.

531
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,161
<i>( car engine starts )</i>

532
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,788

533
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,541
- Well, it sounds
functional.
- Whoa!

534
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,461
- What the hell?
- Hang on. Flashlight.

535
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,344
It's a counterfeit.

536
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,137
Can we still use them?

537
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,139
Can you code in Chinese?

538
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,142
He ripped us off.

539
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,186
( shouts )

540
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,188
Mm-hmm.

541
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,648
Okay.

542
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,360
Mommy isn't coming,
is she?

543
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,363
No, Mommy's got
to work late again.

544
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:52,786
Hey, we could still
go celebrate.

545
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,163
Y'all wanna go get
some ice cream
for dinner?

546
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,832
- ( giggles )
- Y'all wanna go to Braum's?

547
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,667
- Both: Yeah!
- Whatever you want?

548
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,878
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah, all right!
Let's go.

549
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,004
We'll get
some vanilla ice cream,

550
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,382
- hot fudge,
and bananas.
- Yes!

551
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,928
Daddy,
are we rich now?

552
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,682
I'm not quite sure
how to answer that question,
sweetheart.

553
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,768
Well,
are we millionaires?

554
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:19,605
Mm, with some
smart investments

555
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,147
in the next
four or five years,

556
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,316
yeah, we certainly
could be.

557
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,445
- Can we buy an elephant?
- Maybe.

558
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,449
- I mean, theoretically.
- So, can we?

559
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,703
Well, you never wanna
get just one elephant.

560
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:38,373
Elephants are sensitive
creatures and if you
just get one,

561
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,709
then it'll get lonely.

562
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,545
You got to get
at least two elephants.

563
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:47,674
And, frankly,
sweetheart,

564
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:51,762
I don't think
we have the room.

565
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:56,600
If we're rich now,
then why does Mommy
have to work so late?

566
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,019
You know what?
That's a good question.

567
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,940
Daddy, your nose.

568
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,109
- Daddy!
- Hmm?

569
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,987
Oh. Oh, my God.
I'm okay.

570
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,323
I'm okay, girls.
I'll be right back.

571
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,660
( chatter )

572
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,703
Jesus, I remember
the first time I met you,

573
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:21,792
just a perfect Dillard's
catalogue businesswoman

574
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,418
with big judging eyes.

575
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,462
Oh, I wasn't judging.

576
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,173
I'm just used to
looking at Gordon.

577
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,633
( both laugh )

578
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,887
Oh, where is this asshole?

579
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,349
- You're just
as intimidating.
- No.

580
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,727
You know you are.
You pride yourself on it.

581
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,271
You remember when
we launched the network?

582
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,607
It took
four days straight
to get it live.

583
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,693
It was like raising a barn.

584
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,404
And "Parallax" wouldn't
boot from the menu.

585
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,700
You know, halfway through,
a bunch of us thought it was
never gonna happen.

586
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,452
We were done.
Mutiny was over
before it even started.

587
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,913
But not you.
You didn't give up.

588
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,876
Yeah, well,
it was intense.

589
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,802
So...

590
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:18,056
you think I should
be the boss.

591
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,599
I think someone should be.

592
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,101
Look, I know
we're doing fine,

593
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,814
but this point right now
is when most companies
like us go under.

594
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,816
We're plateauing.

595
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:32,612
We need to grow in a big way
or we're not gonna make it.

596
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,656
Okay, well,
we can't let that happen.

597
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,200
We're in dire need
of some major essentials.

598
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,953
We need more users.
Our subscriptions
have topped out.

599
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:44,290
We need another game.
We haven't put anything
out in, what, six months.

600
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,585
Yes, I know, Donna,
but I need to wait
for the right idea.

601
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,503
And we need
to expand the network

602
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:53,508
because buying stolen XTs
isn't gonna cut it anymore.

603
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,677
You're right.

604
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,055
You're-- yes,
you're totally right.

605
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,058
But here's the thing.
I--

606
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,143
I'm not interested
in being in charge.

607
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,438
I want to work,
I want to do my thing.

608
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:10,734
I'm not interested
in product managing.

609
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,277
Well, I'm not either.

610
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,571
( groans )

611
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,990
Look, I've been
watching people chat
on the network

612
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,535
while they're playing,
sometimes even after
for hours on end,

613
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,370
and I think there's
a real opportunity

614
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,582
for a community to exist
outside the games.

615
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:30,587
So if you just help me
with the managerial side,

616
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,006
then I can
play around with that

617
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,760
and still keep my hands
in the guts of the network
and I'm a happy camper.

00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,172
Did everything
go okay?

669
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,257
At dinner last night...

670
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,594
do you believe those things
you said about me?

671
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,638
Of course I do.

672
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,267
Yes, I left
some details out.

673
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:15,603
I didn't say
that you hurt
a lot of people

674
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:19,649
or that you lied your way
through the door,

675
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,819
but you made that company
what it is today.

676
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,864
I didn't get the money.

677
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,202
They shut me out.

678
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:38,751
Well, we don't
need the money.

679
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,464
Marry me.

680
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,051
What?

681
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,599
- Why?
- Because I love you.

682
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,854
Or because I was
the first person
to forgive you?

683
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,481
I get that you're scared.

684
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,193
You've been down
this road before.

685
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:07,155
( laughs, grunts )

686
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,077
Marry me.

687
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,747
Yes.
