Gordon, X to you.
Atari 2600 games.

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,774
Has to start with
the last letter of
the previous answer.

7
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:27,068
Uh, "Xenophobe."

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,529
Whoa!

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,532
Wait, wait, there's seriously
a game called "Xenophobe"?

10
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,535
Yeah, but you're just being
intolerant to aliens,
so it's cool.

11
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,329
All right, guys,
any updates on the bug

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,080
we've been having with
the swap confirmations?

13
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,457
Overhauled
and working great.

14
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,376
That's it, ChernobylBoy
is going to the stocks.

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,920
- Happy Fourth of July,
asswipe.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,382
Some fifth grader reneged
on a swap for a "Close
Encounters" lunch pail.

17
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,885
We're revoking
trading privileges
for repeat offenders.

18
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:55,096
It's all internal for now,
but we're working on putting
this into here.

19
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,640
Show him the guillotine.

20
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,022
( laughs )

21
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,398
But are you dead
in Mutiny?

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,774
I mean, are we cancelling
people's subscriptions?

23
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,902
You just wander around
without a head

24
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,278
and that lets people know
this guy without a head
is a total dick.

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,740
Don't swap with
this headless dickwad.

26
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,282
( laughs )

27
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,036
Can we get some
blood spurting out
of the neck hole?

28
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,372
- God, how did we
not think of that?
- Put that in, dude! Yes.

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,751
All right, we got to solve
for the Sev 1 cache miss bug

30
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,168
in the out-of-region
swap routine?

31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,420
Tests today,
ships tomorrow.

32
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,756
-<i> You sure?</i>
- Gordo, relax.

33
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,216
SwapMeet's righteous.
The only thing
that's sideways

34
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,428
is people keep ignoring
the no buying stuff rule.

35
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,221
A lot of people
are trading for DBs.

36
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,223
- DBs?
- Dollar bills.

37
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:43,228
We could technically
monitor every trade to make
sure it doesn't happen.

38
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,147
I can't help you there.
That's way above my pay grade.

39
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,900
( laughs )

40
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,156
So people are buying
shit for money.

41
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,034
So what?
We knew this would happen.

42
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,411
It's clunky.
Our users want an easy
way to buy things

43
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,455
and they're frustrated
it doesn't exist.

44
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,248
Our users want the Police
to get back together,

45
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,666
but Sting's
not interested.

46
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,376
Doug and Craig said
they can spend the weekend

47
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,004
integrating their code
for credit card transactions.

48
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,173
- No.
- They were already in beta with
it when we acquired them.

49
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,550
It's basically
ready to go.

50
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,594
Because they yanked it
off the shelf.

51
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,679
It's boilerplate code
supplied by the credit
card company.

52
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,347
They just gave it
a little shine job.

53
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,433
We don't need
the perfect solution.

54
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,351
If we have to temp
something in now

55
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,479
and customize it
later, fine.

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,815
A Band-Aid is better
than bleeding to death.

57
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,650
Bleeding to death?

58
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,611
Donna, SwapMeet
has doubled in size

59
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,195
every week since
we went live.

60
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,572
You're just scared
of slowing down.

61
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,616
I don't want
to slow our growth.

62
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,202
And you keep acting like
accepting credit cards

63
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,413
is some devil's bargain.

64
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,207
They make
people's lives easier.
That's the whole point.

65
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,461
Okay, Mutiny is a castle.

66
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,673
You and I built it
and then we gave a little
piece to Diane.

67
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,383
And then a little piece
to freakin' Doug and Craig.

68
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,138
But making deals with
credit card companies is
just lowering the drawbridge.

69
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:03,058
What good is a castle
if nobody's in the kingdom?

70
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,227
It doubles in size
every week, okay?

71
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,063
There is a fix for this,
I promise.

72
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,815
I just-- I don't know
what it is yet.

73
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,859
- Hey, Cam,
are you down there?
- Yeah, Bos.

74
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,528
Cam, I'm gonna pick you up
tomorrow at 6:00 A.M.
sharp, all right?

75
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,238
We got to get
to the terminal
a little bit early.

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,034
They always give me shit
about the rods in my tailbone.

77
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,910
Okay.

78
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,292
When we moved
here, we knew
that there'd be times

79
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,879
that we'd have
to adapt quickly.
This is one of those times.

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,132
Donna, we're all
alone, okay?

81
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,258
There's no other company
that's even attempting

82
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,094
to do what SwapMeet
is doing.

83
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,722
I don't want to rush in
and just screw it up
all at once.

84
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,557
Can we talk about it
when I get back Monday?

85
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,767
- We're not gonna
screw anything--
- Monday.

86
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,984
Have a nice trip.

87
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,777
Stanford's over here
right next to Moffett.

88
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,322
Over here
is jackboot central.
DoD, NORAD, the NSA.

89
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,742
And I printed out all
the directories for every
mainframe on the network.

90
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,452
And we can leverage
some of the weak access
points I found.

91
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,955
Now, the Pentagon
is nearly impenetrable,

92
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,289
but some
of these other guys--

93
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,209
Utah is a total sieve.

94
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,585
What is this right here?

95
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,503
That's not really
part of ARPANET.

96
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,131
That's just the new network
the National Science Foundation
just rolled out.

97
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,800
Yeah, NSFNET.
Steve Wolff's baby.

98
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,219
I went in through
Cornell's node.

99
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,180
It's only been live
for a couple days.

100
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,391
Could you--
could you not do that?

101
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,518
NSFNET's
transmission lines

102
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,604
are 10 times faster
than ARPANET theoretically.

103
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,564
- Uh-huh.
- But it keeps crashing.

104
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,525
- I've been bumped off six
times in less than an hour.
- What else?

105
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,987
Seriously, Joe,
it's just a bunch
of tenure-track slapdicks.

106
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,990
They can't even get their
basic infrastructure right.

107
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,534
They got grants
for the national network,

108
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,703
threw a bunch of cash
at the local level,

109
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,956
and left the regional networks
in the middle hanging.

110
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:53,168
- So?
- So there's a huge
bottleneck baked in.

111
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,170
There's no room
for increased demand.

112
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,215
- So like ARPANET--
- Commercial use is banned.

113
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:01,342
There could be
something here.

114
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,803
It's a lemon.

115
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,806
I've been working on it
for six weeks, I know.

116
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,432
Well, you know.

117
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,602
You've been working
on it for six weeks.

118
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,273
General Atomics left
a hole in our balance
sheet $3 million deep.

119
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,358
We're hemorrhaging money.
ARPANET will be
mothballed soon.

120
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,194
And NSFNET is the future.

121
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,321
That's the story
you just told me.

122
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,574
No, Joe.
Listen--

123
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,577
Just dig deeper
on this.

124
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,370
Indulge me.

125
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,372

128
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,807

- Now.

129
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,019

I'm just so excited
to see this little monkey,

133
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,066
I whizzed right past
Sonny Bryan's.

134
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,151
Hey, when do babies
start talking?

135
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,695
Um, three or four months?

136
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,448
His first words are gonna be
barbecue if I got anything
to say about it.

137
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,368
Oh, hey, check this out.

138
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,411
Remember that stewardess,
the one with the legs?

139
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,457
She gave me that for Sam.

140
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,044
Every time I'd go on a trip
when James was young,

141
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,046
I'd get one of these,
pin it to his teddy bear

142
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,048
first thing in the morning
so he'd know I was home.

143
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,051
That's really sweet, Bos.

144
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,719
So what's the plan?
You gonna ship the bike

145
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,637
or are you gonna ride off
into the sunset,

146
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,099
catch bugs in your teeth
on the way back to the Bay?

147
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,309
You know, I don't even
know if it runs.

148
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,895
I'm kind of playing
this all by ear.

149
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,646
Well, they know
you're back, don't they?

150
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,481
No.

151
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,278
I'm not gonna give
my mom time to work up
some stupid speech.

152
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,571
You'll be glad
you did this.

153
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,534
You're doing
all right, Cam.

154
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,795
I am so sorry.
I thought Linda

She was supposed
to pick up the kids

156
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,800
For her,
this is first thing.

157
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,761

Oh, I am not

Hey, look at this.

162
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,898
Remember that bar
we went to

163
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,691
in Independence on our way
to Onion Valley?

164
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,028
The bartender got us
so drunk, we had to sleep
in the car.

165
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,364
Oh, yeah.

00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,788
I forgot.

168
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,707
But we can go
stop by Orchard Supply
on the way out.

169
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,795
Orchard Supply is not
open on the Fourth.

170
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,466
You know, and this stupid
thing is useless.

171
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,550
Hey, I don't mind sleeping
out under the stars.

172
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,637
Yeah, that's what
the rattlesnakes
want you to do.

174
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,808
You know, what's the point
of even going?

175
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,935
You know,
nothing's working.

176
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,812
Well, the kids are gone

177
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,649
and we haven't
had one night alone
since we got to California.

178
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,363
We could always, you know,
have a vacation at home.

179
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,073
You know what?

180
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,492
We're staying here.

181
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,952
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

182
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,079
I'm gonna defrost
the porterhouses.

183
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,747
You can pull out
that lacy thing

184
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,582
with the straps
that I got you
for Easter.

185
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,337
I am changing
into sweatpants.

186
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,382
Or sweatpants.

187
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,591
Look at this.
We got the same hair.
You see?

188
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,760
- You want to hold him?
- Cameron:<i> No, no, no, Bos.</i>

189
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,514
- No, my taxi's coming.
- Hold the baby.

190
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,598
Hold the baby,
Cameron.

191
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,184

<i>you to stay, Cameron?</i>

193
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,980
I see the crib got
here in one piece.

194
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,524
Uh, yeah, in a lot
of pieces, actually.

195
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,442

this weekend.

these for you?

Your baby's really cool.

00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,503
I got to get going, too.

205
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,422
I can't believe
they're making you
work on the Fourth.

206
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,131
Yeah, well,
mouths to feed.
Work's work.

207
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,050
Oh, I know
that kind of work.

208
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,803
- I'll be back soon.
Just got to kiss the ring.
- All right.

209
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,557
Do you want
to talk to Grampy?
Come talk to Grampy.

It's, uh--
it's the Fourth of July.

212
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,554
Right.
I mean, you didn't say
I had the day off, so...

213
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,806
Ryan, it's
the Fourth of July.

214
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,892
So, do you want
me to leave?

215
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,317
No.

216
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,652
No, come on in.

218
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,633
Sure.

No.

240
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,004
Exactly.

241
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,799

God, she can be

243
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,097
And, you know, you wouldn't
think somebody so punk

244
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,183
would be so conservative
when it comes to business.

245
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:51,104
Yeah, I was really just
talking about the modem.

You know,
the kids love her.

Of course, I guess
that's a mixed bag.

00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,322
I mean, she makes
you better, right?

251
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:05,826
You know what?
I really don't want
to talk about work.

252
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,328
I wasn't talking

259

And then we acquired
this company, which was insane

260
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,568
because our payroll
doubled, like, overnight.

261
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,112

you have to do

Uh, but, yeah, so the thing
that we acquired,

I know about SwapMeet.

266

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

if you wanted to hear from me.

to get your call.
- Yeah.

just to see you.

you get this

00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,519
<i>These things the most </i>

338
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,356
<i>I see all my dreams</i>
<i>come tumbling down </i>

339
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,358
<i>I can't be happy </i>

340
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,819
<i>Without you around... </i>

341
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,863
I love you.

342
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,115
I love you, too.

343
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,410
<i>There's only one</i>
<i>thing I can say </i>

344
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,412
<i>You didn't stand by me </i>

345
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,956
<i>No, not at all,</i>
<i>did you stand by me... </i>

346
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,877
True fact-- a banana peel
will shine your shoes
like no other.

347
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,380
Saved me a mint
in my 20s.

348
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,131
Yeah, I think I've read
that somewhere.

349
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,927
Oh, you did, huh?
Oh, there he is.

350
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,302
Hey.

351
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,764
<i>( car door closes )</i>

352
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,976
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

353
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,144
I got a little--

354
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,146
got ribs
and hoecake for you.

355
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,148
Um, yeah.

356
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,317
And, oh, there's some--

357
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,154
you know, there's some
fireworks going on out there
that are pretty incredible.

358
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,365
Shh, shh.

359
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,534
Lisa:
<i>He's in the nursery.</i>

360
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,579
Your dad built the crib.
He's been a huge help.

361
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,664
Even went out
for some diapers.

362
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:47,835
No, no, no.
I was gonna build
that crib.

363
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,170
Sam will be up
in a couple hours.

364
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,881
I'm going to bed.

365
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,343
Well, I think
we could all use
some sleep.

366
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,555
Yeah. Yeah, okay,
Mr. Family Man.

367
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:03,183
Nobody's blaming you
for being gone, James.

368
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,186
Well, maybe I should
have brought home some
pilot wings, huh?

369
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,647
Maybe that would
make up for it.

370
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,607
You loved those
when you were a kid.

371
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,651
Hell, you had
a whole box of them.

372
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,487
Yeah, I had a whole box
of them because Mom
was a stewardess.

373
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,407
I just tossed the ones
you gave me on top.

374
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,078
You can rewrite
history to impress
your 15-year-old boss,

375
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,830
but you don't fool me.

376
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,510
Hey, what's that place
we used to go eat at

377
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,386
down in the South Bay?

378
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,597
Oh, Los Gatos Cafe.

379
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,684
- Yeah.
- Those eggs Benedict.

380
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,688
I'm taking you there
tomorrow for brunch.

381
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,316
One last hurrah before
the crazies return.

382
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,194
Well, we definitely
worked up an appetite.

383
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,447
God, twice in one day.

384
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,449
We should do that
more often.

385
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,036
Twice in one week
is above average.

386
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,038
We have not had sex

387
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,414
twice in one day
since Gerald Ford
was in the office.

388
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,917
- No, that's not true.
- It's totally true.

389
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,253
Pre-kid.
Do the math.
Carry the one.

390
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,506
Ford.

391
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,551
Oh, my God.
We really needed this.

392
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,262
I'm so glad
we didn't go camping.

393
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,890
- Really?
- Yeah.

394
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,266
I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

395
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,978
Yeah?

396
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,271
I mean,
we're not as young
as we used to be.

397
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,273
Yeah.

398
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,275
But, you know,
even then

399
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,570
popping a squat
behind a tree

400
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,280
and your back kills
when you wake up.

401
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,201
No, thank you.

402
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,953
Yeah, but...

403
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,873
you loved
all those times
at Mt. Tam.

404
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,290
Eh.

405
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,333
What?

406
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,294
Yosemite was
freaking awesome.

407
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,214
You know what it is?

408
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,342
It's like that saying
about what crazy is.

409
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,344
That you do the same thing
a ton of times

410
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,681
and you're like,
"This always sucks."

411
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,767
That's insanity.

412
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,939
It's doing the same thing
over and over and expecting
a different result.

413
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,026
Yeah. Yes.
Camping is insanity.

414
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,278
( laughs )

415
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:24,324
Oh, God.
I am exhausted.

416
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,620
( yawns )

417
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,428

425
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,406
You know how hard it is to get
a halfway decent breakfast
burrito in the Bay Area?

426
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,575
It's a fool's errand.
Thank you.

427
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,703
It's funny.
It's not where I pictured
you growing up.

428
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,496
I didn't.

429
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,915
No?

430
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,959
Oh, that hombre's back.

431
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,460
He brought cash with him.

432
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,509
You gonna do
what you came here
for or what?

433
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,345
Shh, don't.

434
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,722
Cameron, I know
the first 2,000 miles
are easy

435
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,308
and the last 20 feet
are hard,

436
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,436
but you've come all this way
and now here we are.

437
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,686
Okay.

438
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,730
You owe this
to yourself.

439
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,523
And to them.

440
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,324
Come--

441
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,117
he's buying
your dad's bike,
Cameron.

442
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,828
Fine. Just stop
talking, okay?

443
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,413
That's yours.
Go get it.
Go get it.

444
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,623
Stop it!
What the hell
are you doing?

445
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,375
People don't make
mistakes because they
don't love you, Cameron.

446
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,043
They make mistakes
because they do.

447
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,379
Oh, that is such
a crock of shit
even from you.

448
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,256
You want me to pick up
the slack for you again?

449
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,342
Great, why should today
be any different, huh?

450
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,385
Would you stop?

451
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,262
Cameron, you didn't
come here just for the bike.

452
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,555
- Come on, now.
- Jesus Christ!

453
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,477
Listen, you might
think you're my father,
but you're not, okay?

454
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,228
I know that,
God damn it.

455
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,022
No, no, I don't
think you do.

456
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,483

Oh, wow.

00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,651
Oh, hey.
Thought I'd get
a jump-start on the day.

461
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,279
Great.

462
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,865
So Los Gatos Cafe?

463
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,659
I'm really jonesing
for that eggs Benedict.

464
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,537
Yeah.

465
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:05,458
I don't know.
The kids will
be home soon.

466
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,000
Rain check?

467
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,671
Everything all right?

468
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,048
Yeah.

469
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,883
Everything's fantastic.

470
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,684
I'm gonna go
work on the ham
if it's all the same.

471
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,686
Oh.

472
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,316
You know, get some
good ham time in.

473
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,067
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

474
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,653
There's some leftover
pizza in the fridge
if you want some.

475
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,688
( knocks )

476
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,709
( phone rings )

477
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,640
( knocks )
Any word from
the boss man?

478
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,058
She even coming in?
It's already noon.

479
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,018
We're ready
to move ahead.
Just say the word.

480
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,645
I have to talk
to her first.

481
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,355
There's a petition up
right now on Community.

482
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,939
It's called 1986 BC.

483
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,858
It demands we let users
pay with actual money.

484
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,776
Hundreds of people
have already signed.

485
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,987
- It was posted
two hours ago.
- Okay, guys.

486
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,947
One user just emailed me
thanking Mutiny
for reviving

487
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,825
the "efficiency
and modernity of
the barter system."

488
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,286

<i>He signed it Methuselah.</i>

489
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,081
Donna:
<i>Just wait, okay?</i>

490
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,791
My answer is the same
as it was an hour ago.

491
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,752
Take a knee
or whatever.

492
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,806
( knocks )

493
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,684
How was Texas?

494
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,810
Still big.
How was camp?

495
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,063
- Didn't go.
- Peaches.

496
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,024
Was the plane delayed?

497
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,027
Got into San Jo'
8:00 A.M. right on time.

498
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,863
I just needed a morning,
so I took it.

499
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,616
Okay.

500
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,825
Look, I don't know
where she is, Donna.

501
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,494
<i>She didn't even get</i>
<i>on the damn plane.</i>

502
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,246
You left her
in Texas?

503
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,914
I'm not
her keeper, Donna.

504
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,874
And you have no idea
where she is?

505
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,044
Kid was at a Motel 6
on I-30.

506
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,838
Beyond that, like I said,

507
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,840
it's one big-ass state.

Hey, stupid Gordon,
your stupid turn.

<i>R to you.</i>

516
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,444

517
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,362
Gordo's in a mood.

518
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,867
Hey, Donna.

519
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,329
The guy at the Motel 6
said she checked out.

520
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,751
How long will it take?

521
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,295
We can start beta tests
internally today.

522
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,672
Be live in under a week.

523
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,465
Okay, then do it.

524
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:42,882
And Cameron's okay
with that?

525
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,844
Cameron's not here.
She'll catch up.

526
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,100
Ryan:<i> Joe, check this out.</i>
<i>Something weird going on</i>

<i>Found some code fragments</i>

00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,191
Hey, Joe?

530
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,900
Yeah.

531
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,320
You okay?

532
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,490
Okay, I don't know exactly
what we're looking at here,

533
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,326
but the slapdicks
have given way to
the big swinging variety

534
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,911
and they're working
on something together

535
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,789
called NYSERNET.

536
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:14,914
That's interesting.

537
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,125
Interesting, yeah,

538
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,086
but it doesn't do much
to fill the money hole
you're so worried about.

539
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,673
God, you're doing
great work here.

540
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,635
( phone rings )

541
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,972
Hello?

542
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,350
- Woman:<i> May I speak</i>
<i>with Joe MacMillan?</i>
- This is he.

543
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,520
<i>Mr. MacMillan,</i>
<i>I'm calling from</i>
<i>the San Francisco City Clinic.</i>

544
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,938
<i>Is this a good time</i>
<i>to discuss your recent visit?</i>

545
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,608
Hold on one second.

546
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,151
We're done for the day.

547
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,372
I'm ready.

548
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,543
<i>Mr. MacMillan,</i>
<i>I have the results</i>
<i>of your HIV antibody test.</i>

549
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,420
<i>Since you were</i>
<i>in contact...</i>

550
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,505
<i>( "New Misery" playing )</i>

551
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,059

<i>( "Ammunition" playing</i>

553
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,204
- ( phone rings )
- Hello.

554
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,332
New user sign-ups
saw a welcome spike

555
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,041
after we integrated
SwapMeet,

556
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,336
but we're fielding
too many complaints

557
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:28,298
about the lack
of support for our
monetary transactions.

558
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,218
So tonight we will go live
with the credit card code

559
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,972
that Doug and Craig
have been testing all week.

560
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,061
Man:
<i>Look who it is.</i>

561
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,982
It's Cameron.
Cameron's back.

562
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,237
Donna:
<i>When users purchase</i>
<i>something,</i>

563
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,241
<i>we charge them</i>
<i>for the item and we add</i>
<i>a small transaction fee.</i>

564
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,037
Mail checks to sellers
for the sales price--

565
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,251
What's this?

566
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,380
Well, first of all,
welcome back.

567
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,717
I think I speak
for all of us when I say
I'm glad you're okay.

568
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,802
I've been working.

569
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,929
We've all been working.

570
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,390
Cameron:
<i>I can see that.</i>

571
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:23,979
I have a solve
for transactions.

572
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:26,940
We've been in beta
on a credit card interface
all week.

573
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,984
Doug and Craig's code?

574
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:30,318
Yeah, it works great.

575
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,363
Okay, so you just went ahead
and did that without me.

576
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,741
Could you all excuse us?

577
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,450
<i>Cameron and I need</i>
<i>the room, please.</i>

578
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,172
Hey, so let me see
if I've got this.

579
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,426
So let's say
I want to buy a,

580
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:58,722
I don't know,
first Superman comic
for $100.

581
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,976
Mutiny charges my AmEx,
adds five bucks.

582
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,519
As a transaction fee.

583
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,146
But AmEx takes
three of those dollars
as their transaction fee,

584
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,648
so Mutiny is only making
two bucks.

585
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,401
Meanwhile, I'm really
pissed because yesterday

586
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,195
I could have shelled out
100 DBs for that Superman

587
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,782
and today I'm shelling
out an extra five bucks
for nothing.

588
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,618
It's not nothing.
We're providing
a valuable service.

589
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,913
Oh, spoken like
a true middleman.

590
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,124
Okay, so what's
your solution?

591
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,586
Routing numbers.

592
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,421
It's how banks
move money.

593
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:36,635
And our subscribers pay
by checks, so their account
numbers are already on file.

594
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,345
Okay, you sell me Superman.

595
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,681
Mutiny pulls funds
directly from my bank

596
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,475
and deposits them
into your account

597
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,894
using our own
ABA routing number
as a pipeline.

598
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,898
Oh, and it's basically free
because we don't incur
a transaction fee

599
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,651
and we don't charge one
either because our expenses
haven't skyrocketed.

600
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,279
But then with your way,
we'd need, what,

601
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,616
three people handling
credit card transactions,

602
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,452
a few people to handle
check writing and mailing,

603
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,454
probably an accountant
or two.

604
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,582
So that's, what,
12 new hires?

605
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,208
Yeah, that's about right.

606
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,920
Okay, my way adds
one person.

607
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,505
One.

608
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,215
I can't believe you.

609
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,592
<i>Right back at you.</i>

610
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,886
We agreed to discuss this
when I got back.

611
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,221
We agreed to discuss
this on Monday.

612
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,223
It's Friday.
Where have you been?

613
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,392
Who cares?
I'm here now.

614
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,479
Since when do you make
decisions for my company
without consulting me?

615
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,398
God damn it,
I tried to consult you
and I couldn't find you.

616
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,652
Oh, my God,
this is exactly what
I've been worried about.

617
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,905
- What?
- Every new person that walks
through that door,

618
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:42,283
another piece of Mutiny
gets cut away from me.

619
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:46,538
No, no, no, Donna.
Mutiny isn't just my job,
it's who I am.

620
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,247
It's who I am, too.

621
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,875
I couldn't sleep all week.

622
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,461
I could ignore the mountain
of complaints in my in-box,

623
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,921
but I care too much.

624
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,549
I came up with
a better solution.

625
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,510
Just because you think
you need to sprinkle
your fairy dust

626
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:04,430
over everything around here
before you feel satisfied
doesn't mean it's better.

627
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,308
No, it is better.

628
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,061
Oh, God.

629
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:12,271
Okay, but that's
not the point.

630
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,482
We were in real trouble.

631
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,276
And when I'm in trouble
and I look around,

632
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,654
I need to find you there.

633
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:24,576
We need to have
each other's backs.

634
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:29,288
Sometimes I need
to crawl into a hole
just find my head.

635
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,918
<i>I know you're patient with me</i>
<i>even when I drag my feet.</i>

636
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,295
I know I should find
my own place to live

637
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,631
and stop imposing
on you guys.

638
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,510
And I know that--

639
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,889
that dinner with Doug
and Craig that I missed

640
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,724
that you probably didn't
think we should fire them,

641
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,310
<i>but you went to bat for me</i>
<i>anyways with Diane.</i>

642
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,271
<i>I know that.</i>

643
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,070
I was with Tom, okay?
That's where I was.

644
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,866
Yeah, I was wondering.

645
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,287
Still, you should
have called.

646
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:15,334
He said that you're
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

647
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,962
And it's true.

648
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,757
<i>And not 'cause he said it</i>
<i>or anything, just--</i>

649
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,304
you anchor me.

650
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,986
So I guess
we're like a bank now.

651
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,238
That's pretty
cool, huh?

652
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,950
( chuckles )
It's a routing number.

653
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,327
We're not giving away
free toasters or anything.

654
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,208
I do have
your back, Donna.

655
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,629
I have a weird way
of showing it,

656
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,923
but I swear I do.

657
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,719
I have yours.

658
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,470
This and only this
is what we focus on.

659
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:54,267
Okay, yeah, time-out.
This is super cool to me,
but only NSFNET?

660
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,312
The yarn you just pulled,
those are the deep pockets.

661
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,730
Exactly.

662
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,523
It's virgin territory.

663
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,026
Wolff created
a bottleneck, right?

664
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,070
Yeah, no support
for regional networks.
The guy is insane.

665
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,739
The guy is brilliant.
He's sending a signal.

666
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,326
He's like our Gorbachev.

667
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,078
Do you know
what Glasnost is?

668
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,289
I want to say either
a vodka or a satellite.

669
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,333
Wolff knows
that the only way
his network will grow

670
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,501
is if private money
gets in the game.

671
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,172
The problem is
that's against the law
for now.

672
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:27,133
- But...
- But maybe one day
it won't be.

673
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,719
And when the rules change,
people are going to flood in.

674
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,722
Average people at home
on their Apple IIe and Amiga

675
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,557
and it's gonna overload
the system.

676
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,892
So who breaks
the bottleneck?

677
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,728
We are going to create

678
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,523
a regional network
right there.

679
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,651
The past--
the past is a bunch
of fortresses

680
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,071
all closed off
from the rest
of the world.

681
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,407
We don't have to build
a faster computer

682
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,742
or dream up the next
killer application.

683
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,661
That's what you do
in a fortress.

684
00:40:55,703 --> 00:41:00,666
We are going to pave
a road between them.

685
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,002
And you're going
to ask the board to go
deeper in the hole

686
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,587
on something that may
never turn a dime?

687
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,381
I don't care what
the board thinks anymore.

688
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,507
Money is just
a side effect.

689
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,968
Glasnost.

690
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,137
It means openness.

691
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,473
And it's always a bad idea
to bet against openness.

692
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,144
- Are you hungry?
- I don't know, Joe.

693
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,603
You don't know
if you're hungry?

694
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,147
I don't even know
what to think anymore.

695
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,815
I try to decipher
your sayings,

696
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,525
but then the phone
rings and you boot me
to another zip code.

697
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,445
And we still
haven't figured out
how to make any money

698
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,323
and I go home every day
and I'm spinning

699
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,117
and I don't even know
if you like me.

700
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,660
I feel crazy.

701
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,705
You're not going
crazy, Ryan.

702
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,540
You're hungry.

703
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,460
Look, I've had
a tough week.

704
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,670
Will you join me
for dinner?

705
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,050
Okay.

706
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,761
Okay, I'll come
to dinner with you.

707
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,513
Sounds nice.

708
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,808
Just take a good look.

709
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,187
That's what's next.

710
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,033
<i>( phone rings )</i>

711
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,784
Diane Gould.

712
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,577
<i>Diane, hi.</i>
<i>It's Cameron Howe.</i>

713
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,746
Cameron.
What's going on?

714
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,416
I had a talk with Donna
earlier today

715
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,377
and I wanted to call

716
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:29,672
and say I know I've been
a little eccentric lately.

717
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,884
Someone once told me
that eccentric

718
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,303
is just a fancy word
for asshole.

719
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,596
<i>I'm a little eccentric</i>
<i>myself.</i>

720
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,808
<i>And you have to be</i>
<i>if you want to make it</i>
<i>as a woman in this business.</i>

721
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,061
This routing number thing
is really great.

722
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:47,232
Yeah, okay, I also
just wanted to call

723
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,235
and say thanks for,
you know,

724
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:54,239
seeing that Mutiny Exchange
wasn't something we could do
on our own

725
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,616
and that it was smart
to buy SwapMeet.

726
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,036
And, yes, I don't love
Doug and Craig,

727
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:04,416
but I really totally respect
your decision to keep them
at the company.

728
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,917
Like I told Donna,

729
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,669
I'd have paid
for them to go away.
Cost of doing business.

730
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,630
<i>But it shows strength</i>
<i>that you decided</i>
<i>to make it work.</i>

731
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,926
<i>Look,</i>
<i>this call is appreciated,</i>
<i>but it's unnecessary.</i>

732
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,513
<i>It's your company.</i>
<i>You don't have to apologize</i>
<i>for any decision.</i>

733
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,890
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>you decide.</i>

734
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,518
<i>Cameron?</i>

735
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,895
Uh, yeah.
Okay, thanks, Diane.

736
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,398
I've got to go.
Bye.

737
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,495
<i>( door opens )</i>

738
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,039
<i>( indistinct chatter )</i>

739
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,584
( breathing heavily )

740
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,503
Donna:
<i>I'm gonna go check</i>
<i>on the kids real quick.</i>

741
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,701
<i>( music playing )</i>
