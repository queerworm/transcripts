1
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,186
You need any help?

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,271
I got it.

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,403
Well... I'll
just dry, then.

4
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,156
It's okay.

5
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,586
<i>( TV playing )</i>

6
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,725
( sighs )

7
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,945
- Donna. Donna!
- Nope.

8
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,280
I am done
feeling bad about this.

9
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,616
It's been a week.
You've made your point.

10
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:18,286
You're sleeping
in the bed with me tonight.

11
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,872
Get in there.

12
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,958
I'm still
very mad at you.

13
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,628
( chuckles )

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,800
- I am!
- ( sighs )

15
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,219
Gordon, can we
go to bed now?

16
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,479
( thumps )

17
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,816
( rattles )

18
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,823
Wow. Sheesh,
what happened here?

19
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,618
I don't know.
Maybe it fell?

20
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,536
Across the room?

21
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,330
Maybe it was
ringing too much.

22
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,542
- How about there?
-<i> Catastrophic failure.</i>

23
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,339
You're gonna need
wire strippers.

24
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,174
Looks like it,
don't it?

25
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,386
I'd better run out
to my truck.

26
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,263
Here.

27
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,977
Use mine.

28
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,562
You know, phone company's
always hiring.

29
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,397
( chuckles )

30
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,733
Okay, so just leave them
on the desk when you're done.

31
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:42,037
( sighs )

32
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,959
This computer y'all built,
what's it say on the outside?

33
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,710
I think we get
your point.

34
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,964
What does it say?

35
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,299
Cardiff Electric.

36
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,884
It says
Cardiff Electric.

37
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,222
Whose name is that?

38
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,642
I closed ComputerLand
at 100,000 units.

39
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,644
<i>We'll be in stores</i>
<i>March 1.</i>

40
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,480
You're looking at
a projected net profit
of over $40 million.

41
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,691
I'm 65 years old.

42
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,401
Why would I
want $40 million

43
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,989
when I can settle
for five and just
kick back, Jack?

44
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,033
<i>My phone's</i>
<i>been ringing, too,</i>

45
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,535
people wanting to buy
this company outright.

46
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:26,165
They've been offering me
a lot of change to close
her down.

47
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,961
Joe:
This office...

48
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,172
what does it say
outside?

49
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,924
The sign in the lobby,
what does it say?

50
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,676
You be careful, boy.

51
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,095
It says Cardiff Electric.
Whose name is that?

52
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,390
Not just yours.
Your father's, right?

53
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,060
Started in 1934,

54
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,937
shortwave radios
manufactured out of Longview.

55
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,899
I heard he ran
the factory floor himself.

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,734
I'm not talking
about money.

57
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,028
I'm talking
about legacy.

58
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,114
The company shifts entirely
into personal computing.

59
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,949
Overhead shrinks,
profits grow.

60
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,284
You let me run this,
Cardiff Electric
becomes nimble

61
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,662
and ready
for the 21st century.

62
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,790
( sighs )

63
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,714
You both run it.

64
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,507
As equals...

65
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:24,014
because you are
a rattlesnake,

66
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,517
and you-- you're
a little bunny rabbit,

67
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,978
but you're the brains
behind this thing.

68
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,563
Fine.

69
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,485
Eight percent
of the company,

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,487
fully diluted,

71
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,865
four-year vesting,
cliff at one year
for each of us.

72
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,826
( laughing,
thumps )

73
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,913
You know,
I should just bury you
in a shallow grave.

74
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,040
I should get somebody else
in here to run this company.

75
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,127
Hell, I should
save a few bucks
and just run it myself.

76
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,045
Good luck with that.

77
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,839
You gonna manufacture locally
or in Taiwan to save some coin?

78
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,801
Japan has better output
facilities, but the tariffs
are tricky.

79
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,096
You might be able to do
a deal with Intel in bulk
if you know who to talk to,

80
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:07,390
but it's the same guy
who manages IBM's bulk deal,
so it'll take some massaging.

81
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,018
Go 286 in the near future
and switch to AMD.

82
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,439
- Bypass Intel.
- Especially since AMD parts
almost always clock faster.

83
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,817
Megahertz,
minimum bucks.

84
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,945
But I don't know.
What do you think, Nathan?

85
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,034
- Eight percent.
- Each.

86
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,662
Split.

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,455
We can
live with that.

88
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,167
We'll see,
won't we?

89
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,467

All right, this is
the first test shipment
from the manufacturer.

96
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:48,325
We got 100 machines here,
so I need all hands on deck
QA-ing these boxes.

97
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:52,453
Hardware, software,
failed pixels, I/O ports...

98
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,250
- Pinch tension.
- Pinch tension, internal
temp, fit and finish.

99
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,294
Check every millimeter
of this machine.

100
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,671
The Giant ships out
in less than six weeks.

101
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,840
It must be perfect!

Oh, Gordon,
I don't know how
to test a computer.

105
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,937
No, this is for you.

106
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,855
I figured you
put up with me
and Joe long enough,

107
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,399
You deserve one.

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,692
Oh, thank you.

109
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,444
Have you seen Joe?

110
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,364
- He's in Bosworth's office.
- Okay. Thanks.

112
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,919
I wondered
how long it'd take

113
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,545
till you took
the corner office.

114
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,047
- I just needed the TV.

Our first test shipment

116

I got everybody
going over it with
a fine-tooth comb.

117
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,637
Did you miss
the Bowl yesterday?

118
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,599
- I taped it on VHS.
- Well, the Redskins
still lose, so...

<i>( crew chattering )</i>

122
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,370
- Joe...
- Tell me
that wasn't amazing.

123
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,122
Tell me that wasn't
the best piece of marketing

124
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,915
you've ever seen
in this industry.

125
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,168
Yeah, it was neat.
The girl that looked
like Cameron

126
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,836
threw the sledgehammer
through the screen

127
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,754
and freed the weird
slave people.

128
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,632
They're telling
the world that they're
going to topple IBM.

129
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,968
Okay, well, I also didn't
see a computer anywhere
in sight.

130
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,594
My guess is,
knowing those guys,

131
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,596
the Macintosh is all
bells and whistles

132
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,598
and zero utility.
You want a toy, you buy
one of those.

133
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,642
You want a computer,
you buy one of ours.

134
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,853
People will buy the Giant,
but will they remember it?

135
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,980
If we delay shipping
just a few months--

136
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,773
Absolutely not.
We need to QA,

137
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,859
give manufacturing
the full green light,
and ship.

138
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,736
- Don't you want it to be great?
- Joe, we keep futzing
with this thing,

139
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,905
- it's gonna end up vaporware.
- What about a graphical
user interface?

140
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,200
- We could do a GUI--
- Joe, be realistic.

141
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,452
You think Cameron's OS
slowed things down?

142
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,704
We don't even have hardware
that's capable of doing--

143
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,039
A killer app, then.

144
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,458
We design a phenomenal
piece of software,

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,877
bundle it with
the machine as a suite.

146
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,712
Gordon, what's
our "Lotus 1-2-3"?

147
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,756
Our "Lotus 1-2-3"?
It's "Lotus 1-2-3."

148
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,468
We built an IBM
compatible machine.

149
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,137
You wanted a computer.
You have a computer.

150
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,641
You need to sell
your computer, okay?

151
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,940
She really did
look like Cameron.

152
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:30,862
<i>( VCR whirring )</i>

153
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,156
And again, this is
strictly to get a sense

154
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,824
of the department
I'm inheriting.

155
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,494
Please answer
each of the questions
with one of the following,

156
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,579
"Leading the way,"
"Moving ahead,"
"Right on track,"

157
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,956
"Falling behind,"
or "Off track."

158
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,543
How would you rate
the quality of your
work overall?

159
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,878
"Falling behind."

160
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,590
Care to clarify?

161
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,010
Honestly, I've
been very distracted
since Hunt left--

162
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,888
I'm sorry,
Mr. Whitmarsh--

163
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,892
and for a while there,
I was really caught up in--

164
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,769
I wouldn't
call it an affair.

165
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,606
An emotional
affair, maybe.

166
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,942
But then he left
to start a company
based on ideas

167
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,652
he stole
from my husband, so...

168
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,034
How would you rate
the timeliness of your work?

169
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,954
- Off track.
- And why's that?

170
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,707
I went to Vegas in November
for three days and I didn't
tell anybody.

171
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,626
Okay.

172
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,379
How do you feel
about your future
at Texas Instruments?

173
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:33,258
Do you think--
could you just write "N/A"?

174
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,220
Because, honestly,
I don't see one.

175
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,603
I suppose we could
give you two weeks.

176
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,482
Actually,
I would really prefer
if today were my last day.

177
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,741
Can I take you
to lunch, ma'am?

178
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,247
- I got fired.
- Congratulations.

179
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,837
I financed it.
They were practically
giving them away.

180
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,132
- What do you think?
- I think it's about
the gaudiest exorbitance

181
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,967
- I've ever seen.
- Mm.

182
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,137
And everyone's gonna be
looking at us when we
drive in it.

183
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,015
Mm.
Let 'em.

184
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,809
<i>( phone line beeping )</i>

185
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,146
<i>( modem beeping,</i>
<i>chirping )</i>

186
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,156
( laughing )

187
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,868
<i>( line ringing )</i>

188
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,078
Graphics compression
program is amazing.

189
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,080
So is phase modulation.

190
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,666
We're stable
at 2400 baud.

191
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,834
How's my firmware
holding up?

192
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,294
Modem's solid.

193
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,838
Hey, you authorized to access
any of this stuff?

194
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,799
Are you kidding?
If the suit found out,
he'd shit a brick.

195
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,135
Lev:
<i>You know how many connections</i>
<i>we can carry on the 3B5?</i>

196
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,054
We can play "Zork"
on this.

197
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,682
We can make our own "Zork,"
"Wizard, Warrior, Rogue."

198
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,226
God, everything is
"Dungeons and Dragons"
with you guys.

199
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,769
- You have to admit,
this is pretty cool.
- Yeah, I know.

200
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,605
Show your boss.
People would flip
if they could

201
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,315
move data this fast
across the phone network.

202
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,903
Well, then we don't get
to be the phone company
anymore.

203
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,114
- We're probably not even
talking about a patch.
- What?

204
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,076
- What is it?
- Found a sev-one problem
with the Giant.

205
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,663
Manufacturing or design?
'Cause if it's manufacturing,
I can make a call.

206
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,707
- Honestly, we don't know yet.
- What do you mean you
don't know yet?

207
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,250
We can repro it
and we're trying
to pin it down.

208
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,502
It's causing the machine
to turn off spontaneously.

209
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,004
- All the test machines?
- No, just Debbie's.

210
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,632
What did you do to it?
Did you drop it?
Did you spill something on it?

211
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,175
- Did you lend it to your
boyfriend or something?
- No, none of that.

212
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,802
- Debbie, what did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

213
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,723
These are delicate machines.
You can't just throw them
in the trunk of your car.

214
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,807
- Gordon, I'm sorry.
- You've gotta be careful
with them.

215
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,227
None of the hardware
appears damaged.
That's not the issue.

216
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,855
- Then we got a bad egg.
- One bad egg out of the five
we've touched so far.

217
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,942
Say one in five computers
has the flaw? That's 20,000
units.

218
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,945
- That's 20,000 store returns
at ComputerLand.
- Exactly.

219
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,697
- Everything all right?
- No, we have a problem.

220
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,116
- Ooh, how bad?
- Gordon:<i> We don't know yet.</i>

221
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,867
Sev-two, sev-three maybe.

222
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,869
Oh, will it delay
shipment?

223
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,164
Well, we'll have to
check every test unit.

224
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,042
Maybe this is
an opportunity.

225
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,211
Maybe we delay a month
or two to fix the bug

226
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,921
and make some
improvements.

227
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,758
Then come March,
ComputerLand will have
a bunch of empty shelves.

228
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,718
I already got Dennis flying in
first class from New Jersey

229
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,344
at the end of February
for the public launch.

230
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,804
This is bigger
than plane fares
and party costs.

231
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,141
We got software
just sitting around while
we figure out what's wrong.

232
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,769
Let me run with them
and build a killer app.

233
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,563
<i>By the time the bug is fixed,</i>
<i>ComputerLand won't just</i>
<i>have a computer,</i>

234
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,231
<i>they'll have</i>
<i>a bundled suite.</i>

235
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,108
<i>We'll be out ahead again.</i>

236
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,569
Now that's something
to celebrate.

237
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,237
Look, I know
this is unfortunate.

238
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,157
But life gives you
lemons, right?

239
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,622
Joe:
Okay, listen up.

240
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,749
We've had a little hiccup
with shipping,

241
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,668
which means we've
got some extra time,
and because we're who we are,

242
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,795
we're not gonna spend it
playing "Pong" and twiddling
our thumbs.

243
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,963
We're gonna capitalize.

244
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,799
<i>I know you've been</i>
<i>chomping at the bit</i>

245
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,592
to write something that's not
a peripheral driver.

246
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,303
Good, because today,
Cardiff Electric

247
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,930
has entered the software
application business,

248
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:12,560
and in 60 days,
I want a killer app
ready to ship with the Giant.

249
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,481
A top-notch program
for our top-notch machine.

250
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,150
Now this is blue sky.
You got ideas, I wanna hear 'em.

251
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,319
And then I want us
to make them.

252
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,738
You guys up for
a challenge like that?

253
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,156
You bet.

254
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,950
( chuckles )
Good, good, good.

255
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,081
Hey, how was
your first day off?

256
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,460
It was euphoric.

257
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,838
Oh.
Where are the girls?

258
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,506
Sleepover.

259
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,924
Do you wanna have
one of our own?

260
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,427
<i>( briefcase thumps )</i>

261
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,514
Donna:
So, how bad is it?

262
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,058
It's definitely gonna
delay shipping.

263
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,439
I think Joe
did it on purpose.

264
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,444
I-I don't understand
the benefit.

265
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,864
He can't
live in reality.

266
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,115
He's always chasing
some fantasy, you know?

267
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:12,829
- He's never satisfied.
- I don't know what
his endgame is.

268
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,039
It doesn't matter.

269
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,834
The truth is that
I can't trust him.

270
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,049
Hey, you have
worked too hard

271
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,846
and risked
too much to get here.
We both have.

272
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,557
Nothing can be allowed
to jeopardize that.

273
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,187
What are you saying?

274
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,273
I think you know
what I'm saying.

275
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,073
I've got three teams
running diagnostics
on the 3B5,

276
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,785
checking to see if you've
corrupted it in any way.

277
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,246
Also got guys checking
the network itself to see
if it's damaged.

278
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,666
Come on, Eli.
You're not that dumb.

279
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,002
You know the network
can transmit way faster
than we're letting it.

280
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:06,424
We can phase shift,
modulate amplitude,
insert error correction--

281
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,426
basically
whatever we want.

282
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,678
Your modems
were uncertified.

283
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,222
We dictate the terms
of how the network
is accessed.

284
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,183
- You understand?
- Uh-huh.

285
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,354
So, let me guess.
Southern Lines is setting up
its own data network?

286
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,193
Who do you
really work for?

287
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,030
( laughs )

288
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,367
Nobody.
Not anymore.

289
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,152
All right,
what do we got?

290
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,988
Come on,
let's fire it up.

291
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,032
You, let's hear it.

292
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:17,662
Um, um, it's a
moon phase calendar.

293
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,164
So you type in the date
and it gives you

294
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,001
the upcoming
phases of the moon

295
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,503
for the next 25 years.

296
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,630
So, like, on
my birthday in 1997,

297
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,091
it's going to be
a waxing gibbous.

298
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,804
Okay.
What else?

299
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,263
You.

300
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,683
Careful,
you're gonna love this.

301
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,686
A simulator--
beekeeping.

302
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,856
Full-on "zimulation."
Hardcore.

303
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,273
You start with three
hives and you're able--

304
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,234
Guys, a killer app
is something

305
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,153
that everyone wants,
they must have.

306
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,489
Think bigger.

307
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:01,706
What, so Cameron
was the only one of you
that had any real ideas?

308
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:05,877
Well, what are
your ideas, man?

309
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,049
<i>"Voila, An American Dream"</i>
<i>playing in background</i>

312
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,890
I know how
I'm gonna do it.

313
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,892
Lay it on me.

314
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,978
What is Joe's
Achilles' heel?

315
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,271
Casual wear.

316
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,857
No, Cameron.

317
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,734
He's in love
with her, you know?

318
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,570
Of course I know that.
What planet have
you been on?

319
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,572
I'm gonna turn her
in to the feds

320
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,323
for hacking
with Bosworth

321
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,743
unless Joe
leaves Cardiff.

322
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,828
Isn't that
a little bit evil?

323
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,706
You're gonna ruin
Cameron's entire life
just to get rid of Joe?

324
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,251
Relax. I'm not
actually gonna do it.

325
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,836
I'm just gonna
threaten to.

326
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,129
Joe's too smart
for that.

327
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,923
What happens when
he calls your bluff

328
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,759
and realizes you don't
have the stomach to go
through with it?

329
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,970
- No, no, no, no.
- Wait, wait, unless...

330
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,848
you show him proof.

331
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,144
Like this uplink
from the bank's daemon.

332
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,647
It shows the alteration
of transaction codes

333
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,442
all routed back
to Cameron's office computer.

334
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:15,029
Donna, this
is a print driver.

335
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,782
Joe doesn't know that.

336
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,873
( knocking )

337
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,510
I can't do this
without you.

338
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,931
Do what, Joe?

339
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,309
Cameron...

340
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,145
come back
to Cardiff.

341
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,647
You can do
whatever you want.

342
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,398
You'll have
<i>carte blanche--</i>

343
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,485
- No.
- Fine, don't work
for Cardiff.

344
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,822
Form your own company.
I'll hire you
as a vendor.

345
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,282
You'll never have
to see my face.
I just-- I need you.

346
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,409
Oh, God,
you're pathetic.

347
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,039
- ( bangs )
- We can start
our own company.

348
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,499
I'll leave Cardiff.

349
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,250
We can go to California,
go anywhere.

350
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,212
We can start
from scratch.

351
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,297
I wanna be with you.

352
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,469
That sounds nice.

353
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,223
We could build something
together, a partnership.

354
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,642
Make our own future.

355
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,938
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

356
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,649
Except you're not
the future.

357
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,196
You're a footnote.

358
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,655
For a while,
you had me fooled.

359
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:44,994
I mean, I thought
I heard a heartbeat.

360
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,871
But it wasn't
a heartbeat.

361
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,166
It was an echo.

362
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,377
I loved you...

363
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,547
because you recited
my own ideas back to me

364
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,092
and pretended
they were your own.

365
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,510
( scoffs )

366
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,934
You want to know
the truth?

367
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,560
You're still exactly
what you were

368
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,854
the day your mom
let you fall off
that roof.

369
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,817
Yeah.

370
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,487
Just a sad
little boy...

371
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,532
with a lot
of wasted potential.

372
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,838
<i>( elevator bell rings )</i>

373
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,811
Where the hell
have you been?

374
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,521
It's past 11:30.
Nice of you to show up.

375
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,899
Come here, you're gonna
want to see this.

376
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,570
None of them showed up
for work today.

377
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,989
Where are they?

378
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,740
Neil, tell 'em.

379
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,118
They all went
to work for Mutiny.

380
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,620
I've never
heard of it.

381
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,582
( chuckles )
Well, that's
the best part.

382
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,838
Okay, I need you guys
to buy as many XTs

383
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,090
for the shelves
as you can until
these max out.

384
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:24,343
Okay, okay, but the modem
firmware is bugging out
all over the place.

385
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,679
- I can't predict
the errors.
- Okay--

386
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,848
We need to get
onto the protocols,
the interface, the games.

387
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,850
- Okay.
- It'd be awesome to have
someone dedicated to hardware.

388
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,270
Dave:
Shit.

389
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,981
Preferably an adult.

390
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,233
Okay.

391
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,453
<i>( knock on door )</i>

392
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,587
So, I can't pay you,

393
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,049
but I can offer you
a percentage of the company.

394
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,925
Why me?

395
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,053
My house is running wild
with code monkeys.

396
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,722
I need someone
with real hardware
experience

397
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,226
and attention to detail.

398
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:17,646
- Well, what's the idea?
- Connecting people.

399
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:21,650
You dial in,
you play games across
phone lines with real humans.

400
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,070
We're writing the interface,
the games, everything.

401
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,239
But phone lines
aren't fast enough.

402
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,743
I've got a phase-shifting and
amplitude modulation protocol
that breaks 9600 baud.

403
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,330
You subscribe.
You get a modem
and software in the mail.

404
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,337
Wait, what
is this really?

405
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,797
Some sort
of revenge hire?

406
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,092
Some screwed-up way
of getting back
at Gordon?

407
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,761
Because I am not
some pawn

408
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,596
in whatever
twisted chess match

409
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,098
the three of you
play with each other.

410
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,557
Donna.

411
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,812
I'm flattered, thanks.

412
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,980
But, no, thanks.

413
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,777
Okay.
Suit yourself.

414
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,210
You wanted to see me?

415
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,880
- Look, Joe--
- Save your breath.

416
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,382
You got me.

417
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:29,927
Coders are gone.
Any chance of a killer app
is dead.

418
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,472
You're right.
It's ready.

419
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,725
Okay.

420
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,979
Did any other test boxes
display the same problem?

421
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,981
Just the one.

422
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,109
A thousand machines
out of a hundred thousand,
one percent?

423
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,153
Return rate
will be less.

424
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,906
We won't even feel it
in the profit margin.

425
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,995
So, what are you
saying, exactly?

426
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,746
Ship it.

427
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,127
What are you
working on?

428
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,129
Just a print driver.

429
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,182
I think the tailor
cut it weird.

430
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:21,687
( scoffs )
Gordon, that looks so good
on you. You look great.

431
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,521
Well, you know,
Joe's gonna be all--

432
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,483
Oh, Joe is Joe.

433
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,277
You be yourself.
Here.

434
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,449

about placing
their CGA technology

directly onto our motherboard
for the next iteration.

442
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,277
Fantastic.

Gayle, I apologize,
this is my wife Donna.

Oh, so pleased
to meet you.

- Thank you, likewise.

- Busy bee.
- ( chuckles )

449
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,086
So, what do you do?

450
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,630
Oh, I-- uh, I'm not
working presently.

451
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,844
Um...

452
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,971
so, he looks great
without the beard.

453
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,349
- Yeah.
- It makes him look
so in charge, you know?

454
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,188
Well...

455
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,290
Well, you sold
your first computer.

Mm-hmm-- mm,
which reminds me.

457
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,134
What-- what are we
doing in here?

I called the coders
a bunch of Ewoks.

He had no idea
what I was talking about.

Then why did he
have popcorn?

512
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:27,427
I think he just wanted
to look more normal.

when I thought--

566
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,429
I thought
I was gonna lose you

567
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,516
and I never
want to lose you.

568
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,061
I can't lose you,
but more than that,

569
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:32,565
you can't just
sit here and stew.

570
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:37,487
You should do

that you want to do.

Come work at Cardiff.

I'm stretched thin
running everything,

574
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:50,709

it needs to be big.

- Yeah?

579
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,391
Of course.

580
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,396
But I don't think
that Cardiff

581
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,565

One, I'm not your boss.
Nobody here has titles.

597

Fiske Observatory.

Is that around here?
I can't find it on the map.

dozen miles.

661
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,007

Not sure she's
used to visitors.

662
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,676
Don't get yourself shot.

663
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,642
I'll be careful.
