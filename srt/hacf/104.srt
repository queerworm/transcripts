1
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,845
$1.3 million
in 20 days and you just--
you just understand?

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,263
The future's expensive.
We knew that.

3
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,850
Apple spends that daily
on its in-house catering.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:20,562
Apple ships PCs
that you can type on,
that have screens.

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,691
Oh, and what is--
is that a fish tank?

6
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,025
Joe:<i> Yes and no.</i>

7
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,361
It's actually
a time machine.

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,863
See, to test
the BIOS and hardware

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,197
at the speed
we're gunning for,

10
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,824
we need the 12
and a half megahertz 286,

11
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,200
but it's not out yet.
We only have the eight,

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,994
and if we overclock
the eight-- pfft--

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,746
- the chip will fry in seconds,
so Larry here--
- Stan.

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,499
Stan's put the chip
in mineral oil and
cranked down the temp.

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,544
Cooling it makes it run
at 12 and a half megahertz,

16
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,506
- so we get to design tomorrow
before tomorrow's even here.
- Well, what's taking so long?

17
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,842
We're right on track
to have our prototype
ready for COMDEX.

18
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,219
- In November.
- Oh, and, hey,
look at this, look at this.

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,805
Three four-layer PCBs.
That's the new norm.

20
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,016
Our PC's aiming for 12.

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,061
So, imagine, um,
an invisible subway system
with electrons as trains.

22
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,355
More layers,
fewer collisions,

23
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,566
which is pretty amazing
when you're moving at
the speed of light.

24
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,235
The electrons
actually move at one third
the speed of light.

25
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,487
Bigger point here, Stan,
please stop talking.

26
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,614
The checks you're writing
are making innovation happen.

27
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,074
Tell me that's
not beautiful,

28
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,409
that you don't feel
the excitement.

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,412
I will "feel
the excitement"

30
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,623
when a clone with our logo
encased in fancy plastic

31
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,251
running Lotus 1-2-3
is on the shelves
over at Sears

32
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,836
and people are shoving
each other out the way

33
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,255
to get to it
with their wallets
hanging open.

34
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,631
I imagine
how you must feel.

35
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,966
It's difficult
to believe in something

36
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,551
when your knowledge
is so limited.

37
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,637
Maylene:
<i>Nathan Cardiff's</i>
<i>on the line.</i>

38
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,477
- ( computer beeps )
- Mother Mary.

39
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,355
396 milliseconds.

40
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,608
- Hot damn!
- Don't screw with us.

41
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,985
- Are you sure you ran it right?
- Checked it three times.

42
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,781
- Where's Gordon?
- He might still be sleeping.

43
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,617
Yes, I will be home
for bedtimes.

44
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,661
I know I said that last night,
but tonight I promise.

45
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,789
Hey, little privacy.

46
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,041
396 milliseconds.

47
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,876
What?
But she's not done.

48
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,003
She did the subroutine
for the hard drive table
lookups first.

49
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,755
That's what the seeks
clocked in at.

50
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,924
Donna, we just hit
the Doherty Threshold.

51
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,010
No, I know.
I know. I love you.

52
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,014
<i>"I Love Your Neurosis"</i>
<i>playing in background</i>

53
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,061
We hit
the Doherty Threshold.

54
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,481
Someone's been
up late studying.

55
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,775
Maybe between mocking me
and your 19th orange soda,

56
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,068
you could register
a little happiness.

57
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,821
I knew
it would be fast.

58
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,323
- How much longer
till you're done?
- I don't know, two days?

59
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,617
A day and a night,
or two full days?

60
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,328
31.29 hours
and 13 nanoseconds.

61
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,455
Can you leave
and shut the door?

62
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,124
I'm calling
a team-building meeting.

63
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,875
( scoffs )
You're joking, right?

64
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,379
Joe:
<i>All right, gather round,</i>
<i>come closer.</i>

65
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,674
Today, we hit a milestone.

66
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,717
When engineers measure
the speed of a PC,

67
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,260
they talk
about something called

68
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,721
the "Doherty Threshold
of System Response Time."

69
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,348
<i>It sounds fancy,</i>
<i>I know,</i>

70
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,850
<i>but, basically,</i>
<i>what it means is</i>

71
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,768
<i>when you ask your computer</i>
<i>to do something</i>

72
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,478
and hit the enter key,

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,064
if it answers you back
in less than 400 milliseconds,

74
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,858
just under
half a second,

75
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,736
then you will stay glued
to that machine for hours.

76
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,824
Your eyes may glaze over,
but your productivity
will soar.

77
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,035
You'll be transfixed,
mesmerized.

78
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,038
Even a slight deviation
back to half a second
response time

79
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,165
will allow your attention
to stray.

80
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,749
You'll get up
and do the dishes,

81
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,960
pick up the remote,
watch the game.

82
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:35,465
But under 400 milliseconds,
ah, that's the sweet spot.

83
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,218
Well, guess what?

84
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,305
Our soon-to-be Cardiff PC,
though it looks ragtag now,

85
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:46,727
just clocked in
at 396 milliseconds.

86
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,730
( clapping )

87
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,732
Joe:
<i>Once assembled,</i>
<i>it will not only</i>

88
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,692
<i>be faster than other PCs</i>
<i>on the market,</i>

89
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,111
it will also be
addictive.

90
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,573
<i>So spend time</i>
<i>with your families, folks,</i>
<i>get drinks with your friends,</i>

91
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,743
'cause once our PC hits,
you're gonna be hanging
out with it.

92
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,828
- ( scattered laughing )
- And, hey, Debbie,
let's see 'em.

93
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,248
Now, this is just
a smattering of the calls
I'm getting now.

94
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,333
Potential customers,
retailers,

95
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,669
<i>and they all wanna know</i>
<i>what we're up to.</i>

96
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,924
And tomorrow
a reporter from the
"Wall Street Quarterly"

97
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,593
is coming
to do a story on us.

98
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,762
Practically begged me
to get in the door.

99
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,222
We're hitting
the radar, people.

100
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,473
I mean, really
cooking with gas.

101
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,935
So it's only
appropriate...

102
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,978
- Barry:<i> No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>You'll contaminate. </i>
- Whoa, whoa.

103
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,189
- Everybody disperse.
- Joe, what are you doing?

104
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,108
- Ed: Get that thing outta here.
- Stan: You could blow
the whole thing.

105
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,859
- Barry:<i> Come on, Joe. </i>
- Relax.

106
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,152
No one goes anywhere.

107
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,618
( chuckles )

108
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,919
Oh, that's what I call
cooking the books!

109
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,546

laughter )

110
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,187
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

111
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,384
No, Daddy,
my pink ones.

112
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,095
Haley, stop.
These are pink enough.

113
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,596

00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,307

Joanie:
<i>Yuck, they turn brown!</i>

116
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,935
( singsong )
Not if I put lemon juice.

117
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,728
Just wear the red ones,
Haley.

118
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,731
Why is it that
when Mommy says,
"Wear the socks,"

119
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,733
- you suddenly
wear the socks?
- Donna: Gordon.

120
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,653
All right, Smooch,
go put your shoes on.

Maybe we should start
smoking pot again.

That'd take off
the edge.

124
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,703
Yeah, and we'd never
get out of bed.

00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,165
Okay.

167
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,417
Getting an article about us
in the "Wall Street Quarterly,"

168
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,170
the right article,
that could be a game-changer,

169
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,006
put our PC on the map,
take this company into
the stratosphere,

170
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,924
but if we seem sloppy
or fly-by-night,

171
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,219
if we project the wrong image,
then it could all fall apart.

172
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,472
Should I have gotten
pastries instead?

173
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,015
No, those are fine.

174
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,310
( whispering )
Our real problem is Cameron.

175
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,563
Her work station's
a pigsty.

176
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,858
It's unprofessional,
it's unsanitary.

177
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,194
Frankly,
it's embarrassing.

178
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,530
We've gotta get it cleaned up
before Kane gets here.

179
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,532
Well, he's scheduled
for 11:00.

180
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,409
Yeah, tell
the cleaning crew
to hurry.

181
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,911
But she'll
never let 'em.

182
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,913
You know
how she is.

183
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,874
Yeah.

184
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,377
You live
close to here, right?

185
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,420
Yeah, just
down on Buxton.

186
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,630
Then convince her
to go back to your place
for a break.

187
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,717
Get her to take a shower,
wash her hair.

188
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,053
She doesn't hate you
and might listen.

189
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,180
You know,
woman to woman or...

190
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,391
Well, you're her boss.
Can't you talk to her?

191
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,393
I can't tell her
to put on a bra, Debbie.

192
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,561
<i>You</i> can.

193
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,813
And please do.

194
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,985
Okay.
I'll do my best.

195
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,363
Oh, thank you.

196
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,158
Cardiff:
You get enough
of Milly's sausage?

197
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,161
Another bite
and I'd, hell,

198
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,247
pop like a mosquito
sucking a pig.

199
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,042
Good as ever, though.
She is somethin'.

200
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,169
Yep, she's a keeper.

201
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,381
Like they say, John,
"Good help is hard to find."

202
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,552
Yeah, well, thanks
for breakfast, Nathan.

203
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,430
I guess I'd best
be getting on back to it.

204
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,516
To what?

205
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,142
Beg your pardon?

206
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,603
What's your rush?

207
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,148
Thought Joe MacMillan
had everything pretty
much in hand.

208
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,109
( groans )

209
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,571
You know what
I just can't shake?

210
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,866
Loulu not funding
our PC pipe dream,
that I get.

211
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,659
She's a tough one.

212
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:23,331
But her not
returning my calls
after three weeks?

213
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,377
- Joe called
that woman names--
- Bullshit.

214
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,879
- He wouldn't--
- Bullshit.

215
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,300
You could call Loulu
a redneck sack of goat sperm.

216
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,677
She'd still do business
with you if she thought
she could make a buck.

217
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,098
Is that your new M.O.?

218
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,018
I ask a question,
first thing you say is,
"Joe..."?

219
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,896
Ah, come--
no, of course not.

220
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,443
I want
a straight answer.

221
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,069
Who's running things?

222
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,988
I am.

223
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,491
You better be
'cause folks are
starting to talk.

224
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,328
They're saying that
you're letting this thing
run away from ya.

225
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,334
Make clear who's
working for who

226
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,544
or else we're both
gonna look like idiots.

227
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,721
All right, I think
you know your way out.

228
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,658
( groans )

229
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,124

230

And with this extra-wide
chip carrier,

231
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,922
the CPU and coprocessor
can be clipped into
a single ribbon cable.

232
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,301
It's just one of the many
innovations that helped us
hit the Doherty Threshold.

233
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,053
( scoffs )

234
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,720
You're not
an engineer, are ya?

235
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,598
What?

236
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,975
You just sound
a bit canned, that's all.

237
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,894
Like you're repeating
what people told you
or getting it from books.

238
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,398
( chuckles )
No, I'm the product manager.

239
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,693
- Do I have a degree in--
- I mean, the Doherty Threshold?
Come on.

240
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,528
You know how many companies
think they hit that

241
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,405
in the testing phase?
All of them.

242
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,408
Try building the damn thing
with the heat sink
and the case.

243
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,160
Once the realities
of physics kick in,
it's a whole new ball game.

244
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,621
Not to mention I don't write
for "Hobbyists' Weekly."

245
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,081
My readers
will be asleep in seconds.

246
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,458
- Okay, fair enough.
- Joe, I told you on the phone,

247
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,045
I came here because
Matt Garrison in New York
said he owed you a favor.

248
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,465
I owed him one,
so I said I'd pop by,
but now I gotta go.

249
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,176
Ron, please, please.

250
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,761
Just meet some of our people,
get their stories.

251
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,556
There's
an underdog angle here

252
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,683
I guarantee
you'll find interesting.

253
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,606
- Fine. 15 minutes.
- Great.

As you can see,
we don't waste money
on amenities

257
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,808
because, hey,
you know programmers.
What's the joke?

258
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,437
"They're just machines
for turning pizza into code."

259
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,230
Yeah, good one.

260
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,691
But Cameron,
in this case, is a girl.

261
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,443
Yep, you don't
see that every day.

262
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:43,490
22, brilliant,
and writing a BIOS
that defies belief.

263
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,493
- What happened?
- Cameron:<i> It's gone.</i>

264
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,202
All my code, I--

265
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,746
Did you try
booting it up again?

266
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,665
I can't even
get a prompt.

267
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,000
All right, look, it's
probably just the monitor
or the connection.

- What-- what's happening?

269
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,254
You backed it up, right?

270
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:02,175
Yeah-- yeah,
at some point.

271
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,802
"At some point"?

00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,763

00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,525
Probably just
burned out the disks.

276
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,109
Where are your
backup floppies?

277
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,612
She left one in the A-drive.
It's toast.

A vacuum cleaner?

- You plugged your vacuum
cleaner in my computer?!
- Okay, okay.

you put your backups

Okay, girls. Let's go.

Daddy!

00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,525
You're late. Miss Ferris
had to call Mommy.

I know, I know.
I know.

299
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,153
I asked you to do one thing.
You can't write it on your arm?

300
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,864
You can't get an admin

00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,452
Oh,<i> you're</i> having
kind of a day?

303
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,412
Now I'm gonna miss another
deadline that I promised
I'd make.

304
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,915
Well, maybe the stakes
are a little bit higher
in my world, okay?

305
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,833
I'm not just
QA-ing calculators.

- Excuse me?
- I didn't--

307
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,170
Gordon, let me
ask you something.

308
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,339
When is the last time
you cut their toenails?

309
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,134
Or which one
of your daughters
is allergic to apricots?

310
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,844
Do you even know
their pediatrician's name?

311
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,639
No, you don't?
Because you don't have to.

-<i> I</i> make<i> your</i> world possible.
- Mommy, let's go home.

313
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,353
It's okay, it's okay.
We're just--

314
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,314
just take them, Gordon.
We'll talk at home.

315
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,691

316
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,320
- Oh, my God, you can't.
- No.

317
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,530
You can't even
take them.

318
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,866
I need you
to come to Cardiff.

319
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,619
- Crazy back there, huh?
- Pretty sported.

320
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,454
- Thought they might
come to blows.
- ( chuckles )

321
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,164

would be fine.

00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,963
Look, why don't you
come back next week?

325
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,048
Our head engineer just told me
this whole thing's no big deal,

326
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,260
but even so,
it's kind of distracting.

327
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,847
Let me level
with you, Joe.

328
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,350
I was never
gonna write a word
about this company.

329
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,352
I think its odds
of being a player
in the PC market

330
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,980

with the guys who fix
my washer-dryer.

I came only
as a favor to Matt.

332
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,568
But lo and behold,
the universe paid me back,

333
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,572
gave me a story
about a company flying
too close to the sun

334
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,701
that burnt to a crisp
in IBM's shadow.

335
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,787
The pain, the dashed
hopes and dreams.

336
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,789
5,000 words on that,
a byline,

337
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,708
I might finally
get off this crappy beat

338
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,250
and make it back
to Wall Street

339
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,919
or Silicon Valley,
where the real action is.

340
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,087
All of which is to say
I'm not leaving

341
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,423
till I get this
in all its gory glory.

342
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,926
Maybe you don't
understand.

343
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,803
I'm not
asking you, Ron.

344
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:37,891
Oh, a threat.
Okay.

345
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,768
Let me lob one
back at you.

346
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,812
If I leave, if I go,

347
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,565
I write what I got,
and we both know
that ain't pretty.

348
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,527
Other hand, let me stay,
maybe I get the full story--
good with the bad.

349
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,905
Cardiff's engineers
are the best in the
Silicon Prairie...

350
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,948
- That's not saying much.
- ...and they will find
a way through this.

351
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,950
It's a bump,
that's all.

352
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,911
Great, then I'm sure
you'll want me around
to see that.

353
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,329
Or, wait, was that
all bullshit?

354
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,003
This is your
data retrieval expert?

355
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,588
Hello to you, too.

356
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,631
She did her thesis
on magnetic storage.

357
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,927
How long ago, Gordon?
We need current technical
know-how here.

358
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,055
Oh, excuse me. Like you'd
know technical know-how
if it hit you in the head.

359
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,098
Look, you can't be here.

360
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,601
- Great, that's just great.
- Come on, girls.

361
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,562
- Ladies, come on.
- You blow my whole day and
he tells me I have to leave?

362
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,398
Hold up.
Look, girls, calm down.
Get out your coloring book.

363
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,900
What are you
talking about?

364
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,651
With him here?
Come on.

365
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,486
Everything we do
will be open to scrutiny.

366
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,321
Donna:
<i>Who, the reporter?</i>
<i>So tell him to leave.</i>

367
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,990
It's a little
more complicated.

368
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,324
With you,
that's a big surprise.

369
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,077
I'm actually
thinking about you.

370
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,370
If it comes out
that you're working here,
even as a favor,

371
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,581
you think your bosses at TI
would be okay with it?

372
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,708
Is that it,
Joe, really?

373
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,627
Or do you not want anyone
thinking you couldn't
save your own...

374
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,795
( whispers )
...ass?

375
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,630
I don't want your wife
at the office.

376
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,632
What the hell's
the matter with you?

377
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,426
Without Donna,
this thing stays
dead on the table, Joe.

378
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,096
She is our best option.
Right now, she is our
only option.

379
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,850
Fine, but if Kane wants to know,
she's a Cardiff employee,

380
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,393
and don't use
your real name.

381
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,990
Hey, uh, I need to ask you
a couple questions.

382
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,617
Besides the floppy
you left in the A-drive

383
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,035
and the stack
near the speakers,

384
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,912
are you sure you never
backed up elsewhere?

385
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,789
( faintly )
Uh-huh.

386
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,666
<i>That's a no?</i>

387
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,752
Okay, how about a list of files?
Do you keep anything like that?

388
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,755
No. When you're in the flow
creating something,

389
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,341
you don't just stop
for some mindless bookkeeping.

390
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,678
Right, which is why
we're here right now.

391
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,514
<i>( scoffs )</i>
<i>Who are you, anyways?</i>
<i>Just somebody's mother?</i>

392
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,100
Do you have any clue
what it's like to work
close to the metal?

393
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,644
Like, any idea
what I've lost?

394
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:50,064
Well, FYI, I am
also an engineer with
a degree from Berkeley

395
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,108
who's not only created
my share of code,

396
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,734
-<i> but given birth</i>
<i>to two real humans. </i>
- Oh, God.

397
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,862
So yeah, I am
somebody's mother

398
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:59,573
and you could use one
right now because,
frankly, you're a mess.

399
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,327
Leave me alone.
Go burn a bra or something.

400
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,705
That's great. Sally Ride
just went to space

401
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,207
and here's you screwing up
at work and lashing out
like a child

402
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,209
<i>at the people</i>
<i>trying to help you.</i>

403
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,004
You slept with
the boss to get here.
Now I know why you had to.

404
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,381
Oh, I'm still
sleeping with him,

405
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,716
in case you're
wondering, bitch.

406
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,509
Oh, wow.

407
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,803
You really don't think
much of yourself, do you?

408
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,847
Go to hell.

409
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,482
( panting )

410
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,292
Donna:
<i>It's melted, fine,</i>
<i>so it can't spin.</i>

411
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,294
<i>The read head's</i>
<i>damaged anyway.</i>

412
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,922
<i>We'll have to remount it</i>
<i>on a different spindle.</i>

413
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,256
Wait, won't that just
ruin the head on that one?

414
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,465
Yeah, you gonna
spin it by hand?

415
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,634
- A micron at a time?
- Yes.

416
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,762
If the guys at NASA
can grind parabolic mirrors

417
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,431
to within one sixth
of the wavelength of yellow
light by hand,

418
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,474
I'm pretty sure I can control
the rotation of a disk.

419
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:13,231
In fact, my chances of success
are greater by a factor of 144.

420
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,357
Maybe, but no way
the ins and outs.

421
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,443
Exactly, which is why
we'll modify it.

422
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,486
Use the stepper motor
on the head, not
the spinner motor.

423
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,990
Remove the data
one click at a time,
back up to a third drive.

424
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,368
Only problem being
we'll die of old age
before you finish.

425
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,787
Not if the FAT's
intact.

426
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,789
That way, aside from
the fried files,

427
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,582
I can reassemble
the BIOS by deduction.

428
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,169
( scoffs )

429
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,879
I think she's
smarter than you are.

430
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,589
I knew that
the moment I met her.

431
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,967
How I'd never
really deserve her.

432
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,510
And, frankly, I'm amazed
she puts up with me.

433
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,845
( whispers )
Someone's in the doghouse.

434
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,931
Come on,
let's do this.

435
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,687
Joe:
<i>Hey, you all right?</i>

436
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,355
<i>I brought you</i>
<i>something to eat.</i>

437
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,774
Just go.

438
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,374
<i>( keys clicking )</i>

439
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,710
Okay, you can
do the transfer.

440
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,337
ETA on that, Ed?

441
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,380
Not too long.
It's coming.

442
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,300
Wiring's a bit tricky.

443
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,303
Spinner wires
are in the middle
of the ribbon.

444
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,599
- Mommy? I wanna go.
- I'm starving.

445
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:34,394
- Maylene...
- I'm sorry, I got rascals
of my own at home.

446
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,897
- What about Debbie?
- Joe sent her home.
I gotta go.

447
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,609
( sighs )
Fine.

448
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:44,446
Okay, I've got
nuts and raisins.

449
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,907
- That's what's for dinner?
- Just eat it, okay?

450
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,576
- Kids in Africa are
starving right now.
- Gordon...

451
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,538
Com on, we need
to get this done.

452
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,708
Hey, I can take them
if you guys wanna
keep working.

453
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,751
No, no, no.
We're good, thanks.

454
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,003
<i>We don't need</i>
<i>any more of your help.</i>

455
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,463
Well, where
will you be?

456
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,884
Uh, the garage, I guess,
just outside the fire door.

457
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,805
Fine, all right?
Just be careful.

458
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,932
There's a phone down there.
Call if you got a problem.

459
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,976
Okay, and we'll be right
in this room, all right?

460
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,146
Here, dinner,
which they will eat
and not gripe about.

461
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,648
I'm sure they'll be
little angels.

462
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,821
The good news is
I'll go blind
before I die.

463
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,698
Then at least
I'll have to stop.

464
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,952
Well, the guys
are bringing you down
another monitor.

465
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,954
- There.
- ( sighs )

466
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,414
There it is, the FAT.
It's mostly intact.

467
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:40,086
- Thank God.
- Easy, now.
It's a process.

468
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,011
You know, watching you work,
you know what it reminds me of?

469
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,472
How often you distract me
when I'm trying to work?

470
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:56,102
That night in CS-50,
remember?

471
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,021
When everybody
had left the lab

472
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,190
and you forced
yourself on me

473
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,816
on the motherboard
assembly table.

474
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,819
I recall it
a little differently.

475
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,822
It took five days
to rebuild the ones
that broke

476
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:13,119
- when you
swept them to the floor.
-<i> You</i> swept them to the floor.

477
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,830
Hey, romantic urgency.

478
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,292
Yeah, I remember.

479
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,131
Donna, I'm-- I'm sorry.

480
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,354
Okay, now leave me alone.
I gotta work.

481
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,356
- Okay.
-<i> ( chair rumbles )</i>

482
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,859
Okay, oh, do you want
tickle spray?

483
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,569
Sure.

484
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,196
Some guy who doesn't
work here anymore

485
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,198
left it in his desk,
so I stole it.

486
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,576
Some people think it's yucky,
but let's just try it.

487
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,494
Okay, ready?

488
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,167
( laughs )

489
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,709
No?

490
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,587
I think real
tickles are better,
what do you think?

491
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,007
- Right? Real tickles are good.
- ( laughing )

492
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,761
- You're not trash.
- Yeah, you're fun.

493
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,140
What?
Did someone say I was?

494
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,937
It's okay, girls.
You can tell me.

495
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,149
Well, Dad said to Mom

496
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,234
that you were
just like white trash.

497
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,611
Haley:
<i>Yeah, they were joking.</i>

498
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,529
How do you know
they were joking?

499
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,032
'Cause
they were laughing.

500
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,285
<i>Let's go play,</i>
<i>Cameron.</i>

501
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,499
You guys wanna see
something fun?

502
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,919
( gasps )

503
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,505
Huh?

504
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,260
Okay, go. Playtime's over.
Go play with your parents.

505
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,556
Joanie:
Let's go.

506
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,143
<i>( door opens,</i>

507
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,316

<i>( rattling stops )</i>

509
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,518
I thought Joe
told you to leave.

510
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,103
Oh, he did.

511
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,440
But then we came
to an understanding.

512
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,612
How's the BIOS
recovery looking?

513
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:42,369
Yeah, your engineers
didn't want to talk
to me either.

514
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,330
They're
a prickly bunch.

515
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,915
I thought they were gonna
try and crucify me

516
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,375
the moment I set foot
down there.

517
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,127
Now you know
they're smart.

518
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,591
Must be especially
rough on you.

519
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:58,385
I mean,
22 years here--

520
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,430
selling diodes
and ham radios...

521
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,765
to mainframe software,
to this?

522
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,683

523
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,103
<i>You feeling</i>
<i>any guilt</i>

524
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,857
letting some
IBM slickster

525
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,277
come in and hijack it
all away from you?

526
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,031
( scoffs )
First, check your facts.

527
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,075
No one hijacked
anything from me.

528
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,370
And, second, you think
your little story here

529
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,705
about our failed
hopes and dreams,

530
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,792
that gonna revolutionize
news reportin'?

531
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,212
Hell, just another
wad of paper

532
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,506
I'll wrap my dead
fish heads in.

533
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,967
But you
go ahead and write
your Titanic story,

534
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,678
the one
where we go down.

535
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:47,309
But I tell ya,
y'all should be careful.

536
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,521
Because when we
build this PC,

537
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,356
everybody
gonna wanna be in

538
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,983
and you...

539
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:59,112
are gonna be
outside standing there,

540
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:03,158
your little pecker
wagging in the wind.

541
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,371
Now, you get out of my office
before I punch you in the face.

542
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,091
I think
we got it.

543

Oh, man.

549
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,418
They fired you, too?

00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,649
Okay, go ahead.
Do it.

a PC to rival the big boys.

562
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,086
Do it.

563
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,922
I swear to God,
I won't tell.

565
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,640
( sighs )
We got it.

566
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,520
Kane:
Nice save.
Crisis averted, huh?

567
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,356
Well, we're just lucky
the file allocation table
wasn't lost.

568
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,399
Once I found that,
I was able to write a program

569
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,527
to help reassemble
the data sectors.

570
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,986
She's not
completely recovered,

571
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,364
but by my calculations,
about 93%.

572
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:09,827
- And you are?
- This is, um,
Susan Fairchild.

573
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,496
She's one
of our debuggers.

574
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,498
<i>Thanks, Susan.</i>
<i>Nice work.</i>

575
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,793
Hey, guys.
How about showing Ron here
how you cracked the problem?

576
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,712
You really got in
deep there, right?

577
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,797
Okay, well,
the magnetic platter
melted, right?

578
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,633
<i>And it couldn't be spun.</i>
<i>So we remounted it.</i>

579
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:29,471
- Kane:<i> And you are...? </i>
-<i> Oh, Gordon Clark,</i>
<i>head engineer.</i>

580
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:33,600
No, no, but, come on.
IBM decimated your
mainframe business.

581
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,143
You laid off
scores of employees.

582
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,855
Have you got
the resources, the guts,

583
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,147
<i>to fight</i>
<i>in the PC world?</i>

584
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,858
Joe:
<i>Ron, three things--</i>

585
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,194
<i>nimbleness, vision,</i>
<i>and a complete lack of fear.</i>

586
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,279
<i>IBM's formidable,</i>
<i>but it's gotten fat.</i>

587
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,996
( sighs )

588
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,702
The storage room
has no carpeting.

589
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,704
<i>It's concrete.</i>

590
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:39,458
I don't know about you,
but I'd use a mop,
not a vacuum cleaner.

591
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,543
I had the janitor let go,
but if you want, I can call--

592
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,003
My God,
you are tenacious.

593
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,217
They were degaussed,
all right.

594
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,678
But one of them had
a spreadsheet on it.

595
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,597
Another, part of a game.

596
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,433
Cameron's sloppy,
but she's not that sloppy.

597
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,311
She would've used
clean disks to back up on,
not those.

598
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:04,650
You engineered this.

599
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,234
You got her
out of the room somehow,

600
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,361
you made
the power surge happen,

601
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,906
but you grabbed a bunch
of random disks, didn't you,

602
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:14,117
and demagnetized them all
before swapping them
for Cameron's?

603
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,539
Congrats, you got me.

604
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,708
And if I hadn't
recovered the BIOS?

605
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,878
I would've saved
the day myself before
Kane left the building.

606
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,841
All of this
for a little publicity?

607
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,717
Don't underestimate it.

608
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,052
He came in here today
with zero interest
in what we were doing.

609
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,598
Now, whether he writes
that we're geniuses
on the cusp of something great

610
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,433
or misfits who almost
crashed and burned,

611
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,768
at least
he'll write something,

612
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,896
and right now
that's all we need.

613
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,607
And Cameron,
who's sleeping with you?

614
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,777
- She's just
collateral damage?
- She'll get over it.

615
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,446
- Plus, she's learned
to be more careful.
-<i> ( Donna scoffs )</i>

616
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,406
Look, you can think
what you want about me, Donna.

00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,784
<i>But this is their dream, too,</i>
<i>not just mine.</i>

618
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,870
I'd hate to see
their trust in me broken

619
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,915
over something so minor,
so beneficial as this.

620

If you're smart,
and clearly you are...

621
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:15,387
you won't tell anyone.
Not even Gordon.

622
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,522
The kids are fine.
Thanks for asking.

623
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,482
Hey, would you
get them settled, please?

624
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,818
- What?
- Just-- I'll be there
in a minute.

625
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,194
Okay.

626
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,406
Hey.

627
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,578
You scared my girls.

628
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,080
I had to leave,
I'm sorry.

629
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,916
<i>You should be.</i>

630
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:48,045
I don't know if you heard,
but I recovered your code.

631
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,714
Not all of it,
but 93.6%.

632
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,717
Thank you.

633
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,845
God, what I said
to you--

634
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,096
No, forget it.
You were a wreck.

635
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,933
Makes sense
you would be.

636
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:04,019
One time when I was in school,
I spilled a whole Coke
on my motherboard.

637
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,145
Hadn't backed up
for weeks.

638
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,899
I felt like jumping off
the Bay Bridge.

639
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:12,903
But I have to tell you,
my code...

640
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,863
was never like yours.

641
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,783
Yours is, uh...

642
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,703
well, it's like
a piece of music.

643
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:29,419
You should go home.
Sleep, maybe eat
a real meal.

644
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,046
You can work
tomorrow.

645
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,506
No, I gotta get back
that 6.4%.

646
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,010
Suit yourself.

647
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,724
Oh, are these--
are these yours?

648
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,143
Oh.

649
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,228

You were amazing.
I mean, amazing.

670
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,476
Susan Fairchild?
You give me my mother's
maiden name?

671
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,936
It was the first thing
I thought of.

672
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,980
So you think of me
as my mother?

673

<i>No, of course not.</i>

674
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,151
You're being crabby.

675
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,111
Come on, we both
need to get to bed.

Joe fried
Cameron's hard drive

679
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,755
and made it look like
she degaussed her backups.

680
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,258
He did it on purpose
to try and get that reporter
to write about you guys,

681
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,594
about your PC,
about the company.

682
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,097
The BIOS was never lost.

683
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,015
He had the real backups
the whole time.

684
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:50,936
- What?
- This is the man we've
hitched our wagon to, Gordon.

685
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,646
This is your partner
in this whole thing.

686
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,648
But how could he?
I mean--

687
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,111
Jesus.

688
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,779
I mean, what he
put us all through.

689
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,615
Wasting my whole day
on some massive fake drama?

690
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,160
He only told me when I
confronted him about it.

691
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,624
God.

692
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,547

00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,077
Hey, Hank.

701
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,789
Saw that boy of yours
on the mound.

702
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:57,376
- ( laughs )
- God, he is bringing some
Nolan Ryan heat, that kid.

703

Yep, they do

You wanted to see me?
Because I'm doing it right now.

707
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,052
No, no, it's not
about that report.

708
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,971
It's about this one.

709
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:54,309
Not only was it late,
it was full of errors.

710
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,061
I looked like an idiot
in front of Mark.

711
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,897
Um...

712
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,024
I'm sorry.

What's wrong?

714
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,904
You're better
than this.

715
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,240
Now, I'm a friend.
You know that.

716
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,824
But I can't keep
covering for you.

717
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,117
I've got my own job
to think about.

718

As of now,
you're on probation.

719

Now, unless your work improves,
there may be action taken.
