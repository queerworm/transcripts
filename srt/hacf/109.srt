I'm sorry, did you

- That's right.
- Excuse me for one moment.

- Uh, John Bosworth.

- I'm afraid so.

We tried to call,

Unfortunately,
we had no choice but
to release your room.

- After his wife left him
and he lost his house,

in a mental hospital upstate.

00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,024
- Earthquakes.
- I don't feel them anymore.

335
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,818
- Cults? Serial killers?
- That's all down
in Los Angeles.

336
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,447
- The Grateful Dead.
- Wow, you are mean.

337
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,867
( laughs )

338
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,870
I'm hungry.
You want some pancakes?

339
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,454
Yeah.

340
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,831
Hey, you guys
want pancakes?

341
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:02,999
- Pancakes?
- Hell, yeah.

342
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,250
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go.

343
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,835
-<i> Let's do it. </i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>

344
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,256
If the Giant does
everything you say...

345
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,341
it could be
a contender for us.

346
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,677
Don't tease me
if you're not
for real, Dennis.

347
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,013
ComputerLand has nearly
a thousand branches.

348
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,224
We invented computer retail.
I can assure you, we're real.

349
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:24,478
Then why buy
a specialty product
from a podunk firm in Texas?

350
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,814
( groans )

351
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,025
You ever sell cars
for a living, Joe?

352
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,235
No, never.

353
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,238
That's how
I got started.

354
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,159
And I learned
if you wanna sell
station wagons,

355
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,247
you'd better
have a sports car
to park in the window.

356
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,416
Looking forward
to your demo tomorrow.

357
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,217
It's spinning.
That should do it.

358
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,011
Load 'er up.

359
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,477
- ( beeps )
- Gordon: Yes.

360
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,562
Finally.

361
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,606
( all sigh )

362
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,168
( keyboard clicking )

363
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,716
Haven't done that
since our honeymoon.

364
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,308
Oh, I haven't done that
since college.

365
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,560
What? With who?

366
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,104
( humming )

367
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,940
Who?

368
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,576
Should we get him
a blanket?

369
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,620
Hell, no.
We're switching rooms.

370
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,088
Do you really think
it'll sell?

371
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:19,010
If we nail
the demo.

372
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,096
This could be
so good.

373
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,849
For the girls, us.

374
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:29,562
For so long
we've just gotten by.

375
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,314
Weird, huh?

376
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,192
I think they call it
success, sweetheart.

377
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,651
( kisses )

378
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,950
Wally Turner dropped by.
Did you see him?

379
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,245
Yeah, he cornered me
with his sales pitch.

380
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,581
Still all about Wally.

381
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,958
I like his new
software idea.

382
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,961
Yeah, I told him we'd
spec it out on the Giant.

383
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,174
Wally thinks
we still work together.

384
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,053
Yeah?
What'd you tell him?

385
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,306
What am I gonna say?
I'm really enjoying

386
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,684
my dead-end job and having
my mom raise my kids?

387
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,686
It's not exactly
cocktail chatter.

388
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,730
What are you
talking about, Donna?

389
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,982
You saved this project
a dozen times.

390
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,276
We wouldn't have
a motherboard without you.

391
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,904
We wouldn't have
an entire machine
without you.

392
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,242
- I know you know that.
- Well, what?

393
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,078
You wanna join Cardiff?
Get a front-row seat
to the freak show?

394
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,621
I didn't say that.

395
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,539
But?

396
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,045
But it would've
been nice if you'd asked.

397
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,341
You're right.

398
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,676
<i>( glass taps )</i>

399
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,263
I should have
asked, but...

400
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,017
look, a few months ago,
I was in the Kill Room

401
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,019
and I was working late
all by myself.

402
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:56,690
And it hit me,
how far behind we were.

403
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,986
And how hard
I'd have to grind

404
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,403
to get
the Giant built.

405
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,490
And it was like climbing
a cliff on a dare,

406
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,910
where you hit an overhang
and you can't go up,

407
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:12,248
and it's too steep
to climb back down.

408
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,333
And you realize

409
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,502
what the word
"jump" really means.

410
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,049
And if I held your hand
and counted to three...

411
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,054
I wasn't sure
you'd come with me.

412
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,476
We're married,
Gordon.

413
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:36,147
We already jumped.

414
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,316
Yeah.

415
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,159
( clatters )

416
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,626
What's that?

417
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,712
A piece
of the Hoover Dam.

418
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,050
You know
what I like about it?

419
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:08,262
<i>There's no</i>
<i>circuits or wires.</i>

420
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,639
It's so simple.

421
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,100
It is
what it does.

422
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,232
( groans )

423
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,152
Did you have fun?

424
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,114
I ate pancakes

425
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:30,617
and watched the sun
come up with the Xerox boys.

426
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,122
That sounds entirely
too wholesome.

427
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,625
When Bosworth
came to me...

428
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,504
I should've
come to you.

429
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,634
Cameron...

430
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,763
<i>California--</i>

431
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,267
<i>what they're doing out there,</i>
<i>it's really impressive.</i>

432
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,896
Maybe you should go
to Palo Alto.

433
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,649
Maybe<i> we</i> should.

434
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,755
( groans softly )

435
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,761
( Donna laughs )

436
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,471
Gordon, do you really need
another AMD T-shirt?

437
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,515
Yeah, this is
this year's.

438
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,851
Cameron:
Hey, Windows
looks cool.

439
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,187
Donna:
Oh, yeah, but it was
crawling with bugs.

440
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,234
Joe:
I can't get over
HP's touch screen.

441
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,321
Gordon:
Good to see you.
Yeah, it's a fad...

442
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,656
- Donna: Oh, look, look, look.
- Gordon: ...guaranteed.

443
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,658
-<i> ( crowd clapping ) </i>
- High-density floppy disks.

444
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,576
Oh, someone's<i> hot.</i>

445
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,996
- Cameron:
Let's check it out.
- Gordon: Why?

446
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,497
They'll be down at our booth
in, like, 60 seconds.

447
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,627
And so I ask you,

448
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,129
what is the point
of a revolution

449
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,341
if you have to sell
your car to afford it?

450
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,177
<i>Now, this isn't</i>
<i>"The Jetsons."</i>

451
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,222
<i>We're not selling you</i>

452
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,766
<i>We're trying to give you</i>
<i>the simplest product</i>

<i>A bigger monitor?</i>
<i>Our fonts adjust automatically.</i>

456
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,237
<i>Of course, we think</i>
<i>they're just fine as is.</i>

- Get off him!
- Donna, come on.

00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,335
Donna, let's go,
come on.

473
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,716
Okay, okay.

474
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,676
Payback's a bitch.

475
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,022
But they copied our machine.
They need schematics for that.

476
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,024
This is corporate espionage.
I need to know

477
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,276
what was compromised
and the extent of the damage.

478
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,069
- Gordon: Out.
- Cameron: What?

479
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,071
I never brought
anything to T.I.

480
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,449
There were phone calls.
Maybe he overheard--

481
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,535
or-- or that--
the fax you sent
to the hotel.

482
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,371
Are you sleeping
with him?

483
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,206
Answer the question.

484
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,293
- Are you sleeping
with him?
- No.

485
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,378
I kissed him, once.

486
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,589
Yeah, you kissed him
and not the other
way around?

487
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,341
Yeah, Gordon.
Yeah, I kissed him.

488
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,595
And for two and a half seconds,
I felt better than I've felt
in two years.

489
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,388
Christ, Donna,
you're a child.

490
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,307
There was nothing
childish about it.

491
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,517
- I wanted him,
and there were reasons.
- Donna, he--

492
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,436
- Donna--
- There were
you-and-me reasons

493
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,439
because you can't pretend
we were on some moonlit
carriage ride.

494
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,732
He used you!
He used you!

495
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,692
At least he encouraged me
and rewarded me.

496
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,820
You believe that?
You're blind, Donna.

497
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,989
You never even saw
what he was doing!

498
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,409
And you never even picked me up
out of a hole in the ground.

499
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:45,038
I lifted you up so many times.
I carried you and the kids.

500
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,584
And I was tired and miserable
and you didn't give a shit.

501
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,255
It wasn't an affair,
but it should've been.

502
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,049
All right. Go on, then.
You've made your decision.

503
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,260
- Oh, my God.
- You go down
to the front desk

504
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,595
and you ask
for his suite number!

505
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,054
I'm sure he'll
make room for you!

506
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,307
Like you didn't pick
the Giant over me

507
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,891
every second
of every single day.

508
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,060
Oh, my God, Donna.
Donna, you're a cliché.

509
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,979
Both of you.
Just a cheap rip-off

510
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,106
of something
that we built together.

511
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,275
- I would go, but it's
all ruined for me now,
- Yeah? Go.

512
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,943
- because that's
what you want.
- Go.

513
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,446
You want to be right
more than you want me.

514
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,448
You know what, Donna?
Maybe your parents
were right about me.

515
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,451
I'm just a
small-minded, petty,
resentful little tyrant.

516
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:26,955
You know, part-time
alcoholic, full-time
failure as a father!

517
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,582
But I knew what I had
with you, Donna.

518
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,001
And I never
stopped trying
to live up to that.

519
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:35,172
To you, Donna.
To you, I never,
ever gave up.

520
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,593

521

522
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,778
( sighs )
They changed their mind.

523
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,660
Our dynamic OS, our design--
they don't care.

524
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,037
They want
a station wagon.

525
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:15,045
The Slingshot's faster,
it's cheaper.

526
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,381
So we're dead.

527
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,514
Did you
hear that, Gordon?

528
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,017
They'll be in stores
by Christmas.

I know how painful
this must be.

But when
two paths converge,

535
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,750
intentionally or not,

536
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,461

Let's skip the "Two Roads
in a Wood" bullshit.
You're not Robert Frost.

541
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:52,851
You're pawnshop hacks
selling my dream under
a cheap plastic mask.

542
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,894
( chuckles )
I heard you were touchy.

543
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,940
That LCD screen,
where did you find it,
a Taiwanese barge?

544
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:03,362
Apologize, pull your product,
and I'll consider not suing.

545
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,698
There's no upside
to litigation, Joe.

546
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,658
By the time you get
in front of a jury,

547
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,493
we'll be on our
third generation.

548
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,453
And good luck persuading 
them that your BIOS

549
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,914
is such a nobler copy
of IBM's than ours.

550
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,168
We got there first.
Deal with it.

551
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,170
You must be proud.

552
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,632
Hiring our sloppy seconds,
pumping a competitor's wife.

553
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,634
That's one way
to do business.

554
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,219
The opportunity
presented itself.

555
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,137
No laws were broken.

556
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,972
Are you telling me
you'd do different?

557
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,560
- I'd be more careful.
- Oh, please.

558
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,605
Your SVP's under indictment,
you're sleeping with
your lead coder,

559
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,859
not to mention that little
incident back in Armonk.

560
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,819
Let me see if
I get this right.

561
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,613
Following an argument
with your father,

562
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,866
you ruptured
a water main,

563
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,577
flooded an entire
IBM data center?

564
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,952
Whew.

565
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,705
Daddy musta made you
pretty angry.

566
00:31:54,747 --> 00:32:00,168
Oh, yeah.
I did my homework
on you, all right.

567
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,295
You got quite the fan club 
back there in New York.

568
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,091
You recognize that number?

569
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,260
That's your boss,
Nathan Cardiff.

570
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,179
Now, you're gonna go upstairs,
you're gonna call him,

571
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:15,768
and tell him that I offered
you $2 million in Slingshot
stock for the Giant.

572
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,853
<i>Which is more</i>
<i>than you're gonna get</i>
<i>in the settlement.</i>

573
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,897
Why would we sell
to you?

574
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,274
'Cause that covers
your R&amp;D nut, gets
you out whole

575
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,860
as opposed to losing
everything for nothing.

576
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,195
- Then you strip us
for parts?
- ( sighs )

577
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,740
There's some good ideas
in that machine, Joe.

578
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:33,201
Your mistake was
falling in love with that
precious query-based interface.

579
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:37,831
Maybe it's ahead of its time,
but it's a memory hog.

580
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,792
We'll never sell to you.

581
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,543
After we sign
with ComputerLand,
it's academic.

582
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,796
Take it or not.

583
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:48,550
Oh, and tell Donna
it wasn't personal.

584
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,305
I feel sorry for you,
Mr. Whitmarsh.

585
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,973
You cheated yourself.

586
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,893
You'll never create
anything of your own.

587
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,938
Well, neither will you.

588
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,483
You seem to have forgotten,
we're in the compatible
business.

589
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,944
You tried to be good.

590
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,529
We just had
to be good enough.

591
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,795

594
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,539

five bucks for it.

596
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,876
How are we doing?

597
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,045
Fine, I guess.

598
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:11,299
I stripped out
the daughter board and all
the extraneous memory.

599
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,183
Where's
my operating system?

600
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,360
Wally lent me MS-DOS.

601
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,572
It'll beat the Slingshot
on speed and be a hundred
bucks cheaper.

602
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,323
You took it out.

603
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,200
Everything that
made it unique.

604
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,871
We had a problem.
Now we have a product.

605
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,586
You can't
let him do this.

606
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,007
Joe.

607
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,675
Tell him.

608
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,011
He's wrong.
This is wrong.

609
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,852
It's what's right
for the machine.

610
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,031
( gasping )

611
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,908
Oh, my God--

612
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,500
- It's called survival.
- Don't speak to me.

613
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,795
It's an existential choice.
Sell none of the original

614
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,380
- or a million of these.
- And no one will remember
a single one.

615
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,550
- It's still our machine.
- It's empty.

616
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,594
We need to demo
by the end of business
or we're dead.

617
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,345
- I need you there.
- Bullshit!

618
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,391
Okay, how about...
I want you there?

619
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,602
<i>I want you with me.</i>

620
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,983
Then put it back in.

621
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,498
You'll see that whether
it's Multiplan or Lotus 1-2-3,

622
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,083
the Giant runs all
your business software

623
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,293
on one compact,
compatible package.

624
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,962
<i>What happens when</i>
<i>the workday ends?</i>

625
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,047
<i>You pack up your Giant,</i>
<i>bring it home,</i>

626
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,716
<i>and in five minutes,</i>
<i>fire up "Rocky's Boots"</i>
<i>for the kids.</i>

( scattered laughter )

630
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:27,477
Whether it's composing music
or cobbling together
your family finances,

631
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,604
the Giant is there.

632
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,983
It's not just a part
of your family, it's
a part of your life.

633
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,496
Um, are there
any questions?

634
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,916
I heard it asks you stuff,
like it learns your name.

635
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,334
Gordon:
<i>Where'd you hear that?</i>

636
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,919
<i>It sounds a little</i>
<i>"Buck Rogers."</i>

637
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,421
So, it's fast and it
runs all the software,

638
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,967
but besides portability,
I'm not seeing a lot
that's special.

639
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,635
Nothing unique.

640
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,971
"Unique."
Interesting word choice.

641
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,973
What are you
really asking for?

642
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,852
<i>Something special?</i>
<i>Give me something warm,</i>
<i>something fuzzy?</i>

643
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,520
This is a machine.

644
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,938
It's not your friend,
it's your employee.

645
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,606
It works for you.

646
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,067
And the way it should be
evaluated is thus--

647
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,944
"How well and how fast
does it do the things I ask?"

648
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,198
Answer-- "Instantly."
Anything less is a waste
of your time.

649
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,825
"What is the margin of error?"
Answer-- "Zero."

650
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,994
Anything more
and you've failed.

651
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,538
<i>Here's another word,</i>
<i>one that's infinitely</i>
<i>more important</i>

"speed."

00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,003
Let's cut through the bullshit
and act like adults.

654
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,797

<i>and this machine</i>

671
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,858
It got a lot easier
after we fired you.

672
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,860
Spectators:
Ooh...!

673
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:46,116
What about IBM?
I heard they might be
coming out with a portable.

674
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,617
I'm sick of hearing
about IBM.

675
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,244
IBM scraps more projects
in a day

676
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,037
than any of us
attempt in a year.

677
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,956
<i>What</i> we<i> did</i>
<i>was harder.</i>

678
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,834
We took one idea
all the way...

679
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,962
and it cost us.

680
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,547
It cost us people.

681
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,717
But the evidence
of that cost is here.

682
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,720
It's in the damn metal.

( applause )

685
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,756
Joe, why,
I gotta tell ya.

686
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,801
Any man who can speed up
a machine by that much
that fast

687
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,221
has got a very
bright future in PCs.

688
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,681
Thank you, Dennis.

689
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:56,353
How does 60,000 units
at, say, $900 a pop sound?

690
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,980
It's a start.

691
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:03,276
Okay... 70,000.

692
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,611
We'll negotiate
tomorrow.

693
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,749
( pops )

694
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,528
It's warm.
Needs ice.

695
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,328
I'll get it.

699

Computer voice:

700
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,594
( crowd gasping )

701
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,449
You okay, man?
What's the matter?

702
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,289
It speaks.
