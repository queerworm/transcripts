CQ, CQ, is this
frequency in use?

00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,019
CQ, is anybody out there?

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,649
Hello?
This is KC4L.

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,943
Can anybody hear me?

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,532
What's that?

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,909
Uh, it's a radio
that I made.

10
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,704
What does CQ mean?

11
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,958
It's what you say
when you're looking for other
people who've made radios.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,084
Comes from the French
word<i> sécurité,</i>

13
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,005
which means safety
or security.

14
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,048
You can hear it when
you say "secu, secu."

15
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,887
Did you want something?

16
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,930
I wanted to say good night.

17
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,933
Oh, God, Lump,
I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,019
Did you brush your teeth?

19
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,064
Okay, I'll be out there
in just a second, okay?

20
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:11,112
Daddy's in the closet
looking for people
with radios.

21
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,574
Okay.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,119
( blows )

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,123
( scoffs )
That thing made it
from Texas

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,125
and the KitchenAid
is still in storage?

25
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,962
Are you really
gonna stand there and try
and pass yourself off

26
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,130
as someone who ever
used that mixer?

27
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,717
Are you sure
this is the best place
for all this?

28
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,761
No, I'm pretty sure
it's the worst place
for it,

29
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,137
but since the place
that I was gonna use
isn't available,

30
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,141
- I'm making do.
- Okay, sorry.

31
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,560
Have you found anyone?

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,980
No, the connection sucks.

33
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,147
Is it the antenna, maybe?

34
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,525
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Could be.</i>

35
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,612
Or it could be
that all the guys that were
out there when I was a kid

36
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,989
are too busy
running companies
to have time for hams.

37
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,908
Yeah, or they moved online.

38
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,120
There must be some
new kids out there.

39
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,165

CQ, CQ, for shit's sake,
is anybody out there?

42
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,765
Hey, Cameron and I decided to
have a weekly project meeting

43
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,643
to streamline
the SwapMeet integration

44
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,229
and we thought that you'd
be a valuable addition.

45
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,774
Yeah, sure.

46
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,191
If you want me there.

47
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,944
Yeah, we do.

48
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:39,200
Do you want me there
because you think I might
have something to contribute

49
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,203
or because you want me
to feel like I have
something to do?

50
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,206
How about just because
I respect your opinion?

51
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,793
'Cause I just don't
want you to feel like
I can't self-start

52
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,210
because I absolutely can.

53
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,006
No, of course you can,
but the coders look to you.

54
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,843
I feel like you could be
a valuable liaison.

55
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,928
And I want you there.

56
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,808
Okay. Yeah.
I'll be there.

57
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,768
Good.

58
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,858
You know I don't
really have a choice.

- Ryan, welcome.

00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,326
I didn't realize it was,
you know, gonna be such
a big party, so I...

73
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,956
That was very thoughtful.
Thank you.

74

This is really

I'm glad you like it.

Yeah, it took me
a while to find it.

I don't really know
the city that well.

83
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,815
I grew up
in Burlingame.

84
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,817
It's not far.

85
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:21,696
Just-- yeah, we didn't
really get to come to
the city that much.

86
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,287
I really
do like it, though.
I mean, look at it.

You sure do have
a lot of friends, huh?

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,381
I wouldn't really call
these people my friends.

91

00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,404
Or are you still

99
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,033
Oh, no, I got out
of there a while ago.

100
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,994
I'm in Los Altos
now with a bunch
of college buddies.

101
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,872
They're really jealous
that I'm working for you.

102
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,708
I was telling them
about how the office

106
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,928

I just love to code.

107
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,472
I can't tell you
how curious I am

108
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,641

the guys would have me back.

145
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,118
Well, the guys will deal
if I tell them to.

146
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,249
What do you say?

147
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,965
Okay.

148
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,850
You just made
a really dumb call.

149
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,647
I told her you weren't home.
She wouldn't leave.

150
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,692
She was here
for like an hour

151
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,652

Dude, where've you been?

153
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,657

and passed out at Joe's.

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,827
Oh, wow.
Hey, was that fun?

155

I don't know
what the hell it was.

156
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,666
Okay, that makes
absolutely zero sense.

157
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,586
Well, we thought it made
a lot of sense.

158
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,670
Well, you guys are
the heads of the company.

159
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,132
Of course you should
be the ones to bring
the offer over to SwapMeet.

160
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,675
Gordon, it's a formality.
Bos can do it.

161
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,095
It's not a formality.
It's about perception.

162
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,889
And the people that
you're buying, especially since
they're coming to work here,

163
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,142
need to view you and Donna
as the ones in charge.

164
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,145
Gordon, we've already met
with them a gazillion
times, okay?

165
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,897
We've had lunch.
We've had drinks.
They know we're in charge.

166
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,691
God, if I had it
my way, they'd just
send us the disks

167
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,527

call it a day.

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,529
Okay, look,
it's dropping off
an envelope.

You don't mind
doing it, do you?

170
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,700
Do you want to make it
sound any less important?

171
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,621
- I would be happy to do it.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,705
Okay, so the whole company
is gonna bend over backwards

173
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,583
because she can't
get over herself.

174
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,919
No, I don't think
it's a good idea for us
to go either.

175
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,131
The heads of the company
don't tender the initial offer.

176
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,967
<i>We wait for the counter</i>
<i>and only get involved</i>

177
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,636
<i>when the real</i>
<i>negotiations begin.</i>

178
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,762
That's how you show them
who's in charge.

179
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,722
Mm, okay.

180
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,017
Okay, up next,

181
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,811
how are we doing
on the speed of
the background graphics?

182
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,564
Well, we'll never get under
half a second at 2,400 baud.

183
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,731
We're gonna need
to use Huffman,

184
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,233
or even better,
Lempel-Ziv compressions

185
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,776
so we're not sending
all the bits through.

186
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,196
Okay, since when are we
doing a graduate seminar

187
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,781
<i>on information theory?</i>
<i>Our guys can't handle that.</i>

188
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,618
No, no, no.
That's smart not sending
all the bits through.

189
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,745
We preload the most common
backgrounds on the diskettes
users already have

190
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,581
and just send
the catalog numbers.

191
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,543
Okay, so just send
the index to the scene.

192
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,003
Okay, that's good.
I see that.

193
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,130
That's good, right?
No complex coding.

194
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,216
Well, you'll have a limited
set of images

195
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,052
and the user
will get tired of waiting
for the same-old same-old,

196
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,762
but, yeah, it's great
if that's what you guys
want to do. Great.

197
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,930
- Great.
- Great.

198
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,850
So we will
preload the data.
Thank you.

199
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,769
<i>And now for what I thought</i>
<i>was going to be</i>

200
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,813
the only unpleasant topic
for this meeting--

201
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,940
evidently I was wrong--

202
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,775
replacing Ryan.

203
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,236
Oh, I went by
his house this morning.

204
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,030
He is not open
to coming back.

205
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,577
What?

206
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,162
You didn't harm him
in any way, did you?

207
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,623
No, he was fine
when I left.

208
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,791
<i>I mean, he's a moron,</i>
<i>but he was ambulatory.</i>

209
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,587
You know, I want
you looking for people
at that class tonight.

210
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,255
Oh, God.

211
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,632
Hey, look,
I'm already covering
for you at this lunch.

212
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>And don't complain about</i>
<i>being asked for by name</i>

213
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,843
<i>by the next generation</i>
<i>of coding talent.</i>

214
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,887
<i>You should be</i>
<i>very flattered.</i>

215
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,806
Even if I find someone,
it's gonna take forever
to catch them up.

216
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,850
Ryan really understood the guts
of the neighborhood code.

217
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,810
And if we're gonna build out
SwapMeet alongside it,

218
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,812
<i>we need someone</i>
<i>who really gets it.</i>

219
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:56,735
Well, uh, who wrote
the original code
for that section?

220
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,283
- Tom did.
- Great, which one is Tom?

221
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,619
None of them.
He didn't make the trip.

222
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,870
- Why not?
- He just didn't.

223
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,831
- Okay, was it
a money thing or...
- No.

224
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,751
- Well, then get him back.
- No.

225
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,835
If you can't get Ryan,
getting the programmer

226
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,671
who originated the code
makes the most sense.

227
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,132
Look, Gordon, I said no.
Can we just drop it, please?

228
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,841
Why am I even
in this meeting

229
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,843
if no one's gonna listen
to a word I have to say?

230
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,846
We are listening.
We're simply disagreeing.

231
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,682
No, Donna,
you're disagreeing.

232
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,225
Because you are opining
on subjects

233
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,102
about which you do not have
all the information.

234
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,272
I am opining on subjects
on which I am fully informed.

235
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,107
No, Gordon,
you really aren't.

236
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,277
A lot happened while you
were off doing other things.

237
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,862
Oh, damn it, Donna.

238
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,742
You know what?
I screwed her once, okay?
Jesus.

239
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,830
Excuse me.

240
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,085
What the hell was that?

241
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,754
Please, like Cameron
doesn't already know.

242
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,963
The walls in our place
are so goddamn thin,

243
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,923
she can hear it
every time I take a shit.

244
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,884
I invite you
to a meeting and this
is the way you behave?

245
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,887
- What is wrong with you?
- I am sick and tired
of being punished.

246
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,889
Okay? I agreed to the move.
I bought the mainframe.

247
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,267
I fixed the mainframe.
I've let her live with us.

248
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,728
Everything I've been asked
to do, I've done.

249
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,147
I shut you down because Tom
is Cameron's ex-boyfriend.

250
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,898
So what?

251
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,818
<i>So it's obviously</i>
<i>a sensitive subject</i>

252
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,402
and I was trying
to steer you away from it.

253
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,780
So you thought my infidelity
would be a wonderful topic?

254
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,905
<i>You</i> brought that up.

255
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,907
While I was off
doing other things.

256
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,909
Like everybody in this room
doesn't know what that means.

257
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,953
- I was talking
about the mainframe.
- No, you weren't.

258
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,373
No, you weren't
and don't pretend
that you were.

259
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,918
It's always there, Donna.
Every time I look at you,
it's always there.

260
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,337
This is not something
to discuss here.

261
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,921
We'll talk about it
at home.

262
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,884
What's the difference?

263
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,968
Man on radio:
<i>Hello?</i>

264
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,929
<i>Greetings from the ether.</i>

265
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,267
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

266
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,938
I'm right here.
Can you hear me?

267
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,984
I'm right here.
This is KC4L, over.

268
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,695
<i>Hello?</i>

269
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,697
I'm right here.
Can you hear me?

270
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,991
Right this way.

271
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,993
First time
dining with us?

272
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,663
No.
I wish.

273
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,999
- Oh, hello there.
- No, don't get up.

274
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,043
- ( both chuckle )
- Oh.

275
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,003
Sorry.

276
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,798
Where's Cameron?

277
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,175
Oh, she is preparing
a guest lecture she
is giving tonight.

278
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,177
She's so sorry
that she couldn't
make it.

279
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,888
We'll have to
soldier on without her.

280
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,014
May I get you something
from the bar?

281
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,935
You know what?
I will have a gin
and tonic, please.

282
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,895
- Very well.
- Thank you.

283
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,271
Nice choice.

284
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,068
( laughs )
And what's your excuse?

285
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,904
I just like
drinking at lunch.

286
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,322
( laughs )

287
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,742
So, the official SwapMeet
offer is happening today?

288
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,286
Yes, John Bosworth
is taking it over later
this afternoon.

289
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,121
- Exciting.
- Yeah.

290
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,039
Will he go over
with you and Cameron?

291
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,334
No, he's our advance man.

292
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,796
He's taking care of it.

293
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,927
- Whenever the ladies are ready.
- The usual, Jason.

294
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,762
Chicken paillard.

295
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,055
It's thin, crispy,
and somehow still juicy.

296
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,223
I don't know
how they do it.

297
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,893
Uh, you know,
I will try the...

298
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,354
mushroom ris--
risotto.

299
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,067
You still wear
your ring, huh?

300
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,070
- For work.
- Mmm.

301
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,240
Men can't seem
to handle the idea
that sexual availability

302
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,869
and business acumen
can exist in the same body.

303
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,078
It simplifies things.

304
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,708
So when you say John Bosworth
is your advance man,

305
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,959
what exactly do you mean?

00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,336
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

339
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,006
I, uh, finally got
the ham working.

340
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:56,385
You know
I was always planning
on moving out, right?

341
00:18:56,427 --> 00:19:00,264
Like, this is not exactly
an ideal setup for me either.

342
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,810
It's not like
I like listening
to you take a dump.

343
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,189
You know, just for
the record, Donna never
said anything to me

344
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,026
about whatever problems
you guys were having.

345
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,403
She would never do that.

346
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,867
<i>( door closes )</i>

347
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,869
<i>( scraping )</i>

348
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,208
( German accent )
I have the letters
of transit.

349
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,210
A very important
document.

350
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,379
- It's the SwapMeet offer.
- Oh.

351
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,423
And Godspeed to you, sir.

352
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,426
How was lunch?

353
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,219
Extremely delightful.

354
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,221
I had risotto,

355
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,516
which is rice,
but not.

356
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,225
( laughs )

357
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,520
What else did you have?

358
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,523
I had a few--
several gin and tonics.

359
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:56,070
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm great.

360
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,282
Fine.

361
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,329
You know, my ex worked
those long-haul flights

362
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,915
and I was away on business
half the month.

363
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,543
<i>We barely spent</i>
<i>any time together.</i>

364
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:15,131
Still managed to get
on each other's last nerve.

365
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,341
I don't know how
you and Gordon do it.

366
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,930
Well, apparently,
not so well.

367
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,438
I think your husband's
all kind of tricky,

368
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,525
but, by God,
I know he cares.

369
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,111
I can feel it
from 50 paces.

370
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:42,282
There are men
out there who've done
a lot worse, Donna.

371
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,035
Yeah.

372
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,582
But it's hard
to turn that
into good news.

373
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,604
I want you to come
to this meeting.

374
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,648
- Right now?
- Right now.

375
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,415
<i>( door opens )</i>

376
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,169
You must be
John Bosworth.

377
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,590
Diane Gould.
I'll be your backup
this afternoon.

378
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,342
Oh, pleasure
to meet you.

379
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,427
Didn't know
I needed backup.

380
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,263
Well, you don't,
of course.

381
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,058
I just knew you'd be here
and I thought it would be
a nice way for us to meet.

382
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,643
Sure.

383
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,356
Seems a little quiet.

384
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,234
Yeah, I noticed that.

385
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,278
And the parking lot
seemed empty.

386
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,612
Yeah, I noticed
that, too.

387
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,448
Maybe we should
get a tour.

388
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,660
We're giving them 600,000
of my hard-earned dollars

389
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,369
and a piece
of your company.

390
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,289
That earns us
a poke around.

391
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,041
Doug Sheridan.
So nice to meet you.

392
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,542
- Hey.
- This is my partner
Craig Bausch.

393
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,377
Craig, John Bosworth.

394
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,630
Nice to finally put
some faces to the names.

395
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,674
This here is Diane Gould,
our partner.

396
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,425
Of course.
Pleasure to finally
meet you.

397
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,056
This is quite
the delivery committee.

398
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:33,393
While we're here,
we thought we should
have a look around.

399
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,189
Oh, of course.

400
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,481
Sure.

401
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,692
Welcome.
( chuckles )

402
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,406
We pulled a pretty epic
all-nighter last night,

403
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,366
so we're kind of down
to bare bones.

404
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,372
But you should be able
to get a sense of the place.

405
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,051
( sips )

406
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,094
I know I speak
for all the investors

407
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,513
when I say
how delighted we are

408
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:14,060
with the growth
of the individual user base.

409
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,145
That tastes terrible.

410
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:20,233
- I mean, that tastes
just like... ugh.
- ( men laughing )

411
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,735
Look, we may not have
seen it at the start,

412
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,445
but the people
have spoken

413
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,741
and you truly are

414
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,245
the thought leader
that we always
knew you were.

415
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,704
Huh?

416
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,546
So 2.0.

417
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,176
When are we doing this?

418
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:50,763
Well, production can
have disks ready to ship
in a matter of months.

419
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,765
Man:<i> The question is,</i>
<i>is it better to start charging</i>
<i>at the beginning of the year?</i>

420
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,475
Man #2:
<i>Or do we flip the switch</i>
<i>in September</i>

421
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,478
<i>and hope that the charges</i>
<i>get lost in the list of</i>
<i>back-to-school expenses?</i>

422
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,564
What do you think?

423
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:06,320
When do you think
we should start charging
for the new user version?

424
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,445
Well, I--

425
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,492
I mean, I thought
you weren't going to charge.

426
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,704
( laughs )
Hold on, I'm--

427
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,498
I'm sorry,
what's your name again?

428
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,127
- Ryan.
-<i> Ryan, right.</i>

429
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,669
Of course
we're gonna charge.

430
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,214
I mean, what's the point
of developing a user base

431
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,507
<i>if we don't turn them</i>
<i>into paying customers</i>
<i>at some point?</i>

432
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,511
And my gut is telling me
sooner rather than later.

433
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,139
What a surprise.

434
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,225
I see a spigot
and I want to turn it on.

435
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,227
Man #2:
<i>The focus groups</i>
<i>we've done indicate</i>

436
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,439
<i>we'll be losing</i>
<i>30-40% of our users</i>
<i>whenever we do it.</i>

437
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,690
It's just a matter
of how big you want to grow
the base beforehand.

438
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,818
Man:<i> And, unfortunately,</i>
<i>people are going to hate you</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>

439
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,446
<i>Sorry,</i>
<i>couldn't be helped.</i>

440
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,614
Well, it's been a long time
since I cared what people
thought about me.

441
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,491
My gut says...

442
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,537
September.

443
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,539
<i>What's our price point?</i>

444
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,209
Man #2:
<i>If we can stay below</i>
<i>the $15 threshold,</i>

445
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,378
<i>consumers seem willing</i>
<i>to shine it on.</i>

446
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,922
Man:
<i>Oof, that sounds awfully high.</i>
<i>Can't we keep it under 10?</i>

447
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,800
Man #2:
<i>No, the fact is for a one-time</i>
<i>annual expense of this kind--</i>

448
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,635
$14.95.

449
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,431
Yes. That.

450
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,183
That right there.
That--

451
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,559
that has my vote.
Yes, please.

452
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,188
What do you think?

453
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,570
Yeah, I-I guess

454
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,199
$14.95 sounds good.

455
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,537
Well, if Ryan's
on board, huh?

456
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,501
So that's it.

457
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,254
Come September,
we start charging $14.95.

458
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,555
<i>( door opens )</i>

459
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,642
- You okay?
- Yeah, of course.

460
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,522
Look, I know
it tastes bad,

461
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,482
but this is
the right move.

462
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,526
- Mmm.
- I promise you,
all right?

463
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,573

Gordon:
<i>Can I come in?</i>

466
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,599
What is it?

467
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,645
Hey, I--

468
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,816
I just wanted to say
that even though it does
make perfect sense

469
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,694
to hire the person
who wrote that code,

470
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:57,324
I didn't realize that
that was someone that
you had a thing with.

471
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:01,287
So if I seemed insensitive
earlier today,

472
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,620
I'm sorry.

473
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,623
Okay.

474
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,380
And just--
Tom and I wrote
that code together.

475
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:14,383
Just, you know, FYI.

476
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,675
It wasn't all him.

477
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,677
Okay.

478
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,475
And I hope I didn't
make you feel

479
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,726
like you living here
is the cause of all
of our problems.

480
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,313
You're not gonna
start talking to me
about your wife, are you?

481
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,897
No, I'm not.

482
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,857
Just 'cause I really--
I don't think I can
handle that.

483
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,860
Look,
I still don't think

484
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,696
that we should all be living
under the same roof,

485
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,951
but obviously there's
something else going on.

486
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,579
That's all
I wanted to say.

487
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,623
So when are you guys
moving out?

488
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,375
( both laugh )

489
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,880
Jesus, you got
every goddamn mug
in the house in here.

490
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,633
No, I don't.

491
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,718
All right.
Hey, good luck tonight.

492
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,554
You, too.

493
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,020
I just don't understand
how the wind gets into
Candlestick.

494
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,022
- I mean, there are walls.
-<i> ( Doug laughs )</i>

495
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,899
Wind's a Giants fan.
It does what it
needs to do.

496
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,361
It beats the hell
out of sweating bullets
in Arlington.

497
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,112
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm a Houston fan.

498
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,365
Air conditioning
like God intended it.

499
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,408
Where was God
when Nolan Ryan

500
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,410
left that one
hanging for Will Clark
the other day?

501
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,997
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

502
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,749
You want to get that?

503
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,751
No, it's fine.

504
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,420

the extra attention,

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,845
but don't you fellas
have a receptionist?

508
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,764
Of course we do.
She's at lunch.

509
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,434
- Late lunch.
- We do a lot of business
with the East Coast.

510
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,563
So we work through
lunch a lot and then we,
you know, have it later.

511
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,814
Can somebody answer
the goddamn phone?

512
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,775
Everybody's really
spent from last night.
It was a real ball-breaker.

513
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,777
Yeah.

514
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,738
Sure.

515
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,869
What'd you do that for?

516
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,787
Oh, I'm not
comfortable with it.

517
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,789
No, it was a figure
that was arrived at

518
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,084
when we were operating
with less than current
information.

519
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,961
The value
of our company is in our
intellectual property,

520
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,796
our loyal customers,
it's not out there.

521
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,798
No, it sure
as hell isn't.
Come on.

522
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,467
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

523
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,678
Oh, we need
to reassess.

524
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,514
Mr. Bosworth,
I assure you the company
you're bidding on

525
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,807
is a lean, mean
version of itself.

526
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,769
Oh, I'd say
it's a lean, mean version
worth about 400K.

527
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,732
400,000 sounds like
a good place to start.

528
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,067
No, it sounds
like a good place
to finish, son.

529
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,986
If you can find someone
willing to pay north of 350,
you should go for it.

530
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,698
- Wait, he just said 400.
- Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake.

531
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,784
- 325, how's that sound?
-<i> ( phone ringing )</i>

532
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,832
We just saved you
$250,000.

533
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,917
I'd think
you'd be happier.

534
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,836
I am happy, very.

535
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,838
I'm just
a little surprised

536
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,840
by how completely
off-book you went.

537
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,719
I thought this was
supposed to be handshakes
and how do you dos.

538
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,764
You see an opportunity,
you take it.

539
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,474
That's the sport of it.

540
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,523
It could have gone
the other way.

541
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,818
But it didn't.

542
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,950
<i>( engine starts )</i>

543
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,237
- ( knocks )
- Mr. MacMillan?

544
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,995
Uh, I just wanted
to say that--

545
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,914
that I don't think you should
charge for the user version.

546
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,584
Why didn't you say that
in the meeting?

547
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,795
I've been here
for, what, a week

548
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,921
and you plunk me down
in some senior staff meeting.

549
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,216
What was I supposed to say?
I just agreed with
everyone else.

550
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,764
But that's not right
because it's not
what I think.

551
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,851
I'm sorry you couldn't
keep up in the meeting.

552
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,104
You made a promise
to people that you
wouldn't charge them.

553
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,816
I didn't promise
that I wouldn't ever
charge them.

554
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,108
Of course you did.

555
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,944
You said freedom
from fear is a right

556
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,613
and you shouldn't
have to pay for it.

557
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,824
And in a perfect world
that would be true,

558
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,618
but it's not the world
we live in.

559
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,788
- Then why'd you say it?
- Because I believe it.

560
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,670
But I've got a board
and investors

561
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:05,173
and I've got people
to answer to.

562
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,760
But you're ruining
the product.

563
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,803
I am the product.

564
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,931
I know.

What do you want?

00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,321
You gonna tell me
I'm a horrible person?
Go ahead.

What I'd really
like to say is--

595
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,125
is thank you.

596
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,212
Really?

597
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,172
For what?

598
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,133
Everything,
I guess.

599
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,472
How could I have
risen from the ashes

600
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,265
if you hadn't burned
it all to the ground?

601

Is that why you stole
my best coder?

602
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:51,066
Who, Ryan?
Come on.

No, actually,
he's incredibly talented.

605
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,866
Do you want him back?

606
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,831
What are you doing here?
Did you follow me here?

607
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,501
No, Cam, I don't have
time to follow you.

608
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,880

00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,423

611
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,929
Why is that funny?

612
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,890
Because it's a lie.

613
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,226
Well, maybe I got tired
of being told

614
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,228
I was just a salesman
who couldn't code.

615
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,230
Okay.

616
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,942

I know you got this
whole humble Zen master

623
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,921
but come on.

624
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,339
Save it.

625
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,093
I'm not buying it.

You don't have
to buy it, Cam.

628
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,937

How were they
last night?

633
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,509
I didn't see them.

634
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,303
They were in their room
when I got home and gone
before I left this morning.

635
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,305
It was quiet.

636
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,183
Yeah, that's not always
a good sign.

637
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,475
Well, it's better
than screaming.

638
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,937
I've heard quiet
make you beg for screaming.

00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,283
Hey.

642
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:13,166
I want to apologize
for my outburst yesterday.

643
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,961
<i>It was totally</i>
<i>inappropriate.</i>

644
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,006
And it shouldn't
have happened.

645
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,342
So if I made anyone
feel uncomfortable,

646
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,970
then I'm sorry.

647
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,683
Well, that little speech
made me very uncomfortable.

648
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,146
- I'm kidding.
- It never happened.

649
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,647
- Come on.
- What?

650
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,565
-<i> It so clearly did.</i>
-<i> It's a thing you say.</i>

651
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,652
Okay, look, we don't have
to discuss this ad nauseam,

652
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,446
but we thought
saying nothing
seemed equally stupid.

653
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,364
So we're saying something.

654
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,366
We are aware that bringing
a marriage into the workplace

655
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,410
is complicated
and we're doing
the best we can, okay?

656
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,370
Now, can we try to get
back to where we were?

657
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,372
Okay, great.

658
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,542
The big Ryan-shaped hole.

659
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,212
Did you find
any prospects last night?

660
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,257
No, but I decided
we don't need anyone.

661
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,259
- Of course we do.
- No.

662
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,343
Not if I do it.

663
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,307
Oh, I don't know.
I feel like you're
already spread pretty thin.

664
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,268
No, he was right.
Getting the person
who originated the code

665
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,061
makes the most sense.
That's me.

666
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,646
Well, but you should
have some help.

667
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,648
We just bought a company.
Maybe one of them can help.

668
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,027
No! Look, I'd just have to
explain everything to them.

669
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,237
<i>It makes double</i>
<i>the work for me.</i>

670
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,033
All right, if you think
you can handle it.

671
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,617
Yes, I can.

672
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,411
Okay, so we got a call--

673
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,580
You got to be kidding me.
You're moving on?

674
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,459
Yes.
Did you have something
you wanted to say?

675
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:44,341
No. No, no, go ahead.
It's your meeting.

676
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,595
- We got a call--
- She can't do it herself.

677
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,431
The company spends
a third of its time
waiting for her as it is.

678
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,517
He's not wrong.
You could do a bit
more delegating.

679
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,104
I do, just not when it's
something that I think
is truly foundational.

680
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,315
But you think
that everything
is foundational.

681
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,317
Look, if she says
she can handle it,
she can handle it.

682
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,652
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

683
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,529
Gordon, what is
your argument?

684
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:10,242
You're just
sinking the company
by taking on all these--

685
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,285
- No, she's not
sinking anything.
- Can we please just focus?

686
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,413
( overlapping arguing )

687
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,298
I want you
to pack up your stuff.

688
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,429
Starting tomorrow,
we'll be working
out of my place.

689
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,641
If we're not charging
for 2.0,

690
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,103
we've got to find
a new income stream.

691
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,523
Don't smile.
We might fail.
