00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,729
Man:
<i>Mr. MacMillan.</i>

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,733
Mr. MacMillan.

3
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,946
We need to ask you
a few questions.

4
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,575
<i>( police radio chatter )</i>

5
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,286
Man #2:
<i>...pack 'em up and label it.</i>

6
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,413
Do you have any
additional computers?

7
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,124
You mean, do I own
another computer? No.

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,086
Do I have access
to other computers?
Sure, so do you.

9
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,088
You can go to your library,

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,089
you can go to
your friend's house--

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>Write down</i>
<i>all the locations</i>

12
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,719
of computers
you have access to.

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,931
<i>( radio chatter continues )</i>

14
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,432
Have at it.
There's nothing there.

15
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,936
Yeah, that's what I said
when they came for me, too.

16
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,490
What the hell is that?

17
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,076
Oh, kid,
you've never seen
a packet sniffer?

18
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,038
Meet your worst enemy.

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,875
( beeping )

20
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,752
( continues beeping )

21
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,973
Sai:
<i>Where you going?</i>

22
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,059
I'm just, um--

23
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,268
I'm just gonna go
grab a bite to eat.

24
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,269
They told you not to leave.

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,478
What was that thing

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,523
that they were shoving
into the phone jack?

27
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:51,862
Sai:
<i>You-- you didn't</i>
<i>do anything, right?</i>

28
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,030
Hey, what should I tell them
if they come back?

29
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,115
Just don't say anything.

30
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,496
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

31
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,154
Joe:
<i>Have a good morning.</i>

32
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,991
<i>( whistling )</i>

33
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,577
( stops whistling )

34
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:45,749
Hey, what the hell
was that?

35
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,751
The FBI.

36
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,210
God damn it, Joe.

37
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,587
They're looking for Ryan.

38
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,841
He, uh--
he did a stupid thing.

39
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,385
He-- he released
the source code

40
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,305
for MacMillan Utility's
anti-virus software online.

41
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,599
-<i> You've got to be kidding.</i>
- All of it.

42
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,476
It's a violation
of the CFAA--

43
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,227
They think you did it.

44
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,604
I know what
you're gonna say.

45
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,814
It's what everyone's
gonna say, Joe.

46
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,440
- Please, listen.
- Stop, stop!

47
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,650
Stop.

48
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,779
Look me in the eye

49
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,739
and tell me you had nothing
to do with the leak.

50
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,787
I had nothing
to do with it.

51
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,420
All right.
Then I'm all in.

52
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,175
<i>All right?</i>
<i>We'll figure</i>
<i>this out together.</i>

53
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,262
While it's true
that the pace

54
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,473
of Mutiny's growth
has slowed somewhat,

55
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,643
multi-platform expansion
is not the only solution.

56
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,437
Rather,
Mutiny is employing
a number of strategies

57
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,607
which, taken together,
promise a second quarter
earnings uptick--

58
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,609
Stop. You can't say that.

59
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,277
It's not
in the prospectus.

60
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,362
Well, I have
to say something.

61
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,656
They can see
that that user numbers
are plateauing.

62
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,241
The company's laudable
record of growth

63
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,283
is fully documented
in the prospectus.

64
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,869
That sounds like
I'm hiding something.

65
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,412
You can't hype the stock.

66
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,288
Well, what's the point
of doing this road show

67
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,208
if all I can say
is read the prospectus?

68
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,500
So, they read
the prospectus.

69
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,586
Well, there are things
that I want to clarify.

70
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,296
The prospectus should be
a living document.

71
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,465
- Bosworth:<i> Well, it's not.</i>
- Diana:<i> Sorry, SEC rules.</i>

72
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,300
Look,
you're doing great.

73
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,302
The whole point
of coming to these
smaller firms first

74
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,888
is so that you can
work out the kinks

75
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,681
before we take it
to the big guns in
Boston and New York.

76
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,934
I thought it went
pretty well last night,
don't you think?

77
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,310
No, I think they were
all underwhelmed.

78
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,772
Hey, I read the room
as I see it.

79
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,356
You did fine.

80
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,775
<i>Fortunately,</i>
<i>there isn't much</i>

81
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,194
<i>investment capital</i>
<i>for tech in Denver.</i>

82
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,779
<i>Look, everybody</i>
<i>hates this process,</i>

83
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,280
<i>and everybody</i>
<i>gets through it.</i>

84
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,324
<i>So, come on,</i>
<i>tell me about</i>

85
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,659
<i>Mutiny's founder</i>
<i>Cameron Howe.</i>

86
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,661
I understand
she's no longer
with the company.

87
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,333
Cameron is one
of the most talented coders
in Silicon Valley.

88
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,586
She gave her heart
and soul to Mutiny,

89
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,922
- and her spirit
is still very much--
- Bosworth:<i> Oh, please!</i>

90
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,882
It sounds like
you're eulogizing
the family dog.

91
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,259
That's what we agreed
I'd say.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,676
It doesn't pass
the smell test.

93
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,511
Donna:
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>a better suggestion?</i>

94
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,346
Something with a faint hint
of truth to it, maybe?

95
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,349
Oh, so I should say
that she's a temperamental
narcissist

96
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,811
with self-destructive
tendencies who doesn't
work with others?

97
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,854
Well, at least
it sounds like you mean it
when you say that.

98
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm sorry that
there's no pretty way
to talk about this.

99
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,358
But just a reminder,
you voted for it, too.

100
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,361
Yes, I did, under duress,
as I recall.

101
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,239
Nobody wanted it.
It's just what happened.

102
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,364
And yet, here we are.

103
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,367
Look, I'm just trying
to help out here.

104
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,662
Unless you just want me
to go get the coffee?

105
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,374
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

106

107
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,133
Hey.

108
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,386
Are you leaving already?

109
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,388
Tom:
<i>Yeah, I figured I'd wait</i>
<i>till my second week</i>

110
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,473
<i>till I start</i>
<i>showing up late.</i>

111
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,392
- Oh.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

112
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,395
Hey, can you,
uh, run to the store,

113
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,398
get some candy for
the trick or treaters?

114
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,695
- Mmm.
- Cam, they're kids,
they want candy,

115
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,157
and you should try
to get out a little bit.

116
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,495
- Can you do it?
-<i> Mmm, no.</i>

117
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,372
Oh.

118
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,334
- I love you.
- Love you.

119
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,378

I don't know
what to say, Mitch.

147
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

148
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,369
I was too invested
in this project to
just walk away.

149
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,414
Listen, Joe, we like you.

150
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,623
You believed
in the network.

151
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,417
Hell, you walked away
from your own company

152
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,835
<i>when your board</i>
<i>voted against us.</i>

153
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,878
But Ryan--
let's face it,

154
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,547
Ryan doesn't sound
like a guy who's gonna
keep his mouth shut.

155
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,716
<i>His next call</i>
<i>could be to my boss.</i>

156
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,551
Ryan would
never do that.

157
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,429
Well, regardless,
we can't work with someone

158
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,555
who's being investigated
for computer fraud,

159
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,558
who blatantly violated
major legislation that
went into effect this year.

160
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,394
Joe didn't do
anything wrong.

161
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,812
Mitch:
<i>I'm not saying he did.</i>

162
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,564
<i>But until we find the person</i>
<i>who is responsible,</i>

163
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,567
<i>you two need to stay away</i>
<i>from each other.</i>

164
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,113
And this network contract
is frozen.

165
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,671
How did Ryan know
that we were working
together?

166
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,801
Hmm? Down to the details
of my negotiations
with Cisco?

167
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,804
He must be reading
our emails.

168
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,557
He built the network.
He knows how to get inside
better than anyone.

169

No, there must be
another way.

Did you hear the tape?

173
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,403
- The contract's frozen.
- I can't do that to him.

174
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,862
Oh, Christ, Joe.

175
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,325
He's my friend.

176

I was your friend.

Me, too.

It sounds like you got
a lot of problems.

there's no such thing

The feds are calling me

214
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,404
I bet, probably because
every chat room online

215
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,197
thinks you're some kind of
8-bit Robin Hood.

216
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,491
I didn't make
Ryan do this.

217
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,412
Yeah, I know.

218
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,830
It's hard to make
Ryan do anything.

If you could send out
a kind of flare--

You were right.

246

00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,157
I'm sick, Joe.

348
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,203
- I'm sick.
- What-- what the hell
does that mean?

349
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,205
-<i> ( telephone rings )</i>
- Hang on real quick.

350
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,916
- Gordon?
-<i> Hang on, I gotta get this.</i>

351
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,417
- Leave it.
-<i> Look, it could be Donna.</i>

352
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,752
<i>Just give me two secs.</i>

353
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,378
<i>Hello?</i>

354
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,676
<i>Now?</i>
<i>No, I got the kids. I--</i>

355
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,390
All right, look, I'll--
I'll figure something out.

356
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,642
Yep.

357
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,686
Yep.

358
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,270
( sighs )
That was Mutiny.

359
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,439
They need me to--
it doesn't--

360
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,274
we need to talk,
all right?

361
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,276
<i>But right now I need</i>
<i>a favor from you.</i>

362
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,236
You're not going anywhere
until you tell me
what's going on.

363
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,238
-<i> Look, I can't.</i>
<i>I gotta go--</i>
- Sit down.

364
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,242
Sit.

365
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,737
Ryan.

366
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,492
Ryan. Ryan!

367
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,452
How'd you find me?

368
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,205
Uh...

369
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,707
I put up
the "Are You Safe"
board on Mutiny.

370
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,291
You logged in remotely
through an FTP connection--

371
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,377
You wrote a software trap

372
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,297
alerting you to my activity,
including the university
mainlines.

373
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,676
( groans )
I should have
thought about that.

374
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:04,263
Hey, I'm not here
to bust you or anything.

375
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,308
Joe wants to help you.

376
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,269
I-- I want to help you.

377
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,313
Hey, you--

378
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,316
Ryan, you can't live off
Dr Pepper and Cheez-Its
forever.

379
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,277
Believe me, I've tried.

380
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,657
Where have you been?

381
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,326
<i>I crashed with friends</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

382
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,329
The cops,
they keep tracking me.

383
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,831
Uh, how did you know?

384
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,833
I could feel it.

385
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,835
Somebody was following me.

386
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,336
And-- and my buddy,

387
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,589
he kept getting
these weird phone calls.

388
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,299
Yeah.

389
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,678
And, um,

390
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,140
I took the bus
down to San Diego

391
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:50,684
and, um, stayed
with my cousin.

392
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,394
He's a wannabe tech guy
and a total asshole.

393
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,438
He said he wouldn't
rat me out, but I--

394
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,108
I knew he would,
you know?

395
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,281
I hitched a ride
back to SF.

396
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,242
I needed a cup of coffee
and a computer, so...

397
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,702
I blended in right here.

398
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,704
It's like I'm invisible.

399
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,500
Joe probably hates me now.

400
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,669
Oh, no.
( scoffs )

401
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,420
No, and even
if he is pissed,

402
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,256
he'll get over it.

403
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,383
Joe can be...

404
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,386
surprisingly forgiving.

405
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,346
Maybe it's because he's screwed
up his own life so many times.

406
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,855
Hey, if you don't want me
to tell him where you are,
I won't.

407
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:41,568
But he really just wants
to walk you through
your options.

408
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,612
He's worried about you.

409
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,572
<i>And look,</i>

410
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,407
<i>I found you,</i>

411
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,245
<i>so... you can't hide</i>
<i>forever.</i>

412
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,835
I thought you were gonna
bring the girlies along.

413
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,670
No.

414
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,755
Found a great new sitter.

415
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,133
Really flexible.

416
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:12,432
Well, thanks for
bailing me out.

417
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,435
I didn't want to worry Donna
on the eve of her big day.

418
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,438
<i>Yeah.</i>

419
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,398
What you gonna do
with your share of the IPO?

420
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,442
I don't know.

421
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,444
I guess I should
make some plans.

422
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,613
You know, they're saying
it's gonna open at 15.

423
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,116
Ha, 15.

424
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,328
Who'd have thunk it?

425
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,538
<i>What are you gonna do</i>
<i>with your share?</i>

426
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,583
Oh, stash away some
for a college fund
type of thing

427
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,294
for my grandson.

428
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,256
That is, if that's
all right with James.

429
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,465
Yeah?
Why wouldn't it be?

430
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,633
<i>Well...</i>

431
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,555
you never know
what might hit a nerve.

432
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,099
All right.

433
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,186
You talk to Cam?

434
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,313
No.

435
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,814
You?

436
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,275
Nope.

437
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,402
But...

438
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,195
she'll be a millionaire
tomorrow.

439
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,821
She can't be
too sorry about that.

440
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:13,451
- Hey, here's
to going public.
- To going public.

441
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,788
-<i> ( car door opens )</i>
- Tom:<i> Yeah, you bet.</i>
<i>Thanks so much.</i>

442
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,497
-<i> ( car door closes )</i>
- Man:<i> No problem.</i>

443
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,457
<i>( car departs )</i>

444
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,295
Well, look at you.

445
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,380
Waiting for me
at the front door.

446
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:25,631
Mm-hmm.

447
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:29,509
We're one apron away
from a lifelong fantasy.

448
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,304
( laughing )

449
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,849
I have a proposition
for you.

450
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,435
Can I show you
something first?

451
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,728
- Mmm, yeah.
- Okay, good.

452
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,653
- Okay.
- Okay.

453
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,738
It's called
the "Spacebike Chronicles."

454
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,158
- Okay.
- This is our hero.

455
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,492
She doesn't have a name.

456
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,954
And she's just
cruising through

457
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,540
the post-apocalyptic future
on her bad-ass space-bike.

458
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,170
And all she needs to survive
are gas, candy,

459
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,672
and the occasional
long, hot shower.

460
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,883
So, she travels
to planets and asteroids

461
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,509
and space stations
trying to get what she needs.

462
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:15,014
Oh! And when she arrives
at a new place,

463
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,391
she tries to win
one of the five senses.

464
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,726
Each one arms her
with a different power.

465
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,189
A sense of proportion
allows her to change size.

466
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,026
A sense of humor
allows her to fend off
most forms of attack.

467
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:31,989
A sense of self
allows her to appear
and disappear.

468
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,741
Okay, well,
decency doesn't give her
an actual power,

469
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,037
but it makes it possible
for her to win

470
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,164
the rarest sense of all--

471
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,166
common sense,

472
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,960
which lets her see
everything more clearly.

473
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,879
It's beautiful.

474
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,381
( laughs )

475
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,174
How do you win?

476
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,261
You don't, you just
get to keep playing.

477
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,059
I love it.

478
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,399
Come here.
Come here, come up.

479
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:15,199
Do you want to hear,
uh, the proposition?

480
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,117
Mm-hmm.

481
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,998
How do you feel
about moving to Japan?

482
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,420
( laughs )
What?

483
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,963
They want to move me up.

484
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,217
All the way to Tokyo.

485
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,475
That's perfect.

486
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,396
- Really?
- Yeah.

487
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,751
Ryan?

488
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,669
Why'd you lie to me?

489
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,671
Why'd you cut me out?

490
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,924
<i>I didn't do either</i>
<i>of those things.</i>

491
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,553
- I planned to bring you in.
-<i> Bring me in?</i>

492
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,472
<i>I created the whole thing.</i>

493
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,432
I put the code out there,

494
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,933
really made it free
when you didn't have

495
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,977
the guts
to do it yourself.

496
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,813
And I've been
out there ever since,
defending your name,

497
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,273
telling the real story.

498
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,650
I've been worried
about you.

499
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,033
Hey, sit down.

500
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,538
I know you're angry,
just admit it.

501
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,956
<i>I'm not.</i>

502
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,708
I wish you hadn't upset
the NSFNET deal.

503
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,170
You've made things
much harder.

504
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,921
But that
is less important

505
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,257
than knowing
that you're okay.

506
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,553
<i>As I see it,</i>

507
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,805
<i>you've got two options.</i>

508
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:06,185
You can turn yourself in
and own up to what you did...

509
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,397
or you can run.

510
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,734
Either way,

511
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,778
I will help you.

512
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,201
How?

513
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,162
If you run,

514
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,914
I'll give you 50 grand,
drive you to the bus station

515
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,251
and you can disappear.

516
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,755
But the network
you and I created

517
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,216
will disappear, too.

518
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,842
No, I don't want that.

519
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,516
I put in a call
to my lawyer.

520
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,434
If you turn yourself in,

521
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,020
you'll serve no more
than a year or two.

522
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,897
No, I can't.

523
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,357
<i>Listen to me.</i>

524
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,402
<i>A hacker</i>
<i>that violates the CFAA</i>

525
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,778
<i>can't touch a computer</i>
<i>for at least five years--</i>

526
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,031
Five years?
That's insane!

527
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,784
And that's
an impossible choice!

528
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,370
It's better than
10 years in prison.

529
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,788
That's the maximum.

530
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,374
I know it sounds
like a long time,

531
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,167
but you're young,
and it's like you told me,

532
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,294
<i>destruction leads</i>
<i>to transformation.</i>

533
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:18,591
<i>You've got plenty of time</i>
<i>to reinvent yourself.</i>

534
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,385
Yeah, that's what
I want to do.

535
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,887
Start again with you,
like when you first hired me.

536
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,806
We sat right here
making shit up,

537
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,392
writing ideas
on the board.

538
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,772
Okay, all right.

539
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,943
Fine.

540
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,153
Let's say I--

541
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,531
I do what you say

542
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,324
and I serve my time.

543
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,287
Tell me we can
still work together.

544
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,959
That's not possible.

545
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,296
But you would have done
the same thing.

546
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,131
You're a master
at this kind of move.

547
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,840
It's classic
Joe MacMillan.

548
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,135
I can't work with
Joe MacMillan anymore.

549
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,803
( chair clatters )

550
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,938
Fine.

551
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,482
I'll do this
with or without you.

552
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,191
I hope you do.

553
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,821
You're a hypocrite
and you always have been.

554
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,377
You don't have to
decide tonight.

555
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,007
I want you to sleep here

556
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,301
and we can talk more
in the morning.

557
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,220
<i>But you need</i>
<i>some rest, Ryan.</i>

558
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,851
I'll get some sheets
and we can make up the sofa.

559
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,317
( sighs )

560
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,910
Where would madam
like the tray?

561
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,163
Oh, uh,
on the bed, please.

562
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:38,938
Will there be
anything else?

563
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,899
No, thank you.

564
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,407
-<i> ( knocks )</i>
- Diane:<i> Donna?</i>

565
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,117
How'd you sleep?

566
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,953
Oh, horribly,
but I didn't
really mind.

567
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,121
The sheets
were so comfortable.

568
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,040
Have you eaten breakfast?

569
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,376
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>
<i>I don't do breakfast</i>
<i>when I'm nervous.</i>

570
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,960
I do.

571
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,128
I'm gonna be on TV

572
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,922
and then my company's
going public.

573
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,131
You're gonna be great.

574
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,050
You always say that.

575
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,552
No, you are.

576
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,928
You're gonna be great.

577
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,932
<i>( Diane laughs )</i>

578
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,186
So, just look directly
into it like it's a person.

579
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,979
Lynda will be able
to see you.

580
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,690
Her voice will come
into your earpiece.

581
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,609
There will be a bit
of a sound delay.

582
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,402
Any questions?

583
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,615
Five away.

584
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,123
All right,
come on, guys.

585
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,958
I wanna go
back to bed.

586
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,168
I know, but we gotta
get up and watch Mommy.

587
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,003
All right?
It's her big day.

588
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,547
I'll make you guys
some breakfast

589
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,383
in just
a little bit, okay?

590
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,928
All right, you guys
get on the couch.

591
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,901
<i>( TV playing )</i>

592
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,319
- Come on, hop up.
- ( groans )

593
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,446
Gotta make
some room for Daddy.

594
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,949
Lynda:
<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to "Financial Watch AM."</i>

595
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,992
<i>This morning we have</i>
<i>with us Donna Clark,</i>

596
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,161
<i>CEO of Mutiny,</i>
<i>a trailblazer</i>

597
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,580
in the brave new world
of online shopping.

598
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,040
- Welcome, Donna.
- Look, it's Mommy.

599
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,542
Lynda:
<i>Thanks to people</i>
<i>like our guest,</i>

600
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,085
<i>for the 25 million</i>
<i>Americans</i>

601
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,045
<i>who own</i>
<i>personal computers,</i>

602
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,048
<i>Christmas shopping</i>
<i>is just a keystroke away.</i>

603
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,050
-<i> So, Donna...</i>
- Haley:<i> She looks so pretty.</i>

604
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,970
<i>a woman who founded</i>
<i>a tech company.</i>

605
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,054
<i>You're something</i>
<i>of an anomaly, aren't you?</i>

606
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,056
Well, actually,
Mutiny was founded

607
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,058
by my former partner,
Cameron Howe.

608
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,227
<i>Ah, I see.</i>
<i>And where is he?</i>

609
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,063
Uh,<i> she</i> is no longer
with the company.

610
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,065
<i>So, it was founded</i>
<i>by a woman?</i>

611
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,275
Yes.

612
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,444
Lynda:
<i>So, how does it work,</i>

613
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,071
<i>this new e-tail phenomenon?</i>

614
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,073
It's very simple, really.

615
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,159
Most home computers
are connected

616
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,077
to something
called a modem.

617
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,955
That's a device
which uses--

618
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,915
<i>Oh, dear,</i>
<i>it's sounding complicated.</i>

619
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,542
It isn't, really--

620
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,419
<i>Bottom line--</i>
<i>can I buy my shoes with it?</i>

621
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,964
Yes, absolutely.

622
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,925
<i>We're in partnership</i>
<i>with several retailers and--</i>

623
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,052
Lynda:
<i>Finally, something</i>
<i>about computers</i>

624
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,345
to get excited about.

625
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,098
<i>So, how exactly</i>
<i>would I buy my shoes?</i>

626
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,101
Donna:
<i>Well, you would log on</i>
<i>to Mutiny and from the home--</i>

627
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,437
We intercepted
the ticker feed
from phone lines.

628
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,898
Going into a bank.

629
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,941
And then rerouted
to the office modem.

630
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,442
- Ah!
- Yeah.

631
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,152
Well, that sounds
entirely legal.

632
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,905
Sure.

633
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,114
Okay, for the record
I had no prior knowledge
of this plan.

634
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,992
- ( laughter )
- Shit.

635
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,577
Oh, come on.
Rookie move, son.

636
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,537
What are you doing?
Sailboat?

637
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,497
Don't spend your money
before you've made it.

638
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,124
- Coder:<i> What a dweeb!</i>
- ( coders laughing )

639
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,836
Okay, look.
So, the companies debuting
today come out first.

640
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,462
Lev:
<i>How many are there?</i>

641
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,215
I don't know.

642
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,967
- Oh, here we go.
Here we go.
- Hey, look at that.

643
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,011
Bodie:
<i>Money, money, money.</i>

644
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,021
Okay, here we go.

645
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:15,739
Okay, it's a little lower
than we expected.

646
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,616
Just breathe.

647
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,670
( all sighing )

648
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,599

649
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,732
Joanie:
Can we call Mommy yet?

650
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:54,193
Uh, I think we're gonna
wait a little.

651
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,719
Do you wanna know?

652
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,559
Just... tell me
if it's good or bad.

653
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,655
( sighs )

654
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,408
I know
it's a morale blow.

655
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,911
I get it.

656
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,246
But it doesn't mean
that the stock
is worthless.

657
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,749
It's just not worth
what we thought.

658
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,961
It could be
the pace of our growth.

659
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,505
It could be
a Commodore issue.

660
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:59,258
They had
a horrible quarter.

661
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,427
Or just a calendar thing.
There are all sorts
of schools of--

662
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,472
Can I, um--
can I have a minute?

<i>( knocking continues )</i>

667
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,307
Mr. MacMillan,
we need to come in.

668
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,850
What's this about?

669
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,811
Was Ryan Ray
in your apartment
last night?

670
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,272
Yeah.

671
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,689
But he's gone now.

672
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,817
I don't know where he is.

673
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,486
<i>Sir, why don't</i>
<i>you sit down?</i>

674
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,348
<i>( distant sirens wailing )</i>

675
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,168
Gordon:
<i>Look, Joe,</i>

676
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,378
<i>how many times</i>
<i>are you going to read that?</i>

677
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,425
He wrote it right here

678
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,386
while I was sleeping.

679
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,984
I can't profit from this.

680
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,280
No.

681
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,075
No, it was your idea.

682
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,410
Okay? I'll--
I'll wait for you.

683
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,537
You know? I'll see
if I can stall things.

684
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,124
<i>Yeah, you shouldn't</i>
<i>want to work with me.</i>

685
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,505
<i>The night I was--</i>

God, I don't know
what I was saying.

689
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,225
<i>Look, that's--</i>

690
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,435
<i>that's not why.</i>

Jesus Christ.

692
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,444
I was trying to help him.

693
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,866
What are you gonna do?

694
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,119
I don't know.

695
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,082
I can't keep having
this conversation.

696
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,878
I'm done.

697
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,396
Hey, Gordon.

698
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,485
I'm sorry.

699
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,674
Are you sure you don't
want to postpone?

700
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,926
I don't know
if there's a funeral.

701
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,886
No, let's go.

702
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,321
Are you sure?
'Cause we can
change our flight.

703
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,365
Tom, I'm fine.

704
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,573
Okay?

705
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,327
I'm ready to leave
this place.

706
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,551
You know...

707
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,013
( sighs )

708
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,598
God, maybe...

709
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,353
there will be some things
that they won't have

710
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,355
- in Japan.
- Yeah?

711
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,482
Yeah, maybe I should

712
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,567
go to the store
and just...

713
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,571
make sure that we have

714
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,532
everything we need.

715
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,368
Yeah, of course.
Good idea.

716
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,618
You want me
to go with you?

717
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,080
No, I'll go.

718
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,581
Okay.

719
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,088
Ryan's voice:
<i>"I, Ryan Ray, released</i>

720
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,549

721
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,551
<i>I acted alone.</i>

722
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,137
<i>No one helped me,</i>
<i>and no one told me to do it.</i>

723
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:21,891
<i>I did this because</i>
<i>'security' is a myth.</i>

724
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,103
<i>Contrary to what you might</i>
<i>have heard, my friends,</i>

725
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,565
<i>you are not safe.</i>

726
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,649
<i>Safety is a story.</i>

727
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,485
<i>It's something</i>
<i>we teach our children</i>

728
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,653
<i>so they can sleep at night,</i>

729
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,573
<i>but we know it's not real.</i>

730
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,869
<i>Beware,</i>
<i>baffled humans.</i>

731
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:45,498
<i>Beware of false prophets</i>
<i>who will sell you</i>
<i>a fake future,</i>

732
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,126
<i>of bad teachers,</i>
<i>corrupt leaders</i>

733
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,295

734
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,631
<i>Beware of cops</i>

735
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,345
<i>the kind that rob</i>
<i>your dreams.</i>

736
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,055
<i>But most of all,</i>

737
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:04,100
<i>beware of each other,</i>

738
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,852

739
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,150
<i>The world is going</i>

740
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,487
<i>There's something</i>
<i>on the horizon.</i>

741
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,490
<i>A massive connectivity.</i>

742
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,659
<i>The barriers between us</i>
<i>will disappear,</i>

743
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,078
<i>and we're not ready.</i>

744
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,081
<i>We'll hurt each other</i>
<i>in new ways.</i>

745
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,667
<i>We'll sell and be sold.</i>

746
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,710
<i>We'll expose</i>
<i>our most tender selves,</i>

747
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,547
<i>only to be mocked</i>
<i>and destroyed.</i>

748
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,343
<i>We'll be so vulnerable,</i>

749
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,553
<i>and we'll pay the price.</i>

750
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,096
<i>We won't be able</i>
<i>to pretend</i>

751
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,682
<i>that we can protect</i>
<i>ourselves anymore.</i>

752
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,811
<i>It's a huge danger,</i>

753
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,022
<i>a gigantic risk,</i>

754
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,774
<i>but it's worth it.</i>

755
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,236
<i>If only we can learn</i>
<i>to take care of each other.</i>

756
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,614
<i>Then this awesome,</i>
<i>destructive new connection</i>

757
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:02,492
<i>won't isolate us.</i>

758
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:05,702
<i>It won't leave us</i>
<i>in the end so...</i>

759
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,704
<i>totally alone.</i>

760
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,459
<i>( seagulls screeching )</i>

761
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,723
