1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,468
( both exhale )

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,892
I finally
thought of something

3
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,478
I like more about
Dallas than Austin.

4
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,899
You're in Dallas.

5
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,612
<i>( button clicks )</i>

6
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,176
-<i> ( coffee brewing ) </i>
- Son of a bitch.

7
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,151
Joe:<i> Sara?</i>
<i>Everything all right?</i>

8
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,529
<i>( Sara dials phone )</i>

9
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,866
<i>Caroline,</i>
<i>it's Sara.</i>

10
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,159
<i>Put my dad on the phone.</i>

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,746
<i>Got your little present</i>
<i>in the mail.</i>

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,664
<i>The one from your lawyers.</i>

13
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>Even if I wanted to,</i>
<i>this is how you do it?</i>

14
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,168
<i>You don't even</i>
<i>ask me about it?</i>

15
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,671
<i>No, this isn't</i>
<i>up for debate.</i>

16
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,130
<i>Yeah, no kidding, Dad.</i>

17
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,593
<i>You know, I was the one</i>
<i>who went through it.</i>

18
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,970
<i>So when are you gonna stop</i>
<i>treating me like this?</i>

19
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,513
<i>I'm not a kid.</i>

20
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:40,059
<i>Just stop.</i>
<i>Stop now.</i>

21
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:44,813
<i>Because I trust him</i>
<i>and I want him to know that.</i>

22
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,816
<i>He deserves better.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna do that to him.</i>

23
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,651
Cameron:
<i>I know, the network's fast,</i>

24
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,152
<i>but we don't have anything</i>
<i>that maximizes it.</i>

25
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:55,032
We have this... racecar
and it's just idling.

26
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,659
Well, we have a race track.
What we need is a racecar.

27
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,037
You're really annoying.

28
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,663
But this will be
our racecar.

29
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,541
Two player,
first person game,

30
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,752
online,
over dial-up.

31
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,045
We still have to figure out
what it's about.

32
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,671
What it's about.
Yeah, we will.

33
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,298
Between the two of us.

34
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,133
And our crack team.

35
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,843
( laughs )

36
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,595
( Russian accent )
It will be excellent game,

37
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,681
like steal the bread
from the weak little boy.

38
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,977
It is good
impersonation I do.

39
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,604
( Russian accent )
If you were impersonating

40
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,816
the cyborg sent
to kill Sarah Connor.

41
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,567
( normal voice )
Oh, damn, that came out today.

42
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,902
- ( normal voice ) Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, I want to go pick it up.

43
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,779
My friend at Suncoast
was gonna reserve a copy.

44
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,823
What time is it?

45
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,867
I gotta go.
( groans )

46
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,332
If I'm late,
my boss is gonna
have my ass.

47
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,208
Oh, she sounds like
such a bitch.

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,586
Oh, you have no idea.

49
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,090
( German accent )
Your clothes, give them
to me now.

50
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:56,217
- ( laughs )
- Stop with the impressions.

51
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,720
You, me, "Terminator,"
tonight.

52
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,972
( normal voice )
Okay.

53
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,892
Oh!

54
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,940
Hey.

55
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,358
- Mornin', sunshine.
- Ha.

56
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,068
You just headin' home?

57
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,277
Uh, just for a couple hours.

58
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,864
( laughs )
Attagirl.

59
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,616
Now get some shut-eye.
I'll make sure the place
doesn't burn down without you.

60
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,868
- All right.
- ( slaps car )

61
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,391
Hey, good morning.

62
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,977
Long night?
You want some coffee?

63
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,146
I kind of want a beer.
Is that bad?

64
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,899
Hell, no.
A long day at work,
I'd have two.

65
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,738
- Where are the girls?
- They're brushing their teeth.

66
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,908
( beer can hisses )

67
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,334
Oh, that is too good.

68
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,087
Everything going
okay over there?

69
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,922
Yeah, it's amazing.

70
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,216
You know, Community's
expanding so fast.

71
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,967
It's just a lot of work,
but it's work I want
to be doing.

72
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,178
- Mmm.
- Oh, shoot.

73
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,430
You know, we need to get
in touch with somebody over
at what's it called.

74
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,100
They haven't sent us
our first invoice and we
need to figure out billing.

75
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:30,229
Oh, well, I'm sure
they'll probably send
something over, you know?

76
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,731
Yeah, I just want to make sure
we get this deal in writing.

77
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,776
It seems almost
too good to be true.

78
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,695
Right, well,
I'll talk to him.

79
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,114
You know, you've got
enough on your plate.

80
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,032
You know, stuff you
actually want to be doing.

81
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,825
- Yeah--
- Oh, I wanted to talk
to you about this.

82
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,827
I've been thinking
about doing something

83
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,247
with this made-to-order
computer business.

84
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,124
Yeah, you should.

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,086
( spits )

86
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,421
Something wrong?

87
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:01,135
No, no, it just
went down the wrong pipe.

88
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,344
You know, I think
maybe with everything

89
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,806
that's gone down
with Sonaris and all,

90
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,058
it'd be better if I could
deal with them directly.

91
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,977
<i>You know Cameron.</i>
<i>If I can keep you out of it,</i>

92
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,897
maybe we can spare
ourselves her wrath.

93
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,233
Yeah, sure.
No problem.

94
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,902
Great, so we can set
something up soon?
This week?

95
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,403
Yeah.

96
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,075
You know what?
Actually the person

97
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,119
I've been dealing with
over there is Joe.

98
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,081
Ahem.

99
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,540
Joe who?

100
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,048
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

101
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,370
- Man:<i> Incoming! </i>
-<i> ( glass shatters )</i>

102
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,290
-<i> ( coders laughing ) </i>
- Oh, come on, now.

103
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,250
<i>( music playing</i>
<i>in background )</i>

104
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,835
Duck!

105
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,920
Gracious,
is that a pajama top?

106
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,589
- Well, what
is a pajama top, John?
- ( groans )

107
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,841
I mean, if you fall
asleep in that shirt,

108
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,926
does it become
a pajama top?

109
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,095
And then can it ever not be
a pajama top once it is--

110
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,889
I'm just askin'
when you bought it,
did it come with bottoms?

111
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,182
What constitutes bottoms?

112
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,142
Okay, forget I asked.

113
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,019
Yeah, it's cool,
but you know what
I'm gonna say.

114
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,604
Oh, come on.
Look, it's good guys
versus bad guys.

115
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,023
Yeah, but why
are they bad?

116
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,858
Why do we care?
What's the context?

117
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,610
Cont-- a roller coaster
doesn't have any context.

118
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,155
- Tom...
- What? No one gets off
Judge Roy Scream

119
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,574
talking about the story.
They talk about the experience.

120
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,868
- A roller coaster's
90 seconds long.
-<i> ( doorbell rings )</i>

121
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,706
You have to create
something here that's gonna
consume people for hours.

122
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,085
- You know I'm right.
- Cameron?

123
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,294
( imitates Terminator )
I'll be back.

124
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,879
( both laugh )

125
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,215
Oh, God. What?
What do you want?

126
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,175
As you know, I am
a long-standing Mutiny user,

127
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,635
so I trust
you'll give my input
the weight it is due.

128
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,138
- Okay, get on with it.
- Yesterday evening,
I was playing "Parallax."

129
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,932
Chapter eight,
challenge four.

130
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,225
- On the path...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

131
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,768
...I solved the riddle

132
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,937
and yet I wasn't able
to continue on.

133
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,647
Either this is a glitch
or an illogical piece
of in-game storytelling.

134
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,900
Whatever the case,
I would like like a refund
for that hour of usage.

135
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,236
You're not
getting shit, buddy.

136
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,780
We don't give refunds
for people who are too thick
to figure out the game,

137
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,033
and even if we did,
you haven't paid your bill
in two months,

138
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,327
so you're operating
on borrowed time as it is.

139
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,747
Now, if I were you,
I'd head back to
chapter eight

140
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,874
and maybe consider
my dwindling water reserves

141
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,711
and see where in the game
I could've replenished
my supply.

142
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,588
Oh!

143
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,173
Bye!

144
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:49,970
-<i> ( door opens, closes ) </i>
-<i> ( phone ringing )</i>

145
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,930
- Chet?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,015
But it just makes
no damn sense.

147
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,809
I want a cup of coffee--

148
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,728
look, cups are clear
across the kitchen, huh?

149
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,106
See?
Now where's the sugar?

150
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,233
Again, all the way
across the kitchen.

151
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,278
Come on, man.
I'm bouncing around
like a damn pinball.

152
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,281
Now, look, create a station.
One-stop, all your needs.

153
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,325
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,994
- Coffee?
- ( both laugh )

155
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,245
Oh, God.

156
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,331
Efficiency, son.
Time is money.

157
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,167
For-- get outta here.

158
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,626
You're amazing, Boz.

159
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,961
Hey, who was that
bothering you?

160
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,296
Huh? Oh, Chet.
He's a user.

161
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,839
He's just some
pain in the ass.

162
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,133
Hey, what about
vertical space?

163
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,136
We could have
these vertical tubes that
you climb up, you drop down...

164
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,138
Yeah, that's amazing.
But you know what
I'm gonna say--

165
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,848
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just check it out.

166
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,851
- Just check it out.
- Well, then, figure it out.

167
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,145
( sighs )

168
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,022
You lied to your wife.
That's not my problem.

169
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,858
Oh, but it is.
She's gonna tell
Cameron, all right?

170
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,943
They want a sit-down
with a representative
from Westgroup.

171
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,320
They want a formal
agreement in writing.

172
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,071
Look, you gotta make
this thing legitimate.

173
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,157
- That's not possible.
- Well, then, make it possible.

174
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,826
It's only been three weeks.
The whole plan was to amass
months of data.

175
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,911
- We don't have a choice.
- We've always got a choice.

176
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,332
I can kick Mutiny
off the network and go
to another online service.

177
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,043
You can, but you're
not going to

178
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,003
because we had
a deal, right, Joe?

179
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,421
<i>And you're gonna honor</i>
<i>that agreement</i>

180
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,797
because you're not
the reptilian son of a bitch

181
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,716
that everybody
says you are.

182
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,010
- You're a changed man.
-<i> This isn't what I wanted.</i>

183
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,762
If I tell Wheeler too early
and he doesn't go for it,
the network is done,

184
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,015
- Mutiny is done.
- Snap out of it, all right?

185
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,350
You're Joe MacMillan.
You could talk him into

186
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,018
jumping off a bridge
if you wanted to.

187
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,687
Just decide
to do it and do it.

188
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,439
<i>Look, I gotta go.</i>

189
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,692
- Just promise me
that you're gonna--
- Got it.

190
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,279
-<i> ( door opens, closes ) </i>
- ( sighs )

191
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,036
Ahem.

192
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,413
What's going on?

193
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,043
I want to emphasize
that I had no idea
about this,

194
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,170
and as soon as I found out,
I came straight here.

195
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,423
What?

196
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,927
Joe MacMillan is the person
running the network.

197
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,179
He's Gordon's contact
at the company.

198
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,307
I'm sorry?

199
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,892
Gordon helped him
set up time-sharing.

200
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,810
He insisted that Mutiny
get a good deal,

201
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,939
- and he didn't tell me--
- Stop.

202
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,441
You let Joe MacMillan
in the door?

203
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,733
I didn't do anything.

204
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,487
No, Gordon, again.

205
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,364
- I'm sorry, Donna,
but he doesn't work here.
-<i> I know.</i>

206
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,074
- This isn't his
to mess with.
-<i> I know. </i>

207
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,034
He wanted to make up
for crashing the network.

208
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,329
Huh.
What a way to apologize.

209
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,916
He felt terrible.
He wanted to fix it.

210
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,960
I know this isn't
any consolation,

211
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,380
but I sat across from Joe.
He seems... different.

212
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,132
Maybe he's changed.

213
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,099
Thank you
for your honesty.

214
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,810
If you don't mind, I'd like
a few moments to myself.

215
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,147
Okay.

216
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,404
-<i> ( Cameron screams ) </i>
-<i> ( loud clattering )</i>

217
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,787
Um, based on my
examination last time--

218
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,083
the symmetrical weakness
in your hands, the memory
and concentration tests,

219
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,920
your employment history,
um, exposure to lead solder,

220
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,006
and working with solvents--
I ordered the MRI.

221
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,883
I know you were
a little ambivalent
about the test,

222
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,302
but I am glad
that we sprung for it

223
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,095
because it really is
an amazing new tool.

224
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,849
According to the radiologists,
there are two areas,

225
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,811
very small,
that show signs of atrophy.

226
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,813
Atrophy?

227
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,857
Brain damage.

228
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,986
It's chronic toxic
encephalopathy.

229
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,072
- ( gasps )
- Now, given this
combination of clues,

230
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,907
it explains
your physical symptoms

231
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,035
and it likely accounts
for the psychological symptoms

232
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,870
you described
to me as well--

233
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,539
irritability
and the mood swings.

234
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,124
Yeah, how do I fix it?

235
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,918
I'm sorry to say
there is no treatment.

236
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,213
<i>Brain tissue</i>
<i>does not repair itself.</i>

237
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,549
<i>This will be</i>
<i>a permanent condition.</i>

238
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,178
( stammers )
But I feel fine.

239
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,514
What the hell's
gonna happen now?

240
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,434
Well, your symptoms
could likely progress.

241
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,479
- This could get worse?
- This was years of slow
accumulation

242
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,022
of these toxins
in your blood.

243
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,524
But in light of that,
the fact that

244
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,526
your symptoms
have accelerated

245
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,572
would indicate that
you likely haven't seen
the worst of this yet.

246
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,325
I am sorry, Gordon.

247
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,505
-<i> ( keyboard clacking ) </i>
-<i> ( music playing</i>
<i>in background )</i>

248
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,091
So, what's going on
with Cameron?

249
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,510
Do you remember
Joe MacMillan?

250
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,512
- Sure, Admiral Eyebrows.
- What?

251
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,389
That's what we called him.
You didn't call him that?

252
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,474
No, but I will now.

253
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,645
Anyway, turns out
he's the one who's
running the network.

254
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,273
That sucks.
She mutinied to get
away from that psycho.

255
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,650
Mm. Who are you
talking to, Lev?

256
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,194
Nobody.

257
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,072
It's none of your business.
It's just a friend.

258
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,532
Who you talking to, Lev?

259
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,576
It's just a guy I met
in one of the forums.

260
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,537
We've-- we've been talking.
He likes the Cure.

261
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,416
- You've been flirting.
- So?

262
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,462
Lev, this is good.
This is really good.

263
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,590
We're gonna make
a room where you can
meet people online.

264
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,966
- Meet?
- Yes.

265
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,384
- Like girls?
- Yes!

266
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,262
We'll do a personals room
where you meet

267
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,140
and then you go
into a private room,
like a date.

268
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,184
She got the idea from Lev
'cause he's been talking
to someone online.

269
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,395
- ( all laugh )
- Oh, great.

270
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,188
You see, I've been
living in the past,

271
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,357
taking a woman out to dinner
like we used to do.

272
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,110
- You got a date, Boz?
- Now, I'm not sure
why that news

273
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,237
is met with such
shock and disbelief.

274
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,281
Looks like you're talking
to a fella there, Lev.

275
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,451
Yeah.

276
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,120
Oh.
Yeah, okay.

277
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,623
No, so you're--

no, that's completely,
uh-- yeah.

- Okay, fine,
then you figure it out.

Joe:
<i>I've calculated the cost</i>

<i>of every barrel of oil</i>
<i>you pull out of the ground.</i>

325
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,337
It takes an awful lot of money
to make that first dollar.

326
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,300
Using your existing
mainframe for time-sharing,
there's no cost to you.

327
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,718
There's an ocean
of money out there

328
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,678
and you have already
drilled the wells.

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,388
People talk about
the computer revolution

330
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,848
as if it were
a thing of the past,

331
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,183
but I grew up
running around IBM.

332
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,185
This business
is in my blood,

333
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,437
and believe me
when I tell you,

334
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,815
the revolution hasn't
even started yet.

335
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,402
I think it sounds...

336
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,779
promising.

337
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,197
I thought you would.

338
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:34,327
That's why I did it
three weeks ago.

339
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,245
I retrofitted
the mainframe.

340
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,457
I sold the time
to an exciting company
called Mutiny.

341
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,542
In three weeks,
they've shown
steady growth

342
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,878
and will only
continue to expand.

343
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,215
This could be the moment
when Westgroup stops
digging in the past

344
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,218
<i>and starts</i>
<i>building the future.</i>

345
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,555
All you have to do...
is nothing.

346
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,224
Three weeks of data,
that's not much.

347
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,520
- The trend will continue.
- Maybe. Have a seat, Joe.

348
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:08,862
So, you did all this
behind my back.

349
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,571
That was quite a gamble.

350
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,325
You know, Westgroup
is a huge operation.

351
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,453
<i>However, one resource</i>
<i>sorely lacking</i>

352
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,498
in a company
of this size
is hunger.

353
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,208
<i>Everybody here</i>
<i>is fat and happy.</i>

354
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,626
<i>But you?</i>

355
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:30,216
You strike me
as the kind of guy
that isn't ever satisfied.

356
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,803
<i>You aren't happy,</i>
<i>and I can turn that</i>
<i>into money.</i>

357
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:37,390
I assume this takes you
out of Data Entry.

358
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,267
It would. I would be
the network administrator

359
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,479
managing
the sales of the time,
the hardware upkeep.

360
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,273
And I suppose a nice raise
comes along with a new title.

361
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,360
No raise.
Let me show you
that it works first.

362
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,696
Huh.

363
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,824
Sara knew
all about this, huh?

364
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,534
She's got
some poker face.

365
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,869
Yeah.

366
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,662
I just want
to have a meeting

367
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,874
with somebody from,
what was it? Mutiny?

368
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,292
<i>Let's have a sit-down</i>
<i>tomorrow night.</i>

369
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,504
<i>I'm flying up to Alaska</i>
<i>around 7:00, but we can</i>
<i>meet before then.</i>

370
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,673
Uh, you don't have to worry.
I can handle the client.

371
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,844
Oh, I'm not worried.
We'll meet tomorrow night.

372
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,221
I never go
into business with anyone

373
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,474
<i>without looking them</i>
<i>in the eye first.</i>

374
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,976
Cameron:
<i>Well, I want to kill him.</i>

375
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,395
I know you don't like Joe.
Neither do I.

376
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,314
I'd like to see him
punched in the balls
as much as anybody,

377
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,569
but he's a businessman,
and not a bad one.

378
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,321
Put together Giant,
got me onboard.

379
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,907
That box
was an abomination.

380
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,491
From a strictly
commercial standpoint,

381
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,286
pulling your operating system
was the right move.

382
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,374
That machine,
it meant a lot to me.

383
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,834
It wasn't art,
but it was sound business,

384
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,669
and one thing about Mutiny
is you got a whole lot

385
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,547
of the former,
not much of the latter.

386
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,467
Look, to top it all off,
you got Joe right where
you want him.

387
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,927
You kidding me?

388
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,472
He wants forgiveness.
He wants to do right by you.

389
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,436
I just feel like
we're part of some plan
that he has.

390
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,565
The only person I trust
to get an accurate read
on Joe MacMillan-- that's you.

391
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,275
You gotta look him
in the eye.

392
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,902
And if I don't like
what I see?

393
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,904
Then you kill him.

394
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,405

with the setup.

some of the hardware

that I lease the time

Donna works.

<i>I've set up a meeting</i>

He's looking forward

00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,542
- Me specifically?
- A representative
from Mutiny.

465
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,879
I thought you were
the obvious choice given
your hardware background.

466
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,923
And because
I'm not Cameron.

467
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,885
That would be a little awkward,
but that's not why I'm here.

468
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,097
Look, Joe,
it's not my company.
You need to deal with her.

469
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,893
I expect her
to be prepared

470
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,771

to be professional.

471
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,316
It's Mutiny's future
on the line here, too.

472
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,319

So, tell me,
how does someone get good
at something like that?

503
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,174
Uh...
( laughs )

504
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,051
How did Gretzky
get good at hockey?

505
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,387
- Practice.
- And?

506
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,722
And a whole lot
of God-given talent.

507
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,267
- It's your words, not mine.
- ( chuckles )

508
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,436
Here, let me show you.

509
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,984
I didn't make you
for a hockey fan.

510
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:12,071
- I like the fights.
- Hmm.

511
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,906
So this is
just a demo disk,

512
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,449
but it'll give you
some idea

513
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,368
of what our interface
looks like.

514
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,161
Okay.

515
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,372
- Gordon: How was school?
- Girls: Good.

516
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,332
Yeah?

517
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,209
You guys wanna
go have some fun
with your dad?

518
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,960
What do you mean?

519
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,338
I don't know.
You tell me.

520
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,341
We can do
anything you want.

521
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,884
Let's go to
Grandma and Grandpa's

522
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,428
- and play video games!
- Yeah!

523
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,138
You don't understand.
We could do anything.

524
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,807
We could go to the park,
we could go to the zoo,

525
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,269
we could go
to the movies,
you know?

526
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,730
You name it.
Huh?

527
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,233
Um, let's go to
Grandma and Grandpa's.

528
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,402
You guys were
just there yesterday.

529
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:55,072
Come on, be creative.
Anything you want, all right?

530
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,324
- Hi!
- Grandma!

531
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,368
- Grandma!
- You sure this is
all right, Susan?

532
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,495
Of course!
Mm.

533
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,248
I appreciate it.
You know, I asked them
where they wanted to go,

534
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,832
do whatever they want.

535
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,793
They are positively
obsessed

536
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,962
with this thing
Gary brought back
from his trip.

537
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,297
The Japs love him.

538
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,800
Gave him one of those
arcade game video things

539
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,093
you plug into your TV.

540
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,970
It's not being released
until the fall.

541
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,098
Hey, sweethearts,
what is that contraption
called?

542
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,434
- Girls:<i> A Nintendo! </i>
- Nintendo!

543
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:27,062
- Mm.
- It's a bunch of little men
fighting turtles or something.

544
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,983
I don't-- can't follow it.
I don't understand the appeal.

545
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,988
Um, can I offer you
a drink?

546
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,198
Sure.

547
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,493
- Thank you.
- Well, great.

548
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,375
I'm impressed.

549
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,503
So what about this guy?

550
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,006
You two know
each other from your stint
at Cardiff Electric, right?

551
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,593
Can you vouch for him?
He's marrying my daughter.

552
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,060
He's a hell of a guy.

553
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,023
Congratulations.

554
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,075
Uh, Cameron, wait.

555
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,288
I just wanted to say
you were great in there

556
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,415
and it was nice
to see you.

557
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,547
( scoffs )

558
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,051
You know, when I heard that
you had weaseled your way

559
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,345
back into my life,
I was pissed.

560
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:46,350
But more than that,
I was scared because
I thought I was the mark.

561
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,601
He's the mark, isn't he?

562
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,603
He's not a mark.
I don't--

563
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,938
it's an honest
business proposal.

564
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,940
I can't tell if you know
you're lying or not.

565
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,485
- I'm not lying.
- Okay.

566
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,446
So it's just a coincidence
that you fell in love with
the daughter of a billionaire.

567
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,490
Why can't you see
that I'm helping you here?

568
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:04,076
I never asked for help.

569
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,079
I don't want any help,
especially from you.

570
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,998
Joe:
<i>Listen, a lot has changed</i>
<i>since I saw you last.</i>

571
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,252
Yeah, I'm not the same
naive girl anymore.

572
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,004
So just stay away.

573
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,089
Did you get my letter?

574
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,050
Did you read it?

575
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,094
<i>( footsteps approach )</i>

576
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,639
- Hi.
- Uh...

577
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,057
You must be Cameron.

578
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,892
Oh, sorry.
Cameron, this is Sara.

579
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,143
Sara, this is Cameron.

580
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,646
- The fiancée, of course.
- Yeah.

581
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,190
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

582
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,902
Uh, Joe told me
all about your company.
It's very interesting.

583
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,362
- Mm-hmm.
- We should all have dinner.

584
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,655
I'd love to learn
more about it.

585
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,908
We'll have
to make that happen.

586
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,993
Uh, it was lovely
to meet you.

587
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,122
Joe, always a pleasure.

588
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,592
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

589
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,552
Yeah, it was great.

590
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,304
Clearly.

591
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,267

592
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,479
- ( laughing )
- You're fun, Gordon.

593
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,522
How come I never knew
you were so much fun?

594
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,150
I am fun.
I'm super fun.

595
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,985
It's that Donna
that keeps me down.

596
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,572
( laughs )
She takes after her dad.

597
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,699
God, me and her
used to have such
a good time together.

598
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,952
You know, when we
first got together and
we'd come visit you guys,

599
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,581
we'd always end up
at this bar/club type
place, the Twist,

600
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,584
and we would dance
till we were just
about dead.

601
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,169
You know,
shut the place down.

602
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,296
- My Donna?
- Oh, yeah.

603
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,507
I mean, when we moved here,
we thought we'd be going
there all the time,

604
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:46,303
but, you know,
the kids and, you know,

605
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:50,724
life gets in the way
and you just forget
to have fun.

606
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,019
- Mm.
- But, you know,
fun's important.

607
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,230
- To fun.
- To fun.

You know...

612
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,492
I never really
thanked you properly.

613
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,203
You and Gary
have been so good to us.

614
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,330
You know, done so much.

615
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,123
It took us a while
to land on our feet,

616
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:18,084
but you supported us
throughout.

617
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,671
You know, and now
it's finally paid off.

618
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,549
Susan, we couldn't have
done it without you.

619
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,092
Well, what's the point
of having money

620
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,345
if not to help out
your loved ones?

621
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,763
Well, I don't mean
the money.

622
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,766
I just mean, you know,
being there for us.

623
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,644
Oh.

624
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,187
Yeah.

625
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,648
Well, what, you want me
to pay you back?

626
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,816
( laughs )

627
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,570
I thought that's what--

628
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,199
I'm sorry,
I feel awkward.

629
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,493
Oh, you want me
to pay you back?

630
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,371
Well, all that talk
of family and support

631
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,289
and you having money now,

632
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,375
I just...

633
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,044
I think you've had
too much to drink,
sweetheart.

634
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,713
Oh, no, no, no.

635
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,842
What do we owe you?

636
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,387
Donna will never
owe us a cent.

637
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:16,101
But the Symphonic?

638
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:20,480
We put in just north
of 22,000, all told.

639
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,483
I got my checkbook.

640
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,074
Uh, just north
of 22, 000, you say.

641
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,118
Mm-hmm.

642

- I'll pay you back.

Yeah, that's cool.
I'll see you a little later.

How'd you like

682

Did you kick Chet

Yeah.

684
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,983
Why did you do that?

685
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,445
He was in arrears.
He couldn't pay.

686
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,614
I think you'd have
some sympathy for that.

It's a business.

No, it's a community.

690
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,749
It's my community.

691
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,709
And we don't
kick people out.

692
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,921
It sends a message, okay?
He's been with us
since day one.

693
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,757
He's loyal.

694
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,843
Yeah, he's a pain in the ass,
