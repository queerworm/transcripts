00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,849
Joe:
So when does that 3090
get delivered?

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,310
They said by
5:00 P.M. today.

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,104
And we've got Stanford
on Monday, right?

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,565
Cisco and MCI
the week after.

5
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:30,071
I'd take a good look.

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,115
Soon it'll be hardware
and handshake deals,

7
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,075
endless troubleshooting
and upgrades.

8
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:38,288
But right now--
right now it's perfect.

9
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,082
The room?

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,711
The idea.

11
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,212
All goes well,
by the end of the month

12
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,589
we'll be sitting down
with the sector chief
of NSFNET

13
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,550
to walk him through
the bid.

14
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,468
It's Mitch Klowden.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,304
We go back
to my IBM days.

16
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,682
He's a good guy.
Sharp dresser.

38
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,175
- Excellent.
- And you.

00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,553
Where'd you find
this one, hmm?

40
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,263
Great to meet you, Ryan.
Hell of a head on
those shoulders.

Thank you, Mitch.

Mitch, it was great

Sorry, guys.
I got stuck on a call.

00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,034
Okay, let's get started.

65
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,954
Uh, shouldn't we wait
for Doug and Craig?

66
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,997
That would be
a waste of time.

67
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,166

- I fired them.

68
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,754
When?

69
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,047

70

Why?

71
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,052
Well, SwapMeet's
fully integrated

72
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,847
and the cash
feature's bug-free,
so I no longer need them.

73
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,516
And what are we going to do
about their earn-out?

74
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,937
I feel like Diane
was pretty clear she wanted us
to make it work.

00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,650

00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,735

I'm surprised.

84

I thought you all had found
a manageable workflow.

85
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,414
Well, we discussed it
and we decided

86
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,294
that Doug and Craig's
usefulness had run
its course.

87
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,881
And we both figured based
on our earlier conversations

88
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,799
that you'd have
our backs on this.

89
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,426
Well, as I've said,
I'll authorize the earn-out

90
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,262
if that's what
you feel you need.

91
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,723
<i>But that's not what</i>
<i>I'm here to discuss.</i>

92
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,808

93
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,061
You have
an acquisition offer.

94
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,729
From CompuServe.

95
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,317
Uh... ( chuckles )
CompuServe?

96
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,319
I know. I don't think
it's a good fit either,

97
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,279
but it sets a floor.

98
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,614
How much?

99
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,325
20 million.

100
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,246
That's four times
what Westgroup offered.

101
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,289
I mean, have we really
grown that fast?

102
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,083
Here's the thing,
and I didn't think

103
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,085
we'd be having
this conversation so soon,

104
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,712
but I think it's a good
time to consider

105
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,547
the possibility
of an IPO.

106
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,055
The things we could do
with that influx of cash.

107
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,474
Okay, it's not
like we'd get to spend
the money, though, right?

108
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,770
I mean, we'd have
to get a board and chase
quarterly earnings.

109
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,940
Absolutely, but it's also
important to consider
the landscape.

110
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,109
Look at Sun, Oracle.

111
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,652
I mean, Jesus, the money
that Microsoft has raised.

112
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,781
Plus right now Mutiny
is the dominant player

113
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,490
in the online
transaction market.

114
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,492
<i>Once they hear the news</i>
<i>of this offer,</i>

115
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,078
<i>there'll be imitators.</i>

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,123
I mean, just think,

117
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,083
everything we've ever
wanted to play with.

118
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,501
We could hire
a whole team for R&amp;D.

119
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,713
Yeah, okay, I'm not chopping
my company up into pieces

120
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,216
so that you can ring
a bell on Wall Street.

121
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,517
Okay, this is just a lot.
I need time to process it.

122
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,686
Sure, okay.
You think about it.

123
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,605
Take all the time
you need.

124
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,442
This is a huge decision

125
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,195
and both of you should take
a lot of time with it.

126
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,615
But whatever you have
going on here, you need
to deal with it.

127
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,954
I'll tell you what.
I have a place
up in Sonoma.

128
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,415
It's a little vineyard.
It's quite peaceful.

129
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,708
It's a good place
to get your thoughts
in order.

130
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,543

take the weekend,

131
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,379
get on the same page?

151
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,205

just to be clear,

152

ahem, the N-- what?

153
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,127
The NSFNET
is nonprofit, right?

154

<i>and another 400,000</i>
<i>on routers and switches.</i>

Wait, with these speed
and capacity issues,

but the money will come.

it's a huge house.

341
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,751
I brought more food
than I can possibly eat.

342
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,754
So what about this--
I don't tell your mom
I saw you

343
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,339
and we keep it between us
that I was trying on
her clothes?

Yeah, I know.

347
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,014
Did you consider it?

348
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:09,309
Sort of.
I mean, it was 70%
of a fortune.

349

Well, souls
don't come cheap.

355

the low frequency.

368

up here on the top.

I got to be honest.

371

I didn't know what
you were doing in here,

372

You really think so?
I mean, it's kind of silly.

373

No, no, I mean it.
I think it's cool.

374

Yeah, well, I wish Donna

375
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,696
Yeah.

- You and Donna.

378

Yeah, so did you.

Oh, please.
You don't have
to do that.

381

he said
that the two of you

this weekend and that
we're now in business.
