But if you want to see
the craziest thing,

543
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,087
you should swing
by the focus-group testing

545
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,714
It's like "Altered States"

546
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,800
but with market research
instead of LSD.

547
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,761
That damn game
better be good.

548
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,726
Of course,
right when I get a red shell.

549
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,145
Here.

550
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:12,149
You tell me
if it's good.

I'm glad you're doing
so well, Gordon.

Thanks.

I'm doing
really, really great.

557

I mean, last night,
I got to be a human paintbrush.

558
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,002
I saw that.

You know, CalNect is --
it's kicking ass.

has to be the exception.

-Come on.

You know,
if I'm being totally honest,

563
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,763
as time wore on,
the browser just became

564
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,765
more of a side project
for me.

Oh, Gordon,
it didn't go that well.

570
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,446
Well, that's probably
for the best.

571
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,448
For who?

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,782

The user base

607

Then this isn't a rebound.
It's sustained growth.

608

That's good.

609
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,872
Only problem is
the pipe's getting tight.

00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,041
We're starting to clog
a little bit with all that data.

611
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,585
MCI hears
how well we're doing,

612
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:37,877
they're gonna want
to renegotiate

613

the sweetheart deal
before they give us

more bandwidth
on their twisted pair network.

We could balk
and try PacBell,

we'd want to keep

Uh, if MCI wants
more money, fine.

No. I finished it
last night.

So, it was, what,
a day of work?

Joe, I've been working
on this for weeks.

00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,656
You know, you didn't have to sit
around and wait for me.

635
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,533
If you were in such a rush,
you could have hired

636

to do the coding.

637
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,952
You don't get it.
I needed you.

We needed you to care,

on the Mosaic guys,

but we blew it,
and now...

If you had just been here,
actually been available...

642
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,173
Well, I couldn't be here.
That was the deal.

643

And it was a raw deal
for me.

And it's just a shame.

00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,638

away wasn't far enough.

Look, I made this better
than it had any right to be,

with a lot of my own stuff.

Oh, right, your game.

I'm sure that was tough,
being funded, promoted, coddled.

A little more sobering,

is that we've gone
through our seed round

than expected, and now...
