But his mom
is really freaked out

about what happened
on the basketball court,

205
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,062
so she packed up his stuff

206
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,688
and -- and moved him
to Los Angeles,

207
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,690

ever since.

I'm sorry, but was the thing
on the basketball court

209
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,860
really that big a deal?

to send your kid away<i> forever?</i>

211
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,573

like a giant banana,

haven't eaten in a week.

I didn't want to be there.

268

I just wanted to go home,
and so I'd cry and cry.

269
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,376
And that puffs you up
pretty bad.

So my mom found out that

271
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,547
if you put hemorrhoid cream
all around my eyes,

272
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,839
it took the puffiness away.

273
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,801

and march out onstage

why not take their idea
