Gordon, are you okay?
You're screaming.

00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,460
- What?
- You're screaming
at the top of your lungs.

7
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,881
- Joanie:<i> Mommy! </i>
- What time is it?
Why aren't you in bed?

8
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:51,218
This analysis report-- I have
to leave for Lubbock Tuesday
and it has to be perfect.

9
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:55,639
- Did I wake up the kids?
- You probably woke
the neighborhood.

10
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,893
- Are you sure
you're okay?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,645

I'm coming.

Can I get you some dinner

14
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,783
Can you still
call it dinner at
2:30 in the morning?

15
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,077
I'm good, Debbie.
Thanks.

"Can I get you some dinner

17
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,672
- Oh, be nice.
- She's right.
You gotta eat.

18
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,883
Look who's talking.

19
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,428
All work and no play
makes Joe a dull boy.

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,597
Hmm?

21
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,724
- There's got
to be another way.
- We've tried everything.

22
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,268
- Well, get more creative.
- I can't.

23
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,854
I move more things around,
it's going to start
to look bad.

a few messages, but that
was several weeks ago.

Oh, next week?
I had no idea he was
showing his photos here.

- The lasagna is in the freezer.

you reheat it in the oven.

- I know what people

They're saying
that I roll over

- Gordon, look at me.

- Okay, so you're taking
the kids to school,

Rose will be here

and I'll be home
by noon tomorrow.

75

Ed:
<i>Boot time's 48.24 seconds.</i>

<i>at 39 last month.</i>

- Weight?
- Ed:<i> Only added</i>
<i>a few ounces,</i>

<i>but it puts us</i>
<i>over 15 pounds.</i>

Stan:
<i>It's the extra RAM chips</i>
<i>and the daughter board.</i>

89

I know what it is.
Loss in compatibility?

90
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,608
Tried to load
Lotus this morning
and it tanked.

91
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,860
I'd call that
a big yes.

92
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,820
All right,
let's talk names.

93
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,780
Oh, you mean software's
not naming it?

94
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,991
I'm gonna take
a list of suggestions
to the product manager

95
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,492
and there's gonna
be a discussion.

96
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,536
So you mean we don't
have a chance in hell.

97
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,164
( all chuckle )

98
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,834
Do you guys have
name suggestions or not?

99
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,045
( taps )

100
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,838
Okay.

101
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,510
Thank you.

102
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,972
Well, if you knew this guy
was locked for a week,

103
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,016
why am I
just cancelling
Kenny today?

104
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,517
It's awful abrupt
and he's not gonna
be thrilled.

105
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,852
My guy's temperamental.
He's an artist.

106
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,187
Despite our back
and forth over the phone,

107
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,646
I wasn't even sure
he would show up.

108
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,148
But now that he's here,
I know he's a yes.

109
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,567
- There's something--
- He say that?

110
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,152
Cameron:
<i>A bunch of teenagers</i>
<i>broke into</i>

00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,778
Los Alamos National
Lab's computers.

112
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,739
Also into
some cancer center
and a big bank.

113
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,742
Most were DECs
running VMS OS.

114
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,036
God, cover story
and everything.
Pretty cool.

115
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,913
You stole my car.

116
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,831
I stole your keys.

117
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,791
The car just turns on
when I put them in.

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,552
Oh, Simon Church.
It's fantastic
to see you.

119
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,721
Thank you for making
the trip all this way.

120
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,058
I can't tell you
how exciting this is
for us and the project.

121
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,976
Right.

122
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,729
Hello to you, too.

123
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,523
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know I've kept you
waiting.

124
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,650
I just have a few things
to get in order.

125
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,736
Would you mind
waiting for us
in the conference room?

126
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,488
I can't wait to see
what you've put together.

127
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,574
- Debbie?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,205
You think today maybe
we could be adults?
Just for a few hours?

129
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,125
Uh, yes, sir,
Mr. MacMillan, sir.

130
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,710
He is one of the top
industrial designers
in the world.

131
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,963
If he makes our case,
it puts us on a whole
new level.

132
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,091
It was a joke, okay?
I'm sorry. Jesus.

133
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,926
You knew I had
this meeting today.

134
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,511
I'll go first.

135
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,765
The contour,
the design,

136
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,936
the angles, it-- wow.

137
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:02,816
All I can say is wow.
It's exactly what we wanted.

138
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,943
So glad that
I could accommodate.

139
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,947
I think this is
something very special.

140
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,200
( stammers )
Yeah, it's a pretty girl.
C-can I say something?

141
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,287
What happened to the specs
that you've had for a week?

142
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,998
I saw them, but they
were too limiting.

143
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,751
Moving past the specs
gives us an opportunity
to make something,

144
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,087
something that isn't
just a beige rectangle.

145
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,090
Okay, those rectangles

146
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,926
took months
and months of--

147
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,263
do you think you can just
waltz in here and demand that
we change everything

148
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,015
'cause you don't like
the way that it looks?

149
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,767
- Yes.
- Okay.

150
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,062
Okay, well, we'll redesign
the whole thing to fit the suit.

151
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,648
I saw that you
worked on the Countach
and the DeLorean.

152
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,900
Let me tell you what I know.
Both are in the shop
every hundred miles.

153
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,279
Nobody gives a damn about
what the computer looks like
as long as they work.

154
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,865
Let me tell you
what<i> I</i> know.

155
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,159
Your consumers
will soon have more
than a dozen choices

156
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,286
that look identical
to what you'd build,

157
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,330
so what will capture
their attention?

158
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,082
A design that they will
be magnetically drawn to

159
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,378
every single time they move
to touch your machine.

160
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,090
Joe, this design
will require another
hardware overhaul.

161
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,344
I'm talking hundreds of hours.
The one place that I'm ahead
is heat.

162
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,262
If I ditch the sink
for this, I run--

163
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,014
Joe:
<i>Ahem.</i>

164
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,225
When we unveil the Contrail
and it looks like this,

165
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,018
people will be
falling over themselves.

166
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,853
Wait, the what?

167
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,813
The Contrail.
We're calling it
the Contrail.

168
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,857
I'm announcing it this week,
so don't tell anyone.

169
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,069
The Contrail?
You're naming it
after the exhaust

170
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,071
that comes out of
the back of a plane?

171
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,199
It's about soaring,
leaving the competition
in the dust,

172
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,659
which is exactly what this
design can accomplish.

173
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,037
No, Joe, contrail
<i>is</i> the dust.

174
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,706
Look, if we continue to put
form ahead of function,

175
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,125
we're gonna be the ones
left behind with everyone
laughing at us.

176
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,587
I mean, why don't you
just call it--

177
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,714
call it
the "Cardiff Giant"?

178
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,470
You assured me
that everything
was in line

179
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,389
<i>and that my time</i>
<i>wouldn't be wasted.</i>

180
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,975
I don't have time
to waste.

181
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,687
What is this?
I thought this was
a done deal.

182
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,440
You fly out all this way
and now you're leaving?

183
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,193
I let another designer go
just to take this meeting.

184
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,156
- Simon: What's with the girl?
- Is that what this is about?

185
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,742
-<i> ( elevator bell pings ) </i>
- I never should've come.

186
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,847
He's gone.
Are you happy?

187
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,101
All because you
didn't like the<i> name?</i>

188
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,727
What did you
want to call it?

189
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,982
The Giant? Fine.
It's the Giant.

190
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,984
I'll have marketing
toss the art and start
from scratch.

191
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,903
Hey, regardless of the resizing,
half the design was metal.

192
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,490
You want your Armani pants
to catch on fire every time
you put it in your lap?

193
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,949
I think you act like
you can't see it

194
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,827
because the truth is
you can't do it.

195
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,248
<i>( paper thumps )</i>

196
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,628
I read a whole magazine--
thank you.

197
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,047
Someone made me breakfast.
Someone made my kids breakfast.

198
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,133
- It's a revolution.
- ( chuckles )

199
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,344
You must think
I am just the greenest--

200
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,305
No, no, no one I know
gets excited about
business trips anymore.

201
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,723
Especially
this trip.

202
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,644
Why? We're bringing them
fixes for the 99/4A.

203
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,522
- We're part of the solution.
-<i> ( elevator bell pings )</i>

204
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,940
Well, not sure corporate
sees it that way.

205
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,234
These are Band-Aids
on a sucking chest wound.

206
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,986
Well, then why don't we
tell them the truth?

207
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,155
I would, but I'd also
like to keep my job.

208
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,781
- Execs at this level...
- Four, please.

209
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,159
...they want to hear
what they want to hear.
Eight, please.

210
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,953
They asked us
to present the report,
so that's what we're gonna do.

211
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,707
Joanie: 
<i>We can play dress-up</i>
<i>and then play Cabbage Patch.</i>

212
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,959
<i>( Haley gasps )</i>
<i>A dance party.</i>

213
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,629
Mommy left lasagna
in the freezer.

214
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,713
We could put it in the oven
and then play Cabbage Patch.

215
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,508
Haley:<i> Or blocks.</i>
<i>We could play blocks.</i>

216
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,350
No one's gonna
tell us what to eat.

217
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,228
We are gonna
make our own dinner
all by ourselves.

218
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,604
- Joanie: Mommy's gonna be mad.
- What are we gonna eat?

219
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,189
Mommy's not here.

220
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,325
We need to get
Ken back.

221
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,993
Are you
shitting me?

222
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,329
We have six weeks
till COMDEX and we
need a case.

223
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,706
Unless you want me to wrap
the machine in a garbage bag,

224
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,457
we need a designer.

225
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,087
With only 256 bytes
of RAM in the register,

226
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,838
we have a bottleneck
that sets off

227
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,966
a four-cycle wait
to clear every time
we load it.

228
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,886
- Hunt--
- Plus a power regulator
that gets so hot,

229
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,013
users refer to it
as the "coffee cup warmer."

230
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,307
Hunt, you're listing off
a lot of problems,

231
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,394
and a lot of problems
means a lot of money
for fixes.

232
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,730
We need assurances
that correcting these

233
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,190
will solve
the computer's flaws
once and for all.

234
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,234
Well, they won't.

235
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:04,492
I'm sorry, but there are
no once-and-for-all fixes
for the 99.

236
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,244
If you want to do
the right thing,

237
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,038
you drop it
from our product
list for good.

238
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,254
( chuckles )
She's right.

239
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,257
I mean,
what are we gonna do,
slash prices again?

240
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,594
Hand out another rebate?
We're practically giving
it away already.

241
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,929
If you ask me,

242
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,265
we get out of the PC
market altogether.

243
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,395
<i>( elevator bell pings )</i>

244
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,567
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to jump in--

245
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,361
Donna, they've been
toying with dropping
the 99 for months.

246
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,363
People are
just too scared
to say it out loud.

247
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,906
- Except for you.
- Wait, really?

248
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,617
If you hadn't
said that,

249
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,952
they never would've
heard the truth.

250
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,997
- That took guts.
- I thought it took stupidity.

251
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,708
Will you please
just take the credit?

252
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,298
Now, I say we meet
downstairs for dinner,

253
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,300
on the company's
credit card, of course,

254
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,638
and we celebrate
a job well done.

255
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,306
7:00?

256
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,308
Yeah, okay.

257
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,604
- She had to build
her own fire...
-<i> ( phone ringing )</i>

258
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,690
...and gather
her own wood.

259
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,026
Hello?

Debbie on phone:
<i>Hi, Gordon. I've got</i>
<i>Joe for ya.</i>

261
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,492
But in 1898,
Great-Grandma Iris

262
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,537
picked up
some stakes and ran
off to the Klondike

263
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,374
during the last
great gold rush.

264
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,336
Food was scarce.
You had to hunt
and cook...

265
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,423
...from scratch
all on your own.

266
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,802
But Grandma Iris,
she was tough.

267
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,012
She was real tough.

268
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,849
And this was her
original recipe.

269
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,687
- Are you tough?
- No.

270
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,856
Let her speak
for herself.

271
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,816
Come here.

272
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,364
Show your big sister
what you're made of.

273
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,829
- It's good, Daddy.
- It is good.

274
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,582
I want some.
I'm tough.

275
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,795
- It's good.
- 'Cause you're tough.

276
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,047
And you're tough.

277
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,216
We're all tough.

278
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,554
Can we make
cookies, Daddy?

279
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,890
Mommy has the
cut-and-put-in-the-oven kind.

280
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,266
Can we play
with you, Daddy?

281
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,726
We really
want to play with you.

282
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,562
Yes to cookies,
yes to games,

283
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,979
yes to Daddy's
wonderful stew.

I was at a conference

traveled around

309

00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,091
( chuckles )

333
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,929
We was window-shopping
and decided you were
the man to marry.

334
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,472
Yeah, you're settling.

335
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,432
See, I like to get asked
to the prom first.

336
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,977
If I don't,
my feelings get hurt.

337
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,772
Hey, speaking of marriage,
how's Ginnie?

338
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,109
Ginnie's doing
just fine.

339
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,113
Yeah? You line anything
up on the side yet?

340
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,119
Uh, we're not settling.
We're betting on utility.

341
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,997
Your design is simple,
it's welcoming,

342
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,042
it doesn't intimidate,
and we want our machine
to be...

343
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,545
friendly.

344
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,967
Shit, I don't need
to give you a dollar.

345
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,095
You'll dance for free.

346
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:43,016
( laughs )

347
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,767
<i>( music playing softly )</i>

348
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,145
- Do you have an invite?
- Huh? Yeah.

349
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,065
What the hell
is this?

350
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,067
You skank.

351
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,652
You used me for a ride,
didn't you?

352
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,488
Huh? Relax, there's
free champagne.

353
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,491
30 minutes
and I'm leaving
your skinny ass.

354
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,788
Can I get
one of those, please?

355
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,505
Bleak.

356
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,175
Mm. I think
the photographer
understood very well

357
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,968
how empty this place
really is.

358
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,469
Tell me about it.
I'm from here.

359
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,763
Mm, my apologies, then.

360
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,017
So, what can I do
for "Miss Rainbow Brite"
this evening?

361
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,605
- Agree to build our case.
- ( chuckles )

362
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,191
How old are you?

363
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,736
Old enough to see
the difference between
a $100,000 car

364
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,113
that only a fraction of
the population can afford

365
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,699
and a utility that
every single human being

366
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,743
will be interfacing with
inside of five years.

367
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,037
I can certainly see
why Joe likes you.

368
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,623
Please tell him
I said bravo for the
very clever second push.

369
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,543
Joe didn't send me.

370
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,545
But I know this
is important to him.

371
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,714
Important, hmm?

372
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,883
What did Joe
tell you about me?

373
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,220
Look, I know you guys
humped all over Europe
or whatever.

374
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,847
- And I don't care.
- Oh, is that how he put it?

375
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,976
Because I seem
to remember it
fairly differently.

376
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,979
- Did he tell you
I left him?
- Yeah, he did.

377
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,314
Did he tell you why?

378
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,444
Because I told him
I loved him,

379
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,614
and the moment I said it,
I knew it was over

380
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,950
so I left
the next morning.

381
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:29,080
I tried to spare myself
the embarrassment.

382
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,917
We did have quite
a bit of fun for a while.

383
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,878
Late nights.
( chuckles )

384
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,588
Did a lot
of stupid things,

385
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,675
but in the end,
I believe Joe
just got bored.

386
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,765
Listen...

387
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:52,061
I know that you think
what you have with him
is different,

388
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,021
but please don't
make the mistake
of thinking

389
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,857
that he won't
do the same thing
to you eventually.

390
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,367
Come on,
let's go.

391
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,288
Wait, I just got this one.
Come here, come on.

392
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,249
Hey, let's have
some champagne.

393
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,168
Who's that,
an old boyfriend?

394
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,877
Hmm? Yeah.

395
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,839
He looks
like a real asshole.
What did he say to you?

396
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,216
Nothing.

397
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,137
All right,
hold the light steady.
Come on, focus, girls.

398
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,806
Can we play
another game?
Something we can win?

399
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,225
If you play me,
you won't win.

400
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,351
But Mommy
never wins.

401
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,313
That's because Mommy
loses on purpose,

402
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,023
which is not
a good life lesson.

403
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,732
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

404
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,110
In fact, look.
Look what time it is.

405
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,821
It's PJ time.
You guys go get
your PJs on.

406
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,949
All right, as soon
as you brush your teeth,
I'll come in there.

407
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,160
Can we
have our story
in your bed?

408
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,829
Yeah, fine.
Fine, just go.

409
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,248
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

410
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,791
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

411
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,170
I-- I called.

412
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,714
Uh, is everything okay?

413
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,008
<i>No, everything's</i>
<i>not okay.</i>

414
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,260
We went over
the case design again today

415
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,347
and once again Joe
wants me to shift everything
around inside to accommodate.

416
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,807
<i>It's style over substance</i>
<i>and I'm tired of it.</i>

417
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,392
Guy comes in and presents
something with metal paneling,

418
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,854
and because of the dimensions,
the heat sink won't fit.

419
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,648
I mean, the thing's gonna end up
being a waffle iron.

420
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,027
I'll fax you over
the dimensions so you can
see how ridiculous it is.

421
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,779
<i>Wait, but that could work,</i>
<i>couldn't it?</i>

422
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,533
Let the exterior paneling
pull heat off the board?

423
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,702
<i>It's actually</i>
<i>an interesting idea.</i>

00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,225

At the end of the day,

435
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,709
we're happy to be
doing business
with y'all.

436
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,753
We'll get you
a case.

437
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,713
Well, I appreciate
that, Kenny.

438
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,090
The pleasure's ours.

439
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,926
Get that plastic mold
fired up ASAP, huh?

440
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,803
We figure with the amount
of money you're spending,

441
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,179
I can bump you
to the top of the list.

442
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,432
I appreciate that.

443
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,309
Hey, you all right
there, partner?

444
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,436
- Long week.
- Hurts, don't it?

445
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,521
Well, at least we got
to have a good time

446
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,023
on Cardiff's dime,
though, right?

447
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,234
- Yeah, sure.
- Have a good one, Kenny.

448
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,821
Hey, you know, we must'a
seen 20 pretty titties.

449
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,740
Not so much
as a smile from you.

450
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,784
What, are you queer?

00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,745

<i>That is assault, John!</i>
<i>I will press charges.</i>

453
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,918
I am gonna sue
your ass, John!

454
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,004
You hear me?

455
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,299
Kenny: All right.
I'm good, I'm good.
Get your hands off me.

456
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,925
Can you still make it
work with your guy?

457
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,635
I can try.

458
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,932
Daddy?

459
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,979
Um...

460
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:26,692
a long time ago,
way back in the 1800s,

461
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,402
there was a farmer
in Cardiff, New York.

462
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,404
Cardiff,
like your job.

463
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:34,158
Exactly.
And this farmer,

464
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,035
he wanted
to feel special,

465
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:40,122
so he built
a 10-foot-tall giant

466
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,791
<i>and buried it</i>
<i>out in his field.</i>

467
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:47,421
<i>And he waited,</i>
<i>and a year went by.</i>

468
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:52,843
And then he and some
of his workers dug it up.

469
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,221
And the men
who worked for him

470
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,517
were convinced
that the giant was real.

471
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:04,146
And the people told him
to show it to the world,

472
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,357
and he did.

473
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:11,195
And people came
from all around.

474
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:16,075
And he felt
very, very special.

475
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,619
He was so special

476
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,206
that somebody offered
to partner with him.

477
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,336
P.T. Barnum,

478
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:31,131
an expert salesman.

479
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,512
And they fought
and they argued
day and night

480
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:42,017
because the salesman
wanted the giant
all to himself.

481
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,147
What happened?

482
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:51,110
P.T. Barnum
built his own giant.

483
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,322
And he made it
part of his circus

484
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,242
and he claimed
that it<i> was</i> real.

485
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:02,580
And he was such
an expert salesman

486
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,583
that everyone
forgot about the farmer...

487
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,921
and he was left
in the dust,

488
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,925
in the contrail.

489
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,308
And I swear I was headed
for the firing squad.

490
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,226
Great surprise, huh?

491
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,355
You've been far away.

492
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,149
I'm sorry, I'm...

493
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,987

they derailed him
along the way,

00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,388
Donna, why are you
telling me this?

503
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,976
Because
we made a deal.

504
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,982
We agreed
that if he did this

505
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,234
that it wouldn't
turn out like last time,

506
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:18,822
and I just don't think
that he's strong enough
and I'm--

507
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,493
I'm not sure
that I'm strong enough.

508
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,536
You?

509
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,330
You are
incredible.

510
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,418
( music continues )

511
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,382
Gosh, you think
this piano player
knows any other songs?

512
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,508
They should
hire you to play.

513
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,344
They should.

514
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,179
( music stops )

515
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,223
Uh-oh, looks like
he's taking a break.

516
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,099
Good.

517
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,769
- No.
- Go on.

518
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,606
- I can't.
- Quit your stalling.

519
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,525
Fine.

520
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,860
Go on,
get up there.

521
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,369
( applauding )

522
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,545
<i>playing</i>
<i>"New Orleans Boogie"</i>

523
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,558
That's a lot better
than that last guy.

524
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,226
What's your name?

525
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,271
Susan Fairchild.

526
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,571
You call me
all the way out here
just to shoot the breeze?

527
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,074
The PC program's
out of money.

528
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,492
I'm sorry to land it
on you like that.

529
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,661
Wait, why am I just
hearing about this?

530
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,330
What the hell
happened?

531
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,749
Innovation
is a risk.

532
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,709
I don't understand
even what that means.

533
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,419
You sound like Joe,
for Christ's sake.

534
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,338
The good news is
we're weeks away
from a payday.

535
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,674
The moment we debut
at COMDEX, Nathan--

536
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,176
Did you strike Ken Burke
tonight in the face?

537
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,429
- He insulted Ginnie--
- He called me up
madder'n hell.

538
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,724
I need you to personally
offer us a bridge loan
to get us to COMDEX.

539
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,309
Are you
out of your mind?

540
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,185
We're gonna pay you back
by the end of the year.

541
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,438
You have no idea
what these kids
are making, Nathan.

542
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,649
This could change the--
this could change
everything.

543
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,275
In five years,
every one of us

544
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,069
could have one of these
damn things in the house.

545
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,029
It's not a small market
we're talking about.

546
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,115
We gotta get in
the door now.

547
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,285
I'm thinking about
putting up my home.

548
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,578
I need you
to match that.

549
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,788
- Match?
- Yeah.

550
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,623
What the hell
is wrong with you?

551
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:36,585
Rule number one,
you don't risk
your own money.

552
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:39,463
You've been
brainwashed,
gone native.

553
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:42,675
Ain't nothing worse
than a businessman
who's lost his compass.

554
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,468
Hell, Nathan,
you trusted me
before, damn it.

555
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,052
I was the one that
got us to mainframes,
didn't I--

556
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,638
Yeah, that's when you
were still levelheaded,

557
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,473
before you started
burning the bridges

558
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,351
of every
business relationship
that I have ever forged

559
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,478
and now you're
dragging me out here
in the middle of the night...

560
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,731
asking me to cash in
my family's land?

561
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,358
- Jesus, boy.
- Nathan!

562
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,527
If that program
is out of money,

563
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:06,615
that is God saying,
"Good night and God bless."

564
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:11,161
Once the last dime goes,
you shut it down.

565
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,170
Pull yourself
together, John.

566
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,302
Go home
to your wife.

567
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,145
The moment I met you,
you know what I longed for?

568
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,481
The day when we would
get to work together,

569
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,526
when we finally
had something that
would be worthy of you.

570
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:46,029
And that thing
is a portable IBM<i> clone?</i>

571
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,533
Joe, I appreciate
the blanket flattery,

572
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:52,244
but it's a little
too late, isn't it?

573
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,831
I don't get it.
Why call me?

574
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,708
Why come back into
my life at all?

575
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,793
I remember
when Jeremy said
he was leaving New York

576
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,712
to come spend
a year here.

577
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,714
"Tour the Great Plains,"
he said--

578
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,382
Oklahoma,
Texas, Kansas.

579
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:09,511
"Photograph the landscape."
What landscape?

580
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,264
I mean, we all thought
he'd gone mad.

581
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,309
But here I am trying to see
what he was talking about,

582
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,603
looking at his pictures,

583
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,230
and trying to figure out
why you moved here.

584
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,649
I'll tell you why.
Equal opportunity,
a level playing field--

585
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,193
Joe, please.
I already got the hard sell

586
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,904
from your<i> wunderkind </i>
over there.

587
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,782
Truly the future
generation, Joe.

588
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:33,577
<i>She actually reminds me</i>
<i>of you at that age.</i>

589
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,371
She's light-years ahead
of where I was then.

590
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,416
She is tomorrow, and
we're all better off
because of it.

591
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,794
In the end,
it doesn't matter
what design we choose

592
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,797
because it's what's
inside the machine
that's brilliant.

593
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:49,301
She did that.
Not you, not me.

594
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,763
Do the case,
don't do the case.
I don't care.

595
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,556
Get off me, "Kojak."
Ow!

596
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:55,849

-<i> ( Judie laughing )</i>

598
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,937
All right.
Come here, come on.
Get a hold of yourself.

599
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,397
Sorry.

600
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,778
"That guy just
messes me up."

601

( laughing )

602
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,451
Oh, wait a minute.
There we go.

603
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,369
You know, you probably
made that piano player

604
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,707
more in tips
than he makes
in a whole year...

605
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,042
"Susan Fairchild."

606
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,254
Wait a minute,
I think I know that name.

607
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,298
Oh, that's my mother's
maiden name.

608
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,925
You probably
heard it around.

609
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,385
No, actually,
I think I read it
somewhere.

610
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,889
Ahem.

611
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,851
You should be
"Susan Fairchild"
more often.

612
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,060
She's fun.

613
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,066
Can I tell you
something personal?

614
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,906
Doing that extra report
got you here.

615
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,074
Saying no
to those execs

616
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,328
changed our whole
presentation.

617
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,958
Showing people
who you really are,

618
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,837
you should do that
more often.

619
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,506
Be bolder.

620
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,970
<i>( elevator bell pings )</i>

621
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:18,348
Ahem.

630
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,089
Girls,
what are you doing?

631
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,883
Joanie:
Digging for the giant.

632
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,761
No, honey, it's not
a real giant.

633
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,721
It was real to him.
You said so.

634
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,306
Sweetheart, you gotta
get inside or your mother--

635
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,392
Don't worry, Daddy.
We'll find the giant.

636
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,523
Sweetie,
it's just a story.

637
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,734
Okay, look,
I'll show you.

638
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,653
See? No giant.

639
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,614
Daddy, what happened
to your hand?

640
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,157
Daddy, are you okay?

641
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,832
You guys stay here.
All right?

642
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,002
I'll be right back.

Whoa, whoa, what--
what are you doing?

646
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,877
You said "bold."

647
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,712
You said-- wasn't--

648
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,090
I came to bring you
a fax.

649
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:18,635
Um, the hotel delivered it
to my room by mistake.

650
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,762

from your husband.

I am so sorry.

654
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,525

think that--

No, no, no.
No, look, these
things happen, okay?

656

Look, people--
people work together

usually act on them.

672
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:52,122
This didn't turn out
the way either one of us
had hoped.

673
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,166
I just wanted
to see you again, Joe.

674
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,918
Spend some time with you
really working on something.

675
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,377
Then I come to find
you're with her.

676
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,339
Yes, I'm with her.

677
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,509
What we had was
10 years ago, Simon.

678
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,595
Stop living
in the past.

679
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,515
Why bother
with any of that now?

680
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,272
I'm sick.

681
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:20,275
( gasps )

682
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:23,695
I just came
to say goodbye.

683
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,584
Simon:
<i>Aren't you gonna ask?</i>

684
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,172
What?

685
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:45,925
If I'm still
gonna do the case?

686
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,304
I know you, Joe.
I know you're thinking it.

687
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,018
I set it up before
I even got on the plane.

688
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,402
I need you to know

689
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:08,531
that the way
you felt about me,

690
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,991
I wanted to--

691
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,784
Take care of yourself.

692
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,251
( sniffles )
Go.

693
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,561
( bangs )

694
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,898
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

695
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,617
Are you gonna
get bored of me?

696
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,291
I don't know.

697
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,520
( gasps )

698
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,619
Oh, my God.

699
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,288
Baby?

700
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,874
Baby, is everything okay?
Where's Daddy?

701
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,294
We were in the
back yard digging.

702
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:47,172
Okay. Okay,
go back to sleep.

703
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,966
Haley:
<i>Hi, Mommy.</i>
<i>We were helping Daddy.</i>

704
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:56,264
Gordon?

705
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,768
-<i> ( faint scraping ) </i>
- Gordon?

706
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,147
Gordon:
<i>Here! Down here!</i>

707
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,361
<i>( scraping continues )</i>

708
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,492
Gordon,
what are you doing?

709
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,164
I'm looking
for the giant.

710
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:30,215
