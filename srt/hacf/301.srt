00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,990
The school wants
a parent meeting.

174
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,367
Uh, we have a development
meeting at 4:00.

175
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,618
- I know.
- So, can't he do it?

176
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,456
Okay, I'll give
you guys a minute.

177
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,171
( keyboard clacking )

178
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,255
Roar!

179
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,299
Roar!
Got you.

180
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,009
You totally didn't know
I was in there.

181
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,386
Yeah, well,
you're totally busted

182
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,221
for the fight
you got into at school.

183
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,223
Whatever.
I kicked her ass.

184
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,476
- Really?
- Go ahead.
You know you want to.

185
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,061
What?

186
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,604
( imitates modem
screeching )

187
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,275
You're such
a little brat.

188
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,777
- And I--
-<i> ( modem screeching )</i>

189
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,613
I know you're frustrated.
I'm frustrated, too.

190
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,616
We're five people living
on top of each other,
and that's--

191
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,204
Donna, I'm frustrated
because this was supposed
to be temporary.

192
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,289
- It is temporary.
- No, it's been six mo--

193
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,624
- ( rumbling )
- Oh, shit.

194
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,336
Haley, sweetheart,
get under the table.

195
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,628
- ( screams )
- Joanie!

196
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,797
- Mom!
- It's okay, it's okay.

197
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,344
- ( rattling )
- It's all right.
You okay?

198
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,097
- Was that...?
- Yes, it was. Hang on,
there's broken glass here.

199
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,224
What should we do?
Should we stay in the doorway
or go outside?

200
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,309
You're fine.
You're fine right
where you are.

201
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,228
Joanie, baby,
are you okay?

202
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,439
I'm fine, just don't
freak out on me.

203
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,814
Sorry, do you think
that was just a preview?

204
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,691
- Like a bigger one's coming?
- ( whimpers )

205
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,651
-<i> Or is that</i>
<i>the final thing?</i>
- Hey, listen.

206
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,446
- You're not helping.
- Don't be such a wimp, Haley.

207
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,655
- Hey, Joanie.
- Your sister's scared.
Be nice.

208
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,533
- You always
take her side.
- Joanie.

209
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,658
Hey, listen, guys.

210
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,660
( all gasp )

211
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,622
Jesus, people,
it's toast.

212
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,668
Donna:
<i>My, don't you look</i>
<i>out of this world.</i>

213
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,129
Cameron:
<i>Pretty rad, right?</i>

214
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,464
<i>The antennae just</i>
<i>rolled out this week,</i>

215
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,257
<i>along with sunglasses,</i>
<i>regular glasses,</i>

216
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,050
<i>and a mohawk</i>
<i>customization.</i>

217
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,676
You should totally
get the mohawk.

218
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,678
Oh, we should
totally get going.

219
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,847
Let's start with Main Street
and then the smaller places.

220
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,600
( gasps )
Oh, there's Sledgehammer.

221
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,562
<i>Did you hear CompuServe's</i>
<i>expanding to Japan?</i>

222
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,730
And GEnie added
10,000 users last quarter.

223
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,732
At least CBS might
back out of Trintex.

224
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,818
Great, then it's just
IBM and Sears.

225
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,696
Seams kind of dead
on here, doesn't it?

226
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,698
Well, yeah,
at 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday

227
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,700
and the system's
like a casino floor
in the morning.

228
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,743
It's only the hardcores.

229
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,955
But, hey, look
at Comic Book Corner.

230
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,706
Donna:
<i>Oh, the niche room</i>
<i>metrics</i>

231
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,125
<i>are off the charts</i>
<i>'round the clock.</i>

232
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,960
That place is rowdy, man.

233
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,505
There's more fights
than a Hells Angels bar.

234
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,090
Well, I guess it's good
that these guys' glasses
are digital, then.

235
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,926
Nice.
Oh, hold on a sec.

236
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,436
Guy's got
a 1311 with a modded
thumbfire button.

237
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,522
Jeez, do you know
everybody on here?

238
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,106

240

( groans )

241
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,738
And then here we are.

242
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,740
<i>64,000 pixels</i>

00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,455
It can be whatever
we want it to be.

245
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,706
It's got to be--

246
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,044
it's gotta be
something great.

247
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,796
( knocks )

248
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,841
Ryan.
What's up?

249
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,218
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

250
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,969
Are we still on?
I know we said 9:00.

251
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,971
-<i> Maybe it was 9:15.</i>
- No, it was 9:00.

252
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,224
Yeah, no, 9:00.
Come on in.

253
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,019
( mouths )
I don't know.

254
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,770
<i>( computers whirring )</i>

255
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,648

<i>thudding )</i>

256
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,737

<i>( footsteps continue</i>
<i>thudding )</i>

260
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,811
Okay, here's another way
to look at it.

261
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,898
Community looks like this.

262
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,069
No, uh, it looks like this.

263
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,821
Well, no, like this.

264
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,824
Just-- okay, blah, blah,
chatting, chatting, chatting.

265
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,826
<i>We dress it up with</i>
<i>a sprite-scaling interface,</i>

266
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,537
but underneath
it's just paint-by-numbers.

267
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,080
You know, here's a room,
chat in it.

268
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,831
I think it's a little more
than paint-by-numbers.

269
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,626
To discount the meaningful
human interaction.

270
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,043
No, no, no, it works,
it's fine.

271
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,837
It's like vanilla ice cream,
but it's...

272
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,550
So, here are the users
and here's private chat.

273
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,842
And the users,
they're talking, talking.

274
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,927
"Hey, what's going on?

275
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,554
Let's get to know
each other more."

276
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,888
So they go to private chat.

277
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,849
And then private chat
is just PETSCII because--

278
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,893
1977.

279
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,062
You know how your mom
always says to close
the door behind you?

280
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,106
These two users,
they-- they leave,

281
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,941
and they
don't close the...

282
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,153
Okay, so,
all these other people
here are saying,

283
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,862
"Hey, what
are you guys doing?

284
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,864
Where are they going?
I want to check that out."

285
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,866
And so they--
they go, like that.

286
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,577
And so...

287
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,787
that's your problem.

288
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,291
Have you guys ever seen
"The Conversation"?

289
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,875
Which conversation?

290
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,878
Wait, the--
the Gene Hackman movie?

291
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,879
Exactly.

292
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,880
Uh...

293
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,882
People think
private chat is private.

294
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,884
But because of the way
somebody wrote it--

295
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,095
- The way<i> I</i> wrote it.
- Donna:<i> Wait, wait.</i>

296
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,599
You're telling me
that people are hacking
private chats?

297
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,934
Sure, um, big-time.

298
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,894
Look.

299
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,147
So, see this
little guy here?

300
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,191
That's the hacker.
Totally masked.

301
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,984
The asterisk
is a prompt for data.
You can't mask that.

302
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,612
Hold on.
How did you get this?

303
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,322
These are private
chat transcripts.

304
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,324
Easy, I just walked
through the gaping holes
that the hackers did.

305
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,908
- Ryan.
- No, you cannot do that.

306
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,285
Sure, I can.
I just--

307
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,911
Don't do it again.
I mean it.

308
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,123
That's a direct violation
of our user agreement.

309
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,918
Yeah, okay.
Um, totally right.

310
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,920
Uh, but here's my idea.

311
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:44,008
So, you connect users
outside public room,

312
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,928
but to different
encryption points first,
then to each other.

313
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,640
You cover tracks,

314
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,934
you rebuild private chat

315
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,936
separate from Mutiny,

316
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,939
but also still
talking to Mutiny
outside Mutiny.

317
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,941
Second
but separate Mutiny.

318
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,945
Users here,
here, and here

319
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,949
network, remote,
program, hub,

320
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,161
RSA filters
one, two, three.

321
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
No cache.
Voila.

322
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,962
Ryan, that's
an entirely new

323
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,965
and very expensive
something

324
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,968
using techniques
that our coders
don't even know, so--

325
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,970
I can do it.
I can do it.

326
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,973
You still have a ton
of sprite rendering for me.

327
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,227
Then put one of the guys
who can't do this on it.

328
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,396
Ryan, we're not doing it.

329
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,193
Okay.

330
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,073
- But here's another idea.
- ( groans )

331
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,033
Okay, you know what?

332
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,788
Ryan, why don't you
just send it to us
electronically?

333
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,081
Okay.

334
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,166
Cool.
No problem.

335
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,836
Great, really looking
forward to checking it out.

336
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,212
Oh, and just to say it
one more time,

337
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,298
something like this
is way better for Mutiny

338
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,841
than putting a bow tie
on an avatar.

339
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,927
Got it.

Oh, well...

Dangle a couple kippers out
for them and they dance

408

Yeah, 100,000 users

00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,245
but what really matters
is how long they stay on.

429
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,664
And moving that number
is proving

430
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,248
a lot more difficult

Oh, are you

Most of the time.
People also call me Diane.

Of course.
I'm Donna.

Oh, Gordon, sorry.

Look, as far as Joanie goes,
I know how hard it is

to be the new kid in school.

448
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,712
She has my sympathy.

<i>But I think</i>

450
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,299
is Jennifer is
just pretty pissed
at her father and me.

I'm fine.

512
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,425
- You sure?
- Fine.

513
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,676

514
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,433
We are gonna be okay.

515
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,976
I promise.

516
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,196
It's a raise, son.

517
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,655
You won today.

518
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,574
Did Cameron or Donna
mention anything else?

519
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,076
Is it less
than you asked for?

520
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,204
I didn't ask
for anything.

521
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,291
I just pitched them
some ideas.

522
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:48,088
I'm sure they'll reach out
when and if the time is right.

523
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,340
Hmm?

524
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,593
I'm sure
they'll let you know.

Nice to meet you...
in person.

530
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,205
It's weird meeting people
this way, isn't it?

531
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,457
It's like you jumped
out of my computer screen

or something,
like you're not real.

533
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:29,296
Yeah, yeah,
Mutiny's pretty cool
in that...

I only just discovered it.

00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,638
Uh, I work there,
actually.

537

Oh, wow.
That's gotta be fun.

00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,643
Yeah, you know,
it's harder than it looks.

00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,646
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Please go ahead.

Um, I think
it's in there somewhere.

Oh, yeah.

00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,244
Yeah, no, he was
a big Niners fan, right?

545
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,538
Yeah, he was.

546
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,125
Uh, how do you know
about that?

547
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,086
What?

548
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,465
That he was a--

549
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,592
wait, did we talk
about him?

550
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,677
- Yeah.
- My son.

551
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,681
Yeah, yeah.
You posted in the grief

552
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,684
And I'm so sorry
for your loss,

553

554

556
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,193
Right.

557
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,279
That's where we met,
but I saw that you posted

558
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,156
in the grief
and support room
and then--

559
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:41,701
All I posted was--
I mean, I just posted
that I had lost someone.

560
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,538
<i>I never said</i>
<i>anything about...</i>

561
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,708

about him with other people.

-<i> Not anything--</i>
- No.

563
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,340
We never talked
about him, never.

564
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,800
How-- how the hell
do you know about that?

565
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,594
How do you know
about him at all?

566

I...

567
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,307
I think I should go.

569

What I couldn't help
but overhear

591
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,182
is you guys whining
about having a long night.

Back in the Cardiff

593
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,893
we developed
a little technique

594
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,895
for pushing through
nights like this.

595
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,273
Called it
the "Tandy-Shandy."

596
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,859
One keeps you sharp,

628

So I go over
to Joe's house,

629
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,929
you know, I'm expecting
to see this guy swinging
from the rafters.

630
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,181
Holy shit.

631
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,933
But, surprise,
he's alive.

632
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,770
He opens the door.
I mean, he looks like hell,

633
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,188
but he's alive.

634
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,981
So, I go in.

635
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,860
You know, the whole place
is cleaned out.

636
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:47,865
And I can see it,
his whole life gone,

637
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,783
destroyed.

638
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:50,950
It's exactly
what I had thought,

639
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,952
which is exactly
why I stayed up all night

640
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,538
reversing
the Sonaris code.

641
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,876
You know, honestly,
I really wanted to help him.

642
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:04,798
So I gave him the disk
out of the goodness
of my heart.

643
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,007
We hugged.

644
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,051
Joe MacMillan
knows how to hug?

645
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,012
Next thing you know,
I wake up,

646
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,973

about $10 million

647
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,268

648
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,437

00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,980
Yeah.

650
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,567
Of course a guy like that
would steal your idea.

651
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,444
I mean, he's too stupid
to come up with one of his own.

652

No, no, no, no, no.

653
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,989

<i>Don't you</i>
<i>underestimate him.</i>

he's most dangerous.

No, Joe's...

657
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,296
Joe's brilliant.

658
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,049
And when you're
in that guy's thrall,

659
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,969
you know,
it feels like a drug.

660
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:56,516
You know, you--
you feel...

661
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,228
like the most important
person in the world.

662
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,280
And that's when you wake up
with your neck slit,

663
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,866

They're Ryan's

667

He'd already
printed them off

668

and I figured
maybe there'd be
some answers in here,

669
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,052
but what if we do
go under by '88?

670
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,139
I mean, everything
we went through last year,
all the battles we fought,

671
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,225
moving everything out here,
everyone, our--

672
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,269
leaving our families
and our friends.

673
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,105
What if we did all that
just to, what,

674
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,483
putter around out here
for a couple of years

675
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:50,487
and then disappear like
we were never even here
in the first place?

676
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,114
No, moving here
wasn't a mistake.

677
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,074
Here.

678
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,160
There's gotta be
something in here.

679
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,162
Well, there's all kinds
of reasons that people
are signing off.

680
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,080
They're getting
along so well,

681
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,165
they want to talk
on the phone.

682
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,083
Maybe that's obvious.

683
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,169
Sometimes they even
want to meet up in person.

00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,379
Or they want
to make a trade.

685
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,092
I met up with
the joystick guy earlier.

686
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,178
Then why did you
go to Fry's?

687
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,100
Because when I met up
with him in person,

688
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,603
he turned out to be
a total creep.

689
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,069
<i>( bottle cap clatters )</i>

690
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,081
Transactional interactions?

691
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,168
Like, what if you didn't
have to sign off

692
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,587
when you wanted
to make a trade?

693
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,964
- You could just...
- Do it online.

694
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,134
Okay, sure.

695
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,013
That's just what you did,
but that's only one reason--

696
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,306
Okay, look.
We're never gonna
stop people

697
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,059
from talking
on the phone, right?

698
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,394
And we don't want to
because that's...

699
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,313
a genuine connection.

700
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,067
But with
transactions...

701
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,652
Here, look!

702
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,237
This is about bootlegs.

703
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,989
"I've got the Venice show
from last fall."

704
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,657
"I've got the whole
summer up north."

705
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,535
Here's another one!

706
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,537
Here. How about
my "WrestleMania '85"

707
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,999
for your Hagler/Hearns
"War" VHS?

708
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,166
It's not gonna be
every time,

709
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,460
but there could be
enough of these

710
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,169
that it warrants
building something

711
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,255
so that people are doing
this interaction on Mutiny.

712
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,173
Even if people
aren't already trading,

713
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,175
it's a brand-new type
of interaction

714
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,095
that could draw in
more and more users.

715
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,430
Yeah, yeah.
If it's good enough.

716
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,141
It just has to be
good enough.

717
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,231
Okay, that's...
( sighs )

718
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,191
That's interesting.

719
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,027
I've never seen that before.

720
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,239
But is this it?

721
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,496
( sighs )

722
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,205
I-I don't know.

723
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,708
I've never
seen it before, either,

724
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,669
and I feel like
we've seen a lot.

725
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,297
This could be
the sort of thing

726
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,215
that would make people
really sit up

727
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,176
and pay attention.

728
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,432
- But is it it?
-<i> Right?</i>

729
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,267
'Cause it needs
to be it,

730
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,728
'cause we're only
gonna get one shot
at this out here.

731
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,232
-<i> ( door opens )</i>
- Well...

732
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,152
<i>( door closes )</i>

733
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,237
Yo.

734
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,239
Yo.

735
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,492
Everything okay
with the mainframe?

736
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,410
Yep.

737
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,245
Took care of it.

738
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,251
Anyways, it gave me an excuse
to hang out with the coders.

739
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,088
- You know.
- Tandy-Shandy?

740
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,508
Gordon:
<i>And then some.</i>
<i>Oof.</i>

741
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,471
You guys working
on something?

742
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,264
Mm.

743
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,266
Oh, yeah,
we were just coming up
with some ideas--

744
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,478
Ah, I'll leave it
to the brain trust.

745
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,565
( growls )

746
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,239
Okay,
that was so weird.

747
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,583
So, what do you think?

748
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,503
I think let's do it.

749
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,131
Yeah, I think so, too.

750
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,302
But if this is gonna work,

751
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,513
we're gonna have
to trust each other.

752
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,811
Reading private chats
is a violation of our
user agreement.

753
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,315
Can we close the back door
of that code?

754
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,318
Yeah, sure.

755
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,612
No problem.

756
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,832
You're high.

757
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,627
Yeah, so are you.

758
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,380
Oh, hey, hey.

759
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,340
Hey.

760
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,343
You smell like
Berkeley, Gordon.

761
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,222
- I could take a shower.
- No.

762
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,349
When's the last time
our bedroom smelled like weed?

763
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,645
That's the great thing
about California.

764
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,355
Our bedroom
can smell like weed
whenever we want.

765
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,650
( laughs )

766
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,366
<i>( modem screeching )</i>

770

( shutter clicks )

771
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,082
Fear--

772
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,460
it's a natural reaction
to moving closer to the truth.

773
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,009
You know, ever since
I started MacMillan Utility,

774
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,928
I've been accused
of selling fear.

775
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,060
But let me ask you...

776
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,978
is it fear?

777
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,233
Or is it truth?

778
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,441
( shutter clicks )

779
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:06,445
How sure is our footing?

780
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,908
Yesterday morning,
many of us were reminded
of that question

781
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:14,620
when we literally felt
the ground move beneath us.

782
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,874
We live in a world
that is constantly shifting,

783
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,877
<i>sometimes</i>
<i>bringing us together</i>

784
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,755
<i>and sometimes</i>
<i>pulling us apart.</i>

785
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,548
James:
<i>Hey, Pop, don't worry</i>
<i>about calling late.</i>

786
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,509
<i>We already gave up on sleep.</i>
<i>( chuckles )</i>

787
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,096
<i>Anyway, uh, I thought</i>
<i>you'd like to know</i>

788
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,556
<i>we are going with</i>
<i>Samuel John.</i>

789
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,477
( keyboard clacking )

790
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,065
Joe:
<i>Who are our friends?</i>

791
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,901
<i>Who are our enemies?</i>

792
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,158
<i>What's gonna happen to us?</i>

793
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,670
<i>Are we safe?</i>

794
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:09,217
What I created has grown.

795
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,929
Now, some of you...
( chuckles )

796
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,724
...even call MacMillan Utility
the gold standard

797
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,727
in corporate
antivirus protection.

798
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,819
But in the meantime,
I've been asking myself,

799
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,781
"What should the price
of security really be?

800
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:35,534
How much should we pay

801
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,620
to feel safe?"

802
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,548
Wait, here's another one

803
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,969
from that same
ancient tradition.

804
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,351
The whole secret of existence
is to have no fear at all.

805
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,354
Never fear
what will become of you.

806
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,230
Depend on no one.

807
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,566
Only in the moment
that you reject all help

808
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,194
are you really free.

809
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,451
- ( crowd murmuring )
- Only by moving past fear

810
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:19,578
can we ever arrive
at the truth.

811
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,000
And the truth is
freedom from fear
is a right,

812
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,252
not a commodity.

813
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,587
I know what
you're thinking.

814
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,217
I charge
my corporate clients
millions.

815
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,720
Well, they can afford it.

816
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,974
But tomorrow
I'm releasing

817
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,268
our user version,
Citadel,

818
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,603
the version I created
for all of you.

823
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,323
nothing.

it will be
absolutely free.

828
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,838
