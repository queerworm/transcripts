1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,891
Taylor:
When did Joe MacMillan
come to you with the idea

2
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,392
to reverse engineer
the IBM PC?

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,772
Um, ahem, that's
factually incorrect.

4
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,274
John Bosworth
and Nathan Cardiff
approached me

5
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,695
about a new PC program
on April 4th of this year.

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,865
IBM attorney:
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

7
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,450
You were hired to write
a replica of our BIOS code,

8
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,285
but you won't be looking
at our BIOS code.

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,954
You seem like a good kid.

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,330
We're not here for you,
so why don't you just--

11
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,374
Look, I don't need
to look at your BIOS

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,584
because I'm not interested
in copying garbage.

13
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,504
Sure, I might decide
I want to spend the rest
of my natural life

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,631
waiting to move
an instruction without
a 16-bit bus,

15
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,967
but other than that,
I'm not looking
at that binder.

16
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,093
- Then why you?
- Excuse me?

17
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,345
Why you?

18
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,557
You're a mainframe 
software engineer.

19
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,433
<i>You certainly</i>
<i>don't build anything.</i>

20
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,394
Mr. Clark does not have
to theorize as to why--

21
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,439
I have more microcomputing
experience than anyone here.

22
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,402
Just so I understand,
you're saying that your past
failures in this area

23
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,613
somehow qualify you
to spearhead the Cardiff
PC program?

24
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,659
IBM attorney:
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>they got her on for?</i>

25
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,829
- Four, five, weeks?
- However long it takes
to finish the BIOS.

26
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,332
<i>Just so we're clear,</i>
<i>if you do decide to open</i>
<i>this binder,</i>

27
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,418
<i>you'll be the first one</i>
<i>that goes to jail.</i>

28
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,716
-<i> ( door closes ) </i>
-<i> ( turns water off )</i>

29
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,676
You're up right now.

30
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,803
That ain't right.
It just ain't right.

31
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:35,846
Just go in,
stick to the script.

32
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,681
You think this is easy?

33
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,058
Parrot out a couple
of outright lies,

34
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,350
go home, sleep
like a champ.

35
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,769
You got
a lot to learn, son.

36
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,020
You don't think
IBM's ever lied?

37
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,688
I don't know.
Don't care.

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,147
Look, I need you
to understand

39
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,566
that I did what I did
because it was right,

40
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,359
not just for me,
for you, for everybody.

41
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,028
If I'd come in here
a week ago and asked nicely,

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,613
you'd have laughed me
out of the room.

43
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,449
I'd have kicked your ass
is what I woulda done.

44
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,409
And I still might.

45
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>( door opens )</i>

46
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,924
Dale, no lawyers.

47
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,550
Why?

48
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,385
I know what
you're gonna say.

49
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,096
You've coached
your team well.

50
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,180
All we did
was stay inbounds.

51
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,558
You tell the boys
at Boca Raton

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,893
<i>they've written</i>
<i>a nice BIOS here.</i>

53
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,853
It'll be tough to beat.

54
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,522
But rest assured,
ours will contain
no copyrighted material,

55
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,233
Cameron Howe will be
completely isolated in
a clean room environment,

56
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,152
she'll have no contact
with Gordon Clark

57
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,071
or his
reverse-engineering work.

58
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,949
Any similarities in the code
will be completely coincidental,

59
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,784
just like Columbia Data.

60
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,911
Just like Compaq.

61
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,497
You know the legal loophole
as well as I do.

62
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,001
Honestly,
I don't care.

63
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm more interested in
where the hell you've been
the last year and a half.

64
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,090
You left
without saying good-bye.

65
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,050
Told any of your new friends
about that day?

66
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,763
Say all your ducks
are in a row.

67
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,723
Maybe we just
sue you anyway.

68
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:06,520
Just bury you
in paperwork
and legal costs.

69
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,980
You see that gentleman
out there?

70
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,774
That's our in-house counsel,
Barry Shields.

71
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,777
He costs Cardiff Electric
$55,000 a year,

72
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,072
and no matter how many
hundreds of lawyers
you drop from the sky,

73
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,782
we're gonna
stick with Barry.

74
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,950
Just Barry.

75
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:23,120
We will ruin his life.

76
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,750
And if this ever
goes to trial,
you'll lose...

77
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,004
'cause at the end of the day,
you have nothing.

78
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,507
Have a nice flight.

79
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,850
<i>( car doors close )</i>

80
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,352
- So, we're good.
- We're perfect.

81
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,983
So, hey, I write
the BIOS code, then what?

82
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,569
What exactly
are we building?

83
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,665
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

84
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,201
That's physically impossible.

85
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,245
I mean, it's literally
a physics problem.

86
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,206
I don't understand.
This is seriously all
we're building.

87
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,667
Look, you don't get it.
The market moves by increments.

88
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,587
The next machine that hits
the shelves is either faster
or cheaper.

89
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,131
It can't be both,
you know.

90
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,882
That's impossible.
It's--

91
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,804
What are you talking about,
pure megahertz here, or--

92
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,267
-<i> ( pen clicks ) </i>
- ...or maybe we could--

93
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,644
we could crank up
the crystal

94
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,395
<i>or attack at the software.</i>

95
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,232
Joe, that's interesting.
That's really interesting.

96
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,068
Wait, what?
Back up!

97
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,403
This is nothing.
This is boring.

98
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,739
This is a lawn mower
or a microwave.

99
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,242
Let me guess,
you're one of those
idea people.

100
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,994
If by "idea people,"
you mean I'm familiar

101
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,329
with technology that wasn't
obsolete a decade ago.

102
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,166
Gordon:
<i>Have you ever even</i>
<i>touched a piece of hardware?</i>

103
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,084
<i>See, that's the problem</i>
<i>with you entitled school kids.</i>

104
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,585
You've got a lot
of fancy theories,

105
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,629
but you've never actually
been close to the metal.

106
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,218
If real theory is
that I want to do something

107
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,597
a little bit more than
two times everything that
everybody else is doing!

108
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,684
Computers should have
photo-realistic screens.

109
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,937
They should have a million
pixels and be self-learning

110
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,272
and run expert systems.

111
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,731
They should
beat me at chess.

112
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,026
And maybe HAL can
have human emotions, too,

113
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,652
and steer the ship
while we're sleeping.

114
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,321
So we're just building
another boring beige box?

115
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,114
You're not
building anything, okay?

116
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,782
- I am.
- What's that
supposed to mean?

117
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,118
Hey, why are you two
still in the same room?

118
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,913
No, from here on in,
we do this thing aboveboard,
to the letter of the law.

119
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,416
And that means you two
don't so much as smile
at each other

120
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,793
on your way
to the ladies' room.

121
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,295
Fine, get her
out of here.

122
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,463
Debbie, can you deal
with slim here?

123
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,884
So, what is it
that y'all are doing
for us again?

124
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,302
Writing BIOS code.

125
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,763
It's "Basic Input
Output Software."

126
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,307
It's what first runs when
you turn the computer on.

127
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,475
So, like WordStar?

128
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,021
So, BIOS boots the computer,

129
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,648
which allows you to load
the operating system

130
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,942
and then you can
run WordStar.

131
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,986
So I can write a little love
letter to my boyfriend?

132
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,030
That right?

133
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,489
Yeah,
something like that.

134
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,576
Welcome
to the clean room.

135
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,792
You know, there's
a three-for-one sale
at Sanger's all weekend.

136
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,711
They got great stuff.

137
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,470
So, I have to stay here
while you write the--

138
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,181
The entire time?

139
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,017
Yeah, I'm legally required
to keep the clean room log.

140
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,729
Maintain the Chinese wall
between you and that
tainted engineer.

141
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,696
Okay, hey.

142
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,198
Listen up here, y'all.
Hey!

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,033
<i>I'm gonna catch up</i>
<i>on a few things here.</i>

144
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,952
All right, this here's
Joe MacMillan.

145
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,038
He is the new-- ahem--

146
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,874
Senior Product Manager

147
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,336
at Cardiff Electric's
new Personal Computer Division.

148
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,713
( chuckles )

149
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,550
Yeah, Joe comes to us
from IBM, sorta.

150
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,719
He's only been with us
a short while,

151
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,554
but he's already made
quite an impact.

152
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,723
- Joe, you wanna--
- Oh, thanks, John.

153
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,267
And I'd be remiss
if I didn't say

154
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,311
that it wasn't your faith,
your foresight,

155
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,729
and, if you'll excuse me,

156
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,399
your brass balls
that got us here.

157
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,401
( chuckling )

158
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,111
By moving forward
with this endeavor,

159
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,821
you have helped establish
Cardiff Electric

160
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,074
as an industry trailblazer
well into the 21st century.

161
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,118
<i>A round of applause</i>
<i>for John.</i>

162
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,536
<i>( applause )</i>

163
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,040
Now, you may have
heard some rumors
over this last week.

164
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,876
Perhaps you saw
some unfamiliar blue suits
in the building,

165
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,503
heard the same
whispers I did.

166
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,880
"Change is
about to come down."

167
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:30,427
Well, I'm here today
to tell you that those
rumors were true.

168
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,971
Change is coming
to Cardiff,

169

And if we get
one and two right,

178
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,123
well, we just might change
the way people work,

179
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,749
the way people live,

180
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,337

with each other.

- Gordon, hi, can I just
borrow you for a second?

185

we lower their barrier

the speed, we allow them

345
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,704
about that girl
or what she's capable of.

346
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,748
You're right.
Once she writes the BIOS code,
we should cut her loose.

347
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,874
What do you mean?

348
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,625
As soon as she finishes
the BIOS code,

349
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,544
there's no more legal threat,
we don't need her anymore.

350

Oh, well, okay, yeah.
Yeah, good.

Makes perfect sense to me,

352
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,676
but right now we need her
in the clean room.

353
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,636
Then you go down
and talk to her.

I'm not even supposed to be
on the same floor as her.

Look, if she's not at her desk
inputting keystrokes,

356
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,809
then she's not
writing BIOS code, okay?

357
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,603

her writing BIOS code.

00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,050
you be my guest.

505
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,344
But you just remember
it was me that computerized

506
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,429
your outhouse of a company
15 years ago.

507
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,432
Yeah?
Yeah, well, you were
a lousy receiver

508
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,019
whose ass rode the bench
better than he ever ran
a damn route, Carl!

509
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,775
( sighs )

510
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,653
Carl's a no.

511
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,030
Then assuming ADP
stays out...

512
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,494
15 accounts lost,
the top three of which

513
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,288
represent 68%
of our core billing.

514
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,249
Oh, God.

515
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,711
So, um, how severely
will these setbacks

516
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,463
affect the new PC program
in terms of--

517
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,259
Without these 15 clients,
and given it's current
overhead burn and size,

518
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,011
Cardiff Electric will be able
to maintain operation

519
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,472
for a little less
than two months.

520
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,101
Two months?

521
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,686
John:
<i>Did you get that, Gordon?</i>

522
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,439
- ( thuds )
- Two months?

523
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,191
John:
<i>Because what Alan is saying--</i>
<i>and I wanna be clear on this--</i>

524
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,986
is that IBM just sliced
our throats

525
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,906
and left us to bleed out
like a hog on a hook,

526
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,285
and come next week,
half those people out there,

527
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,662
they're gonna be out of a job,
out on the street,

528
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,872
because of your
personal computer.

529
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,542
You know this
would happen, though.

530
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,294
It's all part of the plan.

531
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,506
Tell me you
have a plan, Joe.

532
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,220
- ( sighs )
- Wow.

533
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,432
Wow.

534
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,268
You were just pretending.

535
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,061
You're like
one of those guys
who goes out

536
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,396
and reads
"Catcher in the Rye"
too many times

537
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,398
and then decides
to shoot a Beatle.

538
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,317
Only in this story,
I'm the Beatle.

539
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,569
Because you read
my article in a magazine.

540
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,279
You read my article
and you made a plan

541
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,240
and never once did you stop
to think that something like--

542
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:29,244
you just recited
your magic words
with a big, awful smile?

543
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,588
( crashes )

544
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,548

00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,426
Where is it?

546
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,428
Come on, where is it?

547
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,305
( crashing )

548
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,355
Joe?

549
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,484
( panting )

550
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,402
Where is she?

551
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,446
The BIOS.

552
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,574
What?

553
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,911
Where's the binder, Joe?

554
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,416
Please tell me you didn't
give her the binder.

555
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,628
<i>The assembly language code,</i>
<i>the IBM BIOS.</i>

556
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,547
Damn it, you wanted her
back on track!

557
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,840
Don't put this on me!

558
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,342
You basically told me
to give it to her!

559
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,594
We're going to jail.

560
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,430
We're not going to jail.
There's always another move.

561
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:33,308
There was. It was
don't give her the binder.

562
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,394
Maybe she's not gone.
Maybe she just stepped out.

563
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,271
Look, she's not here.
She's sure as hell
not at her terminal.

564
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,982
<i>And since we know absolutely</i>
<i>nothing about this girl,</i>

565
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,610
unless she's
in the ladies' room, we are--

566
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,744
Look at this.

567
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,787
The way she shortcuts the--

568
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,083
What a mess.

569
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,506
No. No.

570
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,677
No, it's brilliant.

571
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,056
It's brilliant.

That's a cassette system.

I could take a little
bit more off that for you.

Okay.

Why is this store
going out of business?

592
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,824
There must be a reason.
I want to know what it is.

593
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,951
Beats me. I mean,
the sound quality's great.

594

Sadly, I can't stay.

Headed back on
the 9:30 red-eye tonight.

610
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,342
Wanted to take care
of one last thing
before we left, though.

611
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:57,971
When you walked out,
you never gave formal notice.

Back wages.

613
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,852
You had some vacation days

I did over
$2 million worth of damage
to the data center.

618
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,534
Yeah, well, after
the insurance claim,

619
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,286
we ended up making money
on that deal, too.

620
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,043
Consider your IBM employee
file officially closed.

621
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:30,420
That is, unless
you come back with us
on the plane tonight.

622
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:36,009
We even booked you a seat,
just in case.

It's business class,
aisle.

624

Pretty nice.

00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,558
I like it here.

626
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,771
Well, I promised your old man
I'd give it a shot.

627
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,564
Hmm.

628
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,901
I'd say
he'll be disappointed,

629
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,487
but he's pretty
disappointed already.

really here for, huh?

of a boring box?

the binder to IBM.

- Yeah, can you blame us?
- Oh, so it's true.

Fantastic.

662
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,612
Not to worry,
IBM offered me a job,
triple the salary, so--

663
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,115
Excellent, excellent.
It's a great place to work.

664
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,741

- That's right.

00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,702
That's right,
you used to work at IBM.

667
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,662
That was before
you came here

668
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,581
and ruined several people's
lives and an entire company.

669
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,087
Before me,
you were boozing,
not building,

670
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:20,465
and your balls were in
a box by your wife's
bedside table.

00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,970
Stop it, man!

672
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,479
Holy shit.

00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,991

chase me.

676
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,086
I didn't care about
the New York Giants
like they did.

677
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,754
I cared about Sputnik.

678
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,507
I was nuts about it.
I was passionate.

679
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,137
Nobody told me yet
that adults

680
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,139
are supposed to be ashamed
of those feelings.

681
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:13,518
I learned that lesson
the night the Colts
beat the Giants.

682
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:18,023
'58 Championship,
greatest game ever played,

683
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,816
<i>and I didn't see</i>
<i>a single snap.</i>

684
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,777
<i>I was hooked up</i>
<i>to machines at St. Peter's.</i>

685
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:26,865
To this day,
I don't blame them.

686
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,450
I don't think they meant
to chase me off the roof.

687
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,167
After IBM, I went
across the country

688
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,794
just looking for answers.

689
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:43,923
I'd read your article
and I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

690
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,719
Open architecture,
the idea of it.

691
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,721
As a way of life.

692
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,974
It kept me up at night.
It made me that kid again,

693
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,809
and I tracked you
down to COMDEX

694
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,812
and watched
as they chased you, too,

695
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,732
and your beautiful machine
right off the ledge.

696
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,819
And you,
when I saw you,

697
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,989
everything about you
threatens people.

698
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,700
I thought that maybe
we could do this

699
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,370
precisely because
we're all unreasonable people

700
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,998
and progress depends
on our changing the world
to fit us.

701
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,710
Not the other way around.

702
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,714
I want to believe that.

703
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,302
I must believe that.

704
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,014
Tomorrow, I will
show up at 7:00 A.M.

705
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,683
and I will keep going.

706
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,811
You don't have
to join me, but...

707
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,523
something tells me

708
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,736
you both need this
just as much as I do.

709

710
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,184
Hey.

711
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,937
Greatest game ever played?

712
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:06,107
My dad used to tell me bedtime
stories about it as a kid.

713
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,361
Overtime, Raymond Berry's
12 receptions, all that.

714
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,533
The game
was December '58.

715
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:19,287
Sputnik came down
almost a year before that.

716
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,832
Is that right?

717
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:34,635
