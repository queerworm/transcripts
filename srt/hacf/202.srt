00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,219
<i>( planes roaring</i>

2
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,559
Heli-skiing in Bulgaria.

3
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,688
The chalet I stayed at
had beds like a Soviet prison.

4
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,357
But the snow--
oh, my God.

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,693
- Was your first job in oil?
- Hell, no.

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,695
My parents ran
a carpet store.

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,363
Worked there
into my 20s.

8
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,573
Oil was just
a stain to me.

9
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,159
Well, not to mention
that his main ambition

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,328
was bringing girls there
after hours.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,747
Remind me to kill my brother
for ever telling you that story.

12
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,542
- ( both laugh )
- What derailed
those big plans?

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,378
Well, there comes a time
when a man's gotta strike
out on his own.

14
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,505
- Store burned down.
- Okay, that, too.

15
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,549
<i>So, at 26,</i>
<i>unskilled,</i>

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,551
<i>I set out</i>
<i>to eat the world</i>
<i>for breakfast.</i>

17
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,387
The only job I could find
was managing the sludge

18
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,806
from a rubber plant
just outside of Cleveland.

19
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,642
My boss had me cut some corners
and the river caught fire.

20
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,228
- Cuyahoga River?
- 'Course I got fired anyway,

21
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,397
even though I just
worked for the guy

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,066
who was working
for the guy.

23
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,736
- The point being--
- It's always better
to be the guy.

24
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,738
That's my usual joke,
sweetheart,

25
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,156
but just to show
I can surprise you,

26
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,200
the point being

27
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,579
we all have to take our lumps
before we come into our own.

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,123
Makes getting there
all the more sweet.

29
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,125
So, you're in love
with my daughter, huh?

30
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,378
- Dad.
- What, you don't want
to know the answer?

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,631
Okay, he's impossible.
Just ignore him.

32
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,592
And she's an apple
from the tree.

33
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,468
Okay, I'm gonna go
say hello to Graham,

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,303
spare myself
the torture.

35
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,264
Get him to do
some work for a change.

36
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,475
He's supposed to be
fixing my Jeep.

37
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,811
I love your daughter
very much

38
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,481
because,
among other things,
she's skeptical, like you.

39
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,279
Then you won't mind
me asking you how you
intend to support her.

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,197
She won't accept
any help from me,

41
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,866
at least not
while I'm alive.

42
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,534
And the money
she makes from writing

43
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,661
is gonna be spread
pretty thin for two.

44
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,330
Don't worry,
I'm considering
several options.

45
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,792
- What about oil?
- ( chuckles )

46
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,627
Oil's all about
digging in the past.

47
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,545
I've never been
that interested.

48
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,214
Powering the world
isn't interesting
enough for you?

49
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,633
With a glut
on the horizon,

50
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,593
innovation's
bound to be slow.

51
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,304
If I were you,
I would be looking
to diversify.

52
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,847
Into what?

53
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,474
Something
forward-looking

54
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,851
with the potential
to change everything.

55
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,562
For me,
that's still tech

56
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,856
and will be
until proven otherwise.

57
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,735
Here's what
I think, Joe.

58
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,195
I think with your
checkered work history--

59
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,740
and that's the nice way
of putting all the things
I've heard--

60
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,284
you don't have a whole lot
of options right now,

61
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,829
in tech
or anywhere else.

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,831
With your
abysmal references,

63
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:48,293
I think you'd have
a tough time getting a job
selling waffle irons.

64
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,754
You'd really want to put
yourself through all that?

65
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,593
- Whatever it takes.
- I'm just stating
cold facts.

66
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,262
You won't easily
get a new job.

67
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,891
If I haven't
made myself clear,
I'm offering you one.

68
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,439
I don't know
who you think I am,

69
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,232
but I'm not
looking for charity.

70
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,401
And I'm not looking
to give it.

71
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,282
Today-- today
is dream lab day.

72
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,575
I'm gonna really
set 'er up, you know.

73
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,744
No more talking,
just action.

74
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,454
You know, I may
even teach myself C.

75
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,373
Who says
I'm only hardware?

76
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,792
Oh, in my spare time,
I really want to learn
to cook.

77
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,209
Like, you know,
really cook,

78
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,545
you know,
for all for us.

79
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,672
Any special requests
tonight, dear wife?

80
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,383
Huh?
Duck à l'orange?

81
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,718
Yeah, what?

82
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,678
Did you find
the crunchy--

83
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,304
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,598
I mean, sort of.

85
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,227
I went to the bank yesterday
to try and increase Mutiny's
credit limit.

86
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,729
The guy there
just laughed at me.

87
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,647
Well, uh,
how much you need?

88
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,774
Ha-ha, you couldn't
afford it.

89
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,735
Well, that's what
schmancy VCs are for.

90
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,820
Yeah, well,
if we can close him.

91
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,573
( groans )
I'm afraid without
longer term data

92
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,576
- he'll balk
at our projected growth.
- Hey, hey, hey.

93
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,829
Look, you always killed
your presentations at TI.
This is gonna be no different.

94
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,749
You just go in there,
you tell a good story
with confidence.

95
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,753
- Haley:<i> Daddy! </i>
- Oh, you know, you'd think
the house was on fire.

96
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,840
Flying in, babe!
( imitates airplane roar )

97
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,926
It has to be
re-entrant, recursive.

98
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,385
I mean, you never
need to branch

99
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,429
except to sequence,
select, or iterate.

100
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,931
- I don't--
- I'm trying to help
the graphics.

101
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,433
What, even if it makes
the network crash?

102
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,436
Do another rev in blocks,
and do it by tonight.

103
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,979
- Cameron, it's up.
- Yo-Yo:<i> Fine.</i>

104
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,941
What?
Why is this sequence
not done?

105
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,776
Cameron, we're live.

106
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,444
What?

107
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,364
Stand-alone messaging,
no game.

108
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,283
We're calling it
Mutiny Community,

109
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,327
but we're open
to something snappier.

110
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,456
How many hours
did this take you?

111
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,624
Not too many.

112
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,584
Donna, we talked
about this.

113
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,335
You can try this,
but we're falling
behind on games.

114
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,379
Wait, wait, shut up, shut up.
Look, our first user.

115
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,969
"No game, just chat.

116
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,679
Hi, how are you?"

117
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,723
<i>( music continues )</i>

118
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,647
Okay, can you please go
finish your game code now,

119
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,066
like what we actually do
at this company?

120
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,943
( door closes )

121
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,906
Oh, God.

122
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,993
I didn't expect a ticker tape,
but I could use a chair.

123
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,707
- ( grunts )
-<i> ( music stops )</i>

124
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,042
Oh, God.

125
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,961
Whoo, Jesus.

126
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,337
The first prison riot,
I broke both my ankles.

127
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,507
I shattered them.
They got me with
the water cannon.

128
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:44,678
They blasted me off
a second-story catwalk.

129
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,555
Pow!
Right on the concrete.

130
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,643
God dang, are you guys
buying any of that?

131
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,562
- ( all laughing )
- Jesus, what's wrong
with you?

132
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,773
How you doing, Bosworth?
Arki, meet a legend.

133
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,525
( speaks Russian )

134
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,028
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- When'd you get out, Boz?

135
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,488
Well, I tunneled out
a couple days ago,
by God,

136
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,949
but, uh, just had
to find me a shower.

137
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,409
I'm ready to go.
Come on, let's get
the party started.

138
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,454
- Where do I sit?
- Wait, you're working
here now?

139
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,749
- Awesome!
- Yes, sir. Just signed on
as employee number 17.

140
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,459
Yo-Yo:
<i>Did you learn how to type</i>
<i>while you were in prison?</i>

141
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,377
<i>( Bosworth laughs )</i>
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

142
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,547
<i>It's good here?</i>
<i>I'll sit there, for God's sake.</i>

143
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,509
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

144
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,583
You have
nosebleeds before?

145
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,417
No, not since
Garrett Faloona

146
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,128
used to punch me
on the playground.

147
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,506
You have
any other symptoms--

148
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,551
headache, nausea,
soreness of the joints,
anything?

149
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,678
No, no, not really.

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,723
I mean, I, um...

151
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,979
Back when we were chasing
deadlines on this computer
we were building,

152
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,065
mm, I used cocaine
for a brief spurt.

153
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,151
Okay.
How brief and how much?

154
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,612
Two, three months.

155
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,198
And, I don't know,
whenever we needed it.

156
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,450
We were
under the gun, so...

157
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,911
Cocaine is a tropane
alkaloid that can burn
your nasal membranes

158
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,914
if you don't die
from a heart attack
or a stroke first.

159
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,625
N-n-no, I stopped cold
three months ago. I'm--

160
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,129
Good. I'd hate to see
your daughters grow up
fatherless.

161
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,172
That would be sad.

162
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,174
Well...

163
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,218
no, I'm not
one of those people

164
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,845
that gets addicted
to stuff easily.

165
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,058
I can promise you that.

166
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,893
( sniffles )

167
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,521
You could've 
at least told me.

168
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,940
What? We're both
sick of playing boss.

169
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,524
I mean, as soon
as he gets up to speed,

170
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,152
he can take stuff
off our plates.

171
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,861
- He ran Cardiff
for 22 years.
- I know.

172
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,989
Mutiny is not Cardiff.
That's the whole point.

173
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,532
- I know.
- Cameron,
he's an ex-convict,

174
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,493
which is not exactly
the smartest hire

175
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,995
when we're in the market
for more funding.

176
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,955
And when we're
this strapped for cash,

177
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,665
you're gonna waste it
on somebody

178
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,960
that doesn't know a bitmap
from a baud rate?

179
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,879
Don't do this.
Don't threaten
what we're building here

180
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,674
out of guilt
or feeling sorry for him.

181
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,301
Donna, he stays.

182
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,182
We talked about being
in this together.

183
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,684
We talked about
communication being key.

184
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,021

204

were waiting for contact,

219
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,140
I didn't think you meant

If this is
too weird for you,

221

No, no.

223
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,065
I don't want you
to be unhappy.

224
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,692

Okay, so you have put up
chess, checkers, backgammon,

284

"Tank Battle,"
and "Parallax."

285
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,314
And ignoring the first three
because who cares about those?

286
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,274
That's two games
in 15 months.

287
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,984
Not exactly
in a hurry, are we?

288
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,070
Well, "Parallax" actually
has 21 chapters,

289
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,113
each one with
a totally different world.

290
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,032
- So it's not--
- Yeah, my nephew
got hooked on it.

291
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,659
- That's why I took
this meeting.
- Cool.

292
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,454
But then he got bored
around chapter, uh, 13

00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,249
- when the giant
ice squids...
- Crabs.

...ate the Eskimo palace
or whatever.

295
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,378
He said it's fun to play
with other people,

296
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,463
but the game itself--
you know, pfft.

297
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,258
It's nowhere near as good
as what Atari's been
popping out.

298
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,635
I think if your nephew
understood coding
a little better,

299
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,263
- he'd think "Parallax"
was pretty cool.
- Ahem.

300
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,475
Um, look, cartridge games
may look better for a while,

301
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,185
but online gaming
is the future.

302
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,354
Only if there's a profitable
way to sustain it.

303
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,023
That's exactly right.
And that's why we're here.

they're out there?

306
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,697
Only 10% of Americans

307
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,990

313
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,130
There's a whole

314
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,425
Oh, yeah,
with proof like that,
how can I argue with you?

315
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:12,054
Look, Mr. Bondham,
if we had the capital
to buy 10 11/750s--

316
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:16,309
- 35 grand a pop, used.
- 32-- 32, plus additional
funding to cover operations

317
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,602
through the end
of the fiscal year,
then I think--

318
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,270
What about kids?

319
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,064
- Hmm?
- Excuse me?

320
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,610

321
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,614
- No.
- I have two.

322
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,198
What does that
have to do with it?

323
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,075
Well, when I invest
in a company,

324
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,287
I don't just bet on an idea,
I bet on the people.

00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,543
Joe MacMillan?

334
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,712
Yeah, uh, hello.

335
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,339
Hey, Eugene Bowdich.
Welcome to Data Entry.

336
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,507
I'll show you
to your desk.

337
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,426
I was on 23
for orientation

338
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,178
and HR told me
to come down to B2

339
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,596
and I think
there's been a mistake.

340
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,807
Oh, no mistake.
You're on my clipboard.

341
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,727
Now, Westgroup Energy,
if you're not aware,

342
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,645
is really
a parent corporation

343
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,522
to nine wholly owned
subsidiaries,

344
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,483
and we do DE
for all of them.

345
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,194
Color-coded baskets,
redundantly labeled,

346
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,112
correspond
to different inputs.

347
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,574
The process of digitizing
the company's records

348
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,076
was begun in 1974,

349
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,287
though clearly since then
we've made great strides.

350
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,584
Does Jacob know this
is what I'm working on?

351
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,294
You mean Jacob Wheeler?

352
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,715
Uh, never mind.

353
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,175
All right,
any questions?

354
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,178
So, it's--
it's just--
it's, uh...

355
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,768
d-done by hand?

356
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,103
Oh, no, we use optical
character recognition,

357
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,188
which-- which
we correct by hand.

358
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,608
For particularly
naughty images,

359
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,777
you might even get to use
the Big Kahuna over there.

360
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,153
But you'll have
to ask me first, okay?

361
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,782
Okay?

362
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,618
- Okay.
- All right.

363
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,620
Please clock out
at the end of your shift,

364
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,623
and we labor to keep
the bathrooms tidy.

365
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,916
I trust you'll comply.

Jeez, Gordon,
you're gonna break

- ( game explosion )
- You see? Right there.

372
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,523
You should be dead,
not me.

373
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,692
It's like the timing's off
or something.

374
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,152
<i>Here, come on,</i>
<i>let's go again.</i>

375
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,654
There's more
in the drawer.

376
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,280
No, thanks.

377
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,157
I'm surprised
you're still--

378
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,659
I mean, I thought
it was just a goof

379
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,160
when we were finishing
the Giant Pro.

380
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,830
It was, Stan, jeez.

381
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,498
Look, I found some
left over.

382
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,541
What am I supposed to do,
throw it away?

383
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,752
You know?
Come on, let's just play.

384
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,504
Okay, wait--
hey, this time,

385
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,923
okay, on three,
fire your tank.

386
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,591
Ready?

387
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,678
One, two, three.

388
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,931
Damn it!
What is going on here?

389
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,351
I mean, we--
something's going-- we both
saw that I fired first.

390
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,855
I mean, there's gotta
be some sort of glitch
or something in the--

391
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,523
Why don't we take a break?
Maybe grab a beer?

392
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,650
No, I gotta call Donna
and tell her about this.

393
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,235
I mean, this is one
of their flagship games.

394

397
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:04,537
Uh, well, I guess
I'll just go over there.

398
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,831
- You okay to drive?
- Yeah, of course I'm
okay to drive.

399
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,583
Oh, shit!
Stan, will you
help me out?

400
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,210
Will you go pick up
the girls from school?

401
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,295
- What? No.
- What do you mean no?

402
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,548
I mean, I haven't seen 'em
in, like, two years.

403
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,718
( sighs )
Well, here, look.

404
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,720
You can figure it out.

405
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,514
Here, and feel free
to buy 'em some snacks
or something.

Very clever, ladies.
Very clever.

Man, that was awesome.
Did you see the look

- Man:<i> Yeah, perfect. </i>
- Man #2:<i> Priceless.</i>

415
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,938
That's a fire hazard.

416
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,691
- Hey, where's Donna?
- Whoa, look who's here.

417
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,444
Shouldn't you be in Tahiti
or something with all the money
you just made?

418
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,696
Look, there's a major
problem with "Tank Battle."
The game's not fair.

419
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,406
Dude, we've got
bigger headaches
right now.

420
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,616
And it's a good thing
Cameron isn't here.

421
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,409
Oh, yeah, lucky me.

422
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,953
Listen, there's times
when I fire at my opponent

423
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,996
and the game doesn't
read it and I get killed.

424
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,832
Oh, wow, well,
couldn't it be that you're
just shooting second?

425
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,918
No, Stan and I fired
at the same time
over and over

426
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,711
and even when I cheated,
the results were random.

427
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,504
Hey.
( knocks )

428
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,590
Your system's reading inputs
from multiple modems, right?

429
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,508
- Duh.
- So in a given game cycle,

430
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,885
the token checks them
one at a time

431
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,303
to see who fired
their tank.

432
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,305
- We know this, man.
- Okay?

433
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,640
And if you're saying
whoever's fire command

434
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,475
happens to be next in line
when the token sweeps it

435
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,936
is awarded the kill,
then you're right.

436
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:55,022
Congratulations.
But every user shares
that hazard equally.

437
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,776
But it doesn't
reflect who shot first.
I mean, it's random.

438
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,654
What's the point
of playing a game
if the outcome is random?

439
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,531
Look,
it doesn't matter, okay?

440
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,450
I got a fix for ya.
( clicks tongue )

441
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,368
Aren't you just
the hardware guy?

442
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,704
Well, I'm also degree-
in-computer-science-
from-Berkeley guy,

443
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,790
where Donna went,
with honors and top grades
that'd make your penis shrivel,

444
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,501
so maybe if you shut up
for a second, you could
learn something.

445
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,795
You time-stamp the input
from each individual modem

446
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,089
and at the end of each
complete token pass.

447
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:23,092
You put them
in the correct time sequence
before you execute them.

448
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,760
- That way,
whoever shot first...

<i>yeah, we're supposed</i>
<i>to call first.</i>

I can take heat from my wife,
I'd just prefer not to.

465
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,731
- Two months.
- Look, one month, okay?

466
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,067
Deal, you little rats.

467
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,029
I mean, they don't want
what's next or vision,

468
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,906
they want an Adam's apple.

469
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,742
Well, at least what we wore
didn't matter.

470
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,202
Hey.

471
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,166

prankin' going on, sure.

- Cameron?
- What?

00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,212
You should see this.

You might want to go

- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

481

It's exactly

I can see that.
Where did you get this?

A friend of a friend
copied it from his friend,
free.

ripped off "Parallax"
and is just giving it away.

Very cool.
I was kind of hoping

497
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,845
it would find
its way to you guys.

- Mr. Rendon--
- Tom.

499
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,098
Mr. Rendon, we appreciate
your business

500
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,017
for the last 10 months,
but you can't just
copy our game

501
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,517
and expect
to get away with it.

502
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,645
Well, I didn't
just copy "Parallax,"

503
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,189
I made it a whole lot better,
and if I wanted to get
away with it,

504
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,691
I might've, you know,
not s-- not signed it.

505
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,861
My point is you have
to stop or we'll be forced
to take legal action.

506
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,279
Oh, okay.
All right.

507
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,281
Well, I run IT at
Chatham &amp; Watkins downtown,

508
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,907
so I can help you
find a good lawyer.

509
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,118
Oh, you think
this is a joke?

510
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,954
What, you think a couple
of girls won't sue your ass
into the ground?

511
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,123
No.

512
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,625
You won't sue me
because then you're
gonna make me mad

513
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,836
and then I'm not gonna
tell you how to make
your game better.

514
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,963
- You guys wanna come in?
We could have a couple beers.
- Okay.

515
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,132
- I can lay
everything out for you.
- Listen, you might think

516
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,634
you made the game better,
but we do games online.

517
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,762
Yes, six colors,
that fluid scan, it might
work on a Commodore,

518
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,597
- but if you want
to do it across phone--
- I get it! I get it.

519
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,225
I get it.
You don't want
to use spaghetti code,

520
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,600
you want to make
more with less.

521
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,061
That's the real art
of it.

522
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,063
Have you ever tried
page flipping, dithering?

523
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,315
- No, I'm new to coding.
- Combined with anti-aliasing?

524
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,775
Don't do it all on C.
You'll also cut back
on memory.

525
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,073
( sighs )

526
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,910
Beer offer still stands
if you want that tutorial.

527
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,913
Okay, look, just don't
do it again, okay?

528
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,206
Or we're gonna have
a serious problem.

529
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,250
Yes, ma'ams.
Mea culpa.

530
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,293
I hereby cancel
my subscription.

531
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,890
Mm, I don't even
want this anymore.

532
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,600
Dudes, mother lode.

533
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,811
It's to Cameron
from Boz.

534
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,647
Bet it's the last one
he sent from jail.

535
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,149
- What are you
gonna do with it?
- What do you think?

536
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,111
Boz went out for smokes.

537
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,862
Wait, won't that ruin it?

538
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,239
I can fix it.

539
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,366
Did it to my sisters
for 13 years.

540
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,659
( speaks Russian )

541
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,661
Come on.

542
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,164
Yo-Yo:<i> Nice.</i>

543
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,627
( imitating Bosworth's voice )
"Dear Cameron..."

544
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,964
- ( all laugh )
- "...I'll keep this short

545
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,259
'cause I know or hope
I'll see you soon.

546
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,303
More of the same
with Johnson.

547
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,097
I won't burden you again
with that whole mess.

548
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,724
I'm just trying
to put it behind me."

549
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,810
Oh! Cue appropriate
butt sex joke.

550
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,686
( all laugh )

551
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,356
"I think about
my wife, Cameron.

552
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,152
Ex-wife, I mean.
And I think about my sons,

553
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,695
if they'll know me
when I get out

554
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,115
and, God,
if they'll want to.

555
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,992
That's what
hurts the most.

556
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,369
That's the real knife
to my heart."

557
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,872
- Hey, uh, maybe
we should stop.
- Why? It's too good.

558
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,374
Yeah, man,
let's just forget it.

559
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,667
- ( scoffs )
- Bosworth:<i> Go on.</i>

560
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,087
Finish it.

561
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,843
Go on.

562
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,976
( normal voice )
"Was what I did worth it?

563
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:09,313
Honestly, I think so.

564
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,106
Am I good
in the eyes of God?

565
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:15,361
Maybe this is terrible,
but I don't really care.

566
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:19,823
It's me inside
that matters, not Him,
push come to shove.

567
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,075
Sorry to lay
all this on you,

568
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,329
but you're all I got
to talk to,

569
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,832
the light
in this dark hole.

570
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,750
Boz."

571
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,420
What the hell
are you doing?

572
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,467
We were just
goofing off.

573
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,055
Get out of here.
Go home.

574
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,057
This is where I live.

575
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,185
Then go someplace
I can't see you for
a long time, okay?

576
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,242
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

577
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,203
You know, we really
work well together.

578
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,372
Maybe we should
start another project.

579
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,332
Maybe I could
even fund it.

580
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,125
At least till it gets
off the ground.

581
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,378
- You'd do that?
- Yeah, why not?

582
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,922
Man, that'd be sweet.

583
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,341
But I'm headed up
to good old NorCal.

584
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,094
But-- California?

585
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,182
Do you have a job
lined up?

586
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:30,018
Nope, just rolling
the dice.

587
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,854
Booked my ticket the day
I got my pink slip
at Cardiff.

588
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,982
Mm.

589
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,820
A lot of big dogs
out there, Stanny.

590
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,781
You know,
eat or be eaten.

591
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,950
Yeah, well, good,
'cause I'm hungry.

592
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,287
- Ruff, ruff,
you other mutts.
- ( chuckles )

593
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,124
Ah, you don't need
a partner, Gordo.

594
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,334
I'm sure whatever
you dream up will
be incredible.

595
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,422
L-let's play
another round.

596
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,967
I'm sure they've
got it recoded by now.

597
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,094
All right, on three.
No cheating this time.

598
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,138
All right,
line 'em up.
Ready?

599
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,516
Both:
One, two, three.

600
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,480
Why the lag?

601
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,814
That's weird.

602
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,065
Low user volume,

603
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,525
each on
a dedicated line?

604
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,486
I mean, the delay
should be imperceptible.

605
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,987
Nothing near this bad.

606
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,822
I wouldn't pay
for this crap.

607
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,990
The idiots
must've messed it up.

608
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,992
Now the game
sucks even more.

609
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,453
Amit and Wonderboy:
One, two, three.

610
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,337
I don't understand.
The new time-stamp code

611
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,214
should only take an extra
100 milliseconds, tops.

612
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,550
How many users
we got online?

613
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,970
- 132.
- Uh, yeah,
check again, dumbass.

614
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,140
- I'm showing 80 live modems.
- Lev:<i> Wait a second, hold it.</i>

615
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,934
There's code in here
that we didn't write.

616
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,146
What?
What's going on?

617
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,564
Someone hacked
into "Tank Battle."

618
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,983
They added bytes that
let multiple users

619
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,067
play on a single
phone line.

620
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,195
( laughs )
This is awesome.

621
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,571
Like a kid when he buys
a movie ticket

622
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,906
and then passes it
back to his friends.

623
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,201
How many hacks
are there like this?

624
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,496
Here's one that's allowing
12 users on a single line.

625
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,456
12-- wait, what?
How did this happen?

626
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,500
Do you guys
have back doors
in your code?

627
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,004
- Yeah, we always use some--
- Did you tell anyone
about them?

628
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,381
No, no, of course not.

629
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,591
Okay, look, look, just--
we'll delete the bytes.

630
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,302
No free rides.
And then we'll talk
about security.

631
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,929
Wait, wait, hold on.

632
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,599
If the hacks are from a user,
I think I can trace them.

633
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,230
( knock on door )

634
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,445
How'd you do it?

635
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:49,658
- What?
- No, just tell me, okay?

636
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,368
You stole money
out of my pocket

637
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,245
by getting 12 modems
to share a single phone line.

638
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,038
You owe me
how you did it.

639
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,085
I built a PBX in software,
my own private branch exchange.

640
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,336
And 12 is nothing.

641
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,629
I'm working on
three times that.

642
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,674
If Mutiny could do that,

643
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,427
it would make
our overhead per user
that many times smaller.

644
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,470
You do that
in your head?

645
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,141
You want to know
what I think?

646
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,060
If it doesn't
take too long

647
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,104
'cause I really
don't want to burn
my chicken.

648
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,231
You're good at this.
I mean, you could be
hacking into anyone.

649
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,566
But are you?

650
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:26,653
CompuServe? GEnie?
I don't think so.

651
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:30,949
I mean, I think
you're only cloning our games
and hacking our network.

652
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,120
So either you spend
all your time hating us

653
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,456
or you really love
what we do.

654
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,293
- Who says it takes
that much time?
- I do.

655
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:45,130
I checked our top-10 users
last month based on hours
spent online.

656
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,548
You were number four.

657
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,972
I could set up
a software PBX for you.

658
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,599
Hell, I could set up 50.

659
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:59,144
( laughs )
Are you asking
for a job?

660
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,147
No, no.
I like my job.

661
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,399
I do.
It pays well,
the hours are good.

662
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,318
I work on games
in my spare time.

663
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,487
Okay, just because you
ripped off "Parallax"

664
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,738
does not make you
a game designer.

665
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,990
There's still
the actual concept,

666
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,242
the original invention.

667
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,703
You know, not just
sprinkling fairy dust on what
somebody else has created.

668
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,706
Since I don't want the job,
can I not have the lecture
as well?

669
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:23,585
Okay? Give me a call
if you want that PBX.

670
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,712
Okay.

671
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,183
I talked to three
different lawyers today.

672
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,726
They said the worst
thing we could do

673
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,353
is go confront
Rendon ourselves,

674
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,522
so I hope you didn't
do anything stupid.

675
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,318
He's hacking us
to get our attention.

676
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,403
And I think
he's the real deal.

677
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,033
( groans )
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

678
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,161
but I think
we should hire him.

679
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,246
He's interested.
He gave me his resume,

680
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,290
but I wanted to talk
to you first, so...

681
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,672
You already hired him,
didn't you?

682
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:12,175
Great.
I spent the entire afternoon
planning our legal strategy.

683
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,220
What an efficient use
of resources.

684
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,763
( sighs )

685
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,475
What did you
offer him?

686
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,603
$25,000.

687
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,524
Make it 20.
He'll take it.

688
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,609
I called the law office
where he works.

689
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,653
Once I told them
what he was up to,
they threw him under the bus.

690
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,446
His last two performance
reviews have been awful.

691
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,532
They were
gonna fire him anyway
and he knows it.

692
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,077
And if you
want to pay him more,
you can give him my salary.

693
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,247
Because if you keep making
unilateral decisions like this,

694
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,833
I will not be
sticking around, okay?

695
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,460
Yeah, okay.

696
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,464
And thank you.

697
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,768
( phone rings )

698
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,437
- Hello?
- Hey, how was your day?

699
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,606
( laughs )
Oh, no, no, no.
You first.

700
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,775
How was your day
at the office, honey?

701
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:13,278
Good, we're
computerizing records,

702
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,363
getting everything
archived.

703
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,241
And?

704
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,244
And, well, sometimes

705
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,664
I get to use
the microfiche machine.

706
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,250
<i>Not to be sneezed at.</i>

707
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,295
You, uh,
need approval.

708
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,382
All right,
this is my fault.

709
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,218
Oh, come on.
Of course it isn't.

710
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,806
Yeah, he's punishing you
for Peter.

711
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,683
What do you mean?

712
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:47,395
Peter--
he hooked my father,

713
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,314
got him deep
on a few deals.

714
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,524
<i>One in Zurich</i>
<i>and this other thing.</i>

715
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,903
<i>But nothing ever materialized.</i>
<i>The deals weren't real.</i>

716
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:58,406
All told, my father
lost a few million.

717
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,326
And this all happened
right before we got divorced.

718
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,412
<i>My father</i>
<i>let his guard down</i>
<i>because of me,</i>

719
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,707
<i>and Peter never</i>
<i>paid him back a penny.</i>

720
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,337
How come you never
told me that?

721
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,839
Because I--

722
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,467
I hate myself for it,
you know?

723
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,719
I-- I didn't want you
to see me as a victim

724
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,806
or an idiot.

725
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,892
But, you know, I'm gonna--
I'm calling my father
right now.

726
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,853
He has no right
to do this to you.

727
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,688
<i>No, Sara, wait.</i>

728
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,483
I've been stewing
about this all day.

729
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,360
I thought there
had to be some reason.

730
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,697
Well, now it's clear--
your dad is testing me.

731
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,740
He wants
to take my measure.

732
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:44,410
<i>And after</i>
<i>what you just told me,</i>
<i>if you were my daughter,</i>

733
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,329
<i>I would do</i>
<i>the same thing.</i>

734
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,624
Yeah, but it's stupid.
It's a waste.

735
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,292
You know, I'm not
gonna let you just--

736
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,711
<i>I won't, don't worry.</i>

737
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,339
I'm a big boy.
I'm learning a lot.

738
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,844
So we can just
let this breathe a sec.

739
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:01,928
Yeah?

740
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,724
Okay.

741
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,475
<i>Uh, one more thing.</i>

742
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,811
With what
I'm getting paid,

743
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,856
a two-bedroom in North Park's
not gonna happen.

744
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,400
( laughs )

745
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,736
I don't care.
I mean...

746
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,320
we could
pitch a tent.

747
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,865
I'll see you at home.

748
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,951
I love you.

749
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,538
Yeah, me, too.

750
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,919
Gordon:
<i>Should I call 'em?</i>

751
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,004
I'm really excited
for you guys to taste this.

752
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,839
( chuckles )

753
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,717
I saw
the takeout containers
in the trash, Gordon.

754
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,429
- Just testing.
- ( Donna laughs )

755
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,015
You like Sal's
cacciatore, right?

756
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,809
Hey, at least your obsession
with "Tank Battle" paid off.

757
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:53,312
My coder monkeys said
you came by, that your
time-stamp fix was genius.

758
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

759
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,442
I took a little break
from work, so...

760
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,945
Oh, sure, you did,
sexy beard.

761
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,864
Our log says you were online
for nine hours.

762
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,825
Hmm, well,
I must've left it on.

763
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,370
Anyways, the way
those nitwits coded it
made the problem even worse.

764
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,496
Did they show you
the delay?

765
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,957
Yeah, but that was
because of Tom,

766
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,709
this user
who hacked our system

767
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,545
who Cameron wound up hiring
after he ripped off "Parallax."

768
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,464
Sure, makes sense.

769
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,299
Good to know
she's still insane.

770
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,468
Well, apparently,
he had this breakthrough.

771
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,971
It's a software PBX
that allows up to 50 users

772
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,680
to play on
a single phone line.

773
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,725
- That would be huge.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

774
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,727
I'm tempted to go back
to that VC jerk

775
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,647
and see if it'll change
his mind, but I can't
bring myself.

776
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,565
How many potential users
are out there for Mutiny?

777
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,318
Now you sound like him.
Gordon, there's no way to know.

778
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,487
But isn't that critical?
I mean, it'll affect
your valuation

779
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,780
for the next round
of financing.

780
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,657
Yeah, but there's
no crystal ball.

781
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,366
Yeah, no, but, Donna,
maybe there is.

782
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,953
Look, you need a map
of the existing network.

783
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,330
Mutiny only sees a subset
at any given time,

784
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:56,375
but what if-- what if
anyone who could log on,
legitimately or not,

785
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,877
did it at the same time?

786
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,338
How many people
would that be?

787
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,674
-<i> Gordon! </i>
- Look, I gotta
get started on this.

788
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,051
- Eat without me!
- ( sighs )

789
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,780
You know, you can work here,
but you cannot live here.

790
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,824
( laughing )

791
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,078
Yeah.

792
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,749
Your letters
meant a lot to me.

793
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,129
The last one you sent,

794
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,048
you signed it Catherine.

795
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,766
Cameron was
my dad's name.

796
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,770
I started using it
after he died.

797
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,859
And I used to write letters
to him in Vietnam,

798
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,778
so I must've written that
by mistake.

799
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,829
Listen, Boz...

800
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:18,666
you can't just keep stuffing
envelopes around here.

801
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,835
I mean, our books
are a mess.

802
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,628
Accounts retrievable,
that whole thing--

803
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,505
Oh, come on, you know
it's "receivable."

804
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,924
No, no,
I don't know that.

805
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,051
Look, I suck at this.

806
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,930
We need you
to take a look at it,
work some CEO magic.

807
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,140
Plus we need help
raising money.

808
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,560
I mean, we'll get you
an office, we'll get
you your own corner--

809
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,187
Catherine.

810
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,902
I just need some time
to work some stuff out.

811
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,030
Get my head straight.

812
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,784
- Boz.
- Oh, come on,
as smart as you are,

813
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,203
I think I know myself
a little bit better
than you do.

814
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,708
My God, it's beautiful,
you lettin' me work here.

815
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,879
But I--

816
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,513
I'm just ready
for it, not yet.

817
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,850
How long do you need?

818
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,688
Honestly,
I don't know.

Was there a note?

822
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,541
Yes, sir.
It was stuck inside.

823
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,211
- Read it,
Caroline, will you?
- Of course.

824

<i>It just says,</i>
<i>"Thank you for</i>
