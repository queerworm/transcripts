15

17
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,115

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,633
a few last-minute tweaks
in the Mutiny contract

24
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,677
and I want it out the door
by this afternoon.

25
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,596
I was just going over it.

26
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:39,850
Um, specifically
what kind of tweaks
are we talking about?

27
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:43,812
But jumping Mutiny's
hourly rate from $3 to $5
would hamstring their growth.

28
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,856
- Say they have a bad month--
- That's not our problem.

29
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,190
According to
Business Development,

30
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,484
the going
market rate is $5

31
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,570
We have to set a precedent
for our future clients.

32
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,196
It's all found money
to Westgroup.

33
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,365
What difference
does it make if we offer
a temporary exemption?

34
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,620
Why are you so anxious
to give this company
a break, Joe?

35
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,664
I hope it's not
your past relationship
to the founder.

36
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:07,086
Absolutely not.
Mutiny's our pilot program.

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,546
We both took a risk.
They got a corresponding
discount.

38
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,926
Look, I like Cameron,

39
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,720
but I liked the deal
you pitched me a lot more.

40
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,640
A bunch of companies
give us free money

41
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,435
to use our network
when we aren't.

42
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,646
You're my
building manager, Joe.

43
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,024
And I only want the tenants
who pay the highest rent.

44
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,779
Jacob, I respectfully
disagree.

45
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,907
With Mutiny,
I see our role
as much more hands-on.

46
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,994
This is a company
with a real potential
to innovate.

47
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,745
There's a lot
of talent there,
but it's raw.

48
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,748
It needs shaping,
guidance.

49
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,374
That's where we come in.

50
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,502
Okay, start out at $5.

51
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,587
<i>Go down to four,</i>
<i>if you have to,</i>

52
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,798
but 3.50
is the absolute bottom.

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,634
If they don't sign,
move on.

put your feet
to the ground,

62
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,996

showed up.

63
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,666

- ( giggles )
- Yeah, thank God they got
their mother's looks.

67
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,551
Hey, Jody, Michael,
take your cousins
to the back and--

68
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
- New trampoline!
Come on!
- Wow!

69
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,262
- I'll go.
- It's really bouncy!

70
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,141
- Michael:<i> Come on,</i>
<i>you guys! </i>
- Ah.

You all right?

72
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,895
You up and flew
out here awful fast.

73
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,063
Not that I'm not
thrilled to see you.

74
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,523
- Yeah, yeah.
- Huh?

75
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,027
- We'll get into it
a little later, yeah?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,904
Tada.

77
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,989
Oh, thank you
for getting those.

78
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,950
Joanie practically refused
to go to California
without 'em.

79

00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,797
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just have to get to work.

83
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,218
Well, I'm glad you
at least took the morning.

84

You looked tired
as a dog, for one thing,

85
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,681
and I haven't even heard
from you since Easter.

86
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,391
Gordon's been by
with the girls--

87
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,852
Yeah, well, Gordon
has a thing called
free time.

88
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,942
How about you tell me
what's really going on?

89
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:39,320
Is it you and Gordon?
Are you two having
problems again?

90
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,451
I, uh--

91
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,290
I was pregnant,
but I, uh, lost it.

92
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,584
I... miscarried.

93
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,837
Oh, my God, Donna.
Honey, I'm so sorry.

94
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,257
You know, I-- wait,
I wasn't very far along

95
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,592
and I was waiting for
the right time to tell Gordon,

96
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,136
but then it...

97
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,016
You know, it's okay.
It wasn't planned.

98
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,019
Like you said,
I'm so underwater
with work as it is

99
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:16,024
and Gordon and I are
already practically leading
separate lives, so...

100
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,698
You know,
it'll get easier.

101
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,367
But it'll take time.

102
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:33,167
I love
the children we have.

103
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,629
You know, it really wouldn't
have been fair to them.

104
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,135
It was a really special time
when they were small,

105
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,971
but we are in
a different place now,

106
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,766
our family
feels complete,
and so...

107
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:53,270
maybe in a way--
maybe this is what's best.

108
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,108
10 bucks says
they're at it right now.

109
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,985

you think I'd be back here

00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,031
- Well,
time-sharing's not that new.
- Time-sharing's just a way in.

171
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,658
CompuServe
started as a division
of a life insurance company,

172
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,119
then got bought by H&amp;R Block
who wanted to diversify.

173
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,789
Now it's a 500-pound gorilla
in the world of commercial
online service.

174
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,042
Who knows where Westgroup
can take it from there?

175
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,128
Yeah.
So, how are you guys
handling security?

176
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,922
Are you multiplexing
them in from an SNA network

177
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,715
from the modem banks
with task-switching--

178
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:55,387
Comes a time when vision
meets engineering--
you hire people.

179
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,848
Thanks for the coffee.

180
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,318
So, you've said
your party line,
I've said mine.

181
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,904
Let's cut the posturing
and we'll get down to
the real number.

182
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,408
- $5.
- Donna:<i> Joe.</i>

183
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,659
- It's $5.
- No.

184
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:23,457
No, this is where you say
4.50 and then I say 3.50,

185
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:27,668
and then eventually
we settle on four,
which is fair.

186
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,255
$4.

187
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,761
$5.

188
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,764
This isn't a negotiation.

189
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,267
You started
at a promotional rate.

190
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,478
- I'm sorry,
this isn't a negotiation?
-<i> That promotion is over.</i>

191
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,895
If you don't agree
to the $5 terms,

192
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,232
- Westgroup is moving on.
- Moving on?

193
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:54,028
- That's-- that's not--
- Charity? No, it's not.
This is a partnership.

194
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,865
Jacob Wheeler isn't interested
in a typical landlord-tenant
relationship with you.

195
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,744
<i>He wants to work</i>
<i>with innovative companies</i>
<i>who are agile and committed.</i>

196
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,871
$5 is the ante
for this table.

197
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:08,918
If Mutiny can't compete
at the going market rate,

198
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,670
maybe it shouldn't be
in the game.

199
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,431
<i>( Donna crying )</i>

200
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,275
Donna?

201
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,235
Donna?

202
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,154
( crying continues )

203
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,698
This is bullshit!

204
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,994
Joe, this is bullshit!

205
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,955
All you own is time
on a network.

206
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:50,627
What entitles you
to have an opinion about
anything that we do here?

207
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,796
What makes you think
that you can question
our commitment

208
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,508
- for one dollar an hour?
-<i> ( glass shatters )</i>

209
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,301
- Calm down.
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

210
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,718
God...

211
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,891
Maybe being in bed
with a billionaire--

212
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,935
I'm sorry, with
a billionaire's daughter
makes you think

213
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,064
- that you can jerk us around
for your own amusement...
- Donna.

214
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,941
...but this is real to us.

215
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,444
So it's $4, Joe.

216
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,737
It's $4.

217
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,035

223
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,683
He's bluffing.

224
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,982

anything
you need, okay?

227
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,369
Anything at all,
you just say the word, okay?

228
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,121
And the girls,
they can come
stay with us,

229
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,830
or I could fly out
if you need, you know?

230
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,958
- Yeah, yeah.
- Jesus, Gordon.

231
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,460
Hey, hey, hey.

232
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,587
Seriously, it's okay,
all right?

233
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,380
I know it's a shock.

234
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,466
I shouldn't have
laid it all on you
at once like that.

235
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,469
Jesus, I'm sorry.
I should be the one
comforting...

236
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,974
What can I do?

237
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:32,061
Hey, Henry,
you're already
doing it, okay?

238
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,439
It's all right.

239
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,817
Oh.

240
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,987
Donna must be a mess
with all this going on.

241
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,075
Actually, uh,
she doesn't know.

242
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,578
- Gordon--
- Look, you have no idea

243
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,330
what the last year
has been like.

244
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,915
I mean, you know,
her work's taking off,

245
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:57,545
you know, and it's
driving her, you know,

246
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,215
like-- well, like mine
used to, you know?

247
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,385
She's happy, okay?
She's energized.

248
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,304
And she'd stop everything
to take care of me

249
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,931
and I can't ask her
to do that.

250
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,559
Not-- not yet,
at least.

251
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,824
So, um, if we had to
switch back to XTs,

252
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,408
how long would
that take?

253
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,744
We're not gonna
have to do it.

254
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,456
Okay, but just
in case we do,

255
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,542
- just round number it for me.
- Look, I'm sorry, okay?

256
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,251

Okay, okay, okay.

265

- Come on, Donna.

268

of our contract just
shut our company down

negotiation skills!

Oh, come on,
that doesn't seem right.

Yeah, I'll just crawl
into Henry's old window,

305
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,469
scare his kids,
leave mine alone.

- Yeah.

She lost it.
Now we're dead.

All Donna did was behave
like you do every day

for it like usual.

318

- You know, maybe
you didn't like it...
- I never--

319
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,927
...because it was like
looking in a damn mirror!

320
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,015
People have other things
going on in their lives

321

don't know about.

something?

325
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,817

this work means
a lot to me.

And if we accept your deal,
we're risking our survival,

331
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,299

we could scramble
for months

to try and find
another network.

333
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,136

what you want, is it?

335
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,646
- If this
is about Cameron--
- It's not.

336
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,024
Then to pull the plug
over one dollar,

337
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,484
that's what you do
when you're trying 
to get out of a deal.

338
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,653
Which is where
we find ourselves now.

339
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,077
Well, I can't leave here
until we work this out,

340
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,204
so you tell me.

341
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,206
What can I do?

342
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,629
( exhales )

343
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,926
Maybe-- uh, maybe I could
find some wiggle room
on the price

344
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,721
if Mutiny met
a few, um...

345
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,765
strategic benchmarks.

346
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,767
Benchmarks.

347
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,894
<i>For example,</i>
<i>when I log onto Mutiny,</i>

348
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,105
the main screen,
it's boring.

349
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,566
There's a company in Houston
that has news and weather
as soon as you log on.

350
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,318
<i>Delphi has</i>
<i>a travel agency.</i>

351
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,361
There's an outfit
in Galveston

352
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,781
that has a stock ticker
updated hourly.

353
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:21,368
That's the kind of thing
that makes me the user
want to stay longer.

354
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,496
We can do that.

355
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,873
<i>Another thing--</i>
<i>check out the messaging</i>

356
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,584
available on something
like IBM's Vnet.

357
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,462
Mail programs
have been around
for over a decade.

358
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,673
Exactly.
Why doesn't
Mutiny have one?

359
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,215
Because that's not--

360
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,303
We can do mail

361
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,931
and we can
do the interface,

362
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,392
and if we do...

363
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:50,272
He's not gonna like it,
but I, uh, bet I could
get Jacob

364
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,027
to shave off a buck
for one last thing.

365
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,946
What?
What is it that you need?

366
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,950
Mutiny currently
runs exclusively
on Commodore 64s, right?

367
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,536
64s will be
boat anchors by '88.

368
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,288
In the meantime,
UNIX is poised to explode.

369
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,958
<i>If Mutiny could port</i>
<i>to a machine that runs UNIX,</i>

370
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,879
say the new AT&amp;T box,
I think I could justify
a lower price.

371
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,590
But UNIX
is a completely different
operating system.

372
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,843
That's a major
coding overhaul--

373
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:23,597
In fact, I would go
so far as to plug you
back in right now,

374
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,392
- ink the contract
at $5...
- But--

375
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,645
...and add a provision
that once you meet
these benchmarks,

376
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,398
we'll drop it down
to 3.50.

377
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,655
I'll see what I can do.

378
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,116
UNIX?
Christ.

379
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,118
I think he knew
he wanted these benchmarks

380
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,786
before he ever came
over here this morning.

381
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,580
It was all
just about leverage.

382
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,333
Yeah.
Well, I guess it was
a negotiation after all.

383
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,586
But the AT&amp;T
isn't even in color.

384
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,046
Hey, let's look
at the bright side.

385
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,882
I guess we'll have
stock ticker and mail now.

386
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,551
Great, we'll be
bleeding edge for 1979.

387
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,386
You know,
there are blueprints
to build mail out

388
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,138
because it's been
around forever.

389
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,639
It wouldn't
take that long.

390
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,976
- Cool. Thanks.
- Just trying to help.

391
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,771
Look, I just-- I don't know 
what choice we have.

392
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,400
You could fake UNIX.

393
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,444
Make it look like Mutiny
is running on the AT&amp;T,

394
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,820
get your better rate
locked in now,

395
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,530
actually go multiplatform
at your leisure.

396
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,575
I talked to him this morning
and he knows the script, sure,

397
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,327
but his actual tech knowledge
is really limited.

398
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,205
If you get him in here
tomorrow morning

399
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,665
and you sit him down at a demo,
and if it looked real enough--

400
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,586
No, the boot and interface
screens for the 64 and the AT&amp;T
are completely different.

401
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,256
Yeah, but we can paint
the screens however we want.

402
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,260
I mean, write a Commodore
program that makes it look
just like the AT&amp;T.

403
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,930
But Joe would know that porting
to an OS like UNIX would take
longer than 24 hours.

404
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,556
Would he?

405
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,560
What, you're gonna
say, "Bad idea"?

406
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,438
It is a bad idea.

407
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,774
So we run the demo
off a C64

408
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,943
and we don't invite him
till tomorrow night.

409
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,749
The goal is simple:
replace the guts
of this AT&amp;T box

410
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,295
with those of a Commodore,
hook up the video cards inside
to the monochrome CRT.

411
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,257
When Joe boots up,
he'll think he's running UNIX,
but really it'll be our 64.

412
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,758
A wolf in UNIX clothing.

413
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,011
Okay, screwdriver.

414
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,308
The thing only has enough room
for an internal serial modem.

415
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,144
How the hell are we supposed
to fit an external
Hayes box inside?

416
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,313
- Let alone
the Commodore cards.
- We could lay the cards flat

417
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,231
and connect them out
the back with ribbon cables.

418
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,650
The metal connections
will touch the case
and each other

419
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,902
- and short everything out.
- We could put cardboard
between.

420
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:46,364
Well, then we'll
have a cooling problem,
if we can even fit the fan.

421
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,702
Unless we don't
even use a fan.

422
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,037
Yeah, we just turn it on
before he gets here

423
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,830
and kick him out
before it melts.

424
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,791
Or you could just
take your time,
do it for real.

425
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,837
Well, we don't have
that kind of time
at $5 an hour.

426
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,173
So it's about price,
it's not about Joe.

427
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:06,010
No, it's about both.
It's about not letting him
dictate our vision.

428
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,596
But couldn't this make
Mutiny better, these things
that he wants?

429
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,019
All right,
I'll leave you to it.

430
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,527
Ah.

431
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,779
You always were
the prodigy.

432
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,824
Mm, not with
transmissions.

433
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,994
You always kicked
my ass at those.

434
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,499
( groans )

435
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,004
You think that stuff
made you sick?

436
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:46,717
Maybe, but that
time in the shop made me
an engineer, you know?

437
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,053
Guts in a machine equals
guts in a machine.

438
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:54,641
You know, I bet Dad wishes
you had stayed behind
to run the shop.

439
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,977
Hey, why don't I borrow
your truck tomorrow?

440
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,855
I'll head up
to Sacramento,
talk to Dad?

441
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,899
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

442
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,360
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.

443
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:08,822
Um, I should warn you,
though, that some--

444
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,367
some jag-off backed into it
a week or so ago

445
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,035
and so there's
just one headlight.

446
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,204
I know.
I'll be careful.

447
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:20,542
- It's really good
to see you, brother.
- Yeah.

448
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,512
( engine stops )

449
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,150
Hey, thanks
for meeting me.

450
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,610
Not a problem.
So where you wanna
have this talk?

451
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,322
Hop in.

452
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:53,033
-<i> ( bird screeching ) </i>
- Gordon: So, how often
during the work week?

453
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,743
Well, a little less
since that bar fight,

454
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:58,164
but probably still
three, four days,

455
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,790
often before noon.

456
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,460
- Does Wendy know?
- Oh, she knows.

457
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,670
And the truck?

458
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,298
He stayed
till after close
a couple weeks ago.

459
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,758
Next day,
he said he swerved
to avoid a deer.

460
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,594
Yeah, I called my dad.

461
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,055
Although, it was a rabbit
when he heard that story.

462
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,310
- ( Gordon exhales )
- ( sighs )

463
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:23,730
So, anyway,
that's the boring-ass story
of your alcoholic brother.

464
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,733
If you've heard enough,
I think I'll get home
to my kid,

465
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,153
stop narcing on
my high school boyfriend.

466
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,072
( chuckles )
Hell, I got weed
in my purse right now.

467
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:36,035
- Call myself a mother.
- ( laughs )

468
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,661
( sighs )

469
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,835
What?

470
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,505
I'm sure you're
a great mother.

471
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:51,133
I was also thinking
how great weed sounds
to me right now.

472
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,177
Tom:
<i>The external modem</i>
<i>is not gonna fit.</i>

473
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,430
The box, it's big enough,
but it's not tall enough, okay?

474
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,849
The L clips
on the 64 serial port,
they're too high.

475
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,267
We had to hacksaw
them down.

476
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,977
Yeah, but an external modem
will give it away.

477
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,021
We can't...

478
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,648
Could we fake
an online connection?

479
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,651
Have Joe
dial into the network,
but he's actually just linked

480
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,072
to another Commodore
in the house?

481
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,033
- I have completely
corrupted you.
- That's a great idea.

482
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,826
But what cable's
gonna be fast enough

483
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,995
and also not completely
give it away by being
out in the open?

484
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,206
<i>( Donna hisses, sighs )</i>

485
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,791
Wait, what if we--

486
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,002
Carl, did you guys
ever get the HBO working?

487
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,339
Uh, kind of.
Like, we watched
"Cat People" the other night.

488
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,798
You could see
about half a boob,
which we--

489
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,884
Oh, my God!
The coax.

490
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,177
- Lev:<i> Yes. </i>
- 10BROAD36.

491
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,179
We can use
Ethernet encoding.

492
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,390
Plus-- plus, the cable's
already hidden along
the walls.

493
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,016
We can just adjust it
where we need to.

494
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,102
We'll still need
to hear a modem, though.

495
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:47,481
- Bodie?
- Yeah?

496
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,233
Do you still have
that little recorder?

497
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,527
Okay, go record
the modem connecting.

498
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,154
Then we'll pull out
the recorder's power switch,
we'll run wires up it,

499
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,198
- stash the whole thing
in the AT&amp;T--
- Someone pinches the wires

500
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,992
- and then it triggers
the recording.
- Bodie:<i> On it.</i>

501
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,579
- Okay, how much time
do you need for the coax?
- Two hours, tops.

502
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:06,792
Gordon: Oh-- oh, my God,
I was so paranoid after
that first experience.

503
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,336
I think I stopped
getting high till college.

504
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,005
( laughs )
And then you
made up for it.

505
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,633
<i>I totally made up for it.</i>
<i>It was Berkeley.</i>

506
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,886
Yeah, yeah, you were
always the smart one.

507
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:22,766
If I was so smart,
why'd you go out
with Henry?

508
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,768
I was 16.
He was the cute one.

509
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,106
- Oh, jeez!
- ( laughs )

510
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,025
He was never
as funny as you.

511
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,987
Henry could
catch a pass,

512
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,615
but you always
had us cracking up
in the stands.

513
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,952
Jesus.

514
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,746
What?

515
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,874
It's just been
a long time

516
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,210
since anyone's thought
of me as being funny.

517
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:57,176
You know,
it's so interesting
who we grow up to be.

518
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,723
Have you ever thought about
who you could've been

519
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,643
if you'd have taken
a different path?

520
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,313
Sure.

521
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,816
So, what are you saying,
you should've done
something else?

522
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,445
Stayed here?
Sold tractors off the 5?

523
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,573
You got nothing
to complain about.

524
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,450
Yeah.

525
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,913
God, it feel so good
to just sit here

526
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,500
and do the wrong thing
with you.

527
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,549
<i>( lighter clicks )</i>

528
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,758
Well, I don't
want to keep you.

529
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,470
I'm sure you got better
things to do than sit
in the back of a truck

530
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,931
and just listen
to me babble on.

531
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,060
Yeah, actually I do.

532
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,606
I'm having
a good time.

533
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,983
Okay, log on.

534
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,194

535
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:43,198

539

Not bad.

540
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,008
Yeah,
for monochrome.

541
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,594
- Go ahead, play something.
- Whoa, hang on.

542
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,930
I wanna--
I wanna see mail.

543
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,808
Uh, so it's inside the game,
so select what you wanna play.

544
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,812
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, and now find Lev
on the user list.

545
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,522
I'm NewWaveLev.

546
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,399
Okay, then hit Alt+M.

547
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,568
( keys clack )

548
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,696
- Donna:<i> Mm. </i>
- This is still Community.

549
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,450
Exactly.
We built the mail client
on top of the existing code.

550
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:30,663
So if a user is online,
they get the message instantly,
and if they're offline--

551
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,831
Lev, sign off--

552
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:38,629
and, "What hath
God wrought?"

553
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:41,423
Okay, now, Lev,
sign back on.

554
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,718
( computer beeps )

555
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,345
Now.

556
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,514
That's very clever.

557
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,267
Okay, so,
that's everything
you asked for.

558
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,561
Looks like it.

559
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,897
Wait, wait, wait.
I've got a game open.

560
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,608
I want to play it.

561
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,235
Yeah, go-- play it.
Go ahead.

562
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,446
( beeping )

563
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,659
Hmm.

564
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,285
Here, try something else.
There's--

565
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,621
No, I want
to play chess again.

566
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,210
( beeping )

567
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,424
- What about--
- One more time.

568
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,926
( beeping )

569
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,724
Hmm.
I find it remarkable

570
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,933
that three different
human Mutiny users

571
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,812
opened with the same
King's Indian defense.

572
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:40,982
It's almost as if
they were programmed
to do so.

573
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,901
Oh.

574
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,613
Oh.

575
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,784
Your computer is melting
to the table.

576
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,370
Here.

577
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,207
- ( grunting )
- ( computer case creaking )

578
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,218
Interesting.

579
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,722
I've never seen a Commodore
like this before.

580
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,766
Must be
an exclusive model.

581
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,019
And look...

582
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,106
there's no modem.

583
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,110
We're not even online.

584
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,031
UNIX.

585
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,992
You couldn't do it.

586
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,453
Oh, it's not that
we couldn't do it,

587
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,664
we just thought
it was a waste of time.

588
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,374
But you did have time
to animate the games,

589
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,084
gut the box,
fake the data.

590
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,425
How are you
streaming it?

591
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,687
- Joe?
- What? What do you want?

592
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,355
You want to insult me again,
say I'm a bad guy,

593
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,983
a bait and switch artist?
I put you on the network.

594
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,278
I handed you a deal
my boss didn't want
you to have.

595
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,700
Don't do this
to me again.

596
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,744
You did this
to yourself.

597
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,914
What kills me about it
is you're so much
better than this.

598
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,249
( engine starts )

599
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,344

601

<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

602
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,053
I have to tell you
something.

603
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,766
Well, this night
took a turn.

604
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,145
- Hey.
- What?

605
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,857
Can I be honest
with you?

606
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,735
Gordon, I'm a big girl.
I know what this is.

607
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,739
There's something
wrong with me.

608
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,783
Tell me something
I don't know.

609
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,118
No, there's something
wrong with me.

610
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,247
It's in my brain.

611
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,542
I've had problems
with my hands

612
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,460
and my speech.

613
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,213
I may not ever
be the same.

614
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,425
I mean, it may
even get worse.

615
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,510
Gordon, I'm sorry.

616
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,846
- I--
- I'm scared.

617
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,640
Like, I'm really scared.

618
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,227
It's okay.

619
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,689
I mean, it's okay
to be scared.

620
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,441
I'd probably
be scared, too.

621
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,527
Part of me
wanted to believe

622
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:17,240
that if
I didn't say anything,
it wouldn't be real.

623
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,618
But the weight of it...

624
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,160
I understand.

625
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,830
You can't imagine
what it's been like.

626
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,707
I mean,
what does this mean?

627
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,085
- You know,
what about my kids?
- Gordon, I--

628
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,712
Am I gonna wake up one day
and not feel my legs?

629
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,464
Are they gonna have
to put me in a home?

630
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,550
I mean, Jesus, Jules,
I could die.

631
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,552
And I haven't even
told my wife.

632
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,555
- What?
- I can't, her job.

633
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,224
I've been carrying
this all alone.

634
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,393
Okay, stop.
Stop.

635
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,065
Gordon, what are you
doing right now?

636
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,942
Nothing.
We're just talking.

637
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,153
No, no, you're dumping
all this on me.

638
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,530
- Wait, what?
- Wait, is that
what this is?

639
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,491
Is that why
you brought me
out here?

640
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,868
- So you could
unburden yourself?
- No.

641
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,037
Look, if you wanted
someone to talk to...

642
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,583
- Wait, Jules.
- Oh, my God.

643
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,377
I'm grateful to you.

644
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,131
- Grateful?
- Yeah.

645
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,632
( scoffs )

646
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,469
Jules.

647
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,995
( turns engine off )

648
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,915
<i>You know, Donna,</i>

649
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:52,210
<i>Mutiny might be done.</i>

650
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,754
I mean, we might not
exist tomorrow.

651
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,385
So if you're doing this
for the company...

652
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,185
That's not why
I'm doing this.

653
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,778
Do you want me
to come with you?

654
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,282
It's all right.

655
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,785
Thanks.

656
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,996
Yeah.

657
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,321
( crying )

658
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,199
Look, I don't know, Dad.

659
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:07,994
Hey, what happened?
You okay?

660
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,289
- Where were you?
- Come here.

661
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,458
Henry:
<i>She woke up and didn't</i>
<i>know where you were.</i>

662
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,795
I tried Dad,
but I guess you
didn't make it.

663
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,172
Yeah, I had to stop

664
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,174
and talk to Jules
about a few things.

665
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,968
- You kidding me?
- Wendy:<i> Henry.</i>

666
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,886
Yeah, like hell
you were just talking.
( sniffs )

667
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,513
Yeah, you smell like weed
and you also smell like--

668
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,433
Henry!
What is going on?

669
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,186
What's going on is
my brother's a selfish prick
and he always has been.

670
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,021
Hey, get ahold
of yourself.

671
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,399
I thought you were driving up
to talk to Dad to help me out.

672
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,401
I did talk to Dad
on the phone before
I went to Duffy's.

673
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,403
He said that you leveraged
the shop into the ground

674
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,656
over the past three years
and pissed away half
the customers.

675
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,242
- That's bullshit!
- Look, he's worried
about you, Henry.

676
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,494
- I'm worried about you.
- Okay, so let me get this
straight.

677
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,788
So you-- you bang
my ex-girlfriend,

678
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,748
cheated on your wife
because I drink too much?

679
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,708
Listen to me,
we were just talking.

680
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,752
Now you're lying
to my face!

681
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,173
You can't stay
here tonight.

682
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,091
Hey, listen, Henry,

683
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,010
the whole reason
that I flew out here--

684
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,595
Please,
just leave, Gordon.

685
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,850
- Just go.

686
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,104
Oh, come here, sweetie.
Come here.

693
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,959

-<i> Haley, it's okay.</i>
<i>It's okay.</i>

694
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,088
Gordon:
<i>Honey, it's me.</i>
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

695
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,049
Hi, I'm here.
Is everything okay?

696
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,176
No, it's Haley.
She woke up.

697
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,386
There's some
bedtime thing you do.

698
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,681
- She said it'd help if--
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
It's...

699
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,809
Does she have Jinx?

700
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,313
<i>Yeah, she's lying down</i>
<i>with him now.</i>

701
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:02,067
Okay, put the phone
on the pillow next to her.

702
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,654
Hey, come here.
Come here.

703
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,534
<i>Hey, hey, baby girl.</i>
<i>You okay?</i>

704
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,452
- Mm-hmm.
-<i> Okay.</i>

705
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,789
You listen really
carefully now,
all right?

706
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,875
Mm-hmm.

<i>( humming continues )</i>

714
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:13,554
Two days ago
you told me that I was
the building manager

715
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,890
and that our involvement
with our network partners

716
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,559
ended at the rent
we charged them.

717
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,771
I disagreed,
so this is what I did.

718
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,774
I gave Mutiny
a very specific
set of benchmarks,

719
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,692
goals I wanted
them to achieve

720
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,279
in exchange
for a reduced network
rate of $3.50 an hour.

721
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:32,407
- The floor you specified.
- I'm sure you did.

722
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,742
This is beginning to feel
like a pattern, Joe.

723
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,536
- How am I supposed
to trust you if every--
- Here's what happened.

724
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,165
They completed
the first two
in 24 hours.

725
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,541
The third they deemed
a waste of their time,

726
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,043
but they didn't
tell me that to my face.

727
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,129
Instead, they decided
to try and deceive me.

728
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,589
Now you know
how it feels.

729
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,134
Here's the interesting part.

730
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:54,471
Just to avoid doing it,
they ended up using

731
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,848
a sophisticated
Ethernet encode

732
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:01,894
and streaming data
over line they were using
to steal pay television.

733
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,022
The technology
is called broadband.

734
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:08,401
So new it's only being
used in a couple college
campuses and military bases.

735
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,863
Commercially it's too
expensive and there's not
nearly enough line laid, but...

736
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,407
- But?
-<i> 10 years from now,</i>

737
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,535
it'll likely make
modems irrelevant.

738
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,538
These kids rigged it up
on their own in a day.

739
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,667
So what's
your point, Joe?

740
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,130
I think we should
acquire them.
