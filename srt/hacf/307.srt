00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,742
Hi, hi.
Welcome to California.

3
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,703
- Friendly state.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,959
Hey...
we're married.

5
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,460
Hmm.
All right.

6
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,295
No, no, no, no.
No, wait.

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,588
I want to do this
right, okay?

8
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,590
- So--
- Oh, no!

9
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,301
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Yes, yes!

10
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,094
- Okay.
- Don't. Put me down.

11
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,472
Okay. I'm trying
to be romantic, okay?

12
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,599
Just-- just
for the record,

13
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,476
this is my house,
you're unemployed,

14
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,478
and this is an absurd,
sexist tradition.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,146
- Ouch.
- What?

16
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,815
I was just kidding
about that employed thing.

17
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,107
I know, I know.
I think I--

18
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,150
I think I pulled
something.

19
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,278
( sighs )

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,199
Can we cross
the threshold together
like not crazy people?

21
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,659
- Okay.
- Okay.

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,372
- That was easier.
- Mmm.

23
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,541
Good call...

00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,126

00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,712
We should celebrate.

Uh, um...

86
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,342

the Citadel software

I want
the blow-by-blow.

101
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,586
- I did what you
told me...
- Mm-hmm.

102
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,421
which was
to say nothing,

103
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,716

00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,426
Good. Now that you're
out of there, we can--

105
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,428
But Ken
didn't fire me.

106
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,430
What? Why not?

107
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,640
What did he offer you?

108
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,226
He didn't
offer me anything.

109
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,728
Not yet.

110
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,521
It's probably best
if we don't talk

111
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,397
or see each other
until this is over.

112
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,696
Okay.

113
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,489
Look, Ryan,
you're the weak link
in all this.

114
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,492

to get to me
is through you.

Tom:

116
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,462

even like bowling--

there's a knock
at the door.

But, no, it's Cameron,

122
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:19,189
and she has this
look on her face.

123
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,358
I'll never forget it.

124
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,361
What happened next?

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,365
( laughs )

126
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,492
Okay, so you had
the honeymoon
before the wedding.

127
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,412
- Mm-hmm.
- Ha!

128

( coughs )

129
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,083
And, uh,
how did you propose?

130
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,169
- Technically, I didn't.
- Yeah, I proposed to him.

131
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,545
- Mmm, no.
- Donna:<i> Mm-hmm?</i>

132
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,880
Technically,
you didn't either.

133
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,883
- Yes, I did.
- No.

134
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,719
Yeah, at some point,
Cam said...

135
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,015
"I wish it could be
like this forever."

136
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,518
And I said,
"Uh, it could be."

137
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,398
And she said,
"But you won't move
to California."

138
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,817
And, um, yeah.

139
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,528
And then he said,

140
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,572
"I won't move
to California
for a girlfriend,

141
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,451
but I would move
there for my wife."

142
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,328
And the next day we found
a Justice of the Peace.

143
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,497
Oh, my God.
Gordon, isn't that
romantic?

144
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,625
What?

145
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,211
Tom and Cameron's story.

146
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,840
Right.
Um, congratulations.

147
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,510
- Okay.
- Thanks. Cheers.

148
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,270
So, um,
you gonna come
work at Mutiny?

149
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,729
Uh, actually, no.

150
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,815
We decided
that's what killed things
last time, so--

151
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,526
you know, mixing
a relationship with work.

152
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,448
Really?

153
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,575
And by that,
I mean that lots
of couples do that,

154
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,204
and it's great.
It's just-- it's just
really not for us.

155
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,206
But I'm gonna
swing by on Wednesday

156
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,666
to say hi to the guys.
I cannot wait to see

157
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,418
the looks on their faces
when they hear.

158
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,585
- They're gonna be shocked.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,587
You know, Bos has really
kept this under his hat.

160
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,798
Hmm.

161
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,144
Ahem.

162
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,232
<i>( faint barking )</i>

163
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,242
Bos.

164
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,577
Look, I know full well
I should've come in
last night.

165
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,873
I'm listening.

166
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,544
Have you heard
of the Midas Touch?

167
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,089
Well, I got the...
opposite of that.

168
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,093
I'm on the outs
with my ex-wife
and my son--

169
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,470
hell, practically
everybody I did business
with back in Texas.

170
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,514
And to top it all off,

171
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,640
I did 14 months
in a federal prison.

172
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,813
I thought
you should know that...

173
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,316
before I cross
this threshold.

174
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,072
La Tuna, right?

175
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,950
Outside El Paso,
medium security?

176
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,035
You really think
I'd go into business
with a company

177
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,621
and not do background checks
on all of its key players?

178
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,677
So, you think of me
as a "key player"?

179
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,763
( chuckles )

180
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,307
Just give me
the damn flowers

181
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,144
and stop making problems
where there aren't any.

182
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,146
<i>( water splashes,</i>
<i>stops )</i>

183
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,955
Look, I just--
I wanted to--

184
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,707
Donna, look,

185
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,419
we weren't keeping it
just from you, okay?

186
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,087
Tom's mom
only found out
last Friday.

187
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,089
Oh. No, I get it.

188
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,715
It must have been fun

189
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,219
having a secret
nobody knew about.

190
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,721
Yeah, a little.

191
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,973
Would have been nice
to get a heads up

192
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,724
you were moving out,
though.

193
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:28,687
- The girls really miss you.
- Yeah, I regret that.

194
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:36,737
Look, it's just,
I...

195
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,408
haven't had
the easiest time
trusting you lately.

196
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,411
No, I know.

197
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:47,248
I think
that's probably

198
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,750
because I lied
to you.

199
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,837
I hate it.

200
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,924
It's been uncomfortable
and awful,

201
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,093
and I just--
I hate it.

202
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,931
Yeah.
( exhales )

203
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,393
I wanna trust you
again.

204
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,769
I do. I-- I-- I want
things to go back

205
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,481
the way
they used to be
between us.

206
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,776
I miss it.

207
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,779
I miss it, too.

208
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,410
So, where does that
leave us?

209
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,745
Can we just
start over?

210
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,294
( sighs )

211
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,753
Yeah.

212
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,260
Yeah, let's just...
have a fresh start.

213
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,761
- A fresh start.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:49,185
So, in the spirit
of complete honesty,

215
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,729
I've been giving it
a lot of thought,

216
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,733
and I really think
we should go public.

217
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:03,241
Okay. Well, I'm not
completely opposed to it.

218
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,825
- You're not?
- No.

219
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,829
I mean, we're in
the land of the IPO.

220
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,291
If I wasn't open to it,
I would've just stayed
in Texas.

221
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,833
Imagine having
the resources

222
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,295
to take the company
wherever we wanna go.

223
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,132
Yeah, I have
a pretty big
imagination.

224
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,718
I'm counting on it.

225
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,098
Donna, you're here.

226
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,225
So, after last night,

227
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,727
I haven't been able
to stop thinking

228
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,061
about all the things
we can do

229
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,854
to upgrade Mutiny
before the IPO.

230
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,231
I wrote down
some ideas,

231
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,275
and I think we should
get started right away.

232
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,113
- Oh, wow.
There's a lot here.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

233
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,700
It's like once I started,
the floodgates opened.

234
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,328
Well, you've obviously
put a lot of thought
and effort into this.

235
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,873
I did, yeah.
It totally reconfigures
Mutiny and SwapMeet

236
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,793
while returning them
to their roots,

237
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,796
excising everything that's bad
and keeping what's good.

238
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,590
Oh, and, yeah,
it takes us beyond
the Commodore

239
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,467
onto other platforms
which we have to do.

240
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,469
That became obvious
around 5:00 a.m.

241
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,054
Other platforms, right.

242
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,431
How long do you
see that taking?

243
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,685
A year.
Maybe two.

244
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,894
But the goal is
to do it right.
Right?

245
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,399
I'm sure everything that
you've outlined here is great.

246
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,109
I am.

247
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,278
But we can't afford
to wait two years.

248
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,613
Sure we can.

249
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,324
The timeframe for the IPO
is three months.

250
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,743
Three months?

251
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,370
No one ever
said anything
about three months.

252
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,163
Why is that suddenly
the magic number?

253
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,749
Because we have
an acquisition offer
in hand.

254
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,543
People are paying
attention to us right now.

255
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,795
But what we have
right now is broken.

256
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,632
What we have right now,
CompuServe thinks is worth
$20 million.

257
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,926
Yes, but if we make
the improvements
the way I know we can,

258
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,179
we'll be worth
$100 million.

259
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,639
I thought we were
in agreement on this.

260
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,349
We still can be.

261
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,728
Okay, look,
I really hate
to play this card,

262
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,605
but as head
of the company,
I'm saying

263
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,774
that we'll need
to put the brakes
on any IPO

264
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,068
until we get
our house in order.

265
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,406
Okay, how about this?

266
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,366
I will read this
more closely

267
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,410
to get a better
understanding of what
you have in mind--

268
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,370
Great. Okay.

269
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,996
And if there's anything
you don't understand,
just ask me.

270
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,833
Um, I promise,
this is the way to go.

271
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,591
( sighs )

272
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,342
I just got off
the phone with "Forbes"

273
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,968
and it doesn't sound
like a generous piece.

274
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,345
They're asking me
questions about WestGroup,

275
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,432
questions about Cardiff,
questions about IBM.

276
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,974
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

277
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,143
Listen,
they've clearly
got an angle

278
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,480
and it is not one
that is favorable to me.

279
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,149
- I'm calling you back.
-<i> ( phone beeps )</i>

280
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,526
I guess you talked
to your lawyers.

281
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,074
Wow. This is...

282
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,161
not what I expected.

283
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,039
I sure do love
that couch.

284
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,167
I take it
you used a designer?

285
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,004
And, hey, me and Donna
have this same vase.

286
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,006
- Pier 1, right?
- It's not a vase.

287
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,051
I commissioned that
from Kayako Sakaniwa,
a Tokyo artist.

288
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,013
- Hmm.
- She calls it
"Serenity."

289
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,016
Gordon,
I imagine you have
some questions...

290
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,603
- beyond the decor.
-<i> Not really.</i>

291
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,021
You obviously wanted
to get fired.

292
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,816
I've seen
that move before.

293
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,610
It's, uh-- it's
more complicated
than that.

294
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,028
Yeah?

295
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,615
Shocker.

296
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:35,453
Man, this is one
kick-ass view.

297
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,622
You can see
the bridge from here.

298
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,750
I'll bet you
get back every dollar
you put into this place.

299
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,795
Hell, I might even
buy it from you--

300
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,549
the furniture,
the Serenity vase--

301
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,717
the whole
kit and caboodle.

302
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,135
I never wanted you
not to profit.

303
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,263
"I, Joe MacMillan,

304
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,432
stole the code
to our security software

305
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,643
from Gordon Clark
of Clark Computers.

306
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,062
<i>Everything</i>
<i>I've earned is his."</i>

307
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,065
It's the most truthful thing
you've ever said.

308
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,362
Honestly, I was moved.

309
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,364
I never figured you
for a sore winner.

310
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,574
Me, either,
but it's nice to know

311
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,117
we can still
surprise ourselves.

312
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,244
So, what do you say
we cut through the bullshit

313
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,038
and you just tell me
what your angle is
in all this?

314
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,088
The truth is--

315
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,758
and this is
the truth--

316
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,553
I have come
across something
that I am convinced is--

317
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,097
well, it's something
that I really believe in,

318
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,558
and we'll leave it
at that.

319
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,727
But I couldn't convince
my board of its value,

320
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,187
so I ignored them,
I moved forward,

321
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,565
and just like that,
I lost my company.

322
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:50,194
I was out of moves,
and then it occurred to me,

323
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,071
what if it wasn't
my company?

324
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:58,118
So, you screw over
your evil corporate overlord

325
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,580
by parachuting
your stake out to me.

326
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:05,585
Okay, I get that...
sort of.

327
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,212
How do you come out on top
in this scenario?

328
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,422
I don't.

329
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,131
Everything I had
is yours.

330
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,133
If you feel like
I deserve a percentage,

331
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,135
well, that is
entirely up to you.

332
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,766
So, your plan was for me
to just give you the money?

333
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,392
After you stole
everything from me?

334
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,019
You wrote the code,
agreed,

335
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,397
but I offered you
partnership<i> twice,</i>

336
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,233
and you turned me down
twice.

337
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,569
I have to think
that you're not so myopic

338
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,154
that you can't see
that I might be entitled
to a little return

339
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,157
for turning it into
what I've turned it into.

340
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,118
This is
an interesting piece.

341
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,248
And whose work
is this?

342
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,794
Joe:
<i>Mine.</i>

343
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,548
<i>Gordon, to be clear,</i>
<i>you don't have to</i>
<i>give me anything.</i>

344
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,675
Thanks for making
that clear.

345
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,176
But I built
an entire company

346
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,470
and I've just
handed you everything.

347
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,641
All I am asking for
is basically a finder's fee.

348
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:08,230
Joe, I really do
like this piece.

349
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,607
What do you call it?

350
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,612
It's an abstract.

351
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,196
Yeah?

352
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,199
'Cause it seems to me

353
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,201
like one of
those paintings

354
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,204
that the more
you look at it,

355
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,499
the more it seems
to come into focus.

356
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,086
<i>Gordon, I know</i>
<i>this is a leap of</i>
<i>faith on my part,</i>

357
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:34,214
but faith is somethin'
I'm workin' on.

358
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,800
Faith is a--

359
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,929
faith is
a valuable thing.

360
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,181
I'd just look
for somewhere else
to place it.

361
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,852
Thanks for
the company, Joe.

362
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:52,232
-<i> ( doorbell rings )</i>
- Donna.

363
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,234
Is everything okay?

364
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,444
Cameron's gone off
the deep end

365
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,237
and I don't know
what to do.

366
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,824
She came in
today with this
Mutiny manifesto

367
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,617
that will kill
the IPO.

368
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,243
And she's
committed to it.

369
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,247
She did everything
but nail it to my forehead.

370
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,250
Maybe I should
take the night
to read this over.

371
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,920
Why wait?
Why not read it now?
I can wait.

372
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,421
Because I think
she's tryin' to stop you

373
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,257
from figurin' out
I'm here.

374
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,719
Oh! Bos!

375
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,846
I-- hi.

376
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,473
- Oh, hi.
- ( chuckles )

377
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,768
It's a relatively
recent development.

378
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,273
But if you're
worried about
Cameron finding out,

379
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,567
I haven't
talked to her
in over a month.

380
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,276
So, say what
you came to say.

381
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,863
- This is a lot.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

382
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,365
- How long to implement?
- A year. Maybe two.

383
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,326
That's a long time
to wait.

384
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,328
Why is she
against the IPO?

385
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,289
She's not, and
that's what makes it
so frustrating,

386
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,542
but it's what happens
with Cameron--

387
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,293
and, Bos,
you can back me up--

388
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,670
she gets
in her own way.

389
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,296
It's a little more
complicated than that,

390
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,799
but I suppose
that's part of it.

391
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,300
So, what do you
want to do?

392
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,386
I don't know.

393
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,305
Cameron acts like
she's majority shareholder,
but she's not.

394
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,016
She's got more votes
than anyone,

395
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,309
but not more votes
than everyone.

396
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,687
I'd prefer you
to find common ground.
Are you sure you can't?

397
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,773
Just this morning
you were telling me

398
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,316
what a wonderful time
you had celebrating
her marriage,

399
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,318
how you were excited
to start a new chapter.

400
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,363
Right, and then
she comes in and
dumps this on me.

401
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,324
Back up a beat.

402
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,325
Cameron got married?

403
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,789
Oh, Bos,
I assumed you knew.

404
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,792
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

405
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,294
Wasn't your news
to tell.

406
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,277
Love what you've done
with the place.

407
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,361
Drinks with Diane?

408
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,364
Diane, no drinks.

409
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,576
( sighs )

410
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:12,290
It's Cameron.
She changed her mind
about the IPO.

411
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,374
What?
She wants to kill it?

412
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,960
That is not
her intent,

413
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,379
but if she has her way,
it will be the result.

414
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,548
Well, sorry
to hear that.

415
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,884
Nothing's settled yet,
but moving forward

416
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,554
means getting
all the equity owners
to overrule her.

417
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,557
We've got 35%,
and then there's
Diane and Bos

418
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,392
and Doug and Craig.

419
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,395
And Cameron has no idea
this is happening?

420
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,564
Nothing is happening.
It's all talk at the moment,

421
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,568
but I have to explore
every option.

422
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,487
We don't own 35%
of the company.

423
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,325
- Yeah, sure we do.
- No, you own 25%

424
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:50,286
and Clark Computers owns 10%
for buying the mainframe.

425
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,496
And Clark Computers,
i.e., me,

426
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,291
doesn't like the idea
of blindsiding Cameron

427
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,001
and shoving this IPO
down her throat.

428
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,295
( stammers )
That's-- that is--

429
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:04,424
just a gross
mischaracterization. I--

430
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,427
Donna, if you
pull this move,

431
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,639
I guarantee you
she'll see it
as an act of war.

432
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,476
and you will cross a line
that you cannot uncross.

433
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,978
So, don't kid yourself.

434
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:25,445
It's been a long day.
I'm going to bed.

435
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,745
Did you ever
witness Mr. MacMillan

436
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,455
talking
to Gordon Clark?

437
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,625
Nope.

438
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:44,257
Did Mr. MacMillan ever
confide any plans he had
with Gordon Clark?

439
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,716
No.

440
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,760
( sniffs )

441
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:56,518
Don't you find it odd,
the day we eighty-sixed
NSFNET

442
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,478
and we shit-canned Joe

443
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,358
he finds religion
and says Gordon invented

444
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,734
the software
this company's built on,

445
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,278
giving his
ex-partner,

446
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,949
the one suing him,
everything?

447
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,413
Or maybe
you didn't know.

448
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,916
Maybe Joe didn't
tell you that part.

449
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,752
And I always assumed
that you were involved.

450
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,422
They didn't cut you
out of the deal, did they?

451
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,464
Ah, no need to answer.

452
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,302
Look, I'm sorry, kid.
It's bigger than you.

453
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,429
You're just a pawn
that Joe sacrificed
in the end game,

454
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,596
which means that
you're useless to us.

455
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,514
You're probably
useless to him, too.

456
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,226
So...

457
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,519
that's it.

458
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,314
It's time
for you to go.

459
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:45,401
- So, I'm fired?
- Uh, yes.

460
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,027
Good.

461
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:07,505
Mr. Clark?
They're ready
for you.

462
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,384
Gordon, what are you
doing here?

463
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:15,222
Hey, Ryan.
You were right.

464
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,850
That thing that you
and Joe were working on?

465
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,435
It's gonna be huge.

466
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,813
<i>( door opens )</i>

467
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,275
<i>( door closes )</i>

468
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,028
So, Mr. Clark, regardless
of what Mr. MacMillan

469
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,946
thinks he got
away with,

470
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:34,450
we plan to fully
challenge the veracity
of his confession.

471
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:38,037
Hey, listen, I think
we can speed things up
without the lawyers.

472
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,497
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I don't have mine.</i>

473
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,081
<i>What do we say</i>
<i>you lose yours?</i>

474
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,760
<i>You're not really</i>
<i>gonna try to convince me</i>

475
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,515
that you
and Joe didn't talk
about this, right?

476
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,976
I'm not gonna
try and convince you
of anything.

477
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,602
I'm here
to offer you a deal

478
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,604
that will
make that question
irrelevant.

479
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,483
Now, my lawyers say
I'm looking at a floor
of 25 million.

480
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,444
- Your lawyers are dreaming.
- I'm willing to take
10% of that,

481
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,778
along with the equipment
that Joe bought

482
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,864
and the deals
that he made for NSFNET.

483
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,117
Even if I wanted
to make that deal,

484
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,661
I can't just hand you
a government contract.

485
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,996
I mean, I could trade you
the infrastructure,

486
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,622
but you would have to
chase that bid.

487
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,624
No, I think
for 20 million,

488
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,584
you can make a call
to the sector chief

489
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,627
and make that happen.

490
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,879
Or I could just sue you
and keep it all.

491
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,424
Yeah, you could,
but you'll lose,

492
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,633
and I think
you know that.

493
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,345
We do it my way,
I'm giving you
everything that you want

494
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:37,637
in exchange for
nothing you care about.

495
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,100
Hmm. One thing
sticks in my craw.

496
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,644
We make this deal,
you turn around and give
Joe everything he wants

497
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,689
and that son of a bitch
wins again.

498
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,066
And what
makes you think

499
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,276
you're the only
one in this room

500
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,860
that wants to stick it
to Joe MacMillan?

501
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,657
Okay, let's
get this over with.

502
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,659
Remember to detach
Arki from me

503
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,537
when he uses this
as an excuse

504
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,913
to hug me past
a socially acceptable
amount of time.

505
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,124
I got it,
all right?

506
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,960
Let's go fry
some coders' circuits,
Mrs. Howe-Rendon.

507
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,547
- No.
- Rendon-Howe?

508
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,631
- We'll figure it out.
- Okay.

509
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,387
Ahem.

510
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,931
<i>( "Sound Salvation"</i>
<i>playing )</i>

511
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,392
- Tom?
- Rendon!

512
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,519
- Dude!

The company is valued
for what it is

659

The market likes Mutiny,
but in a year or two,

660
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,232
or however long it takes
to implement the changes

Mutiny isn't sustainable

we do that

Perfect is
the enemy of good,

677

very good right now

It's lost what made it
a community.

681
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,582
We need to make it
feel alive again

682
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,375

are going to leave

683
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,460

00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,463
- selling junk
to nobody.
- But--

685
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,298
Please.

686
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,300
We can't afford
to be naive here.

687
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,677
If we put off
these changes,

688
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,596
we won't be able to
make them the right way.

689
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,305
You mean<i> your</i> way.

690
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,892
I mean, we'll be
so focused on PE ratios

691
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,602
and shareholder value,

692
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,312
that we won't
be able to innovate
and respond quickly.

693
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:57,316
Mutiny won't be
Mutiny anymore.

694
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,527
We'll lose
the company's soul.

695
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,240
Donna:
<i>Say we do it your way.</i>

696
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,325
What happens if your ideas,
good as they are,

697
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,578
don't work
or backfire?

698
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,748
We risk losing
our current valuation.

699
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,960
Going public doesn't mean
we stop innovating.

700
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,964
We can continue
to experiment and
improve as we go,

701
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,341
especially with someone
as brilliant as you
leading the way.

702
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,344
- Don't patronize me.
- I'm not patronizing you.

703
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,348
You're handling me
like you always do,
and I'm sick of it.

704
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,935
Listen,
I'm trying to explain
some very real risks

705
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,561
that you're not willing
to acknowledge

706
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,355
to actual stakeholders
in the company.

707
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,357
We can't afford
to be impulsive here.

708
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,819
You're calling me
impulsive? Wow.

709
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,445
What's that
supposed to mean?

710
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,363
I think people
are out there celebrating
what that means.

711
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,407
Oh, you mean
that bullshit little
party you threw

712
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,409
to distract me
from getting stabbed
in the back?

713
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,452
- Bos:<i> Hey.</i>
- Diane:<i> Okay, ladies,</i>

714
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,370
we are getting
off track here.

715
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,372
Diane, it's mostly
your thoughts coming
out of her mouth,

716
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,750
so I can't imagine
what you have to add
to the discussion.

717
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,961
Jesus! I don't know
who should be more
insulted.

718
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,797
Trust me,
if I'm expressing
an opinion,

719
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:01,923
it's because
I believe it.

720
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,716
I should trust you.
Yes, of course!

721
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,135
I mean, unless
you're lying now,

722
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,179
like you lied
about Doug and Craig.

723
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,930
Did you know
about that?

724
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,266
That when you told her
it was fine if I fired them,

725
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,143
she told me that
I had to keep them on?

726
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:14,393
Is that
the sort of person

727
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,271
that you wanna trust
with this business
going forward?

728
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,396
You mean
the kind of person

729
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,440
who actually tries
to make things work

730
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,111
instead of fighting
with anybody who threatens
her "savior complex"?

731
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,403
I get along fine
with people.

732
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,114
You alienate
everybody.

733
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,200
Says the woman
that will take any excuse

734
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,408
not to go home
to her husband.

735
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,203
- Hey.
- Why don't we see

736
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,829
if your marriage
lasts the year

737
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,207
before you start doling out
relationship advice?

738
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,916
- Donna?
- Enough. Enough!

739
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,418
Hey, this meeting
is over, all right?

740
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,421
My God!
You two go to
your corners,

741
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,132
wipe the blood
off your mouths,

742
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,551
- and we will revisit--
- ( slams )

743
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,386
<i>( men murmuring )</i>

744
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,389
This gets decided tonight.

745
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,977
I want a vote,
and I want it clean.

746
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,023
If you all decide
with Donna,

747
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,441
then you can go ahead
and do the IPO without me.

748
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,443
- I quit.
- Cameron, come on.

749
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:09,032
No!
I'm sick of this!

750
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,201
Go! Take a hard look
at this company

751
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,661
and ask yourself
who made it what it is

752
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,747
and who's just been
along for the ride!

753
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,541
Cameron,
please don't do this.

754
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,752
You want it?
You got it.

755
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,630
But I will not sit by
and watch this company die

756
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,466
because it's
being held hostage
by a petulant child.

757
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,802
If we don't move forward
with the IPO,

758
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,097
then you can steer this ship
into the rocks yourself,

759
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,973
because I am
outta here.

760
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,893
Okay, Bos is right.
Let's take a beat,
cool off--

761
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:41,398
Show of hands.
Who's in favor of doing
the IPO now

762
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,442
with all that
that entails?

763
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,514
You're breaking
my goddamn heart.

764
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,526
( sobs )
Oh.

765
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,155
( gasps )

766
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,492
<i>( Cameron sniffles )</i>

767
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,225
( sighs )

768
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,981
Joe?

769
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,607
What are you
doin' here?

770
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,362
Someone had to
drop off the keys.

771
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,502
Welcome
to your empire.

772
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,217
And thus concludes
the grand tour.

773
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,637
All right,
pay attention.

774
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:23,226
This is--
this is complicated.

775
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:27,397
Okay, this one--
this key's for
the building.

776
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,859
This key is for
the ladies' room,
for the men's bathroom,

777
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,861
and those two
are for the front door.

778
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,284
Thanks.

779
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,577
If it wasn't
gonna be me,

780
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,661
I'm glad it was you.

781
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,497
Write me
from the future.

782
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:50,628
- 49 percent.
- What?

783
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,256
Come run it with me...

784
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,841
and 49 percent
of the company's yours.

785
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,303
That's a cruel joke,

786
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,263
and quite frankly,
beneath you.

787
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,265
I'm serious.

788
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,895
49 percent.

789
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:21,534
With how this looks,
we need to be smart.

790
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,870
I should be
a silent partner.

791
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,458
Even better.

792
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,585
( laughs )

793
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,303
( knocks )

794
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,642
<i>( footsteps approaching,</i>
<i>bolt clicks )</i>

795
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,479
-<i> Joe.</i>
- Ryan, today is
a big day for us.

796
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,105
So, you've seen it
already?

797
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:54,108
- Seen what?
- So, then you don't know.

798
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,734
I released the source code
for MacMillan Utility's

799
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,321
security software
to the public.

800
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,573
- What are you
talking about?
-<i> It's free, Joe.</i>

801
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,325
Really free,
like we always wanted.

802
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,868
People can tinker with it,
they can make it better--

803
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,702
or worse,
that can happen, too.

804
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,121
The point is
MacMillan Utility

805
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,665
can no longer
profit off of it.

806
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,375
Joe:
<i>But that's illegal.</i>

807
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,377
And I released
documents to the media

808
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,752
proving that
MacMillan Utility

809
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,256
was totally on board
with charging the public
for 2.0 all along,

810
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,509
and they only went after you
when you tried to stop them.

811
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,969
Yeah, it shows
that they weren't trying
the protect people

812
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,137
or-- or keep them safe.

813
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,931
They were just
going to exploit them.

814
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,976
And I laid out
for the media

815
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:31,312
how you lost your job
defending your ideals.

816
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,608
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

817
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,362
Yes! I returned volley
just like you wanted.

818
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,738
It's gonna
take those bastards
years to recover.

819
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:44,950
They are gonna
come after you.

820
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,537
( sighs )
I'm not stupid, Joe.

821
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,373
I covered every
conceivable track.

822
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:53,543
They will
never catch me.
I am that good.

823
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:56,337
Yeah, nobody's
that good.

824
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,963
I am.

825
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,265
Yeah, we'll see.
