Jesse:
<i>Westgroup headquarters</i>

00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,651
<i>off-line for over 80 hours.</i>

<i>New York's mainframe</i>
<i>off-line for two days.</i>

4
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,656
<i>Hundreds of databases</i>

8
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,164
Just give me
the damn numbers.

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,083
Westgroup stock price
is already down 8%

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,962
and we're looking
at an incurred cost
of several million.

11
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,258
And Joe?

12
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,470
The board recognizes
that he's to blame,

13
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,805
but they don't
feel it prudent

14
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,390
to pursue a criminal
investigation.

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,517
( chuckles )

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,811
So they chose
a scapegoat.

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,648
( chuckles )

18
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,278
- They'll be with you shortly.
- My wife, she's not here yet.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,907
Um, I'd like to speak
with her before--

20
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,992
I'll show her in
when she arrives.

21
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,807
Cameron:
<i>So, this is Lev right here.</i>

22
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,935
Donna:
<i>Lev, you look</i>
<i>so cool online.</i>

23
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,020
- Yeah, like in real life.
- ( laughs )

24
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:47,274
- Cameron:<i> Okay, um... </i>
- Bodie, why do you
have a skull head?

25
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,026
'Cause it's wicked
and awesome.

26
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,404
Yes, okay,
so each visualization
is totally customizable.

27
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,365
The more time you spend online,
the more options become
available to you.

28
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,117
Yeah.

29
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,287
So, walk here to Mutiny Mall,
here to News &amp; Updates--

30
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,539
Is Town Hall ready
for my admin talk tomorrow?

31
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, you just have
to figure out what you
want to look like online.

32
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,419
Hey, uh, so since
I'm taking over accounting,

33
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,171
I just want to make sure
I have the correct info for
our new network partner.

34
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,340
Is it Telnet or Telenet
with an E?

35
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,676
It's Telenet with an E.

36
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,678
They're based out of DC
and the guy we work with
over there

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,889
is Doug or Warren or--

38
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,642
hey, how great is it
we don't even know
his name?

39
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,851
Houston's officially up.

40
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,227
How many
new subscribers?

41
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,021
With the promotion,
I've had 29 sign-ups

42
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,108
with the new 713 number
in the last two hours.

43
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,193
Conquering the world
one area code at a time.

44
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,029
( laughs )

45
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,656
( whispers )
This is so real.
Let me see.

46
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,240
Yeah, is there
something else?

47
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,284
Yeah, uh,
if it's okay with you,

48
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,829
I was wondering
if I can move
to Tom's desk.

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,164
You see,
his has two drawers
and mine only has one,

50
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,001
so I was thinking,
"Dave, you bonehead,
you wanna do accounting,

51
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,336
you're gonna need
more than one drawer."

52
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,379
But they don't necessarily
have to be Tom's drawers--

53
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,048
Yes, fine.
Whatever.

54
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,095
Hey, have you, uh,
heard from him?

55
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,597
No.

56
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,224
- Um, how is Gordon?
- Good, good.

57
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,602
I'm gonna go pick him up
from a meeting in a couple
minutes.

58
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,563
-<i> ( ringing ) </i>
- Dave:<i> I got it.</i>
<i>Probably Telenet.</i>

59
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,941
- They like to fax.
They're big on faxing.
-<i> ( modem screeching )</i>

60
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,068
<i>Don't worry, I got it.</i>

61
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,667
I was just hoping
to speak with Sara
before signing.

62
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,961
She came in this morning.

63
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,130
I'm sorry, someone
should've told you that.

64
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,179
( sighs )

65
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,898
<i>( music playing</i>
<i>in background ) </i>

66
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,941
( scoffs )
You gotta be kidding me.

67
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,070
Donna, look at this.

68
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,448
( scoffs )
Well, we're doing well,
so they're charging us more.

69
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,701
Great, great.
Here we go again.

70
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,370
No, it's because the pie
is getting bigger.

71
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,081
This is just
part of the process.

72
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,084
No, no, no,
this is about being
beholden to somebody else.

73
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,544
I mean, it doesn't matter
if it's Telenet or Westgroup

74
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,880
or Doug or Warren
or Joe MacMillan
or the Pope.

75
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,883
As long as we are on
some other dipshit's network,
this is gonna keep happening.

76
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,260
We'll never be
in the driver's seat.

77
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,764
Well, the only places
that have networkable
hardware

78
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,682
- are big companies...
- I know.

79
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,018
...places that can
afford the metal.

80
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,979
This is time-sharing.
This is the name
of the game.

81
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,982
You know-- look,
we'll counter Telenet,
we'll do the dance.

82
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,400
No, screw the dance.

83
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,696
I want to change
the music.

84
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,656
I know.
I know.

85
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,868
Look, I gotta go.

86
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,331
All right,
let's wrap up the day

87
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,209
by looking
at our stress journals.

88
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,253
Last session,
I asked you all

89
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,255
to note your stresses,
big and small,

90
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,300
conflicts,
frustrations, fears,

91
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,137
and rate them from one to five,
five being the most stressful.

92
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,013
First, I'd like
to quickly go around the room

93
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,766
and have everyone say
their final stress tally
out loud.

94
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,811
- Robert?
- 39.

95
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,772
- Paul?
- Uh, 24.

96
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,816
That's excellent, Paul.

97
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,359
- Diane?
- 57.

98
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,654
Why so much stress
this week, Diane?

99
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,406
The bus route changed,
so I've been driving
the girls to school myself

100
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,618
and I had to go by K-Mart,
and the K-Mart by our house
isn't open yet,

101
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,829
so now I have to go
all the way to the one
in Carrollton--

102
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,413
Okay.

103
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,332
<i>We'll discuss that.</i>

104
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:37,045
-<i> Gordon? </i>
- Uh, ahem, 0.28.

105
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,590
That's pretty low.
Must've been a good week.

106
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,052
Yeah, nothing to report.

107
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,638
I'm home,
taking my medication.

108
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,890
Kids are headed
back to school, so...

109
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,852
What registered
the .28 of stress?

110
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:56,273
Oh, uh, I couldn't
find my glasses.

111
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,984
Anything else
come to mind?

112
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,070
Something you might've failed
to capture in your journal?

113
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,281
Nope.

114
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,616
Just seeing the glasses
thing here, Brendan.

115
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:10,704
Okay, well...

116
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,499
since that's all we've got,
that's what we'll workshop.

117
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,585
Why don't you role-play
your stress for us?

118
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,462
Sure.

119
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,051
I woke up
and I thought...

120
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,347
"Where are my glasses?"

121
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,308
And then I found them
and I said...

122
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,852
( chuckles )
"Here they are."

123
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,394
No, let's get you
on your feet.

124
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,813
I'd like to see
you act it out

125
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,397
in the center
of the group.

126
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,614
Here, why don't you
take them off

127
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,325
and I'll hold them
while you look for them?

128
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,079
<i>Okay, it's the morning.</i>

129
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,000
You just woke up,
but can't find
your glasses.

130
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,044
Go.

131
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,670
Oh, no.

132
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,465
I can't find my glasses.

133
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,967
<i>Where are they?</i>

134
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,179
I'm never gonna
be able to see again.

135
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:13,683
I'm blind.
Oh, no.

136
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,602
Brendan:
<i>Rather than caption</i>
<i>what's happening,</i>

137
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,145
<i>why don't you tell us</i>
<i>how you're feeling?</i>

138
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,065
Right now I feel like
I'm wasting my time.

139
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,983
How do you feel
about losing your glasses?

140
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,195
I'm mad that
I can't find them.

141
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,446
What else?

142
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,283
I'm, uh--
I'm frustrated

143
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,160
and I'm-- I'm worried.

144
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,329
Why are you worried?

145
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,331
Because it's been
a few minutes

146
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,043
and I'm worried
that I lost them

147
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,213
and, I don't know,

148
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,048
<i>I can't remember</i>
<i>where they are,</i>

149
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,093
and is this
just me forgetting

150
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,305
or is this
something more?

151
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,224
Does it scare you
that your illness
might progress?

152
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,145
No.

153
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,981
'Cause they were on
the damn kitchen counter.

Daddy keeps it up there.

160

Hmm?

161

My Eggo's still
cold in the middle.

Well, it's also
drowning in syrup,

163
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,700
so maybe that
makes up for it.

Excuse me!

of behavior is that?

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,887
- Like in California?
- Shut up, stupid.

171
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,681
Hey, no name-calling.

172
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,725
What happened
in California?

173
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,186
Nothing.

174
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,106
Joanie?

175
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:10,777
Daddy and Uncle Henry
got into a yelling fight,

176
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,448
and the three of us had
to sleep in a crummy motel.

177
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,367
Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

178
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,995
Because then you and Daddy
would fight like him
and Uncle Henry.

179
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,997
Oh, what was
the fight about?

180
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,334
Joanie.

181
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,421
Everything okay?

182
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,137
Yeah, uh, Joanie didn't
like her breakfast.

183
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,930
We're out
of orange juice.

184
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,224
And there's no coffee.

185
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,936
( whispers )
It's okay, sweetheart.

186
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,112
-<i> ( phone rings ) </i>
- Woman:<i> Reception.</i>

187
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,697
I'll let him know.

188
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,576
Mr. MacMillan,
they're ready.

189
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,958
Bondham:
<i>Yeah, we had</i>
<i>Mutiny in here,</i>

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,170
but frankly I was on
the fence about them
from the get-go.

191
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,838
And I heard
they're doing
pretty well recently.

192
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,048
I'm chalking that up
to dumb luck.

193
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,635
Mutiny certainly isn't
the answer to anything,

194
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,595
but I will say
this burgeoning
online sector

195
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,805
is the place to be
in technology right now.

196
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,307
Do you have
something in mind?

197
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,724
Mutiny's fine
if I live in Dallas,

198
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,644
but what if I want
to access information

199
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,647
in Toronto,
San Francisco, Tokyo?

200
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:32,609
What if I live
in rural Nebraska
where there is no service?

201
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,945
So, what, you want
to do the first online
service in Omaha?

202
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,114
Omaha is just
a place on the map.

203
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,659
I'm trying to make maps
irrelevant.

204
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,329
<i>This service allows</i>
<i>customers to dial in</i>
<i>from one location</i>

205
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,914
and dial out from banks
in a completely different city.

206
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,125
Something like this
sidesteps long-distance fees.

207
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,504
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

208
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,507
Now, you brought Westgroup
into tech recently, right?

209
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,966
WestNet?
All that?

210
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,219
I transitioned Westgroup
into time-sharing

211
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,638
and helped them realize
a dormant passive
income stream.

212
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,391
So why did
you torch it?

213
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,692
- I didn't.
- ( chuckles ) No,
that's not what I heard.

214
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,486
( clicks tongue )

215
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,613
Here's the honest truth.

216
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,407
We don't have
a dime for ya.

217
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,284
We took this meeting
out of morbid curiosity.

218
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,706
Now, the press story
is that Wheeler botched
the tech move,

219
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,374
but I know some guys
on the inside over there

220
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,918
who told me
the real story,

221
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,753
and what I want
to know is...

222
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,922
why?

223
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,217
Also how?

224
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,386
Some destructive program?
Right?

225
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,055
A virus or something?

226
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,934
<i>You know, I looked into you,</i>
<i>what you did at Cardiff.</i>

227
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,811
Immolating 100 computers
out by Lake Texoma.

228
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,813
Holy shit.
( laughs )

229
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,277
I am blown away.

230
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,947
I've never
met a legitimate
psychopath before.

231
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,872
We should buy this.

232
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,833
IBM 3033 mainframe.
It's a refurbish job.

233
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,877
It needs a little love,
but then we'd own it.

234
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,879
- No more network partners.
- Cameron...

235
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,506
You know where
I found this?

236
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,924
Community.

237
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,301
I went into
the Tech Talk room,

238
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,094
I wrote out the specs
we'd need,

239
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,179
and suddenly I had
100 Mutiny field agents
on it.

240
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,390
They found this thing
in two days.

241
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,018
This machine
is 10 years old.
It uses tape drives--

242
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,938
- Which we--
- Control unit is missing.

243
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,066
And even if it wasn't
in Daly City, California,

244
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,817
this is all
of our liquid cash

245
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,445
plus most
of our projected income

246
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,863
for the next year,
and that's before shipping.

247
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,283
And even if we could
get it on a truck to
move it out here,

248
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,534
where would we put it?

249
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,120
Yes, there
are challenges, sure,

250
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,414
but we need
to start moving in a--

251
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:55,627
If you want to drive
a submarine, you gotta
join the Navy.

252
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,879
Yeah, you might
have to salute somebody
every once in a while,

253
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:03,884
but I-- it's better
than buying a rickety
old diesel boat

254
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,928
that sinks you to
the bottom of the ocean.

255
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,976
This is a reach,
even for us.

256
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,647
Okay.

the music, so...

00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,540
I see you're busy.
I'll--

273
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,544
No, no,
I'm just trying out
a steam-powered CPU.

274
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,215
Look, I know
what this looks like--

275
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,509
like they parked
the loony bird out back
with his kiddy toys,

276
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,929
but I'll have you know
that these aren't just toys.

277
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,931
This is rail
transport modeling.

<i>I got this back</i>
<i>when I was at Cardiff.</i>

279
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,604
I just never
got around to it.

280
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,022
- ( music stops )
- What's going on?

281
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:45,904
I, uh-- I just came by
to give you something.

282
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,453
What is this, a PROM?

283
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,955
It's from the one
we reverse engineered.

284
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,124
You saved this.

285
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,544
I've always kept it
as kind of a private
touchstone.

286
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,505
Nice to have
when times are tough.

287
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,549
Sounds stupid, but...

288
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,763
it always kept me going.

289
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,723
Maybe you should
hold on to it.

290
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,102
Boy, it seems
like yesterday,
doesn't it?

291
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,942
Yeah, it seems
like forever ago.

292
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,360
Look, I heard about
what happened at Westgroup,

293
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,989
and if there's anything
I can do to help...

294
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,159
There may be a way
to repair the mainframe.

295
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,286
After I blew up Mutiny,

296
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,955
I tooled around
with the Sonaris code,

297
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,581
tried to see if there
was any way to reverse it.

298
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,374
You look good.

299
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,419
I'm glad.

you and Sara?

301
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,090

There's a company off LBJ

304
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,817
That sounds promising.

You know, Telenet wants
to have a conference call
to discuss the rate hike.

to Sonaris by name.

Yes, Nurse Ratched.

325

Westgroup's cover story

326
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,045
is that some network
assessment software
went awry.

327
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,505
I always hoped
one of my inventions
would go down in history.

328

I just never
knew it was gonna be
a goddamn computer virus.

334
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,521
I don't think
he's doing well.

335
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,857
I'm sorry to hear that.

336
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,109
( slams drawer )

337
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,695
You know, he stopped by
to give me the PROM chip

338
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,405
from the IBM
we reverse engineered.

339
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,282
- He had saved it.
- Ha.

340
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,452
I've never
seen him like this.

341
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,790
I feel like
he could do something--
something desperate.

342
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,626
All because of what
Cameron did to him.

343
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,425
Doesn't that
disgust you?

344
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,052
I mean, even just
a little bit?

345
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,511
You know, I don't
think it's a good idea

346
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,138
for you to get
so worked up like this.

347
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,556
You know what
the doctor said.

348
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,976
She destroyed
his entire life,

349
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,311
and for what,
because he tried
to help her?

350
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,148
Well, it sounds like
you're just going with
Joe's version of events, then.

351
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,942
<i>Because I think</i>
<i>he's telling the truth.</i>

352
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,694
Do you remember what kind
of a partner he is?

353
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,571
When you were in business
with him last year,

354
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,531
all the things
that you accused him of?

355
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,118
- But this is different.
- Why?

356
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,828
Why is it
different now?

357
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,705
Now suddenly when
I experience the exact
same thing you do,

358
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,291
Joe is a nice guy?
Why is he the victim?

359
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,086
Joe might not be
the most trustworthy
person in the world,

360
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,921
but what Cameron did
to him is the most--

361
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,340
We did it.

362
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,092
<i>Giving him the virus--</i>

363
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:39,428
it was our idea,
Cameron's and mine.

364
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,221
You knew he was
leaving Westgroup.

365
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,598
- I told you that.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

366
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,475
Why would he have anything
to do with WestNet?

367
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,893
He already had
one foot in California.

368
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,186
The truth is,
it doesn't matter.

369
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,980
- What do you mean it--
- He's toxic.

370
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,773
You know that
as well as I do.

371
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,776
- What?
- Last month when
you were so worried

372
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,235
that someone
was stealing your idea,

373
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,738
well, that actually
happened to me.

374
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,449
- It wasn't just in my head.
- Who are you?

375
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,576
It's like I don't
even know you anymore.

376
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,163
- I mean, this entire year--
- Who am I?

377
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,749
You kept a serious illness
from me for nearly two months.

378
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,627
Frankly, I don't know
how honest you're being
with yourself about it

379
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,005
considering how
out of control
you've been.

380
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,215
- I am doing my best
to deal with this, okay?
- Oh, yeah.

381
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,009
I'm taking the pills,
I'm going to group.

382
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,844
- Which you think is a joke.
- I'm doing the--

383
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,847
- What?
- I saw you there
making fun of it.

384
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,640
You were not even trying.

385
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,018
So you're spying
on me in therapy?

386
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,561
Unbelievable, Donna.

387
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,563
Yeah, because you
keep things from me.

388
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,232
Well, it sounds like to me
we're keeping things
from each other.

389
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,234
Well, while we're
on the topic of secrets...

390
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,947
I would like to know
what happened in California.

391
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,077
Joanie told me
that you and Henry
got in a shouting match

392
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,872
that was apparently so bad
you had to take the girls
to a motel.

393
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,415
Why would you not
tell me that?

394
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,959
Because, Donna,
I had an affair!

395
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,503
( voice breaks )
What?

396
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,297
( whimpers )

397
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,593
It was one night.
It was meaningless.

398
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,179
It was absolutely stupid.

399
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,430
Do I regret it?

400
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,349
Yeah, every minute
of every day.

401
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,061
When I found out
I was sick,

402
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,939
I looked around
for my marriage

403
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,398
and it wasn't there.

404
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,862
You weren't there.

405
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,197
Maybe--

406
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,120
<i>maybe this</i>
<i>has been broken</i>
<i>for a long time,</i>

407
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,747
<i>and we're the only ones</i>
<i>who don't know it.</i>

408
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,755
Joanie.

409
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,465
Joanie, sweetheart.

410
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,467
<i>( door slams )</i>

411
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,360
( gurgling )

412
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,074
- Ow.
- ( sizzling )

413
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:08,286
- ( sputters )
-<i> ( door opens, closes )</i>

414
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,459
Hey.

415
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,298
You're here early.

416
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,760
I don't know
that Gordon and I love
each other anymore.

417
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,972
<i>And I don't know--</i>

418
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,809
I don't know
if we can fix it.

419
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:38,191
And I don't even know
if I wanna fix it.

420
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:04,466
I don't know
what it's like--
um, marriage.

421
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,470
Being married,
it's--

422
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:12,099
I don't know,
I won't pretend
to understand.

423
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,773
What you
and Gordon have,
or don't,

424
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,986
um, I mean,
that's something only
you two can figure out.

425
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:36,707
I do know that once
in a while, you know,

426
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,961
life can give us
a sign...

427
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,464
point us
to a different place,

428
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,928
make good things
come out of bad.

429
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,679
If it weren't
for Cardiff Electric,

430
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,349
there would've never
been a Mutiny, and...

431
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,771
you know,
if it weren't
for Gordon Clark,

432
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,898
I would've
never met you.

433
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,031
Listen, I don't want
to add to your misery here,

434
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,118
but the coffeemaker
is broken,

435
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,621
- so...
- ( laughs )

436
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,498
I think we should
move to California.

437
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,836
Here.

438
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,510
The diesel sub.

439
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,933
Look, if we can't
bring the mainframe
to Mutiny,

440
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,437
maybe we bring Mutiny
to the mainframe.

441
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,358
I think life
is giving us
a sign here.

442
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,778
Yes, we will have to beg,
borrow, and steal
the money for it,

443
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,363
but I--

444
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,951
it would be
a fresh start.

445
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,291
And I think that
that's something

446
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,752
that we could both use.

447
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,388
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

448
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,435
Hey.

449
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,644
What's up?

450
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,646
Can I come in?

451
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,116
I love what
you've done
to the place.

452
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,831
Listen, I was the one
who wrote the code

453
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,291
that took everything down.

454
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,876
Okay?
It was me--

455
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,378
You didn't do
anything wrong.

456
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,129
Yeah,
but neither did you.

457
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,716
I appreciate that,
but...

458
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,550
it doesn't really matter.

459
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,429
What about Sara?

460
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,224
Joe?

461
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,558
Damn it.

462
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,436
You're a good man.

463
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,105
You make it really difficult
for other people to see that,

464
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,940
but I see it,

465
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,443
and I suspect she
had something to do
with that.

466
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,611
That supposed
to make me feel better?

467
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,495
Look, I just came by
to give you this.

468
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,208
I went into the Sonaris code,
fixed the missing branch error.

469
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,376
Not only that,

470
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,711
this version targets
older copies.

471
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,047
It eradicates them.

472
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,673
I muscled it up
some, too,

473
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,301
so it'll inoculate machines
from future infection.

474
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,595
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's-- it's one hell</i>
<i>of an antidote.</i>

475
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,348
I mean, it won't undo
the damage done,

476
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,519
but maybe you can use it
to make things right.

477
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,603
Or a sign of good faith
to Jacob Wheeler.

478
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,064
I don't care
about Jacob Wheeler.

479
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,067
Then screw him.
Do it for Sara.

480
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,157
When we came to dinner
here that night,
you said to me,

481
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:01,412
"She makes all the suffering
of what we do worth it."

482
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,456
And I'm telling you,

483
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,792
that is not an easy thing
to come by.

484
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,920
And when you do,
it's--

485
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,757
it's even harder
to make it last,

486
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,342
and, I don't know.

487
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,971
Maybe it can't,
but...

488
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,851
I do know that you'll
hate yourself every day
if you don't at least try.

489
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,398
Okay.

490
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,486
Yeah, okay.

491
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,073
Hey, man,
come here.

492
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,909
( pats back )

493
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,914
( exhales )

494
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,464
Take care of yourself, Joe.

495
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,467
<i>( door closes )</i>

496
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,438
( chatter )

497
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,773
So I go in
and I tell him, I said,

498
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,984
"Now, it looks like
we're gonna finish the year
110% of quota."

499
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,944
My God, the accountant's
looking at the numbers.

500
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,864
He's going, "Well,
it says here 83%,
Mr. Bosworth.

501
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,075
Says here 83."
And I go, "Man, are you
including Bannister?

502
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,161
That's a $2 million
deal, man."

503
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,456
He goes, "Well-- well,
Bannister didn't close
in Q4."

504
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,124
And I said, "Sure, it did.

505
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,877
I closed that son of a bitch
on the 35th of December myself."

506
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,838
( all laughing )

507
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,220
I tell ya,
he's full of these.

508
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,096
Get him going,
he won't stop.

509
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,558
Well, James,
you were right
about your daddy.

510
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,185
A month in, he's already
whipping this place
into shape.

511
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,769
I had no doubt.

512
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,897
Well, it's a damn fine
place to work, I gotta say.

513
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,567
And thank you
for inviting me to this
big muckety-muck lunch here.

514
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,776
Ah, I know you're
only manager level now

515
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,071
and we're not
fast-tracking
anything here,

516
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,323
but, well, we thought
it'd be good for you to hear

517
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,158
how things are operating
at the upper levels,

518
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,951
have your voice
in the room.

519
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,370
And, Mr. Stern,
it goes without saying

520
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,954
that I sincerely
appreciate the invite

521
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,915
to sit down with
the senior team today.

522
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,875
A junior boy like me
is a guppy at this table.

523
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,503
Well, without you,
we wouldn't have John.

524
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,296
Well...

525
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:20,593
You know, I-- I must've told
this one about a million times,

526
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,680
but I remember
when I was a kid,
a manager comes in and...

527
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,391
( laughs )
...he says, "Now, Joe,
you're under quota.

528
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,184
We need to be
in the black."

529
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,688
So I look at him,
I toss my coffee cup
up on the forecast,

530
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,441
and I say, "Now how's that
for bein' in the black?"

531
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,902
( muffled laughter )

532
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,993
-<i> ( conversation</i>
<i>continues indistinctly ) </i>
-<i> ( ringing )</i>

533
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,255
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

534
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,817
<i>( music playing</i>
<i>in background )</i>

535
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,820
Donna?

536
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,280
Donna?

537
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,198
Whoa, Gordon,
what do you want?

538
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,742
- Hey, where's Donna?
- Okay, Gordon,

539
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,034
I think you need to
back off for a little bit.

540
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,369
Damn it, this has
nothing to do with you.

541
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,912
Gordon, I want you
out of my house.

542
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,414
- Hey.
- Is she here?

543
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,374
- What the heck is going on?
- Is she here?

544
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,959
<i>Who?</i>

545
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,919
Oh, Christ,
I thought she was
with you.

546
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,838
Gordon, what are you
talking about?

547
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,716
I can't find Joanie.
She's not at the house.

548
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,426
She's not
at your parents' house.

549
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,763
- Haley said she ran away.
- Okay-- ( sighs )

550
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,858
You haven't
seen her at all?

551
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,362
Sometimes she rides bikes
with Heather after school.

552
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,655
<i>( car door closes )</i>

553
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:08,408
Okay, well,
just let me know.
Thanks.

554
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,202
- Did you--
- I didn't see her
on Marion

555
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,162
and I went all the way
to Belt Line.

556
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,456
- Oh, what about the, um--
- She's not in the cul-de-sac

557
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,082
and she's not
down by the creek either.

558
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,377
Okay, so, uh,
her backpack is gone,

559
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,838
her lunch box is gone,
her sleeping bag--

560
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,550
Donna, I need you
to know that I didn't--

561
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,844
look, this wasn't me.
I didn't--

562
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,429
God damn it,
I didn't lose her.

563
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,432
Haley said
that she ran away, okay?

564
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,852
Donna, I need you to know
that this wasn't me.

565
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,771
Mommy, Daddy, look.

566
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,821
- What is that?
- It's our camping lantern.

567
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,492
I had to leave.

568
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,578
I told a secret.

569
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,830
And it made you
not in love anymore.

570
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,332
Hey, hey, listen.

571
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:03,505
Your mom and I may
get into an argument
sometimes, okay?

572
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,593
But it's never
because of you, okay?

573
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,345
Are you gonna
get divorced?

574
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,686
Mommy and Daddy love
each other very much.

575
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,898
But there are some things
that we need to talk about.

576
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,278
So why don't you
go up to the house,

577
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,447
give your sister
a big old hug,

578
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,284
and you two can pick out
what kind of pizza to get
for dinner, okay?

579
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,202
Good girl.

580
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,829
Come here.

581
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,046
( sighs )

582
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,966
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

583
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,099
I don't want
to be the woman

584
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,184
that leaves her husband
when he's sick,

585
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,855
but that doesn't
mean I won't.

586
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,983
I thought a lot
about what you said
and I think you're right.

587
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,026
This marriage
isn't working,

588
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,489
so we need to do
what's best for the kids
and what's best for us.

589
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,032
So here are my terms.

590
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,913
You're gonna
write a check.

591
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,629
It's gonna be for almost
as much money as we have,

592
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,799
and we're gonna use it
to buy a 3033 mainframe.

593
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:32,093
Not only that, you are
gonna help me fix it up
and get it running again.

594
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,430
The mainframe
is in Daly City,

595
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:39,476
so, yes, you are going
to move to California.

596
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,603
We all are.

597
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:45,649
That is what it costs
to fix our marriage.

598
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,027
So what is this,
extortion?

599
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:54,157
No, it's an investment.

600
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,327
Not just in a mainframe,
but in something that
you believe in

601
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,288
or something I thought
you believed in

602
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,957
before you did
what you did.

603
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,167
Look, I know it was wrong
and I'm sorry.

604
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,252
I told you
it was a mistake.

605
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,798
No, I can't-- I don't
want to talk about that.

606
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,886
( exhales )

607
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,347
Cameron is going
to offer you a job
at Mutiny

608
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,974
and you are
gonna take it.

609
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,018
You want me
to work at Mutiny?

610
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,605
No, I want you
to work with me.

611
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:29,026
And this taking turns,

612
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,987
this one person holding
the kite strings

613
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,406
while the other person
is off chasing something,

614
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,491
that isn't working.

615
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:44,123
You really think
that moving to California
is gonna fix everything?

616
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,125
I don't know.

617
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,714
But it's the best thing
I could come up with.

618
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,886
And I do know
that if we stay here,

619
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,637
we are not gonna make it.

620
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,030
Sir, it's already
been three hours.

621
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,573
I suggest you make
an appointment,

622
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,158
come back at a more
reasonable time.

623
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,786
Hey.

624
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,412
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>how long you'd wait.</i>

625
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,089
( chuckles )
I'm surprised, Joe.

626
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,674
You are persistent.
I'll give you that much.

627
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,884
- I, uh--
- Ooh.

628
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,636
I wanted to show
you something.

629
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,806
<i>( computer screeches, beeps )</i>

630
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,437
See, after my time
at Cardiff, I went away.

631
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,273
I decided I should
do things differently,

632
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,359
operate from a place
of total authenticity.

633
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,614
<i>Be open, be human,</i>
<i>do the right thing.</i>

634
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,200
But the truth is,
no one else

635
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,286
made that pact
with themselves.

636
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,955
So why should I?

637
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,665
What is this?

638
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,207
Damn it.

639
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,043
Your computer's now
infected with a virus,

640
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,462
the same one
that took down Westgroup.

641
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,380
It's a malignant
fetch program,

642
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,299
and it will spread
from this box

643
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,260
to every other
networked computer
in your organization.

644
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,805
Oh, my God.
I'm calling security.

645
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,057
Security?
You want security?

646
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,517
Why, 'cause you
don't trust me?

647
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,810
You don't know
what I'll do.

648
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,145
Who knows
what I'll do?

649
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,273
When there's no trust,
you're vulnerable.

650
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,902
Just because you play
by the rules doesn't mean
anyone else will.

651
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:39,031
- So what should you do?
-<i> ( hangs up phone )</i>

652
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,784
You should
protect yourself,
build a wall.

653
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,954
Not like that,
like this.

654
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,754
- ( computer beeps )
-<i> ( keyboard clacking )</i>

655
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,882
Do you know
what a vaccine is?

656
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,425
It's not medicine;
it's a little bit
of the virus.

657
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,927
You take a little bit
of something bad

658
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,180
so you can never be
hurt like that again.

659
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,639
- ( keyboard clacks )
- ( computer beeps )

660
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,725
Check it out.

661
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,602
Ahem.

662
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,152
-<i> ( keyboard clacks ) </i>
- ( computer beeps )

663
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,409
It's--
how'd you do that?

664
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,786
With an antidote
to the poison.

665
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,248
Sure, this program
only protects your machine
from this specific virus,

666
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,459
but the real product here
is security,

667
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,712
a shield against those
who would hurt you,

668
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,714
perhaps because of
their own carelessness

669
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,801
or simply because
they want to destroy you.

670
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:45,013
And after the national exposure
of what happened at Westgroup,

671
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:48,934
entire organizations
are going to be ravenous

don't want the job,
