12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,008
Hey, it's market research.

13
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,969
Uh-huh.
You know why your network's
on the fritz--

14
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,304
freeloaders.
Ghosts.

15
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,765
- We know how many
subscribers we have.
- Legit ones.

16
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,059
- Meanwhile, the cheats
gobble up your bandwidth.
- Uh-huh.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,979
But what if someone 
were to write a program

18
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:06,692
to find all your users
and map the actual size
of your network?

19
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,653
I call it Sonaris.

20
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,657

"Your understanding of
U.S.-Soviet relations

21

22
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,828

a "flame war."

23
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,706
Donna, you realize
I'm doing this for you,
you know?

24
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,082
- Yeah, I know.
- Could you at--

25
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,625
And you must really
be enjoying it

26
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,335
because I haven't
seen you for two weeks.

27
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,963

31
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,722

- Oh.

33
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,852
- Lois Lane.
- Oh, Clark.

34
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,437

35

42
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,238
Hey.

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,866
- Is your car in the shop?
- Yep.

44
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,160
Nice wheels.

45
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,788
Does it have a horn?

46
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,166

You got-- you got
her back.

50
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,186
Well, Ginnie
got the house,

51
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,856
Feds got
everything else.

52
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,691
Oh, but not this.

53
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,986
Whoo, God.

54
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,278
Can't thank you
enough, Barry.

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,115
- You and Louise...
- Glad to.

56
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:21,035
...holding on to this,
putting me up,

57
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,244
keeping the jackals
at bay.

58
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,289
And you put food on my table
for, what, 20 years?

59
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,416
Anything I can do
to repay you?

60
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,006
You can get in that tank
and drive it like a man.

61
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,716
( chuckles )

62
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,426
All right.

63
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,015
Barry:
<i>There you go.</i>

64
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,142
- ( engine starts )
- Yeah!

65
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,728
( both laughing )

66
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,355
Yeah.

67
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,571
- Eugene:<i> Settling in? </i>
- I am.

68
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,698
- Thanks, Eugene.
- Fine, that's just fine.

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,616
I've got some ideas,
though.

70
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,869
We double-check
all these documents
for scanning errors.

71
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,121
- Yes, sir.
- And sometimes I'll notice
a correlation

72
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,707
between a well's perforation
level and its drainage rate

73
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,375
and I'll make
a note of it here.

74
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,960
And if we all
took those notes,

75
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,461
we could harvest them
into spreadsheets,

76
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,380
- maybe find some--
- Data processing...

77
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,965
- Yeah?
- ...is on B1.

78
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,635
This is data entry.

79
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,680
That mainframe in there?
Our job is to fill it up.

80
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,600
Shovel sand,
not count the grains.

81
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,561
- And that
doesn't bother you?
- No.

82
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,480
Listen, I know staring
at 60 years of well depths

83
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,982
ain't exactly hair-raising.

84
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,235
That's why it helps
to have a pastime.

85
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,029
We're doing a decoy
decorating contest.

86
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,281
Drakes or hens,
your choice.

87
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,912

vintage percussion.

90
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,670

Jell-O chunks.

97
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,447
But you dodge them,

up, down,
shelf to shelf.

99
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:12,289
Soon the fridge is empty.
Only you, the Jell-O bowl,
have survived.

100
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,373
I call it "Jiggles."

101
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,046

102
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,548
Cool, uh,
questions, anyone?

103
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:26,345
- Uh, what flavor the Jell-O?
- Orange, obviously.

104
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,014
- "Jiggles" sounds
like a strip joint.
- Lev:<i> Well, it's not.</i>

105
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,641
Am I the only one
that's rooting
for the hands?

106
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,061
You know,
'cause the family's hungry
and you're available.

107

I feel like it's your job
to be eaten, you know?

108
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,233
Unless you're rancid,
moldy, like three weeks old.

109
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,318
Yeah, and then you
could call it, like,

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,278
"Jell-O Death Wish"
or something.

111
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,990
Your mission--
poison the family.
Kill 'em all.

112
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,244
- Totally.
- My Jell-O is not rancid.

113
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,704

- Does it need one?
- Cameron:<i> Uh, yeah, it helps.</i>

121
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,597
Online gaming is different
from arcade or cartridge.

122
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,058
You're trying to draw
the players into a world,

123
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,394
- not just hustle
them for quarters--

170
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,820
At least you have one.

171
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,240
Was moving here
a mistake?

172
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,492
<i>Uh, probably.</i>

173
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,202
Oh, great.
I'm gonna go
pack tonight.

174
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,204
Sara, it was a joke.
We can't go back to Austin.

175
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,621
Your father would flip.

176
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,499
<i>No, I-- I know,</i>
<i>I know.</i>

177
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,460
And, look, I love my dad,
but screw him, you know?

178
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,255
Oh, God, I can't believe
I'm whining.

179
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,131
<i>I hate when</i>
<i>I get like this.</i>

180
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,263
Let's have dinner.

181
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,224
<i>A dinner party</i>
<i>with other people.</i>

182
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,560
Evan and Alicia
will drive up for
a free meal, right?

183
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,937
( laughs )

184
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,523
You could invite
your friends from Dallas.

185
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,776
<i>Unless that makes you</i>
<i>uncomfortable.</i>

186
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:14,197
No, that-- um,
that sounds like fun.

187
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,161
Let me get back to you.

188
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,038
Is that a personal call?

189
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,916
- Love you.
-<i> ( dial tone )</i>

190
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,645
Is Jacob Wheeler in?
Joe MacMillan.

191
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,357
Yes, I'd like to make
an appointment.

192
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,860
4:00? Absolutely,
that works for me.

193
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,238
I'll see you then.

194
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,539
Give people a dial-up,
they'll talk about anything--

195
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,626
politics,
sports, Kathy Ireland,
Billy Joel sucks--

196
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,294
Hey, Billy has chops.

197
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,296
I started a discussion
on Moog synthesizers.

198
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,090
It got 23 replies.
Can I borrow a coder?

199
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,301
We need to split Community
into multiple forums.

200
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,261
- It's exploding.
- Yes, okay.

201
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,347
Take Lev, please.

202
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,642
- Hey, how many online?
- 306.

203
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,226
- What?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,437
<i>That's up, what,</i>
<i>50, week to week?</i>

205
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,730
It's gonna be a bloodbath
in "Tank Battle."

206
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,983
Well, that's
the beautiful thing
about our business model.

207
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,068
Even the corpses
pay to play.

208
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,404
- That PBX patch is holding.
- So we're above water.

209
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,157
Well, we're just
not drowning so fast.

210
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,995
( moans )

211
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,831
I picked up
a new long-haul route.

212
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,916
- Oh, you did?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,503
Where's the layover?

214
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,881
- Tokyo.
- Ah, me "wrikey."

215
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,258
- ( laughs )
- Tokyo.

216
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,260
( laughs, sighs )

217
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,846
It's gonna put
a serious hitch in these
little hanky-panks.

218
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,931
I'll just
stop by the house.

219
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,684
I wouldn't.

220
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,691
Well, what's
this about, then?

221
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,656
This...

222
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,783
is why I married you
in the first place.

223
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,288
The man in 25B.

224
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,551
Going dark on me?

225
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,928
It's okay.

226
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,430
Well, I paid
for that house.

227
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,098
And now it's mine.

228
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,392
And I can do what I want
with whom I want.

229
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,352
I understand that.
I just don't want to feel

230
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,812
that there's a broom
at my heels.

231
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,857
The world didn't stop
when you went to prison.

232
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,405
You ashamed of me,
Ginnie?

233
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,907
Not anymore.

234
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,919
All right, well,
I'll see you this
weekend, then.

235
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,756
I hope you're joking.

236
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,929
I just don't think
the time's right.

237
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,557
Well, hold on, now.
Is that why you
showed up today?

238
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,850
To convince me
not to go to Galveston?

239
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,438
Honestly, I didn't
think I'd have to.

240
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,856
We're not
your satellites anymore,

241
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,151
spinning around
the big man.

242
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,445
It was a fun ride
and a real hot show,

243
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,489
but this one's not yours.

244
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,784
Please don't come, John.

245
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,661
Promise you won't.

246
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,334
Let me know.

247
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,338
Love to Nancy
and the kids.

248
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,465
All right.

249
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,843
( sighs )
Some people don't
want to be saved.

250
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,430
Joe:<i> You know</i>
<i>the most common last-second</i>
<i>regret of suicides?</i>

251
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,141
People who jump off
bridges but live?

252
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,812
- High school girlfriends.
- ( chuckles ) Faucet left on.

253
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,774
Car running. Fridge open.
Just loose ends.

254
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,901
Okay, let me have it.

255
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,530
You're leaking data,
data that can be used

256
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,617
to increase yields,
predict profits, reduce risk.

257
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,120
I suggest folding
data collection and analytics
into a single department--

258
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,748
- Sure, do it.
- I'm not done.

259
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,999
I am.

260
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,959
Who's in charge
down there?

261
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,838
Uh, Eugene Bowdich.

262
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,382
Fire him.
Scrap the whole department.

263
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,300
Build your own.
It's the best way.

264
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,761
I'll let HR know.

265
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,096
I never thought you'd stay
on the basement level,

266
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,558
but if that's your goal...

267
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,771
I just need
a few days to prepare.

268
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,857
<i>Take 'em.</i>

269
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,861
Joe?

270
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,655
Seat opens up
on a crowded train.

271
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,075
It's okay to hesitate.
Maybe you're the next stop.

272
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,745
Maybe you're
a good Samaritan.

273
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,498
Or maybe you think
you don't deserve it.

274
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,133
Joe's voice:
<i>So, that's it.</i>
<i>Thursday night, 8:00.</i>

<i>Hope you guys can make it.</i>
<i>Talk soon.</i>

276
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,264
Okay, I just
need to listen to it
one more time.

277
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,349
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,442
Okay, you first.

282
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,652
Okay, I'm picturing
a perfume model.

283
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,571
- Dior--
no, no, no, Halston.
- Mm.

284
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,573
- Tall, blonde--
- Well, duh.

285
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,826
Daryl Hannah cheekbones,
shoulder pads,
Upper East Side.

286
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,912
No, no, no, no, no.
After Cameron, he'd want
a follower.

287
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,248
You know,
someone less challenging.

288
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,792
- Really?
- Yeah.

289
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,502
- Worked for me.
- ( laughs sarcastically )

290
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:06,132
I'm going with a secretary,
Joan Baez type.

291
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,967
You know,
kittens on the futon.

292
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,220
- I guess we'll find out.
- ( laughs )

293
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,264
What, dinner?
With him?

294
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,934
Well, yeah.
Oh, come on.
Aren't you curious?

295
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,186
Mysteriously, my interest
in tall, dark mannequins

296
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,731
with delusions of grandeur
has dwindled,

297
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,691
but, hey,
knock yourself out.

298
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,234
Snob.

299
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,444
Sucker.

That's it,

Oh, you twisted

00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,847
- Excuse me?
- Yes, dear-- I mean,
yes, honey.

310
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,391
Damn it.
One of your freeloaders
just wasted me.

311
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,893
Okay, well,
I'm gonna go shower.

312
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,812
I want us accidentally
late on purpose.

313
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,189
Can't we bag?
I think I feel
a cold coming on.

314
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,065
Gordon,
this was your idea.

315
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,651
<i>Well, how about</i>
<i>the two of us</i>
<i>just go out?</i>

316
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,529
You know, Chaparral Club,
the Torch, you know?

317
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,115
We'll tell Rose to stay
the night, maybe rent
a room downtown.

318
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,659
I would love to.
That sounds great.

319
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,994
But we told them
we're coming.

320
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,704
Wheels up in 20.

321
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,045
"They can be
a great people, Kal-El;

323
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,425
They only lack the program

324

338
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,641
What did you think?

339
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,393
Okay.

340
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,144
It took me
about an hour and a half.

341
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,940
- That's pretty fast.
-<i> Because it's a rehash.</i>

342
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,482
You stole the layout
from chapter nine

343
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,234
and the puzzles from 14,
you put them in a blender

344
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,819
- and hoped no one
would notice.
- No, I--

345
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,280
And of course if you get stuck,
the hairy lampshade

346
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,616
comes swooping in
and literally...

347
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,036
- What? It's a fez.
- ...drops clues on your head
like dandruff.

348
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,496
You know what I wanted to do?
I wanted to take that thing

349
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,125
by the pubes
and then fly outta there.

350
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,502
To some other game.

351
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,546
To someplace new.

352
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:54,092
This--
this shouldn't be updated,
it should be destroyed.

353
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,220
So stick that in your box.

354
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,932
<i>( thumping resumes )</i>

355
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,818
I...

356
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,825
- Donna:<i> Ahem. </i>
- ( knocks )

357
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,411
Oh, hey.

358
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,706
Wow, you guys
look great.

359
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,835
- Uh, here you go.
- Thanks.

360
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,420
It's-- I should've
clarified about--

361
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,965
Oh, come on.
I wear this every day.

362
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,051
Yay, finally.

363
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,053
I've heard a lot
about you guys.
I'm Sara.

364
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,681
Hey.

365
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,474
Joe, don't leave them
in the hall.

366
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,226
- Oh, sorry, come on in.
- Big galoot.

367
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,855
<i>I love that word.</i>
<i>It comes from the Dutch.</i>

368
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:53,026
It means either galley slave
or pirate or pimp.

369
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,361
But if I'm lucky,
all three, right?

370
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,322
- You guys want a drink?
- Donna: Oh, yes, please.

371
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,326
- Yeah, ahem.
- Um, gin and tonic,
hold the tonic.

372
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,460
( chatting, laughing )

373
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,932
Oh.

374
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,559
Ginnie:
<i>I'm so proud of you,</i>
<i>I'm gonna cry.</i>

375
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,146
( chatter continues )

376
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,995
Gordon:
<i>So I told 'em,</i>
<i>"You got two choices.</i>

377
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:49,540
Either pump the MSRP
or cover our tooling overages."

378
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,168
Of course, there were
no tooling overages.

379
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,669
You son of a bitch,
I taught you that move.

380
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,671
Yeah, create the sickness,
sell 'em the cure.

381
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,298
- It still works.
- Hell, yeah, it got me
a promotion this week.

382
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,095
- Gordon:
<i>Mm, congratulations. </i>
- So, this is cozy.

383
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,097
Yeah, we got
a bigger place in Austin.

384
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:07,725
This is just a<i> pied-à-terre</i>
for my<i> auteur.</i>

385
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,104
Yeah, I'm trying
to finish this article.

386
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,647
Well, actually,
I'm trying to start it.

387
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,943
- Oh, uh, about what?
- The Jarvik artificial heart.

388
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,780
- Oh, so, um,
nothing serious.
-<i> ( laughs ) Well, yeah.</i>

389
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,950
My friend
Alicia's doing the layout.
She's a professor of design.

390
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,743
Joe:
<i>They should've been</i>
<i>here an hour ago.</i>

391
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,203
Probably stuck
outside Waco

392
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,038
trying to fix a flat
tire with a metaphor.

393
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,250
- Gotta love academics.
- Lovely people, total flakes.

394
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,587
Joe, do you mind
helping me for a second?

395
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,965
Yeah.

396
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,346
- Who are you right now?
- What do you mean?

397
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,849
Don't you dare
apologize for my friends,

398
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,644
for our friends,
for this apartment,
or for me.

399
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,896
And if you're
done dick measuring
for the evening,

400
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,273
then you might
want to mention

401
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,357
the real reason
you got the promotion.

402
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,110
The truth.
Do you remember that?

403
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,906
And the apricots
are really good, too.

404
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,616
Little heavy
on the blue cheese, but--

405
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,618
All right,
where were we?

406
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,121
Mm, academia.

407
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,874
Right, you say that
like it's a nut you're
allergic to.

408
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,543
- ( Donna laughs )
- You know what, Sara?
I like you.

409
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,964
And I'm gonna give
you a really good
piece of advice.

410
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,008
Don't let him
hold out on you.

411
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,885
<i>Come on, Joe.</i>

412
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,470
<i>What are you saving</i>
<i>all that Cardiff money for?</i>

413
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,266
Hmm? Mutual funds?
Houseboat on Lake Travis?

414
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,392
I didn't get anything
from Cardiff.

415
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,023
Not a penny.

416
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,611
Pass the red?

417
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,988

- Damn it!
- It's a computer
game, okay?

429
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,723
Calm down.
I'm sure it's nothing.

430
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,350
Let me just check
the root file.

431
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,019
- ( speaks Russian )
- Bad software hit our network.

432
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,147
- It's overwriting our data.
- Our drives or the users'?

433
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,398
- Both.
- It just ate chess.

434
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,944
- What?
- Hey, we need to quarantine
all the unaffected machines.

435
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,905
- No!
- Anyone connected 
right now...

436
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,740
- No!
- ...is vulnerable.

437
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,492
We have users online.
We're not-- we're staying up.

438
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,704
- It's starting on "Parallax."
- Christ, this thing is fast.

439
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,540
- There goes chapter two.
- Can somebody call Donna?

440
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,376
Yo-Yo:
<i>We couldn't find her number.</i>

441
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,253
- What?
- It's on a Post-it
somewhere.

442
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,380
Jesus.

443
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,674
I think that
it'll be fine.

444
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,390
Hi, can I speak to Donna?

445
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,059
What? Where?

446
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,603
It's Cameron.
Did she leave a number?

447
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,065
( groans )
Listen to me!

448
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,276
I need to speak
to Donna right away!

- ( laughs )

Hello?

Shut it down.

The whole network?

456
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,053
Everything,
shut it all down.

457
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,600
Donna:
<i>Maybe you changed him.</i>

458
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,394
Sara:
<i>No, he's nothing</i>
<i>like my ex.</i>

459
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,562
Thought you were
strictly a beer guy.

460
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,316
I had this bottle
of "San-seer" at the mission
last summer.

461
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,401
It kind of rocked my world.

462
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,278
Sancerre.

463
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,071
Sans-who-gives-a-shit.

464
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,290
- Mm.
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

465
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:02,209
<i>Mm, that's good.</i>

466
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,965
It makes it all
worthwhile, right?

467
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,884
Oh, yeah.

468
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,719
She's burning
at both ends.

469
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,806
Every morning,
I peel her off the couch,
tuck her in.

470
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,724
My turn, I guess.

471
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:22,229
Anyhow, you traded up.
It's good to see you're
doing so well.

472
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,897
You, too.

473
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,611
Why didn't you tell me
you got screwed by Cardiff?

474
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,530
Well, I thought
I could live with it.

475
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,616
Well, I'd have gone
to him for you.

476
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,285
I mean, I wouldn't have
split my share or anything,

477
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,705
but, you know,
I would've spoken up.

478
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,500
I report every morning
to a basement.

479
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,419
( laughs )
I come home
to an apartment

480
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,005
that's smaller
than my old bathroom.

481
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:52,051
And yet if you offered me
this version of my life

482
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,512
or your payout,

483
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,680
whatever it was--
how much was it?

484
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,099
$838,100--

485
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,186
I'd choose this.

486
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,604
I'd choose her.

487
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,984
- Honey?
- Yeah?

488
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:12,154
Hey, I'm sorry.
Rose says Mutiny's
trying to reach me

489
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,156
and I called and their
phone lines are all tied up.

490
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,408
I think we should
head over there.

491
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,201
Oh, Donna,
is it serious?

492
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,203
No, it's probably
just a riot,

493
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,122
a massive fire,
or a Goobers overdose.

494
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,418
Joe, thank you
for a lovely evening.

495
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,341
Well, it was good
to see you.

496
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,134
Sorry we have
to cut it short.

497
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,969
It's okay.

498
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,679
Enjoy the Sancerre.

499
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,475
Gordon:
<i>Sara, thanks</i>
<i>for having us.</i>

500
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:44,644
Oh, my God,
I thought that
would never end.

501
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,272
What is he
doing with her?

502
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,731
And vice versa,
what do you think?

503
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,483
She's got some sort
of savior complex?

504
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,986
I don't know.
She seems impressive to me.

505
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,532
Yeah, well, I'm sure
her father's name opens
all kinds of doors.

506
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,535
Yeah, Joe's happy.
Minor miracle.

507
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,913
Yeah, of course he is.
He's got her completely
snowed.

508
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,916
Well, you look
lovely tonight.

509
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,140
Hey, uh,
thank you, Pop.

510
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,933
Now everyone
knows you're out here.

511
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,478
How are you, James?

512
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,938
Couldn't have picked up
a phone when you got out?

513
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,690
No, I wanted to
say this in person.

514
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,943
Oh, jeez,
here we go.

515
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,195
Look, the rehearsal
dinner's a damn milestone,

516
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,989
so sit back...

517
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,076
- close your piehole.
- ( chuckles )

518
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,747
"When his mother
and I found James on
the roof one Christmas,

519
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,708
waiting for Santa with
a flashlight and a long
list of questions,

520
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,753
we knew that
our boy wasn't afraid
of a challenge.

521
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,798
And now we know Lisa
isn't either."

522
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,842
- Ha-ha.
- ( snorts )

523
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,303
- "Pause for laughter."
- Oh, nice.

524
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,180
Okay.

525
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,517
"When James got his first
strikeout in Little League,

When he graduated
from high school,

528
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:14,067
I was at a conference
in Tampa.

529
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,530
I know there are times
when it felt like his father

530
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,325
was nothing but a head rub
in the morning

531
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,370
and a shadow
in the door at night.

532
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,625
But not this night.

533
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,003
Not tonight."

534
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:37,383
May I see it?
I'd really like
to show Lisa.

Look, I don't know
what Mom told you,

537
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,560
but I'm not angry at you.

538

I hear you got yourself
a hell of a gal, huh?

540
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,943
Aw, yeah.

541
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,946
Well, I'll have
you over to the--

Sure thing.

All righty, well,

545

It's gonna feel weird
saying that.

546
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,295
"My wife."

547
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,964
Well,
it gets easier.

548

come tomorrow?

Every game that we make.

for ruining their
other software.

565

Chances are they've suffered
total data extinction

566
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,412

blame us.

No, no, no.
He doesn't know
what that is.

You wouldn't
just stay away?

590
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,431
You couldn't just leave
us to do our thing?

591

Right?

the egg in his chest

00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,223
( breathing slows )

676
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,101
Okay.

677
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,186
That's what I'm gonna
miss about "Parallax."

678
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,897
Those early chapters,

679
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,315
how every trap
had a reward,

680
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,569
every exit was
actually an entrance.

681
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,405
You know, the whole
thing made me feel like
"The Wizard of Oz."

682
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,490
But it was better
because you were
really like--

683
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,244
like inside the movie,
you know?

684
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,122
Running those balloons,
running through those
poppy fields?

685
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,165
It was like it was real.

686
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,005
I'm gonna let go, okay?

687
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,298
Yeah.

688
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,801
I'm gonna
get you some water.

689
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,970
Don't go anywhere, okay?

690
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,521
( sobbing )

691
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,809
How bad is it?

692
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,979
( yawns )

693
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,897
It's bad.

694
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,575
I should've
tested it more.

695
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,081
I just--
I got excited or...

696
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,628
I don't know.
I should have told you.

697
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,505
No.

698
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,468
No, I let it happen.

699
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,262
I didn't stop you.

700
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,937
What exactly
was the issue?

701
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,068
Oh, sorry.

702
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,333
( clanks )

703
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,878
Eugene:
<i>Well, that's what I'm</i>
<i>trying to find out.</i>

704
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,796
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

705
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,841
<i>Yeah, hold on.</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>

706
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,468
Hold on.
Morning.

707
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,562
<i>( Eugene chuckles )</i>

708
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,232
-<i> Boy, that's funny. Yeah. </i>
- ( sighs )

709
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:45,151
Meet me in
the mainframe room.

710
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,903
- I'm almost done.
- Now.

711
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,036
<i>( door closes )</i>

712
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,581
<i>( exhales sharply )</i>

713
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,504
<i>( machines powering up )</i>

714
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,343
<i>( machines whirring )</i>

715
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,763
( beeping )

716
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,844
These machines.

717
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,971
They work
the same shift as us.

718
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,056
Yep, 9:00 to 5:00.

719
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,184
- Why?
- Millions of dollars
of hardware

720
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,145
sitting unused
for 16 hours a day.

721
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,855
What's this about?

722
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,149
A way in.

723
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,234
- What?
-<i> Never mind.</i>

724
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,198
Back to work, then?

725
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,201
Yes, sir.

726
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:37,472
