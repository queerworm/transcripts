<i>Mommy, fix it.</i>
<i>Make it better.</i>

Girls, girls,
Mommy's gonna be

00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,227
Gordon,

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,521
Barely.

Brian:
<i>Yeah, watch out</i>
<i>for mites.</i>

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,525
Well, is there
something we can do?

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:29,196
- Give it some water, or...
- I think we're beyond that.

10
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,323

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,241
I should take it

Honey, the girls
have to get to school.

13
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,412
And with your car

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,164
Yeah, yeah,
you're right.

15
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,791
Hey, you need
a ride, neighbor?

Donna:
<i>Oh, that would be</i>
<i>so great.</i>

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,550
- Yeah, thanks, Brian.
- Hey, no problemo.

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,761
Poor little sucker.

Hey, man.

Don't sweat today.

22

You can do this.

It's no one's fault.

It's like when you get

your orange grove.

35

Wait, you're firing me?
I'm being fired?

46
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,915
- Just calm down.
- My reference letter.

47
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,792
And don't worry,
I wrote it myself.

48
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,627
Sign it.

49
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,587
Oh, my God,

That's not portable,

the combined sales figures

59

60
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,027
- Video games.
- Microcomputers.

Proof that America

<i>And how did</i>

63

than 15 pounds.

71
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,398
Anyone that knows anything
about microprocessing...

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,983
You've got
that number wrong,
right, Gordon?

73
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,860
It's gonna take
a million dollars

74
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,779
and four times the size
of this desk...

75
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,573
- Yes, that's correct.
-<i> ( chatter stops )</i>

76
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,158

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,870
- Randy.
- Sure was.

79
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,664
Say, where is Randy?
Oh, that's right,
you fired him.

80
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,374
Run out to the parking lot.
Maybe you can flag him down.

81

- Gordon, outside.
- Brian:<i> Guys, relax. </i>

<i>No, I'm not relaxing.</i>
<i>Wake up, Brian.</i>

something I'm in no way
qualified to do.

90
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm worried
about their attitude.

91
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,105
Their attitude is based
on the laws of physics,

92
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,689
which, if I were you,
I'd bone up on.

93

Craig James was slow

Still plenty
fast enough.

128
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,772
There's gotta be a way
to add speed without
adding heat.

129
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,983
Or you can build in a griddle
and fry steaks on it.

What do you want to
call this place?

I guess "Skunk Works"
is taken.

132
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:49,159
"The Chamber
of Chipsets."
"Logic Lair."

133
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:53,412
We're probably gonna
end up killing each other

00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,102
Eiger &amp; Littlefield
Venture Capital.

142
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,895
"Venture capital"?

Hell, I remember

called "money."

144
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,775
Give him five minutes.
He just flew in from New York.

145
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,569

- So did we.

146
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,199
They keep reading about
the Silicon Prairie
in the "Journal."

147
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,160
They have cash to spend
and they want exposure
to this market.

148
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,080
Our PC could be
a nice entry point.

149
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,082
You know I gotta clear
all this with Nathan.

150
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,126
I already have.

151
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,507
- Aaron.
- Hey.

152
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,843
Hey, John Bosworth here.
Nice to meet ya.

153
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,888
- How was the flight?
- Oh, a little bumpy,
but worth it.

154
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,891
Well, good.
I sure as shit hope so.

155
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,396
I've identified
the bugs in the PCBs.

156
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,773
We're gonna have to
recall about 10,000 units.

157
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,777
But the bigger problem
is with the keyboard bouncing.

158
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,904
If we could just
redesign the trim,
then--

159
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,408
But that's not
our purview, right?

160
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,786
How soon can I
tell Mark?

161
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,039
Monday, Tuesday
at the latest.

162
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:25,339
- Your folks are well?
- Oh, great. Thank you.

163
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,425
Only parents I ever knew
who came to the game to
cheer on the xylophonist.

164
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,471
( laughs )
And how's Martine?

165
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,558
Well, she thought
that Texas Instruments
meant staying in Texas.

166
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,146
This is our third stop
in five years, so...

167
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,440
I think she wants
to settle down, but--

168
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,942
But that's not the way
you climb the ladder.

169
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,652
( chuckles )

170
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,612
I can't believe
we're talking like this--

171
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,240
climbing ladders,
quarterly targets.

172
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,867
We are a long way
from high school.

173
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,245
Oh, well, thank God.
My hair and that band uniform.

174
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,831
<i>Hey, we all knew that you</i>
<i>weren't cut out for band.</i>

175
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,791
You were just
marking time,

176
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,710
waiting for something
better to come along.

177
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,135
Donna...

178
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,221
not to be a pain,

179
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,556
but I'm meeting
with Mark tomorrow

180
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:20,143
and that report
would be helpful.

181
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,230
Oh, okay.

182
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,148
You'll have it.

183
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,617

184
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,879

Mr. MacMillan's office.

188
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,396
Hi...

189
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,980
Debbie:
<i>Cameron?</i>

190
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,905
We have got
an ideal business climate.
Unlimited growth curve.

191
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,575
And you just got your
ass handed to you by IBM.

192
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,286
They took their shot.
They missed.

193
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,540
But the cash from
your system packages
is running out, correct?

194
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,003
Guys, I'm gonna
find out anyway.

195
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,089
- John:<i> How's that? </i>
- Well, we partner with you,

196
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,258
we audit your books
top to bottom,

197
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,260
install upper
management on-site,

198
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,095
probably Roger.

199
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,056
- You'd report to him.
- Roger?

200
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,891
It's just an option
we're discussing.

201
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,436
- At lunch?
- Aaron:<i> That's right.</i>

202
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:48,315
You know, maybe instead
of sending someone out,
you do a weekly call.

203
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,942
Guys, I haven't even heard
a rollout date yet, okay?

204
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,279
What's your marketing strategy?
How do you plan on rebuilding
your client base here?

205
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,281
We got a whole new
client base.

206
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:00,118
Yeah, Joe here
wants to take this
machine to the people.

207
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,246
Yeah, no more biz-to-biz.
We're pushing doorbells
and pounding pavement.

208
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,415
Along with a sophisticated
media campaign.

209
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,126
Oh, sophisticated, my ass.
Come on, Joe.

210
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,963
We're tired of
these doodad launches
and corporate suites.

211
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,923
No, I wanna
breathe me some air.

212
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:18,094
You know,
mom-and-pop stores,
county fairs.

213
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,473
Now, we may not have
the track record
or the balance sheet,

214
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,642
but, by God,
we got heart.

215
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,978
That can-do
Texas spirit, y'all.

216
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,943
My home number's
on the back.

217
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,070
I want you to call
the ranch anytime.

218
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,364
Sure will.

219
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,992
Let me show you
some sketches.

220
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,662
It's so good
seeing you again, Joe.

221
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,664
I'll be in touch.

222
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,350
( softly )
What do you think?
Let 'em go?

223
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,854
What, before midnight?

224
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,191
You can't win a race
at the quarter pole.

225
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,819
Seriously,
buy yourself some
goodwill with these guys.

226
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,074
( loudly )
All right, thanks,
everyone.

227
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,034
Have a good night.

228
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,710
Brian:<i> Especially if we try</i>
<i>and cram a bigger motherboard</i>
<i>into a smaller case.</i>

229
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,380
Either way, we swap out
the crystal and we
overclock the CPU.

230
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,508
Which heats up
the innards, which means
a bigger heat sink.

231
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,386
And may I remind you,
we just ditched
the heat sink.

232
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,179
( sighs )
Okay.

233
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,393
Hey, how's it
going?

234
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:52,188
- No contact, remember?
- I know, I know.

235
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,315
- Look, I don't mean to pry.
-<i> ( soda can clatters )</i>

236
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,360
I know it's only been a week
and you're under a lot
of pressure,

237
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,237
but if you could
just give us

238
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,364
some sort
of idea as to--

239
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,455
I'll order
a pizza.

240
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,540
She took my soda.

241
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,586
Nothing like a bubble bath
to make you forget life's
little traumas.

242
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,631
- Works for me.
- Oh, we also got them
a little something.

243
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,091
Oh, you
shouldn't have.

244
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,098
"Bowser"?

245
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,684
It's not exactly
a bird's name.

246
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,394
( scoffs )
Poor thing's dead by now.

247
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,771
I expect you can call it
whatever you like.

<i>( tinny music playing )</i>

249
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,941

250
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,111
The Japanese never sleep.
Look here.

251
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,783
It's our back pager
this month.

00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,076

we'll move half a million.

253
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,911
( chuckles )
"No-doubt" Dad.

254
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,622
It's a catalogue
business, darling.

255
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,873
Both:
"There's always doubt."

256
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,752
Now, don't go telling
Gordon it's from us.

257
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,671
I know he
doesn't approve.

260
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,301
He's got a new project.

261
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,638
Well, make sure he does
the dishes sometime.

262
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,807
I love
my son-in-law,

263
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,476
but I don't
wanna see you
worn down to a nub.

264
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,852
Why, do I seem
nubbish to you?

265
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,651
You are radiant,
as always.

How's life at TI?

268
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,203
You know, we haven't even
seen Hunt at the club
since he moved back.

269
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,497
Well, nose
to the grindstone.

270
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,417
Well, maybe Fourth of July,
he'll show off that foreign
wife of his.

271
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,296
- Mom, she's Canadian.
- She is a guest
of this country.

272
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:45,218
She can wave a flag
and light something on fire
like the rest of us.

273
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,848
Well, I don't think
they'll be in Dallas long.

274
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,142
If management likes him,
they'll probably ship him
overseas.

275
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:59,524
Mm, old Hunt in Vienna
or Rome, Italy.

276
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,068
Can you imagine?

277
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,701
- This is very nice.
- Mm-hmm, a man needs
to seek shelter.

278
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,662
I believe we
have that in common.

279
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,708
We don't just need money.
We need smart money.

280
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,877
A name. Someone
who puts us on the map.

281
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,503
Yeah, I know.

282
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,881
You weren't wrong
to do what you did,

283
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,674
but then,
neither was John.

284
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,966
John:
<i>Hey.</i>

285
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,474
A little scotch here,
and... I guessed.

286
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,982
We let you in the door,
Joe, we gave you the rope.

287
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,528
But only one
boss-dick can swing it.

288
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,574
Now, you're the vision guy
and I'm retired and I want
to stay retired.

289
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,869
The way that works
is that John here
sends me my checks,

290
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,329
keeps me
fat and happy.

291
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,249
So John makes
the financial decisions

292
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,794
on this project,
all of them.

293
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,472
Agreed.

294
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,933
Good.

295
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,768

296
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,104
No more backstage
bullshit.

297
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:24,358
I'm gonna set you up
with Louise Lutherford.

298
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,569
- An old friend of ours.
- Cardiff: Mm-hmm,
she is a handful...

299
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,989
but she's got
more than enough capital
to see us through.

300
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,952
And she's local,
so no "Rogers."

301
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,537
Yeah, that's
all well and good,

302
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,705
but does she have
a background in--

303
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,081
Good evening, Seth.

304
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,167
Mr. Cardiff.
Are we dining tonight?

305
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,628
Oh, you know it.
I'll have the petit fillet.

306
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,922
Burn it,
and peas and mash.

307
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,425
Porterhouse, rare.
Rare.

308
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,554
I'll have the same.

309
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,307
I mean, we could
recess the keyboard
in the bottom cover

310
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,268
and run the connector cable
through the hinges.

311
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,689
Okay.
No one's ever
done that before.

312
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,401
- Well, does that mean
it can't be done?
- No, just expensive.

313
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,738
Well, how else
are we gonna make room
for the screen?

314
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,033
Gordon, I'm not trying
to yuck your yum here.

315
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,996
No one
wants this to work
more than me.

316
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,332
It's a hell of a concept,
but to execute it...

317
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,879
- ...that's tough sleddin'.
- I know, I know.

318
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,464
( sighs )

319
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,759
First thing tomorrow,
we sit down with Joe,

320
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:36,681
bring him back to Earth,
tell him it can't be done.

321
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,099
I'll fly wingman
if you want.

322
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,062
No, no,
I'll tell him.

323
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,827

324
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,374
-<i> ( phone rings ) </i>

325
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,876
Joe:
<i>You called earlier.</i>

326
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,086
No, I don't--

327
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,005
yes, fine, yes,
I did by mistake.

328
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,965
What?
What do you want?

329
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,884
Just checking in.

330
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,511
<i>Okay, I'm all checked.</i>

331
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,598
-<i> I just wanted to know... </i>
- What's taking so long?

332
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,726
You're a talented coder,
but right now you're
a bottleneck.

333
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,771

Couple hours.

349
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,081
That's
an interesting layout.

350

You're already rooting around

393
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,832
Oh, "Go To"
executes the next line.

394
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,918
"Go Sub," you need, like,
a return command at the end.

395

That makes
no sense to me.

You can work here

You cannot live here.

I think we can
make this work.

408
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:30,784
If we actually
split the motherboard

409
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,870
and then layer

410
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,707
one half on top
of the other,

411
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,878
run the jumpers
vertically.

412
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,880
So you're doubling
the amount of chips
on each half.

413
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,049
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

414
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,093
Where'd you get
that idea?

415
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,387
In my kitchen.

416
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,847
It'd buy us a couple
centimeters, for sure.

417
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,474
- Nice work.
- If we can stabilize
the vertices.

Brian:
<i>Buddy, I thought</i>
<i>we had one.</i>

423
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,443
Not like this.
I call it a layered array.

424

It's really,
really different.

425
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,822

- Yeah, I see that.

a brand-new board from scratch?

are we doing here?

00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,968
You're right.
I wasn't thinking
that far ahead.

432

- Gordo, it's
a killer idea, it is.

But we got three months.

434

Every bone in my body
is telling me

435
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,605
that if we try
and reinvent the wheel here,

436
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,650
man, we're gonna end up
with a square wheel.

where do you hail from?
