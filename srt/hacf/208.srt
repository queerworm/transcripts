Joe told me they were gonna
mess with it, with Mutiny.

5
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,827
- And now you decide
to believe him?
-<i> Yeah, I do.</i>

6
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,495
He was telling the truth.
I could tell.

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:40,165
- ( scoffs )
- I just could.

8
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,334
- What, are you mad?
-<i> Yeah, I am.</i>

9
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,128
I wanted to sell.
And I'm not the only one,
by the way.

11

mysterious feeling you got

12
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,720
off the one person
you told the rest of us
never to trust.

13
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,432
I'm not going
to apologize.

14
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,643
Is that going
to be a problem?

15
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,771
No.

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,110
When we're able,
I think we should
find another network.

17
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,780
It's about time we got out
of the Joe MacMillan business.

18
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,324
Yeah, agreed.

23

Don't you think
that's something
I'd wanna know about?

24
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,172
- To be there?
- Well, we wanted it
to be the two of us.

25
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,885
- ( soft laugh )
- No big party, just
two people in love.

26
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,638
- ( sighs )
- Don't be upset, Dad.
This is good news.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,558
I'm happy for you.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,771
It's just...
you're my daughter.

29
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,564
Joe, I'm sure
you can understand

30
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,441
why I'd want to be at
my only daughter's wedding.

31
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,317
Sir, we meant
no disrespect.

32
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,571
You seem to be making a habit
of springing things on people.

33
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,156
We did this together.
It wasn't inflicted on me.

34
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,742
It was my decision,
actually.

35
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,494
<i>Look, why are you</i>
<i>making this about you?</i>

36
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,871
I just told you
I got married.

37
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,581
You should
be happy for me.

38
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,625
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,668
Congratulations.

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,045
To both of you.

41
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,547
Thank you.

42
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:15,052
Well, if you'll
excuse me for a moment,
I'll go tell Caroline.

43
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,971
Maybe I'll get
a better reaction
out of her.

44
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,438
I take it there's
something else you want
to discuss with me?

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,650
- Um...
- Sara can't stand Caroline.

47
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,949
As much as I appreciate
the opportunity you've
given me here,

48
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,867
I think it's time
for me to move on.

50
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,289
I'm sorry
to lay all this
on you at once.

51
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,125
No, no, no.
You're right.

52
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,876
Maybe it is time
to move on.

53
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,088
No hard feelings.

54
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,173
Best of luck in all
your future endeavors.

55
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:58,261
Uh, I'm happy to help you
find a replacement.

56
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,140
No, that's okay.
I'll leave that up
to our people.

57
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,142
- They'll find
the right guy.
- Okay.

58
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,602
I can stick around
until you've got
someone in place.

59
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,937
( chuckles )
Don't be silly.

60
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,023
I couldn't give
my daughter a wedding.

61
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,858
The least I can do
is give her a honeymoon.

62
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,818
I'll tell you what.

63
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,570
Ask Caroline for the keys
to my private garage.

64
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,824
There's a '57 Bel Air
convertible in there,

65
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,910
pristine and ready to go.

66
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,163
Take it for
a couple of weeks.
Hit the road.

67
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:28,876
Uh, I'll talk
to Sara about that.

68
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,919
- Thank you.
- You bet.

69
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:40,345

sorry the Mutiny deal
didn't go through.

72

things don't always
break my way.

and you reconfigured
the game menu?

Hmm? Yeah, I want
to go over it briefly,

91
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,308
but, yeah, I think
we're basically there.

92

- It's perfect.
- No. No.

95
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,063
I want to tweak
a few more things

96
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,232
and copy protect it
and maybe rewrite

97

some of the scroll
at the top.

- What? Copy protect it?

99
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,407
But we don't do that.
We're Mutiny.

100
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,827
Uh, well, we both wrote
some pretty bitching code.

101
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,704
You want someone
taking that?

102
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,998
I learned to code
by copying other
people's work,

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,042
pulling it apart.
So did you.

104
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,461
Yeah, I've also
had my work stolen.
It's not pretty.

105
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,256
We never would've met
if you had copy protected
"Parallax."

106
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,508
Yeah, but we did meet.

107
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,928
So, because we met,
now I can copy protect
our work

108
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,430

of us not meeting.

109

Uh, not quite.
Almost.

142
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,311
- 250?
- Yeah, I took out some ads

in some high-end
lifestyle magazines.

144

they'd wanna stick around.

How are we supposed
to keep up with that
with only two of us left?

some more people.

- It's a return.

00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,920
You, too, man.
You, too.

171
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,339
Really excited
to be here.

172
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,968
- How was the trip?
- Wonderful, thank you.

173
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,180
Went on our honeymoon
out West, sort of
scouting it out.

174
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,308
Joe is absconding
with my daughter
to California.

175
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,396
Um, started my own thing,
talked to a few VC firms.

176
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,939
That's fantastic.
I'm just coming
from there.

177
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,401
You know Mark Merlis?

178
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,027
Yeah, go back
to my IBM days.

179
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,779
Great guy to talk to.
Knows everybody.

180
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,907
He put me
in touch with Bob Reed
and Stuart Woods.

181
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,035
Amazing.
They're in my pickup
basketball game.

182
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,620
You'll have
to sub in for me
now that I'm here.

183
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,707
You know Jeff Archer?
I'll get you his info.

184
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,751
Great guy,
super smart.

185
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,921
What were you doing
out there?

186
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,466
I started an online
service, Symnet.

187
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,553
Did pretty well.
Eventually got bought
out by Oracle.

188
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,596
Turned that money
into a few different
ventures--

189
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,890
a couple out West,
one in Tokyo.

190
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,477
You know how this business is.
Always gotta be moving
in every direction.

191
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,229
Yeah, sure do.

192
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,939
Really love what you got
going on here, though.

193
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,316
It's a fantastic
opportunity you spotted.

194
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,444
Oh, thank you.
A good friend of mine

195
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,237
did the hardware work,
Gordon Clark.

196
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,613
He's coming by later
to walk you through it.

197
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,365
Great.

198
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,075
Use all the help
I can get in that
department.

199
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,369
Jesse's more
of a big picture guy.

200
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,710
So, what is
the big picture
as you see it?

201
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,007
In Q1, we could be
in four cities--

202
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,843
Dallas, New York,
San Francisco, and London.

203
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,012
By Q4,
we could be in 24.

204
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,223
<i>Positioned around</i>
<i>the globe as we are,</i>

205
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,392
a company this size,
we can arrive on the scene

206
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,436
a major player right away.

207
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,981
<i>None of the uncertainty</i>
<i>of a fledgling outfit.</i>

208
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,858
( Jesse's voice fades )

209
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,622

210
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,295

214
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,139
Oh, hey.
What's up?

215
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,476
- How was lunch?
- Good, good.

216
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,729
- We brought you a sandwich.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

217
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,651
Uh, Gordon, we've been
giving it some thought,
and, um, I think--

218
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,736
it's-- it's not
that we don't believe
in what you're doing here.

219
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,238
No, no.
Heck, no.

220
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,407
But we just
need something
a little less risky.

221
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,202
Need something?

222
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,496
What, you're quitting?

223
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,249
What's the risk?
We got 250 orders
waiting to be filled.

224
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,335
We sure do,
but we're a little old

225
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,420
to be bettin'
our future on this.

226
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,631
So, what?
Stan take you out,

227
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,467
fill your head
with visions of VC money
flowing through the streets?

228
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,553
Oh, no,
that's not it at all.

229
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,971
You know, these fancy
Silicon Valley companies
started out somewhere,

230
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,098
and it's not
in a big corporate office.

231
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,101
It's in a garage
with three guys rolling up
their sleeves,

232
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,728
betting on themselves
and making something great.

233
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,649
Come on, we are
in this together.

234
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,279
You know what?
It's fine.
It's fine.

235
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,739
You know, you guys
are gonna be the ones
on the outside lookin' in.

236
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,201
I'm sure you're right.
But right now I--

237
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,952
I think we've pretty much
made up our minds.

238
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,331
( phone ringing )

239
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,043
You gonna answer that?

240
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,086

241
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,964

- Joe:<i> Who's Jules?</i>

242
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,966
- What?

243
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,801

What do you want?

245
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,600
You were supposed
to be at Westgroup
half an hour ago.

246
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,269
Oh, yeah.
I-- I forgot.

247
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,271
I'll be
right over there.

248
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,814
- ( sighs )
- Sorry, Gordon.

249
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,693
I'm sure you'll
do fine without us.

250
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,153

00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,677
Fine, you know what?
Just break up with me

339
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,470
if you're gonna
break up with me
and we can--

340
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,930
I'm not gonna
break up with you.
I'm just--

341
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,348
I'm just mad at you, okay?

342
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,183
And I can be mad
at you, right?

343
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,726
- So, what, you wanna quit?
- No, I don't want to quit.

344
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,978
I love you.
Why would I quit?

345
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,980
Have you ever had
a disagreement before?

346
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,023
We're just talking.
People talk.

347
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,108
They fight.
They argue.

348
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,568
It happens
every single day.

349
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,987

350
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,406
You love me?

351
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,826
What? N-no-- now you're
putting words in my mouth.

352
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,287
No.
You said those words.

Oh, yeah?

- Clearly.
This is pretty cool.
- Yeah.

373
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,852
Yeah, if you're
gonna switch over to
a more conventional setup,

374
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,812
maybe it'd be best

Yeah.

379
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,990
You should definitely
bring on a hardware specialist.

380
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,576
The expansion's
gonna require lots
of expertise in that area.

381

It's my problem

Welcome back.

392
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,324
- I wasn't about
to miss this.
- I know.

393
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,076
Wanted to see
what these freaks
were like in person.

394
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:23,203
It's really good

Lev! You look so fragile.
I want to hug you, but--

00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,008
Yeah, I think
you'll dig it.

00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,050
Thanks for coming.

Uh, today we're putting
the finishing touches

Yeah!

what we've done, so...

432
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,757
Come on.
Let's grab a beer.

433
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,675
Man:
<i>All right.</i>

434
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,220
- Talk to
your publisher friend?
- Jeanette? Yeah.

435
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,848
I'm gonna meet with her

back out there.

How's the new guy?

00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,728
Uh, yeah, he's great.
Like him a lot.

438
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,480
Young. Doesn't have
the hardware experience
I would've expected, but...

439
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,441
( pops lips )
seems nice enough.

440
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,445
- You hated him?
- What? No.

441
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,280
Not at all.

442
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,200
Well, there's a palpable
hate energy here.

Oh, I don't know.
I can't put my finger on it.

445
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,208

an odd choice
for the job.

446
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,876
You're gonna miss it.

447
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,921
Oh, there'll be
other projects

448
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,923
way more exciting
than trying to take

449
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,674
an oil company
into the future.

450
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,218
Of course, yeah.

- Come here.

You're a force of nature.

454
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:55,481
All right?
You make the world
what you want it to be.

455
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,234
It'll happen
in California, too.

456
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,076
H-how about this?

457
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:11,122
How about we
step out of reality
for the night,

458
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,708
a hard reboot?

459
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,671

you'll realize what's
really important.

How do I get
on the outside?

461
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,716

the closet.

463

- MDMA.

<i>doing the exposé.</i>

There's some people here
you really have to meet.

475
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:07,178
This one guy, he proposed
to his girlfriend after
they met on Community.

476
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,847
- How cool is that?
- That's, uh--
that's great, honey.

477
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,224
Look.

478
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,893
- What? What is this?
- Someone stole my idea.

479
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,481
Oh, well,
your idea is about you.
It's about Gordon Clark.

480
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,067
Computers handmade
by an expert.

481
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,735
Who knows
who these guys are?

482
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,486
All right, look.
The price point's
the same.

483
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,530
I mean, the slogan's
nearly identical.

484
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,075
Gordon, come on.
Let's get a beer.
Let's enjoy the party.

485
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,828
I think it was Stan.

486
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,122
What,<i> Stan,</i> Stan?

487
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,499
I think he got
Ed and Larry involved.

488
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,293
Should I go over there?
I mean, should--

489
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,544
- No.
- Should I say something?

490
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,380
No, I don't think so.

491
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,508
Look, we can-- we should
take a careful look
at this tomorrow.

492
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,886
It's probably
just a coincidence.

493
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,681
Even if it's not,
there's nothing they can do
to hurt Clark Computers

494
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,851

the most valuable asset,
right?

No.

497

I want to see

No, no, no, wait.

684
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,685
They can't see us.

685
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:49,898
If my father
hears about this,
I'm gonna die.

686
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,442
You go to the limo
and I'll meet you there.

687

Oh, my God, and then
you could, you know,
walk from topic to topic.

702
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,380
Yeah, and better than that,
you could find other users
at those places.

703
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,132
Yes, okay, I feel like
we have to write this down.

704
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:58,758
Do we have something--

705
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,301
Carl, could you clear off
the bulletin board?

706
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,095
We need to create
a layout for Community.

707
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:06,224
I want a list printed
of every room-- Carl.

708
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,062
Carl, what are you
looking at?

709
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,400
I-- I don't know
what I'm looking at.

710
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,860
I logged into Mutiny.

714
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,619
I don't get it.
Where's Mutiny?

715
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,832
We're kicked
off the network.

716
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,709
Replaced by this.

717
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,546
There is no Mutiny.

718

722
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,947
The phone lines terminate
in modem banks at Westgroup.

723
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,032
They switched them over,
so now when you dial in,

724
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,785
the same number you've always
dialed, you get WestNet
instead of Mutiny.

725
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,996
- They've stolen all our users.
- They even cloned our
interface, so most people

<i>they're not on Mutiny.</i>
<i>They think we changed the name.</i>

727
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,584
Okay, get on the Community
forums and tell them they're
not on Mutiny.

728
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,378
- What,
they cloned the whole thing?
- Yes, everything, except games.

729
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,464
Yeah, 'cause he realized
Community is where
the money was.

730
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,092
Just tell them to log off
and wait for us to find
another network.

731
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,802
Wait for us?
Oh, Christ.

732
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,553
I mean, why pay
$5 million for us

733
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,389
when they can
just duplicate us
and steal all of our users?

734
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,642
Hello, hi, hi.
This is Tom Rendon
from Mutiny.

735
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,644
Another company's taken over
our network and I just...

736
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,521
No, it looks like us,
but it's not us.
You need to log off.

737
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,357
We'll be up again
in... a week or two?

738
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,819
- Hello-- damn it!
- Hello?

739
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,904
They don't understand.
They're still communicating
with all the same users.

740
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,405
All of their friends
are on WestNet now.

741
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,032
No, no,
this isn't happening!

749

I didn't know
about this.

751
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,362
I didn't know
that this was happening.

to California.

755
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:45,466
I-- I gave my notice
weeks ago.

756
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,970
There's no reason
I would've done this.
I'm on your side.

757
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,972
I wouldn't do this.

758
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,183
I promise you,
I wouldn't do this.
