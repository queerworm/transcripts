how did you get these?

20
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,775
Really?

21
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,988
I was

22

( moans )

23
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,828
I'd been saving up money
for a long time.

24
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,915
Summer jobs
and everything.

25
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,460
And I bought
a '64 Chevy Nova.

26
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,254
Bright yellow,
love at first sight.

27
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,299
The day I got it,
I took some friends out.

28
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,637
And it was
mid-February and cold.
I mean, bitter cold.

<i>( Joe sighs )</i>

out that night.

00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,435
Hold on.

32
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,353
Is this true?

00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,439
What do you mean?

34
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,985
You're lying to me.

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,405
Okay.

Oh, my God.

37
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,952
The truth is--
God, this is embarrassing.

38
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,411
When I was a kid,
I had a buddy

39
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,124
who lived
out on this farm road

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,919
and there was this mill
rusted to hell.

41

Oh, my God.
Stop.

43
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,301
Is this another lie?

44
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,803
Why do you care, Cameron?
I mean, honestly.

45
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,722
Stop handling me.
It's just a question.

46
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,349
But why do you care
about the answer?

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,518
You are too
screwed up for words.

48
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,311
Because I don't want to tell
sad stories in bed with you?

49
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,313
- When did this become that?
- What's "this"?

50
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,984
Our routine?
You come over whenever,
I don't know, you need to,

51
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,653
and I'm happy to oblige.

52
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,738
Now all of a sudden
you're getting pissed 'cause
I don't want to play house.

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,866
Don't do that.
It's just a question.

54
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,659
You designed the routine.

55
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,829
( groans )
Well, it's no longer
doing anything for me.

56
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,246
This has gotten boring.

57
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,999
You're free to leave
whenever you like.

58
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,376
- You have gotten boring.
- Like I said.

59
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,131
- You want a piece
of advice, Joe?
- Not really.

60
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,258
Your whole thing,
it attracts people,

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,677
but it won't
keep them around.

62
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,596
Authenticity is what
inspires people.

63
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,891
If you want to lead people,
you have to show them
who you really are.

64
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:49,354
Otherwise, you're just
a thousand-dollar suit
with nothing inside.

65
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,190
No one gives a shit.

66
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,073
( thumps )

67
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,874
- What time is it?
- Shh.

68
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,836
Go back to sleep.
It's late.

69
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,006

70
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,341

I can't.

76

I have so much tomorrow.
I have to pick up the cake.

77
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,693
And I have to do it
before work 'cause
they close at 6:00.

78

You poor lady.

79
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,450
And Joanie's become fixated
on this Cabbage Patch Doll

80
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,911
or Kid or whatever.

81
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,582
She got so worked up
talking about it
she started crying...

83
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,502

( laughs )

189
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,879
Gordon.

190
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,131
Our computer's
gonna have a personality.

191
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,260
An operating system
that asks you questions,
you answer it back.

192
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,137
You interact.

193
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,431
What?

194
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,017
Um, I need an additional
384k of RAM.

195
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,853
Um... no.

196
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,190
- ( all chuckling )
- What do you mean, no?

197
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,151
I mean, it's completely
out of the question.

198
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,696
Operating systems
are total pigs.

199
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,615
Even with the added memory,
you're gonna be stealing from
the other applications...

200
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,199
- Yeah.
- ...and slowing
the entire machine down.

201
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,783
I know, but, Gordon,
figure out a way around that.

202
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,203
- Cameron, it's done.
- No, it's--

203
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,997
- Look at it. It's done.
- No, it's not done.
It's-- it's--

204
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,167
it works fine,
but it needs a soul.

205
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,378
It needs to be something
that people can fall
in love with.

206
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,673
We can do that.

207
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,884
Okay, if there's one thing
that I've learned

208
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,637
in the 15 years
of doing this

209
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,223
is that at some point,
you have to stop
changing things.

210
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,225
You have to be happy
with what you've made.

211
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,394
( slaps table )
You're scared.

212
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,731
What would I
be scared of?

213
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,319
Yeah, why don't we make
the machine jerk us off, too?

214
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,903
( men laugh )

215
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,530
And I can program
hundreds of commands

216
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,157
in the operating system
for it to understand

217
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,159
accounting for regional
variance in speech,

218
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,161
program 10 ways for it
to respond to each.

219
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,497
It would be
conversational.

220
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,081
It would be
like speaking
to a human being.

221
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,084
- Slow down.
- You've played "Adventure."

222
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,505
It's like that, except
instead of, "I want
to cross the stream,"

223
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,590
you input "I want
to run WordStar."

224
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,841
You tell it
what you want it to do.

225
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,218
What are the hardware
implications?

226
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,804
Have you talked
to Gordon about this?

227
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,348
Gordon is too scared
to try anything new
or different

228
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,017
because he's traumatized
from being a loser
his entire life.

229
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,727
I think you might be
overstating that slightly.

230
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,146
Okay.

231
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,524
See this?

232
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,027
This I made with my dad
when I was a little kid.

233
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,237
It's a stupid,
stuffed thing,

234
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,032
but my dad wiggled its head
and he gave it a voice

235
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,659
and he brought it
to life.

236
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,537
I named it.
I fell in love with it.

237
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,665
This is
the sort of loyalty
we can create.

238
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,629
We have to get a share
of the market first.

239
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,506
<i>We have to show that we can</i>
<i>compete with the majors</i>

240
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,466
before we start
changing things up.

241
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,720
Maybe for a second generation,
we could do something
like this.

242
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,096
This is because
of last night.

243
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,724
I haven't given that
a second thought.

244
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,142
I thought you said
this was a business.

245
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,729
It is.
If we go with a standard
operating system,

246
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,397
I know what is
going to happen.

247
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,191
There are no surprises
down that road, no pitfalls.

248
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,443
<i>We will go to COMDEX,</i>
<i>we will make it into Sears,</i>

249
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,071
<i>we will sell 150,000 units,</i>
<i>guaranteed.</i>

250
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,781
You're offering me
none of that.

251
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,700
Gosh, you're right.

252
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,034
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

253
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,494
I guess with all
your grandstanding,

254
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,496
I somehow
got you confused
with a visionary.

255
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,749
I guess it just doesn't
matter what you're saying

256
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,417
as long as people
are listening, right?

257
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,793
What the hell
does that mean?

258
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,754
Forgive me.

259
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,547
I just thought something
around here should have a soul.

260
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,133
<i>( door closes )</i>

261
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,560
I may need you
to walk me through this.

262
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,020
It's possible some of it's
going over my head.

263
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,980
Yeah, no problem.

264
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,067
Does Gordon understand
everything that comes
out of your mouth?

265
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,861
Yeah, as long as it's
about computers.

266
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,906
Hm. How's his project
coming along?

267
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,866
Oh, sorry.

268
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,992
( softly )
His super secret project.

269
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,703
It's going well.

270
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,955
It's eating up
a lot of his time.

271
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,833
You know, it can always
be faster, it can always
be smaller.

272
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,668
Mm-hmm.

273
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,295
They solved
the real estate
problem, though.

274
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,631
Did you help them
with that?

275
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,049
Maybe.

276
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,343
What was the solve?

277
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,013
Chips on both sides
of the board.

278
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,392
So simple.

279
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,480
I guess you're everyone's
secret weapon, huh?

280
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,234
Super secret.

281
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,821
Speaking of,

282
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,197
corporate's gonna
want a presentation
of this work.

283
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,241
I'm gonna need you
by my side.

284
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,787
Would you be
up for that?

285
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,705
A little business trip?

286
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,667
Of course.

287
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,960
Good.

288
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,004
Yes, good.

289
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,384
Cameron tell you
her bright idea about
the operating system?

290
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,973
It's insane,
right?

291
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,686
I trust that you
told her no.

292
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,815
Tell me you told her
it was out of the question.

293
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,568
I don't know.
She might be
onto something.

294
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,947
- It's certainly unique.
- "Unique"?

295
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,157
You didn't write "unique"
on the board three months ago.

296
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,827
- Maybe I should have.
- You wrote "faster,"
you wrote "cheaper."

297
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,871
Anyway, that's not the point.
Do you know how much real
estate that would take?

298
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,373
I'd have to rethink
the entire layout
of the board.

299
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,834
Greatness comes
at a price, no?

300
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,169
Yeah, and I've
paid that price.

301
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,797
Do you know how many nights
I've missed putting my kids
to bed?

302
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,466
You know how
many all-nighters
I've spent here?

303
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,510
You asked me
to do something
and I did it.

304
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,762
It was impossible
and I did it anyway.

305
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,765
It's a thought experiment.
And I'm considering it.

306
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,226
Well, don't.
Just don't consider it.

307
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,811
I'm gonna do
whatever I want to do

308
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,354
and you're gonna do
whatever I tell you to do

309
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,815
because that's the way
this relationship works.

310
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,492
Gordon:
<i>And Joe tells me</i>
<i>he's actually considering it.</i>

311
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,370
You can't change it.
It's a thing of beauty.

312
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,205
I don't know.
Maybe he's right.

313
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,624
No, Gordon, you built
a beautiful machine.

314
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,043
<i>You have to</i>
<i>stand up for it.</i>

315
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,544
Joe MacMillan's
an asshole.

316
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,962
He doesn't know
a fraction of what you do

317
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,380
about what makes
a good computer.

318
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,258
Daddy, is the hurricane
gonna come?

319
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,054
No, no, no, no.
We might get a big storm,
some rain,

320
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,848
but the hurricane
can't reach us here.

321
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,140
Houston might
get walloped, but--

322
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,976
Ahem.

323
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,355
We're safe here.
You guys go play.

324
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,737
Oh, hey, did you get
the you-know-what?

325
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,155
- What's that?
- The Cabbage...

326
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,075
Did I get cabbage?

327
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,492
No, the--

328
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,453
( whispers )
the Cabbage Patch Kid.

329
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,415
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I left it at the office.

330
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,086
I didn't want
Joanie to find it.
She snoops, you know?

331
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,546
Anyway, sort of
the worst part of it is--

332
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,257
please keep in mind
that you love me when
I tell you this,

333
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,010
but before
everything went down,

334
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,387
I invited Joe
for dinner tomorrow.

335
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,433
- Dinner here?
- I know, it felt like
the right thing to do.

336
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,477
You know?
Smooth things over.

337
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,854
Well, do you think
this idea

338
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,982
could really compromise
what you've done?

339
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,317
Yeah.

340
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,779
Well, you have to do
whatever you can

So, Gordon tells me
you're thinking

495
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,790
of doing something
experimental with the OS?

496
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,793
I'm considering it.

497
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,838
The truth is, I just
want to do something great.

498
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,467
How did torturing Cameron
fit into that?

499
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,719
I regret that...

500
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,306
but it was about getting
the world's attention.

501
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,309
I guess I also want to do
something successful.

502

Well, then you should
listen to Gordon.

He's actually a genius.

504
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,815
Why do you think
I chose him?

505
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,193
You know the competition.
The only way to cut into
their market share

506
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,696
is by doing what they do
better or cheaper or both,

507
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,115
and you can do that
if you stick with what
you've got.

508
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:06,786
There's something
to be said for
ingenuity, no?

509
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,581
Well, sure.
Exactly.

510

Gordon is good.

526

- He's really good.

527
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,810

- But Gordon wants
to build a computer

528

00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,140
I didn't have
a ton of friends
in junior high.

541
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,309
Oh, I am shocked
by that.

542
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,770
Yeah.

543
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:59,149
So, yeah, I was hiding out
in a classroom at lunch

544
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,110
and the Computer Club
came in.

545
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,823
I just pretended
I was there on purpose.

546
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,825
Mr. Monroe
taught us BASIC

547
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,286
and it was like
finding water

548
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,289
in the middle
of the desert.

549
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,793
For the first time,
I knew how to talk
to something.

550
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,338
I finally had
the right language.

Be more careful, Cam.

557
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:46,905
I'm a big girl.
I can take care of myself.

558
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,992
Oh, hell, I know that.
That's plain as day.
It's just...

559

( sighs )

560
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,287
Some of the people
around here,

561

no matter what they say,
or even what they think--

562
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,335
part of them wants
to see you shit the bed
on this thing.

563
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,004
Why's that?

564
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,091
'Cause you're the future.

565
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,719
Ain't nothing scarier
than that.

566
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,765
When I was little,
any time there was
a big storm,

567
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,433
my dad would
take us out in it

568
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,352
to show me
there was nothing
to be afraid of.

569
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,105
Then a kid in our
neighborhood got pinned
under a fallen tree

570
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,107
and so he stopped
doing that.

571
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,863

I feel like parenting
used to be different.

Oh, yeah.
A bigger storm, you might
need to go outside.

586
