Uh-huh.
Okay,
one final thing --

190
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,574
How would you list a website
about "barks"?

dog noise, tree layer,

it's a sailing ship

you are officially hired

Chief Ontologist.

00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,553
Perfect. [Laughs]

to the obsessives.

205
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,355
Every day, we receive
hundreds of e-mails from people

206

to our index.

207

on the look-out

for new sites
to catalogue.

209
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,445
When a surfer finds a site,
they categorize it

210
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,071
and add it
to Comet's master list.

211
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,366
Each group is responsible
for growing the index

212
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,783

213
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,535

in each category.

214
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,870
Yeah, but the problem is,

215
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,830
is that we started out
with five main topics.

216
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,374
As new sites pop up,
you know,

217
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,459
categorizing them becomes
more and more...complicated.

218
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,878
Yeah, there's
an ontological term for that.
Yeah -- "shit-show."

of French New Wave

245

246
