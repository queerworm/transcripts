Donna Emerson,

senior partner.

4
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,132
My God, that does
have a ring to it,

5
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,176
doesn't it?

6
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,178
Here.

7
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,598
You know I like redheads,
but my God,

8
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,017
that new girl at reception
got a real attitude.

9
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,853
- She make you sign in?
-<i> Well, she damn well did.</i>

10
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,772
Hey, I'm sorry
I missed the celebration.

11
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,774
We had a big storm
down in the San Juans.

12
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,652
Wow. I never pegged you
for a Montblanc kind of guy.

13
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,154
Well, I ain't.
I thought it would go
with the decor.

14
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,158
Also got that nice
little snowflake thing
right on top.

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,578
- Thanks, Bos.
-<i> Sure.</i>

16
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,663
Jeez.

17
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,167
Hey, you wanna
stick around?

18
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,045
Maybe got downstairs,
get a cup of coffee, or--?

19
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,797
Oh, I would love to,
but, uh...

20
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,172
I gotta hit the road.

21
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,009

<i>up at the Vineyard.</i>

22
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,596

23
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,222
congrats.

24
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,063
Oh, say.
Are you going to
Comdex this year?

25
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:32,193
Uh... no.
Too much work this year.

26
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,030
Oh, you know,
it's a circus now.
Not like it used to be.

27
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,865
It's more trouble
than it's worth.

28
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,994
Well...

29
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,163
All right.
Hey, now, that's
the good stuff.

30
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,874
Remember,
respect the dirty bird

31
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,626
or fear
the kickin' chicken.

32
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,129

Mm-hmm.

42
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,193
Amgen's a yes,

What's your position
on Lam Research?

52
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,223
All right,
set up a limit order.

53
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,142
I'm not interested.
You know I'm long on telecom.

Guys, you're in great hands.

58
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,530
Elias will make sure
that CaminoWare
is the talk of Comdex.

59
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,117
- Wait, wait, wait--
- And by the time
you're back in San Jose,

60
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,953
I'll have the table set
for your Series B financing.

61
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,913
How does that sound?

62
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,330
All right.

63
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,250
Well,
we should go pack.

64
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,292
Yeah.

65
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,836
Yeah, yeah.

66
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,923
Oh, Jesus, guys,
I've got your Heinekens.

67
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,135
Whatever you do,
don't do<i> that</i> at Comdex.

68
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,343
Okay, thanks.

69
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,846
It was really
sweet of you.

70
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,558
Hey, Donna. This is
your area of expertise.
Settle a bet for me.

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,937
This fellow thinks the feds
are gonna deregulate
all of NSFNET by '91.

72

73
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,731
Gordon Clark,
this here is--

74
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,399
Donna. Donna Emerson.

75
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,026
Nice to meet you.

76
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,444
Yeah, so I said the goddamn
federal government

77
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,362
<i>can't even deliver my</i>
Playboys<i> without some creep</i>

78
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,990
<i>swiping them</i>
<i>every other month.</i>

79
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,616
'93 at the earliest.

80
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,201
Well, there's a senator
in Tennessee.

81
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,078
He's a real dog with a bone
on this thing.

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,080
- Oh, you seem really
sure of yourself.
- I am.

83
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,373
And you know,
for a long time I wasn't.

84
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,211
and then this... weight
was suddenly lifted off of me.

85
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,172
What kind of weight
exactly?

86
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,257
Like someone poured cement

87
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,842
in a bunch of bowling balls

88
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,885
and then strapped
those bowling balls

89
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,053
onto a big fat circus man

90
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,014
and then he climbed
this ladder...

91
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,308
- And then stood
on your shoulders?
- You get it.

92
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:53,228
I do! I cut loose
a ball and chain
of my own recently.

93
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,813
- Mm.
- Very liberating.

94
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,066
So, what now?
Just casual sex and cosmos?

95
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,068
- Casual sex and martinis.
- Mm.

96
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,113
Oh, but "casual" makes
it sound boring, lazy.

97
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:07,117
I'd rather go with
"hot and dirty" sex.

98
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,493
Speaking of,
what are you doing later?

99
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,454
Mm. Hot date, sorry.

100
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,998
We'll settle
the bet later.

101
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,666
Yes, we will.

102
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,251
( clears throat )

103
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,046
Who was that?

104
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,215
I don't know.

105
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,218
So, congratulations,
it's official.

106
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,307
Donna Emerson.
You really couldn't stand
being a Clark, could you?

107
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,352
Emerson has three syllables.
It's got stature, you know?

108
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,854
Plus, it takes up more space
on the sign, so.

109
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,440
Well, my name,
your dad's name--
what's the difference?

110
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,443
We should probably get a move on
if we want to get our
reservation, Gordo.

111
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,446
Um, yeah.
Uh, Michelle,
this is Donna.

112
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,532
- Donna,
this is Michelle.
- Oh, of course.

113
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,450
Hi. Nice to meet you.

114
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,869
You as well.

115
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,830
Um, let me just
close out my tab?

116
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,707
Sure, yeah.
I'm gonna grab my coat.

117
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,751
It was--
It was nice meeting you.

118
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,630
Gordo?

119
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,301
Ms. Emerson.

120
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,844
She seems nice.

121
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,470
She is.

122
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,556
Hey, can you watch
Joanie on Friday?

123
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,474
Haley's still at space camp
and, you know,

124
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,852
Joanie just listens to CDs
and makes collages.

125
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,354
You really don't
have to do anything.

126
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,855
Look, Diane's

127
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,191
Elias is at Comdex,
Gilson's useless,

155

why are you calling me, not her?

156

00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,729
Amazing.

178
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,651
Here it is.

179
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,695
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

180
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,121
Hi, I'm Tracy.

181
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,333
Hi, Tracy.

182
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,003
They told me not to sit
on the bike because
I might crush it.

183
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,714
- That's probably good advice.
- ( laughs )

184
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,717
<i>You've got a few minutes</i>
<i>to settle in before</i>
<i>the signing starts.</i>

185
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,386
Oh, yeah.

186
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,392
Here's your lunch.

187
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,726
As you requested,

188
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,063
a bean and cheese burrito.

189
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,733
Thank you.

190
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,361
I've been in Japan
for four years.

191
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,487
Oh.

192
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,697
Mmm.

193
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,577
<i>If I had to choose one word</i>
<i>to describe myself,</i>

194
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,745
I guess I would say, um,
"seeker."

195
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,166
Yeah, you know?
And, uh...

196
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,751
And "giver." Yeah.

197
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,253
I mean,
I'm a tech professional

198
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,754
but I'm not just
bits and bytes.

199
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,633
I own a regional network
that's part of NSFNET,

200
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,468
which connects researchers

201
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,761
to the National Science
Foundation

202
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,181
super-computing center,

203
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,185
via T-1 backbone
through a Unix-based rout--

204
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,687
Look,
( clears throat )

205
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,480
let's just say
I do well for myself.

206
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,773
Fun is very important to me,

207
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:17,153
and listen, if, you know,
it's casual,

208
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,364
you know, it stays casual,
I'm okay with that.

209
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,074
And if it becomes something
more than casual

210
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,411
then I'm okay with that too.
Yeah.

211
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,788
And I like camping.
I really like camping.

212
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,790
Do-- do you like camping?

213
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,294
Recently, I've gotten
into fine cuisine,
uh, cooking.

214
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,422
But, like, really doing it.

215
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,466
You get to cook something,
and then you look at it,

216
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,386
and you think,
"I made this!"

217
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,222
And then you get to eat it
and then move on.

218
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,392
That makes me happy.

219
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,811
My, uh, name--
Can I look into the thing?

220
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,647
-<i> Uh, my name is Gordon...</i>
- Joanie?

221
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,107
<i>number 108A-2...</i>

222
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,816
Joanie, that is private.

223
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,278
Mm. Yeah.
Making a video
that screams

224
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,113
"I need to get laid"
is totally private.

225
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,616
"Get laid"?
Who taught you that?

226
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,326
Dad, I know kids
in school giving handjobs

227
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,827
<i>in the parking lot.</i>
<i>I'm not a kid.</i>

228
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,497
No, you don't.
And yes, you are.

229
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,459
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Now, what time am I</i>
<i>taking you to this party?</i>

230
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,670
- It starts at 9:00.
- Can I take you a little
earlier?

231
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,465
My date-- Okay.

232
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,427
I'm cooking dinner
for someone and
she'll be here at 7:30.

233
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,305
Yeah, but Jennifer is seeing
<i>Child's Play 2</i> at 6:30

234
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,847
to go stalk Bobby Ostoff.

235
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,684
So, she probably won't
even be back until 8:30.

236
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,852
The party's at Jennifer's?

237
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,439
Mom said I could go.

238
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,857
Yeah, well, Mom told me
that Diane was out of town
all week.

239
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,859
You can't go to a party
if there aren't
any parents there.

240
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,737
-<i> You know that.</i>
- But Mom said!

241
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,697
Joanie, when you're
staying with me,

242
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,450
- I make the decisions.
- God!

243
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,826
- Joanie?
- Ugh!

244
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,833
Thanks.

245
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,879
Right, okay,
so I've got some
banging ideas

246
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,799
for<i> Space Bike 5.</i>

247
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,259
Okay, so there's this--
there's this space goldfish--

248
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,178
Fantastic!
So, just pay over there.

249
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,891
- Hi, I'm Jessica.
- Hey.

250
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,686
Alex.

251
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,604
You two going
to the Atari keynote
later?

252
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,939
- Yeah.
- Good.

253
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,484
Don't let boys like that
push their way in front of you.

254
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,901
- Okay.
- Okay.

255
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,612
Okay.

256
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,455
Can you make it out
to "Joe"?

257
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,924
Yeah, it's just a really
amazing culture, you know?

258
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,926
Do you even speak Japanese?

259
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,928
( speaking Japanese )

260
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,972
Ooh.

261
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,932
That means,
"I don't want the shrimp
with the heads on."

262
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,645
It's a very useful
phrase in Tokyo.

263
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,980
So, you're gonna stay?

264
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,774
Maybe, yeah.

265
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,361
It's-- I don't know,
we've really settled in.

266
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,821
It was weird at first.

267
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,947
like, alien, you know?

268
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,783
And that's what
<i>Space Bike 2</i>
was all about.

269
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,744
It was just,
Tom was working a ton

270
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,413
and I was wandering around
this strange city
feeling lost.

271
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,582
And then...

272
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,209
I don't know, one day
I just decided to give
myself over to it.

273
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,254
Just like that, like a--
like a switch...

274
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,673
flicked in your brain?

275
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,676
Yeah.
( laughs )

276
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,053
It's just,
you go through life

277
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,472
and you have this idea
of who you are,

278
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,974
and what you do,
and then...

279
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,602
you discover
it's total bullshit.

280
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,978
It's a defense mechanism,

281
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,648
and once you stop
defending yourself
you can be

282
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,442
all these other things,
and that...

283
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,236
- Yeah.
- seems totally cheesy.

284
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,154
No, it's not.

285
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,740
I still suck
at using chopsticks.

286
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,579
So, what are you
doing here?

287
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,330
Are you still
consulting?

288
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,043
I'm thinking about
getting back into that,

289
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,962
if the gig is right.

290
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,677
It's amazing how much changes
in just a few years.

291
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,265
And how much stays the same.

292
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,937
So, what do you think?

293
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,730
What should I see?

294
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,441
Oh, uh...

295
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,276
Well, you can skip
all the laptops.

296
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,446
They're just variations
on a theme.

297
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,532
Uh... the Microsoft booth
is "ugh."

298
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,869
Gates' speech is overrated.
Just get the transcript.

299
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,747
Oh, Phillips
just released
a recordable CD

300
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,459
and Adobe added some
cool stuff to this thing
called Photoshop.

301
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,544
So...

302
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,338
Yeah, great.

303
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,923
That's interesting.

304
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,883
Yeah.
( laughs )

305
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,846
Well, God, it was--

306
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,430
it was great to see you,

307
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,432
and, uh,
this was a lot of fun.

308
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,476
Wait. Are those...

309
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,520
those guys from '83

310
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,689
that had that really
terrible printer?

311
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,524
You convinced them
you were from IBM?

312
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,359
Oh!

313
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,654
Yeah. We bought out
their suite for the Giant.

314
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,073
That suite came with that
free seafood tower.

315
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,159
Hey, what are you doing?

316
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,330
<i>Offering, uh,</i>
<i>fully-integrated</i>
<i>TypeKit compatibility</i>

317
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,458

323
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,681

00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,899

so fast

327
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,402
that you'll think
your documents were...

328
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,320
Come on.
Come on, Petey.

329
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,906
There's a little breeze.
Get your hand in front of it.

330
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,741
Use your backhand.

331
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,158
On fire.

332
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,328
Cool, cool, cool.

333
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,956
So, it's called the, uh,
the "S Printer"?

334
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,833
Oh, no, um... "Sprinter."

335
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,586
- Because it prints
really fast.
- No space.

336
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,213
It's kind of confusing
with the flame gag, though.

337
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,132
- It's a mixed metaphor.
- "S Printer" does
sound better, though.

338
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,968
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah. It's got
rigor behind it.

339
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,012
Like the R&amp;D Department
was unsatisfied

340
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,805
<i>with models A through R,</i>

341
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,432
and then finally,
after a lot of sweat
and tears...

342
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,059
We proudly bring you
version S.

343
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,519
Um... it's the Sprinter.

344
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,938
No space.

345
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,606
Hey, do I know you?

346
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,734
Here, help yourself
to a lighter.
No, just one, please.

347
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,151
- Oh, that's a lot.
- Good luck, guys.

348
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,154
- Not all of--
- She took so many.

349
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,282
Just one, please,
one.

350
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,494

352
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,891
- Hey. Michelle.
- Hi. Hi.

353
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,559
What you got, what's--

354
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,061
Oh, it uh,

355
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,814
it says "kiss the cook"
but in binary code.

356
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,066
- ( laughing )
- So, uh.

357
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,484
Oh. Well.

358
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,277
It smells great.

359
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,113
That's the Bolognese.

360
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,406
You know, a lot of people
think that pasta's Italian,

361
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,033
but it actually
originated in China.

362
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,577
- Huh.
- Yeah, 1100 B.C.

363
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,038
You're taking me
to the party. I left
a message on Mom's service.

364
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,248
- She's gonna tell you
to let me go.
- Um, Joanie?

365
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,626
- This is Michelle.
- Hi.

366
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,586
Michelle, this is
my lovely daughter,
Joanie.

367
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,171
- Hello.
- Hey.

368
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,008
I, uh--
I like your shirt.

369
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,259
It's very... cultural.

370
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,219
Do you like culture?

371
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,306
( laughs )
What's it, um, say?

372
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,225
Well, "shonen"
is Japanese for "boy."

373
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,020
So, it means "boy knife."

374
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,437
Huh.

375
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,439
"Boy knife" means "dick."

376
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,818
- Hmm.
- Um, do you want some wine?

377
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,486
- Mm-hmm.
- ( clears throat )

378
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,491
Cameron:
I wonder how high
you'd have to be up

379
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,743
for your spit
to actually kill someone.

380
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,912
<i>( laughing )</i>

381
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,713
( yawning )

382
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,718
Okay, let's see
what we got.

383
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,303
Ooh.

384
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,191
What do you think?

385
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,818
Oh, I wouldn't.
They make your ass look big.

386
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,323
Oh, okay.

387
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,452
Here are the rules.

388
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,954
Four rows of lighters.

389
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,707
When it's your turn,
you can take as many

390
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,376
or as few as you want,
as long as they're
from the same row.

391
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,213
<i>The person who ends up</i>
<i>with the last lighter</i>
<i>loses.</i>

392
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,381
You wanna go first
or second?

393
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,883
Mm, bold.

394
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,301
Is there anything
on the floor catch
your eye?

395
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,596
No, I'm going whole hog
on the Sprinter.

396
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,932
Those guys really have
their finger on the pulse.

397
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,810
Actually it was...

398
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,232
it was all
pretty overwhelming.

399
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,155
You know,
if you look closely,

400
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,157
there are some diamonds
in those dorks.

401
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,826
( laughs )
Would you really
wish me on anyone?

402
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,084
You lose.

403
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,755
You go first this time.

404
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,342
Hey,
I knew what I was doing,

405
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,345
you know,
when we worked together.

406
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,225
<i>And Mutiny took a nosedive</i>
<i>all on its own,</i>

407
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,061
didn't need you
to screw that one up for us.

408
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,772
And Gordon,

409
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,858
would be the first to admit
that he made his own bed.

410
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,281
Yeah, but...

411
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,704
But Ryan, right?

412
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,212
Yeah, Tom and I were...

413
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,883
leaving for Japan
when we heard.

414
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,097
At first I was...

415
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,974
angry.

416
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,185
At you...

417
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,435
and at him.

418
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,813
And at myself...

419
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,650
for all these things
I never said to him.

420
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,071
<i>Then I realized</i>

421
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,282
<i>there was nothing anyone</i>
<i>could have done about it.</i>

422
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,118
<i>Not you and not me.</i>

423
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,537
- You don't know that.
- Neither do you.

424
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,457
You're not that powerful.

425
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,257
So, eventually, my anger

426
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,675
turned into sadness,

427
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,469
and...

428
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,471
that's fine,
that's healthy.

429
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,104
I mean, yes, be sad.

430
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,398
But Jesus,
stop blaming yourself.

431
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,875
I win.

432
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,676
This isn't about Ryan.

433
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,845
It's, um...

434
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,973
I'm just saying
I don't think you should...

435
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,101
deprive the world
of what you do.

436
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,520
Okay.

437
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,233
What is it that I do?

438
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,866
It's so hard...

439
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,953
to bring about
actual change.

440
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,537
Real change.

441
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,497
<i>The whole world</i>

442
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,251
<i>conspires to stop that</i>
<i>from happening.</i>

443
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,337
But you bring people together.

444
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,466
You... create change.

445
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,684
I think that that's...

446
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,477
really great.

447
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,579
Hey, so I have this

448
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,832
Atari party
that I have to go to

449
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,793
that would be so much
more fun if you would come

450
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,462
and get drunk with me.

451
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,046
What, so I can fend off
your groupies?

452
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,714
Exactly.

453
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,175
Mm.

454
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,385
I'm not really dressed
for that kind of thing.

455
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,307
Okay.

456
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,603
Well...

457
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,980
Okay.

458
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,857
Now I'm ready.

459
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,360
( laughs )
The future's so bright.

460
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,820
( laughing )

461
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,826
Anyways,
back to the important stuff.

462
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,786
<i>Do you know why most people</i>
<i>screw up their pasta?</i>

463
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,830
- Here we go.
-<i> Not salting the water enough.</i>

464
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,874
You know, it should
taste like the ocean.

465
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,168
<i>You know, when properly</i>
<i>portioned,</i>

466
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,170
<i>salt will not</i>
<i>make food taste salty,</i>

467
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,880
<i>but instead will enhance</i>
<i>the flavors that are</i>
<i>already present.</i>

468
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,508
-<i> ( phone rings )</i>
- It's for me. It's my mom.

469
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:53,760
She's a partner at a VC firm
so she has her own messaging
service.

470
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,595
- ( clicks on )
- Mom?

471
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,848
Joanie, I got your voicemail.
What's going on?

472
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,059
<i>You made it sound</i>
<i>like World War III</i>
<i>from your message.</i>

473
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,019
Yeah, Dad won't let me
go to the party,
which is bullshit

474
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,271
because you explicitly
told me I could go.

475
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,899
I'm sure he has good
reasons, Bug.

476
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,985
There is no good reason
why I should be stuck here

477
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:13,531
making pasta from scratch
with freaking Chef Boyardee
and some random lady.

478
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,202
Is it that Michelle woman?

479
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:22,998
Bingo-rama.
She works for Dad.

480
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,917
Look, when you're at Dad's
house, his word goes.

481
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,544
You know the rules.

482
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,547
- Can you just talk to him?
- No, I don't have time--

483
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:32,049
Dad! Mom wants to talk to you.

484
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,931
So, what grade are you in?

485
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,516
You know, I'm gonna, like,
go in a second.

486
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,017
You don't have to
talk to me anymore.

487
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,728
Donna, I don't wanna
have this conversation
right now.

488
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,646
- Neither do I.
- She wants to go over
to Jennifer's

489
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,357
and there's not gonna be
any parents there.

490
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,317
I already told her that
she has to listen to you.

491
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,652
She just put you on the phone
because she thought we'd fight

492
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,030
<i>and she'd come out on top.</i>

493
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,740
( laughs )

494
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,285
Since when do you make pasta?

495
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,954
Oh, well, I-I--

496
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,123
I took a cooking class.

497
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,166
Ah.

498
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,754
My parents got divorced
when I was little, too,

499
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,965
so, I know it stinks.

500
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,341
But it gets better.

501
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:21,140
All right, you're, uh,
you're not going.

502
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:25,269
So, even with a conservative
estimate of the licensing fees

503
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,480
for the voice-recognition
component,

504
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,150
we'll be in three million
domestic refrigerator-freezers
by the end of Q3.

505
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,611
And I'll hit profitability
by Q4.

506
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,571
So, what is it you do?

507
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:38,698
- I think this is
definitely him.
- I think it's him!

508
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,494

we need to--

567
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,665
We don't need
to do anything!

568
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,874
We both did things
we're not proud of,

569
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,877
and if we could turn back
the clock, I'm sure
we'd do it differently.

570
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,756
I can't believe
this is happening.

571
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,800

572
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,343
No.

573
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,680
I think about
you and me every day.

574
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,516

Since when?

588
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,097
Since I started
paying attention

<i>to the thinking,</i>
<i>feeling creatures</i>
<i>we share the planet with,</i>

590

00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,937
That's since when.

592

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,573
Mmm. This is really good.

596
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,366
Mm.

597
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,868
<i>Grazie.</i>

598
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,870
What did you put in this?

599
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,954
Ah, it's the Bolognese.

600
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,457
It's taken a while
to perfect, but--

601
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,502
( sighs )

602
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,464
Did you know

603
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,884
that almost
all beef you buy
at the supermarket

604
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,968
tests positive
for E. coli?

605
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,012
- Mm-mm.
-<i> Because cows,</i>
<i>when they're slaughtered,</i>

606
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,015
<i>are decapitated.</i>
<i>And when you</i>
<i>decapitate a cow,</i>

607
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,976
all the stuff
in the intestines
and the stomach

608
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,480
flies out through
the neck hole,
all over the body.

609
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,608
<i>And E. coli is found</i>
<i>only in excrement.</i>

610
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,651
Basically...

611
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,445
there's shit
in your Bolognese.

612
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,447
Okay, Joanie,
we are trying to eat.

613
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,699
So am I.

614
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,992
And that's why
we all need to think about
the gross, and, like,

615
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,830
inhumane process
that we get all the stuff
we consume on our plates.

616
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:42,419
Well, did you know
there's a detectable level
of cow piss in most milk?

617
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,962
( chuckles )

618
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,676
You know, I understand.
When I was five,

619
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,011
I gave up eggs
for a whole year

620
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,847
because I thought
when you cracked the eggs,

621
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,642
that you were killing
little baby chicks,

622
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,019
and every time my dad
made an omelet I would
just burst into tears

623
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,105
- and just cry for hours.
- ( laughs )

624
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,775
I'm 14, not five.

625
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,070
She'll grow out of it.
It's a phase.

626
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,114
You think this
is just a phase?

627
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,117
Okay, Joanie,
why don't you take your plate
into the other room

628
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,035
and we'll talk
about this tomorrow.

629
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,454
Fine.

630
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,919
I am<i> so</i> sorry.

631
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,129
No. No, no, no.
Why? I mean,

632
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,214

633
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,676

634
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,057

639
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,777

656

that you can inflict

We don't even

665
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,176

668
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,188
She wanted me to find you...

669
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,733

670
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,197

00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,700
No.

00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,997

wanted to talk to you,
she could do it herself.

673

I don't even know
what the idea was.

674
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,626

call it a night.

697
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,328
( heavy breathing )

698
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,170
( sharp moan )

699
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,494
Boy on television:
<i>...lawyer.</i>

700
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,205
Girl on television:
<i>Slater, I am impressed.</i>

701
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,497
<i>Spare me.</i>

702
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,959
<i>I want to have</i>
<i>at least seven kids!</i>

703
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,503
<i>Oh, great, so I'll have</i>
<i>to take a number to get</i>
<i>into the bathroom!</i>

704
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,424
<i>Seven kids?</i>
<i>Slater, I don't know.</i>

705
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,008
Consistency.

706
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,719
I can admire that.

707
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:15,181
Slater:<i> Why?</i>
<i>Because I'm a good boss.</i>

708
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,311
God, I hate it when
Slater does that

709
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,396
stupid turnaround thing
with his chair.

710
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,814
I know.

711
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,233
It's like, okay, we get it,
you're the cool jock.

712
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:26,567
<i>( indistinct dialogue</i>
<i>continues )</i>

713
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,532
Are you serious?

714
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,452
What?

715
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,662
- You--
- I can't totally commit
to a label.

716
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,166
People aren't one thing.

717
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,544
Yeah.

718
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,005
You're right.

719
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,676
( sighs )
All right.

720
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,147
Is it bad
this morning?

721
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,399
No, it's fine.

722
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,650
I'm just
a little stiff.

723
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:11,529
Nothing a hot shower
won't fix.

724
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,577
This is ridiculous.

725
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,330
I'm making you switch
bedrooms with me.

726
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,582
Climbing these stairs
is totally dumbass.

727
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,086
Yeah. I'm sure that would
work out great for you.

728
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,173
Nice fancy bed,
big closet...

729
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,218
Oh, it's really
the bathroom I'm after.

730
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,874
Working with you was...

731
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,585
the most fun
I ever had in my life.

732
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:10,880
Okay?

733
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,258
Oh, Cam.

734
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,638
I picked up the phone
so many times.

735
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,476
Never actually called,
though. Did you?

736
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,231
Well...

737
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,525
I'm here now.

738
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,610
Uh-huh.

739
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,322
Did you even read it?

740
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,656
What?

741
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,659
What I sent Joe.
The idea.

742
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,541
He never even
showed it to me.

743
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,174
What was it?

744
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,245
