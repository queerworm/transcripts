00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,870
( beeps )

3
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,329
Jesus.

00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,398

6
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,164
Doug:
Your code loops
all over the place.

7
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,667
It's not structured.
It's not maintainable
by anyone.

8
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,087
- I disagree.
- There are reentrant forks,

9
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,422
no way of knowing
which branch invoked
a function.

10
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,801
We don't do that in C++.
It's officially deprecated
in the language.

11
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,261
I can maintain it.
There are condition
flags for everything.

12
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,596
There's no one-way arrow.

13
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,098
Is that what
you want to do?

14
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,682
Be the code grunt
for this sick piece
of choss?

15
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,434
Dougie, chill.

16
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,352
My guys will flowchart it.
I'll write out the flags...

17
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,229
I'm sure you will.

18
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,398
The flow chart
would strangle us.
It's a mess.

19
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,691
And what do you mean
your guys?

20
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,276
It's fast and it fits.

21
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,694
It's no longer necessary.

22
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,196
Doug, we bought
your company.

23
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,658
You should adapt
to our programming language.

24
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,284
<i>I know it sucks</i>
<i>to be rewritten.</i>

25
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,120
It doesn't make sense.

26
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,664
It's like asking a race car
to adapt to a covered wagon.

27
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,666
- Poetic.
- Maybe we should
all try to,

28
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,459
you know,
take our egos out of it.

29
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,294
Well, my ego would love
to have a good night's sleep,

30
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,380
but sadly it has
to rewrite your code first.

31
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,882
( pencil clatters )

32
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,092
Yikes.

33
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,510
Diane, I am so sorry.

34
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,928
Diane:
<i>It's all fun and games</i>

35
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,304
<i>till someone gets</i>
<i>stabbed in the cheek.</i>

36
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,432
Hi.

37
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,183
I'm just here to observe.

38
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,605
Okay, well...

39
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,315
I think we're all
on the same page now.

40
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,610
Definitely.
Um, we're really close.

41
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,529
( scoffs )

42
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,238
Maybe this'll help.

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,033
It's an integration
road map.

44
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,535
Look, we think the way you
created Mutiny was brilliant.

45
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,829
The original block of code
was truly innovative.

46
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,497
Mm-hmm, but?

47
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,624
It doesn't play nice
with our SwapMeet code.

48
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,044
<i>If you make some changes</i>
<i>to that block</i>

49
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,087
and we make
some changes to our C++...

50
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,715
It's a bug factory.
The old code makes
it impossible

51
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,341
to keep track
of the reentrant looping.

52
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,722
But I don't need
the object-oriented
language, okay?

53
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,724
I can keep track
of the looping in my head.

54
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,517
Oh, I get it.
You're that good.

55
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,269
Yeah, I am.
Aren't you?

56
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,938
Bosworth:
<i>...looking all around</i>
<i>and then</i>

57
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,066
<i>he came around the side</i>
<i>of the trailer there.</i>

58
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,901
And I swear to God,
he goes,

59
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,569
"Man, that ain't no bear.
That's your ex-wife."

60
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,362
- Grr!
- ( laughs )

61
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,280
- She was just doing
the whole thing.
- Uh-oh.

62
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,325
Oh, you surprised
to see her?

63
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,660
- Yeah.
- Mm-mm.

64
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,704
<i>Adios, amiga.</i>

65
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,663
- Hey there.
- Hi.

66
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,456
Hi.

67
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,958
( stammers )
Here, go ahead.
After you.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,670
Thank you.
( chuckles )

69
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,463
Good day, ladies.

70
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,758
Donna:
<i>Hi. Well, this is</i>
<i>a nice surprise.</i>

71
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,135
I was in the neighborhood.

72
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,012
So, how's it going
with the SwapMeet guys?

73
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,430
Um, good.

74
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,767
You keep
telling me that
on the phone

75
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,770
with that same
not-so-sure thing
you do with your voice.

76
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,897
What not-so-sure thing?

77
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,523
( chuckles )

78
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,026
Anyway, I just popped
into their project meeting.

79
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,570
The vibe
was pretty hostile.

80
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,321
Why haven't you told me?

81
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,323
Well, it's a work
in progress.

82
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,785
- Donna.
- ( sighs ) I know.

83
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,369
Cam isn't comfortable
with the guys yet,

84
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,038
and I'm working on it.

85
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,998
- How are you
working on it?
- Well--

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,333
My point is,
<i>we</i> should be
working on it.

87
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,711
<i>If there are issues,</i>
<i>we need to air them out.</i>

88
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,130
Otherwise
resentment festers

89
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,422
and the whole thing
starts to rot.

90
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,801
All right,
how about this?

91
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,928
We could all
go to dinner tonight,

92
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,721
have some wine,
talk things through.

93
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,431
- I do like wine.
- Great.

94
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,933
But I can't do tonight.

95
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,559
I've got tickets
to a charity thing,

96
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,811
a fundraiser
for Save the Bay.

97
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,771
- Oh, that sounds--
- Terrible.

98
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,815
I was gonna say lovely.

99
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,276
My date just cancelled
and I have a plus one.

100
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,654
I could check with Gordon,
see if he could watch
the girls tonight.

101
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,363
No, um...

102
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,449
I was thinking
about John Bosworth.

103
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,994
Oh.

104
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,369
I mean...

105
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,622
really?

106
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,000
Bosworth:
<i>"Man, that ain't no bear.</i>
<i>That's my ex-wife."</i>

107
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,085
- ( all laugh )
- Grr!

108
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:39,173
You know, there'll be
a whole slew of Valley
big shots there.

109
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,092
It's a great opportunity
for John to make some
business connections.

110
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,969
Sure.

111
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,096
But...

112
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,473
nobody
calls him John.

113
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,852
I do.

115
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,652
All right, guys.

116
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,237
Guys.

117
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,489
- Guys, please, please!

Bodie:
Yo, shut up, kid!

119
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,870
All right,
I know we've gotten off
to a rough start,

120
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,412
and I'm sorry about that.

121
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,622
That's the understatement
of the century.

122
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,999
We're in a bit
of a holding pattern

123
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,335
ever since Cam took over
for our lead coder.

124
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,128
- Louis:<i> Yeah, that was genoid.</i>
- Bodie:<i> You don't know</i>
<i>jack about it.</i>

125
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,881
But we're gonna use this
as an opportunity.

126
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,257
Now, I know we've
had some success

Oh, you mean
the buddy system?

130
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,892
It's a nightmare trying
to train these jokers.

131
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,061

is bitch about C++.

00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,692
- C++.
- Carl, he's
your trainee, okay?

135
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,652
- I don't care.
- Master Carl,
I've been programmed

136
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,612
- to observe
your every move...
- Okay.

137
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,448
...so I may learn
from your flawed behavior
what it is to be human.

138
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,117

Bodie, stop

Okay, why don't I give you

00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,368
Thanks.

You're not my type.

00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,625
Yeah, this place
has character.

160
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,043
This isn't a generic box.

161
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,045
No, the Mutiny house
had character.

You've hated
every place we've seen.

00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,386
So? I'm picky.

165
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,972
And nothing feels right.

166
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,017
Is this about the house
or is this something else?

00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,576
Heckle and Jeckle.
Frick and Frack.

175
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,996
I get it.
But they want
to be useful.

176
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,457
By what? Translating
everything into C++?

177
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,960
Donna, if I knew
that was the plan,
I wouldn't have signed on.

178
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,380
But we did sign on.

179
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,964
The guys are under
a two-year contract

180
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,799
with a piece of the company.
We married them.

181
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,677
<i>We have to sit down</i>
<i>and talk it out</i>

182
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,597
before the whole thing
festers and rots.

183
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,975
- We're having dinner
tomorrow night.
-<i> What?</i>

184
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,810
That's a horrible idea.
Who suggested that?

185
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,313
I did.

186
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,232
Oh, great.

187
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,442
And so now you're
just informing me.

188
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,570
See?
It already
feels like home.

189
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,284
MacMillan Utility
was always intended to be
a jumping-off point.

190
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,037
Totally.
It's all about
transformation.

191
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,705
Many companies
start doing one thing

192
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,290
and then change direction.

193
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,042
If we can just find
the right vector.

194
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,504
Ryan:
<i>Then our freeware</i>
<i>can stay free.</i>

195
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,089
Router tech is promising.

196
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,258
Ah, Cisco's already
way ahead on that one.

197
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,136
Uh, 3-D graphics.
Uh, AI.

198
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,347
- 5th gen systems.
- It's a billion-dollar
road to nowhere.

199
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,266
I give it a year.

200
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,851
Fairchild made cameras.
Now they make semiconductors.

201
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,521
Coleco was the Connecticut
Leather Company.

202
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,939
Now they make video games.

203
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,648
Yeah, and Mutiny started
as a games company.

204
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,277
- Shut up.
- Sorry, I'm just
so stoked

205
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,861
to be a part
of your process.

206
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,906
-<i> Plus the caffeine...</i>
- No, I mean be quiet.

207
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,241
Now.

208
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,577
Please.

209
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,747
Shh.

210
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,337
<i>Uh...</i>

211
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,922
okay.

212
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,216
<i>Let's circle</i>
<i>the five best ideas.</i>

213
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,477
Wait, what--
what are you doing, man?

214
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,978
<i>We spent weeks on that.</i>

215
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,521
There's some
good stuff there.

216
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,193
Good is the enemy of great.

217
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,071
If anything's worth pursuing,
we'll remember it tomorrow.

218

But then you're probably
always here late.

00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,273

Yes.

Alone in my bedroom,
just me.

311

Back when this whole place
was just me.

00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,672
<i>I did all the timings</i>
<i>by hand,</i>

Yeah.

320
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,949
And what do you
want me to say?

321
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,661
I-- I'm proud
of this place.

322
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,873
<i>But back then,</i>
<i>it was this secret.</i>

323
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,876
It was all mine.

324
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,006
Then we should
leave it alone.

325
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,983
Ah.

326
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,323

327
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,033
Just got the weirdest

328
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,662
<i>My stepfather.</i>

329
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,581

They're selling
all my dad's stuff.

331
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,175
He died when I was nine.

332
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,970
Shit.

333
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,724
I'm sorry to hear that.

334
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,185
Just he had
this motorcycle...

335
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,398
an old Panhead Harley.

336
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,442
Oh, he used to ride me
to school on it.

337
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,947
I'd show up to kindergarten
with this, like,

338
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,699
gigantic helmet.

339
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,578
I'm sure it looked
ridiculous, but it was--

340
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,875
it just felt so...

341
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,963
You should
go get the bike.

342
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,771

a solo business venture?

00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,240
<i>( game chiming )</i>

346
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,788
Hmm.

347
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,373
Wasn't the Nintendo system
supposed to be for Joanie?

348
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:49,003
- ( gunshots )
- No, it was a family present.

349
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:54,174
Anyways, I had to unwind
after that brawl today.

350
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,594
I honestly don't know
what to do about those guys.

351
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,178
Cardiff had its challenges,

352
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,099
but no one ever
punched me in the ear.

353
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,268
Yeah, well, you're not
at Cardiff anymore.

354
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,938
( gunshots )

355
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,858
There's your answer.

356
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,027
Just take the guys
out back and shoot 'em.

357
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,279
( quacking )

358
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,663
( chimes )

359
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,374
Bosworth:
<i>Well, he comes around</i>
<i>the side of the trailer,</i>

360
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,669
<i>and he goes,</i>
<i>"Man, that ain't a bear.</i>

361
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,670
That's your ex-wife."

362
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,213
- Grr!
- ( laughing )

363
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,216
See?
Thank you,
thank you.

364
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,220
( coughs )
Man, it was crazy, man.

365
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,222
<i>And I don't know</i>
<i>how long she stayed there.</i>

366
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,100
<i>She was there all night,</i>

367
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,392
<i>just sort of</i>
<i>frozen in place.</i>

368
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,228
<i>Grr!</i>
<i>The poor bastard...</i>

369
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,272
( woman giggles, screams )

370
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,692
( continues indistinctly )

371
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,695
-<i> ( music playing )</i>
- ( chattering )

372
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,285
Don't move.

373
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,338
Joe MacMillan.

374
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,256
Of course.

375
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,718
Diane Gould.

376
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,428
Funny that we've
never officially met.

377
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,681
But I'm certainly
aware of you.

378
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,767
Amador Gould Gilson.
I admire your business model.

379
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,270
Small, intelligent
investment portfolio.

380
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,856
I guess you could
call that boutique.

381
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:36,569
Well, size isn't
everything, right?

382
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,280
I hear you facilitated
the SwapMeet acquisition
at Mutiny.

383
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,281
Congrats.

384
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,283
We're very excited
about it.

385
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,285
I'm surprised Cameron Howe
wanted to play ball

386
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,787
with another company.

387
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,288
She must be
in a good place.

388
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,292
Excuse me.
Can I, um--

389
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,461
- can I borrow you
for a sec?
- Yeah.

390
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,296
It's great
to finally meet you.

391
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,757
Mm, you as well.

392
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,476
( whooping, giggling )

393
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,938
-<i> ( music continues )</i>
-<i> ( chatter )</i>

394
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,316
How do I get
one of these?

395
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,319
Uh, make more money.

396
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,573
Which brings us
to our little problem.

397
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,742
You heard
of this individual,
Topher Erickson?

398
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,326
Does not ring a bell.

399
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,578
His father's Cal Erickson,

400
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,705
senior vice president
of General Atomics.

401
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,582
Okay.

402
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,586
Well, apparently
he was at one
of your parties

403
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,964
and indulged in
a copious amount
of cocaine.

404
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,924
Mm-hmm.

405
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,842
And then grabbed
someone and went off
on a little joyride

406
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,929
in the brand-new Ferrari
his father procured for
his 18th birthday.

407
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,347
What kind of jerk
spends 60 grand
and buys Italian?

408
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,809
Yeah, well,
this particular jerk

409
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,811
funds about a quarter
of your business.

410
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,395
Hmm, okay.

411
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,023
And it's boring old
contractor clients like that

412
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,651
that float your little
software experiments.

413
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,360
I'm gonna mingle.

414
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,362
Set something up.
I'll do damage control.

415
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,364
Good.

416
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,325
- Hi there.
- Mm.

417
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,620
Friendly fella.

418
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,498
Well, we can't all have
your Southern charm.

419
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,375
I want to thank you
for calling me

420
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,420
when my grandson
was born.

421
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,630
That was you, right?

422
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,048
Mm-hmm.

423
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,845
Oh, sure.
Joe MacMillan,
man of mystery.

424
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,431
Yeah, it's always
good to hear from
an old... friend.

425
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,392
Well, you seem
to be doing just fine
making new friends.

426
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,394
Oh, Miss Gould is just
a business associate.

427
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,396
Oh, no, I mean
everyone here.

428
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,107
They're lapping you up.

429
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,775
It's a good call,
playing up the Texas thing.

430
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,777
People love
a performance.

431
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,821
It looks like you're
in a performance
of your own, huh?

432
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,447
More of a one-man show
kind of thing.

433
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,743
Yeah, I'm a regular
Spalding Gray.

434
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,873
I left someone hanging.

435
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,624
Be well.

436
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,465
Oh, good,
you're still here.

437
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,425
I was worried
you got kidnapped

438
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,636
by that old pal
Joe MacMillan.

439
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,850
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.

440
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,904
You certainly
made a splash tonight.

441
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,114
How so?

442
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,492
You're the life
of the party.

443
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,410
Everybody loves you.

444
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,083
Between you and me,
I told Donna

445
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,459
I was inviting you
for business.

446
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,461
But really, I just didn't
feel like flying solo,

447
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,464
you know,
under the circumstances?

448
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,759
Glad I could be
of service.

449
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,468
<i>Isn't that crazy?</i>

450
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,513
That you can build a life
with someone, raise kids,

451
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,517
spend your 20s, your 30s,
half your damn 40s together,

452
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,436
<i>and in the end</i>
<i>feel nothing?</i>

453
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,481
<i>How is that possible?</i>

454
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,483
I don't know.

455
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,485
Would you like
a cigarette?

456
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,696
No.

457
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,490
No, I'm good.

458
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,869
Somewhere along the line,
I lost my taste for tobacco.

459
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,955
<i>And champagne.</i>

460
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,539
Parties.

461
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,970
I told my lawyer
I didn't want
to fly up here

462
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,512
and bail Topher out
right away.

463
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,513
Let him cool
his heels for a while,

464
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,766
reflect upon
his actions.

465
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,102
Plus, SF's not
my cup of tea.

466
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,937
It must be hard
to leave La Jolla.

467
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,022
I love Del Mar.
It's got the perfect mix

468
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,192
of sand bottom beach breaks
and patchy reefs.

469
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,779
It's, uh--
it's very easy
to find a wave

470
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,156
you can call your own.

471
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,782
I've always envied surfers.

472
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,534
We do a little naval work
out at Coronado Island.

473
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,536
- Mm.
-<i> Those bastards offshore</i>

474
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,538
<i>look like they don't have</i>
<i>a care in the world</i>

475
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,833
while I'm stuck to my seat
worrying about packet switching

476
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,709
and computer viruses,
thank you very much.

477
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,171
- ( chuckles )
- Packet switching?

478
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,547
- Is that with the DoD?
-<i> Yeah, nothing sexy.</i>

479
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,049
<i>Just moving a bunch</i>
<i>of electronic boxes around.</i>

480
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,634
- Mm.
-<i> System's so damn clunky,</i>

481
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,552
<i>they're gonna overhaul</i>
<i>the whole thing.</i>

482
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,846
Ken:
<i>Ugh, sounds like</i>
<i>a pain in the ass.</i>

483
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,555
<i>You know</i>
<i>what you should do?</i>

484
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,558
You should take a page
from those carefree bastards

485
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,228
and you should
catch a wave, huh?
Clear your mind.

486
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,605
Joe's got
a great instructor
down your way.

487
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,151
She's, uh--
she's amazing.

488
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,568
And guess what,
her name--

489
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,570
it's, uh--
her name is Sandy.

490
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,822
- ( both laugh )
- Sandy.

491
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,949
- Right, Joe.
- ( chuckles )

492
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,534
That's good.
Love to meet her.

493
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,582
Look, I know
I'm being managed here.

494
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,084
Glenfiddich goes down nice,
but it doesn't wipe away

495
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,086
the taste
of that phone call
from those cops.

496
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,589
Topher's still a teenager.
We don't let our boy run wild.

497
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,842
Cal, I was very troubled

498
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,260
when I heard
what happened to your son.

499
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,680
I had no idea there were
minors in my home

500
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,182
or narcotics,

501
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,934
and in no universe
would I approve of that.

502
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,605
All right.

503
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,691
You seem
like a decent man.

504
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,693
Not some 'Frisco nutjob.

505
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,280
<i>I'll submit a detailed report</i>
<i>to the big boss, i.e., my wife,</i>

506
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,033
and, uh, that should
clear things up.

507
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,576
Might not mention
Sandy to her, though.

508
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,081
Nothing like a girl
in a wet suit,
am I right?

509
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,041
You sure are.
Although, I prefer a bikini.

510
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,210
Yeah.

511
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:30,630
Some of our business
associates in SF,

512
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,633
they're a little funny,
if you catch my drift.

513
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,635
Soft handshakes.

514
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,637
Hell, maybe
we'll get lucky

515
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,640
and all the faggots
will catch that special flu
that's going around.

516
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,309
<i>As long as my son</i>
<i>stays away from it.</i>

517
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,644
<i>But, uh, got plenty of time</i>
<i>to whip him into shape.</i>

518
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,063
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>he's still a kid.</i>

519
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,649
All right, gentlemen,
it's that time.

520
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,819
All right.
Yes, sir.

521
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,654
Hey, watch it, man.

522
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,282
Do you know,
I wouldn't worry
about your son.

523
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,159
He'll find his path
when he gets away from you.

524
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,328
But I feel sorry
for your wife.

525
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,080
She has to lie there
taking it,

526
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,915
wondering
what the hell she did

527
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,167
to have your stinking
breath in her face.

528
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:11,130
Or, wait,
maybe I was wrong.

529
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,631
Maybe the big boss
isn't the one taking it.

530
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,676
Hey, Jesus Christ, Joe.

531
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,137
We had the son of a bitch
locked and you had to--

532
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,679
Had to what?

533
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,183
We sell security software
to the government.

534
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,228
Hey, wait.
Come on, hey!

535
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,780
Hey.

536
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,282
Hey.

537
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,159
It was great hanging out
with you last night.

538
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,204
Mm-hmm.

539
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,706
<i>( keyboard clacking )</i>

540
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,171
- Can I just--
- Uh, yeah.

541
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,396
Sure.

542
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,773
Cool.

543
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,067
I'll let you
get back to work.

544
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,283
( groans )

545
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,790
I heard you two had
a good conversation
last night.

546
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,168
Uh, yeah.

547
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,171
I decided to, uh, keep
the SwapMeet code as it is

548
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,132
and translate
some of Mutiny into C++
to bridge the interface.

549
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,342
Really?
That's great.

550
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,759
The guys are
gonna be thrilled.

551
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:43,722
And I think
we should fire them.

552
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,809
What? Why?

553
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,937
Do you have an actual,
you know, reason we
can give Diane,

554
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,814
since she's the one
who's gonna have
to pay for it?

555
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,025
Yes.

556
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,318
We don't need them.

557
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,779
Well, the dinner
is tonight.

558
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,822
If you really want
to fire the guys,

559
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,741
then you can
tell Diane yourself.

00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,791
Race!

563
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,793
No, no, no, no, no.
No video games.

564
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,045
We're here to coalesce
as a group.

565
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,796
- What?
- So line up by "heighth."

566
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,298
- What?
- "Heighth"?

567
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,884
Height.
Line up by height.
How tall you are.

568
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,053
- ( laughing )
- Height.

569
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,388

be at the end.

- Yes, hair counts.

Come on, guys.

Bodie:
<i>Yeah, Wonderboy.</i>

577
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,819
All right, you've been
ordered by Allied Command

578
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,821
to select
12 general prisoners...

579
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,491
- I'm innocent.
- ...convicted by
courts-martial

580
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:48,828
and sentenced to be executed
or serve lengthy prison terms

581
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,873
for murder, robbery,

582
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,834
striking
a general in the ear,

583
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,836
and other crimes
of violence.

584
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,089
And you will deliver them
behind enemy lines

585
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,842
in France to undertake
a mission of sabotage

586
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,345
that could change
the course of the war.

587
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,889
Okay, Lee Marvin,
but don't most of the guys
in that movie eat it?

588
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,558
By the end, is it more
like the "Dirty Deuce"?

589
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,351
I'll show you
a Dirty Deuce, Bodie.

590
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,853
It's a metaphor.

591
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,355
Actually, it's more
of an allegory.

592
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,898
Uh, pipe down,
Smurfette.

593
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,941
An allegory
is a metaphor.

594

F you, semen.

595
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,487

call me semen?

00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,132
Yeah.

she's my partner.

But you just said
that they're a big asset.

686
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,826
I wouldn't
be happy about it,

687
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,996
but it's better than
forcing something toxic.

688
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,331
I just hope it's the guys
who are the problem.

689
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,336
So, how's
the team-building coming?

690
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,547
Well, surprisingly
productive.

691
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,174
Although I've been banned
from future competition

692
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,928
due to my controversial
military tactics.

693
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,013
- ( chuckles )
- You can get out there.
They're still there.

694
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,347
It's stupid fun.

695
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:03,226
No, I just
came by 'cause I--

696
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,520
well, 'cause
I said I would.

697
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,523
Well, look at you,
Mr. Nice Guy.

698
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,943
Mr. Nice Guy?

699
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:14,863
Back at Cardiff,
you were the heavy
SVP of Sales.

700
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,573
All those
multimillion-dollar
accounts,

701
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,617
everybody was
scared shitless of you.

702
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,660
You know,
including myself.

703
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,995
But now...

704
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,957
Now what?

705
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,627
Look, I just mean, you know,
being the boss sounds good,

706
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,420
but this is better.

707
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,881
There's minimal
responsibility,
maximum fun.

708
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:37,427
Which reminds me,
what's that story
you keep telling the guys?

709
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,888
- Something about...
- That thing's outta gas.

710
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,767
( coders laughing )
Bos!

711
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,769
- You should've seen it.
- Oh, man, you're not
gonna believe it.

712
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,771
Gordon went
full-on kamikaze.

713
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,982
He practically
murdered the guy.

714
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,275
It seemed totally
lame at first, but it was
actually pretty awesome.

715
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,069
Yeah, even she
liked it.

716
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,445
( all laugh )

717
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,863
You should play
the next round, man.

718
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:57,990
- You would shred
this course.
- No.

719
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,992
Coders:
Come on. Come on.

720
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,453
( chanting )
Bos! Bos! Bos!

721
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,875
No, I'm good.

722
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,168
I said I'm good!

723
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,218
Go have another round.

724
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,304
Get on in there.
You guys enjoy it.

725
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,890
- Okay, yeah.
- ( overlapping chatter )

726
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,684
( all cheering )

727
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,644

728
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,327
( sighs )

729
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,463
Cam.

730
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,258
What time is it?

731
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,970
It's late.
You missed the dinner.

732
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,514
Oh, my God, Donna,
I'm sorry.

733
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,143
Jesus, I--
I don't know...

734
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,145
I meant to be there.
I planned to be there.

735
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,730
I don't know
what happened.

736
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,939
You're overworked,
that's what happened.

737
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,441
You're exhausted.

738
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,485
Um, how was the dinner?

739
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,363
Fine.

740
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,740
Doug sucked up a lot.

741
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,575
God, I hate that guy.

742
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,493
I know.
But Craig's okay.

743
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,204
Yeah.

744
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,498
After they left,

745
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,167
I told Diane
you want to fire them.

746
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,211
And?

747
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,548
She said no.

748
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:42,802
What do you mean,
she said no?

749
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,138
They're a part of the deal.

750
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,975
They're an important asset
and we have to find a way
to make it work.

751
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,309
( chuckles )
What?

752
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,311
I thought she
was on our side.

753
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,732
She feels
it's what's best
for the company.

754
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,365
Okay.

755
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,702
( exhales )

756
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:11,414
Okay, well,
thank you for asking.
I really appreciate it.

757
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,750
Yeah.

758
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,421
- I'll see you at home.
- Yeah.

Hello?

762
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:58,377
I'm cool to work at night,
but your call kind of
freaked me out.

763
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,422
We lost
General Atomics today.

764
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:05,218
They represent 37%
of our annual billing.

765
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,220
What happened?

766
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,681
<i>I traded them</i>
<i>for something</i>
<i>more valuable.</i>

767
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,392
What's this?

768
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,687
The log-in credentials
for the ARPANET,

769
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,231
the Department of Defense
packet-switching network.

770
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,900
I secured the information
through General Atomics.

771
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,902
I want you to look into it
before they flag

772
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,654
that my credentials
still work.

773
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,283
Okay, but, you know,
the ARPANET isn't new tech.

774
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:32,453
It's sort of rusty.
It's not like missile codes
or fighter plane blueprints.

775
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,413
This is--
this is mundane stuff.

776
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,416
I do know that.
It's antiquated.

777
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,460
And that means
it's ripe for an upgrade.

778
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,421
So what should I do?

779
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:46,718
I need you to go
into it, map it,

780
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:51,097
and help me figure out
what's next.

781
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,433
-<i> ( duck quacking )</i>
-<i> ( gunshots )</i>

782
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,937

783
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,523
<i>( Cameron and Gordon</i>
<i>chatting indistinctly )</i>

784
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,702
- Play after this.
- There's two controllers,
though.

785
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,289
Play after I finish
the best out of 10.

786
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,959
Man, you're like some kind
of "Duck Hunt" savant.

787
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,503
Does that mean I'm totally
deficient in other areas?

788
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:27,466
Like "Duck Hunt" savant,
but bad team player.

789
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,135
Come on.
( groans )

790
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,469
So how's it going with...

791
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,555
( German accent )
<i>...Dick und Doof?</i>

792
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,640
<i>Dick und Doof?</i>

793
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,935
That's what my grandfather
called Laurel and Hardy.

794
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,770
Loosely translates
to "chubby and dumb."

795
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,982
Well, that's perfect,
'cause Doug's the<i> Dick...</i>

796
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,734

Ahh!

00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,909
Oh, whatever, though.

801
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,494
I guess I'm gonna
have to make it work.

802
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,706
All right, hope you
haven't lost your edge

803
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,917
now that you're
a peacemaker.

804
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,881
Uh, oh, do you
want a soda?

805
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,175
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

806

- Hey.
- Jesus!

00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,772
What are you doing?

808
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,359
You know, I wanted
to tell you something.

809
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:30,280
