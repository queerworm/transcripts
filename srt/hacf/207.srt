<i>( clock ticking )</i>

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,388
-<i> ( high-frequency ringing ) </i>
-<i> ( Gordon's voice echoing )</i>
<i>I spoke with a doctor.</i>

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,474
<i>And he's a really,</i>
<i>really good doctor.</i>

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,978
<i>And he assured me</i>
<i>this is not something</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,605
<i>( Gordon's voice )</i>
<i>This is not a death sentence.</i>

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,817
I'm okay.

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,736
This is a complication,
that's it.

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,197
Lord knows
we've overcome our fair
share of those, right?

9
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,158
Yeah. I can--
I can leave work.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,619
I can quit and stay
and make sure you're
all right.

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,413
Donna, this cannot,
will not derail anything.

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,207
Your work-- everything
that you're doing.

13
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,460
That would break my heart.
I feel fine.

14
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,671
Yes, my hands
are a little weak,

15
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,257
and, yes, there are
small things, tiny things
here and there,

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,011
but I feel good, okay?

17
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,679
I'm gonna live my life.

18
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,263
I'm moving forward
with the company.

19
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,891
Gordon, how?

20
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,309
My office is 23 steps
from the bedroom.

21
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,978
There's no driving,
no commute,

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,522
my engineers are
my most trusted friends.

23
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,608
And worst-case scenario,
you're here.

24
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,529
We're gonna
be okay, okay?

25
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,116
I'm sorry you felt
like you couldn't tell me.

26
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,245
I was-- I was scared.
I didn't know.

27
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,873
I'm here now, okay?
I'm here.

28
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:34,011
Wait, wait.
No, it's okay.
Um, can we just, uh...

29
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:37,138
Yeah. Yeah.

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,266
Let's just...

31
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,276
Jacob:
<i>What do you think about 10,000</i>
<i>square feet of office space?</i>

32
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,987
<i>We'll do it gratis</i>
<i>and off-site.</i>

33
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,407
Nowhere near the stench
of the oil business.

34
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,451
I think they'll love it.

35
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,703
- They'll never have to
see a suit and tie.
- ( both chuckle )

36
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,248
Do you have the zoning records
on Mutiny's current address?

37
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,375
Just to take that further
for a second,

38
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,169
where they are now,
east side, neighborhood's
a little rough,

39
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,465
house itself hasn't seen
a coat of paint since the
invention of the Model A,

40
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,593
but the heart of the company
is sewn up into its walls.

41
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,639
We could save some coin
and embrace that motley
spirit.

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,351
There's nothing stopping us
from buying up the house,
the entire block.

43
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,896
We could turn the place
into a mini campus.

44
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,732
Let them design it,
grow it as they see fit.

45
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,358
Change as little
as possible.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,693
Then they could
pepper the place

47
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,071
with foosball tables
and arcade cabinets.

48
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,239
( chuckles )
That would certainly
win more votes

49
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,700
than our 401(k)
and platinum dental.

50
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,453
Drop in a grid
of IBM 4361 Superminis,

51
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,204
300 dedicated
phone lines,

52
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,874
give them
direct admin access
to the mainframe,

53
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,127
I think we got 'em.

54
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,295
That's brilliant.

55
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,797
Great work, Joe.

56
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,424
Give 'em a call.
Let's get this thing done.

57
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,054
Three bucks and
my Doctor Doom says
red all the way.

58
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,305
I'll bet Kang on blue.

59
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,474
Kang?
Dude, everyone has Kang.

60
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,392
I have five Kangs.
Arki has 11 Kangs.

61
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,227
Kang is like
the John Q. Public
of action figures.

62
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,063
Fine,
my black Spider-Man.

63
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,648
- Yeah!
- Oh!

64
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,359
All:
One, two, three.

Guys!
Whoa, why is no one working?

67
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,538
- Is something wrong
with the network?
- Bodie:<i> Not yet.</i>

68
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,957
Unless Joe MacMillan's
morning coffee tastes bad.

69
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,251
- ( scoffs )
- Okay, well, shh.

<i>( music playing</i>

71
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,801
Hi, sorry about that.

72
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,345
Oh, please, I raised
three rambunctious boys.

73
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,805
The place
feels like home.

74
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,557
( chuckles )

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,187
What was Tom like
as a kid?

76
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,190
- Oh, God.
- I'll try not
to embarrass him too much.

77
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,150
Oh, you say that
10 minutes after

78
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,527
telling her about
the time that I wet
your bed.

79
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,655
But little Tommy
was the golden child,

80
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,867
even if he was
more of an indoor boy
than his brothers.

81
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,371
Every day after school,
he got a cupcake and a Kayo
just for keeping me company.

82
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,208
- Oh, spoiled.
- Mother: Always.

83
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,794
Oh, I gotta get
to the depot.

84
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,088
Yeah, okay.

85
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,422
Oh, yeah.

86
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,507
Cameron, thank you
so much for lunch.

87
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,717
It was great
meeting you.

88
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,260
No, it was great
to meet you.

89
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,138
I haven't seen Tom
this happy in a while.

90
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,225
Thank you for giving him
such a wonderful
opportunity here.

91
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,309
We're glad to have him.

92
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,646
This is a very, very
special place.

93
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,982
And I know
you're bound to have
tremendous success.

94
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,902
Thanks.

95
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,904
- Bye, baby.
- Okay, I'll see you at home.

96
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,448
- Bye.
- All right. Okay.

97
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,576
Um, chicken parmesan,
is that okay?

98
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,953
And he can cook, too.

99
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,454
- Can you beat that?
- No.

100
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,956
Okay.

101
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,665
- Mother:<i> Bye. </i>
- Bye.

102
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,336

103
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,922
Little Tommy.

104
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,432
Thank you.

105
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,683
I know she can
be intense.

106
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,685
I liked meeting her.

Okay, Joe's gonna
be here any minute.

121
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,347
So, I'm thinking that
we'll listen to him,
hear him out,

122
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:32,475
and then act professional
and then just let him
down easy, right?

123
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,979
- I'm gonna need
some time off.
- Now?

124
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,397

a few days, at least.

- So that's it, huh?
- No.

<i>Here are some others.</i>

133
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,881
Inventory:
31 Commodore 64 machines,

each with a 1541
peripheral floppy,

135
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:52,180
12 recently purchased

My point is, you don't
care about numbers.

140
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,403
<i>You shouldn't.</i>

141
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:11,158
What makes this place special
is people sharing recipes,
advice,

142
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,244
human experiences,
connection

143
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,912

of a phone line.

144
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:21,626

Vital for technological
breakthrough.

Essential for bringing
users into the door.

153
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,653

connection trumps content.

<i>Starting day one,</i>
<i>Westgroup will begin</i>

<i>a global expansion</i>
<i>of your network.</i>

00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,494

all over the world

158
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,042

feel less alone.

Uh, just

global expansion look like?

162

we should take a minute
with this.

163
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,812
- I have.
- Donna: Maybe I'm crazy,
but it sounds to me

164
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:26,691
like Westgroup
wants the exact same
things that we do.

165

<i>Let's leave the past</i>
<i>where it is</i>

You build it.

171
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,509
I'll get
out of the way
this time.

172
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,178
You'll get
out of the way?

173
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,826
Hey!

174
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,037
Everybody, listen up.

175
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,873
- Cameron, come on.
- Here's what's going on.

176
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:28,211
Joe MacMillan
and Westgroup Energy
want to buy us up.

177
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,256
You hear that?
Yeah.

178
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,218
We can all go work
for a bunch of oil
company suits downtown.

179
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,387
- How's that sound
to you guys?
- Boo.

180
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,389
Oh, what, does it sound
like selling out?

181
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,099
- Yeah.
- 'Cause that's what
it sounds like to me.

182
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,560
Yeah, instead of building
kick-ass games,

183
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,062
they want to turn this
into a place

184
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,941
- where housewives
can share their recipes.
- Coder:<i> That's bullshit!</i>

185
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,569
What?
Oh, wait, you don't want
to wear a tie to work?

186
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,613
You don't want
to clock in and out?

187
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,365
- No. Hell, no.
- So you'd rather
be equal partners

188
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,950
in a thing
that you created

189
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,702
with your own blood
and sweat and tears

190
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,831
than mindless stooges
in a corporate food chain?

191
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,625
- Coders:<i> Yeah! </i>
-<i> ( clapping )</i>

192
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,711
( chanting )
Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!

193
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,798
-<i> ( coders cheering ) </i>
-<i> ( chanting continues )</i>

194
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,220
( coders cheering )

195
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,765
<i>( chanting continues )</i>

196
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,310
- Coder:<i> Great! All right. </i>
- Coder #2:<i> Let's do it!</i>

197
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,728
<i>( chanting continues )</i>

198
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,817
All right, first off,
I wanna thank you guys

199
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,319
for knocking off
a few days' vacation time

200
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,987
so we can try this thing out,
all right?

201
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,572
I'm not asking
for full buy-in now.

202
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,449
I believe the proof
is in the pudding.

203
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:44,329
Once those days are up,
if you want in, you're in.

204
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,958
- Yeah?
- Tandy, EDS,
General Dynamics, Sabre.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,628
That's a lot of salary
to walk away from after
a couple weeks.

206
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,588
Yeah, yeah.
I know it is. 

207
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,676
And that's why tomorrow
I want each of you

208
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,304
to bring in your most recent
pay stub so I can match 'em
in good faith.

209
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,264
Look, I'm not handing out
parking spaces

210
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,100
and gold watches just yet
because it's just us, okay?

211
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,354
100% fulfillment.
Guys with screwdrivers
and soldering irons

212
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,065
sitting at these benches,
doing what they do best.

213
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,817
Once we get going,
I'm dropping ads

214
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,445
in the biggest national
computer magazines.

215
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,280
No more retail store
middlemen,

216
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,782
no more cubicles,
no more bullshit,
all right?

217
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,494
Just these and this.

218
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:28,707
- ( chuckles )
Paging Joe MacMillan.
- ( all chuckle )

219
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:34,462
We'll standardize around
the Intel 186 '87 processor
running at 8 MHz.

220
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,465
10-meg hard drive,
5 1/4 floppy.

221
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,385
Eventually,
we'll go to 12 MHz
on the 286-based system,

222
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,639
but for now I want
to stick with the 186
so we can keep prices down.

223
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,600
How far down, you ask?

224
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,477
800 bucks per unit,
give or take.

225
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,480
All depending
on what options
the customer chooses.

226
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,108
They want a standard
Lincoln Town Car, boom.

227
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,112
They want a Ferrari?
Hey, they got the money,
honey, we got the time.

228
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,656
A nimble economy job,
500 out the door.

229
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,992
Prices are lower
than retail brands
across the board.

230
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,580
We're offering the customer
unlimited self-assembly

231
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,541
with the convenience
of plugging it in

232
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,628
and flipping
a switch.

233
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,713
Open architecture, baby.

234
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,592
The destiny
of every box we build

235
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,303
lays in the hands of the user
turning that mother on.

236
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,513
So, what do you say?

237
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,266
You guys want to slam
one of these together or what?

238
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,272
It's not a death sentence,
it's a complication.

239
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,816
And Lord knows the two of us
have overcome our fair share
of those.

240
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,323
What?

241
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,493
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm still on "brain damage."

242
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,912
Microscopic.
Some mild effects.

243
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:56,877
- Like what?
- Like muscle weakness,
some memory lapses.

244
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:01,090
He might seem a little off
once in a while.

245
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,968
Like when he dug a hole
in your yard in the middle
of the night?

246
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,722
No, no,
that was work, stress.

247
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,726
What about
when Gordon flew out here
all those years ago

248
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,604
to ask your father's
permission to marry you?

249
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,064
- What happened?
- No, Mom-- now you're
being ridiculous.

250
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,817
- What happened, Donna?
- Mom.

251
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,403
He was so nervous
that he got on
the wrong plane.

252
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,489
Ended up in
Salt Lake City.

253
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:28,201
Had to call your father,
who ended up booking him
a seat.

254
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,329
Even told the gate agent
to make sure he got on
the right flight.

255
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,914
That's not--
that's-- it's cute.

256
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,000
It's-- that's--

257
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,795
Jesus, Mom, that's one
of my favorite stories
about Gordon.

258
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,005
That has nothing
to do with this.

259
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,258
What if he gets worse?
What if one day he's
in a wheelchair?

260
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,926
What then?

261
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,973
Well, then we will
deal with it.

262
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,768
What if something happens
when he's taking care
of the girls, honey?

263
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,479
- Have you thought of that?
- ( groans )

264
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,191
I know it's hard,
but you have to.

265
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,862
Maybe what happened--

266
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,489
the baby--

267
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,243
<i>was a blessing</i>
<i>in disguise.</i>

268
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,166
Hey, how's it
going over here?

269
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,710
Whatever, whatever.

270
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,045
What, when are you
gonna meet up with
this guy?

271
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,548
- George, right?
- I don't know.

272
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,965
We talked about doing
something tomorrow,

273
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,301
but maybe never.

274
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,305
- Lev, do it.
Stop being such a wuss.
- ( laughs )

275
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,183
Shut up.
You still owe me
a black Spider-Man.

276
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,353
- ( laughs )
- Hey.

277
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,106
I think I got it.

278
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,652
Coder:
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

279
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,659
Where's how much
it was for?

280
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,454
I haven't found it yet,
but look.

281
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,248
Office space renovation
and expansion,

282
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,711
- something-something--
- Cameron owns 90%
of this place?

283
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,755
Founding
entry-level employees

284
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,467
entitled to a 64% increase
of current salary

285
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,469
and 1% of sale price.

286
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,304
( speaks Russian )

287
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,389
1% of what?

288
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,769
Well, we already said no,
so it's 1% of jack shit.

289
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,607
Let's be clear.

290
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,735
You didn't bring me here.
I elected to show up.

291
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,321
Everything you say in this room
goes right back to Cameron.

292
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,575
And I have every expectation
that Cameron knows you came
to see me.

293
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,953
You know this is
a good deal.

294
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,748
The terms are not insulting,
yeah, but it ain't my company.

295
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,877
Can't fault the kid
for being a little squirrely,
either, can you?

296
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,841
Hell, Joe, you seemed like
a pretty good deal to me
back in the day.

297
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,092
I never asked you
to embezzle that money, John.

298
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,762
- ( scoffs )
- If you hadn't taken matters
into your own hands

299
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,681
and instead
just listened to me,

300
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,350
you'd be a multimillionaire
along with Nathan right now.

301
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,269
I know you see it.
You always have.

302
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,939
You went to bat for the Giant
because you believed in it.

303
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,817
You're at Mutiny
because you believe
in what they're doing now.

304
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,195
I'm at Mutiny because
I'm a 55-year-old ex-con
who can't get a job.

305
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,113
You're an extremely
valuable asset.

306
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,073
Please, Joe.

307
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,869
I can't take
such a large amount
of sunshine up my ass.

308
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,829
It makes me itch.

309
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,622
We're going to need
to pitch this program

310
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,457
to nine different
global subsidiaries.

311
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,710
<i>That's gonna require</i>
<i>serious sales acumen.</i>

312
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,337
We want you on that team.

313
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,006
We?

314
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,465
Man, you're
not pitching shit

315
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,718
unless she miraculously
changes her mind,

316
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,512
and I work out of her kitchen
until the day she says
otherwise.

317
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,181
You belong
in a corner office

318
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,600
and we've got one
waiting for you right here.

319
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,854
( sighs )

320
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,689
You have Cameron's ear.

321
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,524
She can hate me
all she wants,

322
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,736
but don't let her
cut off her nose
to spite her face.

323
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,364
I know you're
her go-to.

324
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,118
It ain't me, babe.

325
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,287
Is it Donna, then?

326
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,750
What can I say?

327
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,668
The kid's in love.

328
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,714
-<i> ( knock on door ) </i>
- Oh, Jacob.

329
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,798
So glad you
could swing by.

330
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,051
- John Bosworth.
- Hey.

331
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,762
- I've been hearing about you
in my circles for years.
- Sure.

332
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,722
I'm really looking forward
to having someone

333
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,516
of your background
and experience on this team.

334
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,101
I'm sure we both
can learn a thing or two

335
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,310
from each other,
don't you think?

336
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,396
Oh, I think so.
I think so.

337
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,900
- Thank you.
- Look, I'm sorry to be
in and out like this.

338
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,693
I have to be
in Houston by 4:00,

339
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,112
but when I heard
that you were coming in,

340
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,449
- I just had to come over and
introduce myself personally.
- Oh, sure, sure.

341
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,701
- It's a real pleasure.
- Pleasure's mine, Jacob, yeah.

342
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,119
( chuckles )

343
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,579
Joe.

344
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,669
You know...

345
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,839
you're not gonna find
a deal like this
anywhere else.

346
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,010
You might be right.

347
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,471
But I won't
be bought, Joe.

348
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,934
And if that's
what Cameron wants,
none of us will.

349
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,238
But we can offer an option
for a micro 3 1/2.

350
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,075
- Single or double-sided?
-<i> ( generator whirring )</i>

351
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,954
Offer both,
but double costs more.

352
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:28,250
Hey, you don't have to
hang out here all day,
you know.

353
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,921
Look, you've been living
with this for a while.
I haven't.

354
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,673
But, look,
it's more than that.

355
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,549
I've been gone too long.
I've missed you.

356
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,887
I've missed you, too.

357
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,349
<i>Hey.</i>

358
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,936
- I know that's why
you went to Henry's.
- What?

359
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:50,148
You needed someone else
because I wasn't there
for you.

360
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,359
Well, you're here now.

361
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,278
- Hey, Gordon?
- Yeah?

362
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,572
- Where do you keep the mugs?
-<i> Left of the sink.</i>

363
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,074
Want me to make you
a new pot?

364
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,284
Oh, it's actually
for smaller screws.

365
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,162
Tiny, tiny stuff.

366
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,622
- How's everything
going out there?
- Great.

367
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,042
Laying out
the prototype specs,
digging in on mods.

368
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,877
How's Gordon
handling everything?

369
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,921
He just bought 40 grand
worth of CPU chips

370
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,090
over the damn phone,
so I'd say pretty good.

371
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,718
- $40,000?
- Yeah.

372
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,553
Does that
seem okay to you?

373
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,679
Why, is something wrong?

374
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,597
No, no, nothing.

375
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,725
Just, could you keep
an eye on him

376
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,768
and let me know
if he seems...

377
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,395
different,
you know, or...

378
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,190
Sure, will do.

379
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,818
Larry, what's the holdup?

380
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,695
You puttin' the moves
on my wife?

381
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,073
- ( chuckles )
- Uh, no, sir.

382
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,241
Gordon:
<i>We got work to do.</i>

383
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,160
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

384
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,210
- You went to my house?
- I thought I'd try you there.

385
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,212
You weren't home,
so I left the--

386
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,672
The terms sheet, yeah.
You knew I'd be at work.

387
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,257
<i>Do you know who was</i>
<i>at my house?</i>

388
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,551
My mother.

389
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,845
Do you know she cried
when she thought

390
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,098
I was getting this kind
of a payout from the sale?

391
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,851
And then she cried again
when I had to tell her
that it wasn't true.

392
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:13,189
Do you--
do you understand
the recklessness

393
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,942
of telling
those kinds of lies
to someone like that?

394
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,736
Who's lying?
These numbers are real.

395
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,487
That's the same
acquisition offer

396
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,782
tendered to Cameron
and the senior staff.

397
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,575
The only new piece
of accounting here

398
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,703
is what you would
personally stand to make.

399
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,372
- A bribe, you mean.
- I just did the math for you.

400
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,168
You know, Tom,

401
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,421
you could've told me
all this over the phone.

402
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,132
And yet you're here.

403
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,634
You invaded my space,
I figured I'd invade yours.

404
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,886
Mm.

405
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,512
You care about Cameron.

406
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,766
You should.
She's special.

407
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,852
But you have to ask yourself
if you're doing right by her

408
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,522
if you let her make
this decision from a place
of pure emotion.

409
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,615
I'm not even gonna
tell her that we spoke.

410
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,033
Okay.

411
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,252
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

412
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,671
That's all
that he told me.

413
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,218
Is that
what you want?

414
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,471
( sighs )

415
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,643
<i>( coders chatting )</i>

416
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,109
( chatter continues )

417
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,531
How much do you
think it was for?

418
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,825
I don't know.

419
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:53,039
It was five million.

420
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,749
But we already
made our decision,

421
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,045
so let's get back to work
and just forget about it, okay?

422
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,296
No.

423
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,258
You made our decision.

424
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,926
What happened
to democracy?

425
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,553
Maybe your memory's
failing you,

426
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,555
but we all shouted Joe
out of this house.

427
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,557
Didn't we all
make this call?

428
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,434
Yeah, honestly,
we were just curious,
that's all.

429
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,770
- Yeah, it's okay.
Cool, so it's settled.
- Carl: It's fine.

430
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,274
How come you never told us
you own 90% of Mutiny?

431
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,029
You need
to let this go
right now.

432
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,530
How could anything
be up to us at all?

433
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,199
And shouldn't this
be different?

434
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,492
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>the details of the deal</i>

435
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,662
or that we were turning
our backs on $5 million.

436
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,414
What?
What do you want?

437
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,667
A vote.

438
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,044
A real vote.

439
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,670
Fine.

440
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,505
Yes, fine.
We'll have a vote.

441
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,593
For you, so that we
can put this to bed.
Everyone come in here.

442
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,929
I'll call your names.
Raise your hands if you
want to sell, okay?

443
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,013
Sell.

444
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,058
Yes, got it.

445
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,768
Arki.

446
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,020
Sell.

447
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,318
Carl?

448
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,196
Can I abstain?

449
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,367
Okay, not sell.

450
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,536
Wonderboy.

451
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,124
Not sell.

452
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,379
Bosworth.

453
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,341
( sighs )

454
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,842
Well?

455
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,679
Not sell.

456
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:38,185
( phone ringing )

457
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,770
Tom?

458
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,897
Bosworth:
<i>Mutiny.</i>

459
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,696
Cameron:
<i>Tom?</i>

460
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,115
Jesus.

461
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,451
Cameron.
Cameron!

462
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,035

-<i> ( music playing</i>
<i>in background ) </i>
-<i> ( chatter )</i>

464
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,712
What are you
waiting for?

465
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,049
I know my father
has this idea of me

466
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,219
as some damaged little girl
unable to keep a relationship.

467
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,805
I'm not exactly
eager to prove him right.

468
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,642
- Then don't.
- Oh, please, don't make this
harder than it already is.

469
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,104
( sighs )

470
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,986
This is a scintillating
conversation.

471
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:34,367
Dad, uh, Joe and I--

472
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:38,829
well, I haven't been
exactly happy in Dallas.

473
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,209
It's been hard
on me, on us,

474
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,586
and last weekend
I was in Austin and
I was thinking that--

475
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,297
No, no, no, no,
I understand.

476
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:51,008
Things here are new
for both of you.

477
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,094
New job, new home,
new city.

478
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:58,057
Is it perfect yet?
No, but you're building
a foundation.

479
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,727
- Well, that's not what I mean.
- Well, what I mean is that you
were never very good

480
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,521
at sitting still
for anything.

481
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,856
You know, you don't need
to hit the reset button

482
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,025
every time you feel
the slightest bit
of discomfort.

483
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,194
That's not what I do.

484
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,820
- And if you're
referring to Peter--
- Oh, come on, Sara.

485
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,947
- It's exactly what you do.
- ( scoffs ) Okay.

486
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,283
I do business in nine
different countries,

487
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,828
but compared to you, I feel
like a thousand-year-old
oak tree.

488
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,039
You've finally found
a guy you can trust,

489
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,958
someone who can help you
heal those old wounds.

490
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,379
<i>Frankly, I'm delighted</i>
<i>that you're with Joe.</i>

491
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,006
Even right now,
you seem much more
grounded to me.

492
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:35,344
Look, I hate to see
both of you

493
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,388
throw away everything
you've been building here

494
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,016
just because of some
anxious whimsy on your part

495
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,270
stemming from the mistakes
you made with your ex-husband.

496
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,772
With all due respect,
Jacob, I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

497
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,024
- Ah.
- Sara deserves a little more
credit than that.

498
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,692
She sees the best in people.

499
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,610
That's not a weakness,
it's her strength.

500
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,321
I'm sorry.

501
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,240
You think you
know my daughter
better than I do?

502
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,742
I think we can navigate
our engagement without
your input.

503
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,494
Does anybody want
to know what I think?

504
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,876
- Gordon: Moment of truth.
- Man: Moment of truth.

505
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,795
All right.

506
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,968
( powers up )

507
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,888
- Geronimo.
- ( men laughing )

508
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,307
- Yeah!
- ( slaps table )

509
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,225
The Giant
took us a year.

510
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,935
The Pro took us
half a year.

511
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:29,189
We got this sucker
running in two days.

512
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,525
If nothing else,
we're getting a lot faster.

513
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,027
I think pretty soon
we're all gonna be
a whole lot richer.

514
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,572
( all laugh )

515
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,493
You all right, Gordon?

516
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,913
You know, um...

517
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:49,251
the hardest thing in life
is to get knocked down

518
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,254
and then get back up
constantly.

519
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,299
But we do it
because we love it

520
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,594
and we know deep down
that if it's the right idea,

521
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:02,181
it could be bigger
than all of us.

522
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:06,519
For a long time,
I wondered if I was
ever gonna find it.

523
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:11,315
The closest I've come
is my kids.

524
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,487
Well...

525
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:20,115
I think I've finally
found something

526
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:26,704
that will allow me to say
to them with confidence,

527
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:31,126
"You can do it.
You can follow your dreams.

528
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:35,381
No matter how hard it is,
you can do it."

529
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,675
Hear, hear.

530
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,718
- Man:<i> Cheers... </i>
- To dreams, Gordon.

531
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,813
Just two weeks ago,

532
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,024
I was ready to walk
into Joe's office

533
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:59,238
and tell him that a portable
under 15 pounds--

534
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,240
it couldn't be done.

535
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:06,495
And now the Giant is gonna
be the lightest machine
on the market.

536
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:13,793
And that is truly
something to be proud of.

537
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,424
Joe as in
Joe MacMillan?

538
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,761
Uh, what?

539
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,932
What about Joe?

540
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,023
Um, anyways, uh...

541
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,402
great--
great work, guys.

542
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,904
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

543
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,822

<i>to curtain 2. </i>
- Hey.

546
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,585
Easy, easy.
He's stable.
It's fine.

547
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,546
He can't talk right now.
He's asleep and they
want him to rest.

548
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,339
What happened?

549
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,882
He was supposed
to go out

550
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,384
with George today
from the network.

551
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,261
Did they get jumped?

552
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,012
There is no George.

553
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,682
It was just
a bunch of guys

554
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,643
pretending to be
a person on Community

555
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:14,354
so that they could
lure him out and...

556
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,149
Did you give the police
the subscriber info for
the account?

557
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,026
- That should help them--
- No, the address
is phony, so...

558
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:24,364
of course the dumb pigs
aren't even doing anything
about it, especially--

559
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,160
Um, can I see him?

560
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,031
So, what?

561
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,701
Dinner here
again next week?
We tell him then?

562
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,577
You know, listening
to the two of you
talk in there,

563
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,287
it all crystalized
for me.

564
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,956
This is what's wrong.
You're in Dallas again,

565
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,835
working at Westgroup,
with a network that you
set up in secret--

566
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,504
I think you didn't tell him
'cause you're not ready
to give up on this.

567
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,673
No, when we came down
from the observatory,

568
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,800
we talked about
moving forward,

569
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,844
but the way
you're acting now,
where you're headed,

570
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,721
you're backsliding,
and I didn't sign up
for that.

571
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,139
I don't know what you
want me to do differently.

572
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,059
I want you to stop
meddling in other people's
companies and build your own.

573
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,935
Somewhere else,
like we talked about.

574
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,522
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

575
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:42,735
You're the one
who's afraid of your history,
my history repeating.

576
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,236
It won't.

577
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,197
I see what I see.

578
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,824
<i>( car approaches )</i>

579
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,887
What was your vote
gonna be?

580
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:24,610
She told you how
I got a cupcake and a Kayo

581
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,820
every day after school.

582
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,824
What my mom didn't tell you
was that was my dinner.

583
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,622
That way,
she could feed me
for under a buck.

584
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,885
( sighs )

585
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:52,971
She was laid off
two weeks ago.

586
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,517
But we already
had lunch planned

587
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:02,773
and she insisted
on wearing her uniform
and I begged her not to.

588
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:06,276
But she didn't
want you to think...

589
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,950
I don't want you to think
that this is about money.

590
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,663
'Cause it's not.

591
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,791
'Cause my mom
will get by.

592
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,462
We always have.

593
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,760
This job means
a lot to me.

594
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:39,392
And I hope it goes on
for a long, long time.

595
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,656
But you also mean
a lot to me.

596
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,411
And I want us
to go on

597
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,247
for a long, long
time.

598
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,963
You gave me this job.

599
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,175
It's your company.

600
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,515
No.

601
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,647
This company
belongs to everybody.

602
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,821
I'll call Joe.

603
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,450
I'll tell him
we're selling.

604
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,584
First of many.

605
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,383
Step one,
beef up support staff

606
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,301
of the explosive
Community functions.

607
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,430
Step two,
prep a huge launch
of the latest game,

608
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,098
"Extract &amp; Defend."

609
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,810
Spectacular blitz.
National TV spots,
full-color ads.

610
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:07,105
Let's hold off
on the games just
for a minute.

611
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,941
Why would we do that?

612
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:12,069
Three letters-- C-E-S.

613
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,487
The Consumer Electronics Show
is this month,

614
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,867
and from what I hear,
cartridge consoles still
own the games business.

615
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,328
What about Atari?
First company to lose
a billion dollars in a year.

616
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,205
Nintendo.

617
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,000
This, uh,
entertainment system thing

618
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,210
is gonna hit the States
just in time for Christmas,

619
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,505
and the skinny is
that's all she wrote.

620
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,925
<i>Continuing</i>
<i>with online games</i>
<i>at this point</i>

621
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,176
<i>would just be throwing</i>
<i>good money after bad.</i>

622
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,055
You're right.
We should proceed
with caution,

623
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,807
but games are the door.

624
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,975
They get users in.

625
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,018
They get them hooked
on the network.

626
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,562
The better the games,
the bigger the door.

627
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,356
No. Community.

628
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,191
That's the door.

629
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,487
And, in my opinion,
that's everything.

630
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,072
That's what we'll grow.

631
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,200
A big part
of my pitch to them

632
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,620
was that they could
maintain creative freedom.

633
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,125
Yeah.

634
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,876
That was smart.

<i>( faint chatter )</i>

637
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,077
I, um--

638
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,204
I went by the house.

639
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,290
They told me.

640
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,385
We don't know
who did it.

641
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,804
You probably
never will.

642
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,894
Sixth grade,
first day of school.

643
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,647
Someone wrote "fag"
on my locker.

644
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,068
I got some paper towels
from the bathroom,

645
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:20,321
wet them down,
and scrubbed it off
before anyone could see.

646
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:24,617
Next day,
they wrote it 20 times
in a permanent marker.

647
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,289
I never went back
to my locker.

648
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,211
Carried
seven textbooks
in my backpack

649
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,171
for the rest
of the year.

650
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,132
I was only 11 years old,

651
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,176
but I was already
running from something.

652
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:48,600
I guess it made
my legs stronger,

653
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,518
my back stronger.

654
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,608
It's dangerous
to try and really
connect with someone.

655
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:03,949
It's so special
when you find a person
you can be yourself with.

656
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,037
You were that.

657
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,709
Sara is.

658
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,679
Don't sell.

659
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,766
<i>He'll ruin it.</i>

660
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,062
He won't mean to,
but he will.

661
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:37,190
He'll make a ton of money,
the company will be
a juggernaut,

662
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:41,527
but your vision will be
corrupted and lost.

663
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,406
He'll start by pulling
the plug on games.

664
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,534
( groans )

665
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:55,667
What--
what is this, Joe?

666
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,295
You fight so hard
to get me to sign
the dotted line--

667
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,879
It's not my business.

668
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,133
I'm not gonna
bully you into this.

669
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,510
It's your company.

670
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,637
You should decide
what happens to it.

671
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,932
Maybe you'll make it.

672
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,517
Maybe you won't.

673
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,562
But you'll live or die
by who you really are.

674
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,109
And where do you
fit into all this?

675
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:23,402
I don't.

676
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,407
I'm removing myself
from the equation.

677
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,464
( sighs )

678
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,551
Donna:<i> Gordon?</i>

679
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,558
What is it?

680
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,482
What's wrong?

681
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,442
Our first order.

682
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,699
Clark Computers.

683
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,284
We're officially
in business.

684
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,328
( laughs )

685
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,002
-<i> ( door closes ) </i>
-<i> ( footsteps )</i>

686
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,979
I'm putting in my notice
at Westgroup.

687
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,651
I do believe I'm the person
you fell in love with.

688
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,238
If you want me to go,
I'll go.

689
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,829
Just tell me
what you want.

690
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,459
I want to get married.

691
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,837
( laughs )

692
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,757
( exhales )
That's what we'll do.

693
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,675
No, today.

694
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,887
And in two weeks,
we're in California.

695
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,935
Okay.

696
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,478
Okay.

697
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,239
( laughs )

698
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,242
-<i> ( door closes ) </i>
-<i> ( coders chattering )</i>

699
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,394
Let me just make
one thing clear.

700
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,773
This is my company.

701
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:10,611
And I'm not selling it.

702
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,051
