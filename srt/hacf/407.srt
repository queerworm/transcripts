00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,171
What?

360
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,215
I didn't know Tiffany's
made a box that big.

361
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,843
Look at you --
all happy and healthy.

362
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:09,844
Hi!

363
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,095
Good to see ya.

364
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,555
Yeah, feeling good.

365
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,265
Ready
for another dinner.

366
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,892
Different restaurant,
though.

[Chuckles]

368
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,605
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

369
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,065
I'm...
I'm so happy for you.

370
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,318
Well, we really only did it
for tax reasons.

371
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,904
Yeah, on account of me
almost dying.

372
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,073
Oh, I don't know.
You pledged your troths.

373
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,784
I feel like that's romantic.

374
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,828
Well, that's what people
keep telling us.

375
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,746
[Chuckles]

376
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,541
Uh, sweetheart, can I have
a minute with Donna --

377
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,668
if you have time?

378
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,253
Mm, sure.

379
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,672
Here.

380
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,006
[Grunts]

381
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,549
Geez! This thing's
heavier than hell.

382
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,802
Oh, it's just --
it's a punch bowl, I --

383
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,386
Oh! Punch bowl.

384
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,722
Oh, sweetheart, where do
we keep our punch bowls?

385
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,850
Put it in the pantry.
I'll take care of it.
Okay.

386
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,477
Or you can just put it right
in the back of Diana's car

387
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,604
so she can exchange it
for a nice piece of jewelry.

388
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,856
What the hell do I get?

389
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,816
You get Diane.

390
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,943
Oh. Fair enough!

391

[Chuckles]

392
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,615
Donna...

393
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,827
first of all,
I owe you an apology.

394
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,411
I was...

395
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,080
rough about Rover.

396
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,000
No, look,
no apology necessary.

397
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,292
It was a...

398
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,127
complex situation.

399
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,005
Water under the bridge.

400
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,508
I wanted to let you know

401
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,887
that I'm getting ready to step
back as managing partner.

402
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,972
Really?

403
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,932
We got the message
loud and clear

404
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,600
about not living forever.

405
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,646
And if I want to spend time
with my new husband...

406
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,733
managing partner is
not a part-time job.

407
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,821
When were you thinking
about doing this?

408
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,948
Soon-ish.

409
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,075
[Sighs]

410
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,954
I wanted to let you know that
if you still want the job...

411
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,915
I'll back you.

412
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,958
Oh, I...

413
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,378
Of course.

414
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,629
I do.

415
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,089
Good.

416
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,842
I mean,
I can't just anoint you.

417
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,010
No, of course.

418
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,679
But I do have a pretty
jumbo-sized vote.

419
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,556
[Laughs]

420
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,602
Thank you.

421
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,312
Should we celebrate?
Some champagne, gin?

422
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,942
You know, just water
would be great.

423
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,777
Okay.

424
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,534
Sorry, I know it's a little
insane in here, but...

425
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,828
Ah. No, no, it's ---
it's perfect.

426
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,329
I didn't know
what to expect

427
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,873
when I heard
"trailer in the woods."

428
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,583
-Yeah.
-Ha.

429
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,543
I feel like I just
walked into your brain.

430
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,254
Oh, no, my brain is
not as tidy as this.

431
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,297
Do you want to see?

432
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,424
-Of course.
-Okay.

433
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,802
So it's all still
pretty basic,

434
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,178
but what I've been
trying to do

435
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,808
is create bots
with distinct personalities

436
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,143
and whose choices
change depending on --

437
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,104
on the circumstances
they're in.

438
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,314
-Self-learning A.I.
-Exactly.

439
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,608
So it's not just the player
acting upon the game,

440
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,234
it's the game acting
upon itself

441
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,320
and then the player has to try
and catch up.

442
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:19,158
So this is Bing and Billie,

443
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,119
and this is Gazebo.

444
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,746
I have a bunch, but these
are kind of the main three.

445
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,791
What I'm really trying to do
is create a world

446
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,752
in which actions have
consequences, you know?

447
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,463
Mm-hmm.
I mean, I was trying
to do that with Pilgrim, too,

448
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,381
but I guess
that game was too...

449
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,510
solitary or hard
or whatever.

450
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,930
But, um, here, I feel
like I'm creating characters

451
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,684
that have the ability to accrue
memory and -- and -- and --

452
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,396
and develop a personal narrative
and -- and change over time.

453
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,150
And it's all just
feeling really...

454
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,402
immersive and complete.

455
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,656
-Really great.
-Yeah.

456
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,743
I mean, I was expecting great,
so I'm not surprised.

457
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,788
So do you want to see some of
the more, um, in-progress work?

458
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,707
Um...sure.

459
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,667
Or maybe we could go
for a little hike,

460
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,918
talk more big-picture.

461
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,545
It's just so gorgeous
out here.

462
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,005

[Chuckles]

464
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,799
Okay.

465
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,927
So it wasn't really what you
were looking for?

466
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,221
Oh! No, no.
It's just...

467
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,640
sometimes I think
the ideas can get bigger

468
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,517
when the space
around you does.

469
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,978
Yeah.

470
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,105
Yes. Let's...

471
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,273
I've been trying to get out
for a hike all day.

472
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,817
Let's --
Let's get out there.

473
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,411
Joe:
We can call a guy.

474
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,705
I already called a guy,
he made it worse.

475
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,082
So did you.

476
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,293
Look, it's a bad breaker.
I can fix that.

477
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,295
It's more
than a bad breaker.

478
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,715
You sure you don't
want to call a guy?

479
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,426
You guys,
this is not rocket science.

480
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,178
Okay.

481
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,639
Thanks for
the afternoon off.

482
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,600
I didn't give you
the afternoon off.

483
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,602
You're supposed to be
working from home.

484
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,395
Oh.
What did I say?

485
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,480
All right,
I'll see you tonight.

486
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,899
Can I bring anything?

487
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,358
Nope.
Got all that covered.

488
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,112
Oh. You're a take-charge
mama jama.

489
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,529
Mm-hmm.

490
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,907
Try not
to blow anything up.

491
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,617
I'll try.

492
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,412
Cam said Donna
was looking pretty rough

493
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,330
when she came by
the Airstream last week.

494
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,916
Is something
going on with her?

495
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,962
Cameron said she didn't seem
like herself.

496
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,672
Why is Cam
gossiping about Donna?

497
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,466
She was concerned.

498
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,510
Look, I just don't
trust the woman.

499
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,971
I know she's your family,

500
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,056
I'm not supposed to have
an opinion about her,

501
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,099
but I don't trust her.

502
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,726
Haley cut all
of her hair off, okay?

503
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,729
Short. Like a boy.

504
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,067
Donna came over this morning
to talk about it, except...

505
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,865
Well, short hair...

506
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,034
doesn't mean anything.

507
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,494
Um...

508
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,079
Well...

509
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,499
apparently, I shouldn't have
barked at you the other day.

510
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,795
But it's really tough hearing
something about your kid

511
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,880
that you don't know about.

512
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,761
Can I make one suggestion?

513
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:31,475
It's really important for Haley
not to feel isolated right now.

514
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,812
This place
is such a great fit for her.

515
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,648
I wish you'd let her come back.

516
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,484
I want her to,
but she seems pretty intent

517
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,611
on hating me right now.

519
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,451
She trusts you, though.

520
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,205
Hmm?

521
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,333
I mean, she took you to that
restaurant, didn't she?
