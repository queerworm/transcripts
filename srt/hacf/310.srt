00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,093
Chairs.

00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,602

<i>( thudding, creaking )</i>

8
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,351
Hello?

9
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,023
- Hey.
- Hi!

10
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,650
Am I early?
I thought we said 9:00.

11
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,652
Uh, no, yeah.
Yeah, 9:00.

12
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,155
She here yet?

13
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,199
Uh, I know
her plane landed,

14
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,202
so... as long
as she's on it.

15
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,246
<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>The drive okay?</i>

16
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, yeah.
It's the weekend,
plus the holiday, so...

17
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,127
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, there was no traffic.

18
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,799
- What's M-NET?
- Oh, uh...

19
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,803
Mutiny's last-ditch
rebranding effort.

20
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,639
Tried to stop the bleeding,
but, you know, still--

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,181
Bled.

22
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,230
Anyway, my VC firm
held onto the lease

23
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,776
just in case we needed
a raw space for some
tadpole investment.

24
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,111
( squeaking )

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,862
It's pretty raw.

26
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,447
Yeah, well,
the building
was in shambles

27
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,699
when we moved in
four years ago.

28
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,868
I'm sure last year's
quake didn't help.

29
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,912
Oh, God, that was crazy.

30
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,204
What?

31
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,248
- The earthquake.
- Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,127
- Where were you?
-<i> Work.</i>

33
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,881
- How about you?
- Work.

34
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,884
( chuckles )

35
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,012
How come you wanted
to meet here?

36
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,221
Oh, I didn't.

37
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,266
Cameron did.
Who knows?
Maybe...

38
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,644
she wanted
to see it again.

39
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,522
Mm-hmm.

40
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,234
By the way, I--

41
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,613
I didn't mean to invite Gordon
without talking to you.

42
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,824
- No, no, it's fine.
-<i> But I--</i>

43
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,242
I just read the paper
and I thought it was
something phenomenal,

44
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,245
and he's still running
the regional network we built,

45
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,498
so it was a no-brainer.

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,833
Makes perfect sense.

47
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,502
I'm so sorry about that.

48
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,546
No, really, it's fine.
I'm glad he's coming.

49
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,175
No, I-- the divorce.

50
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,426
Oh. Right.

51
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,512
( stammering )
That the two of you...

52
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,848
- Yeah.
-<i> ...got a divorce.</i>

53
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,270
Anyway...

54
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,565
- I really appreciate it.
-<i> It's no problem.</i>

55
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,275
I mean, it's just
a couple of days
for us to see

56
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,070
if there's even
a "there" there.

57
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,572
Yeah, of course.
( chuckles )

58
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,283
But... I'm excited.

59
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,786
I'm excited, too.

60
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,789
I'm really excited.
I--

61
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,791
Hey, sorry I'm late.

62
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,459
Is Cameron here?

63
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,755
Hey!

64
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,297
Hey!

65
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,968
How long has it been?
What was that, April?

66
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,303
Yeah, it was actually
two Aprils ago.

67
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,766
- Oh, jeez,
it's been that long?
- Yeah. Yeah.

68
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,309
- Well, you look good.
- So do you.

69
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,729
No, I mean it, you look--
you look good.

70
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,482
Thank you.

71
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,318
Hey, can I, uh...

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,238
( whispering )
Can you give us a sec?

73
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,489
Oh, of course.
Absolutely. Ahem.

74
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,325
Take all the time you...

75
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,704
- Gordon: Um, can I...?
- Donna: Yeah.

76
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,707
What's up?

77
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,586
Hey, uh, you're okay
that I'm here, right?

78
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,421
I just thought it was
an interesting concept,

79
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,506
given everything
that I've been working on.

80
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,342
And, you know, I haven't
seen Cameron in years.

81
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,804
But look, I don't--
this is your thing, okay?

82
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,722
I don't want to get in the way.
I don't want to interfere.

83
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,433
Gordon, it's fine.
I'm glad you're here.

84
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,353
Him? I'm not so sure.

85
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,730
Gordon:
<i>Yeah, I don't know.</i>

86
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,817
Part of the reason
we've been losing touch is...

87
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,279
Well, you should have
seen him the last time I did.

88
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,296
( sighs )

89
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,765
Hey, Joe.

90
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,814
Glad you're here.

91
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,863
( sighs )

92
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,699
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

93
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,436
Okay,
let's just hold off
for a second

94
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,898
on trying to talk about
what the World Wide Web is

95
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,816
and let's focus
on what it could do.

96
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>Okay, so,</i>
<i>here's some context.</i>

97
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,780
Let's say these
are the big boys,

98
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,407
the walled gardens
we're all familiar with.

99
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,119
You've got your Prodigy,
CompuServe, your
America Online--

100
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,495
America Online.

101
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,122
What kind of name
is that, anyways?

102
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,623
It sounds like
a Neil Diamond song.

103
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:00,128
♪ We're coming
to America... Online! ♪

104
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,420
<i>♪ We're com-- ♪</i>

105
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,465
<i>Okay, and then</i>
<i>we've got NSFNET.</i>

106
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,467
<i>Now, what Berners-Lee</i>
<i>is proposing in this paper</i>

107
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,389
is an application
that could run on this
network of networks.

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,433
And now, well,
NSFNET isn't for
commercial use yet,

109
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,476
and it isn't, you know,
sexy at all--

110
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,231
Hey, hey, come on.
NSFNET's dripping with sex.

111
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,359
The size and scope of that
would be formidable.

112
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,611
Still, it's completely separate
from the walled gardens,

113
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,529
where all the real money is.

114
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,490
Right now,
unifying all these networks
is essentially impossible.

115
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,492
There's different software,
different protocols,

116
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,537
different operating system
on different hardware.

117
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,417
But if something like
the World Wide Web expands,

118
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
what it ultimately
could do...

119
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,173
is this, right?

120
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,841
Well, no, not really.

121
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,885
No.

122
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,845
Sorry, I know I wasn't
exactly invited.

123
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,222
May I?

124
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,516
Thanks.

125
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,227
Okay, uh...

126
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,648
if I'm understanding this
correctly,

127
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,526
an implementation
would somehow

128
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,655
take these massive
online networks

129
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,907
and do this.

130
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,827
No, no,
you've got it
backwards.

131
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,163
Can you give me the thing?

132
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,458
Good.

133
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,502
Oh.

134
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,547
It's this, isn't it?

135
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,926
Remember,
the World Wide Web
and NSFNET,

136
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,429
or the Internet,
or whatever you want
to call it,

137
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,805
are two different things.

138
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,725
The Web runs on top
of the Internet.

139
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,728
It unifies everything.
It makes it one network.

140
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,648
And that's the incredible
potential behind something
like this.

141
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,486
Right now the online world
is the Tower of Babel.

142
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,862
This is the Rosetta Stone.

143
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,240
And it's running on
state-of-the-art NeXT
hardware and software.

144
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,326
( stammering )
That's my biggest problem.

145
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,453
NeXTSTEP is not a problem;
it's perfect.

146
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,579
Okay, yeah, but I run
a network that's not
just on a whiteboard.

147
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,831
All right,
here we go.

148
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,376
The NeXT is
a state-of-the-art system.

149
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,586
Designed by a disgraced
megalomaniac who loves
form over function.

150
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,589
No wonder you love the NeXT.
Look, if we're talking
about a network

151
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,302
that lives exclusively
on a ridiculously overpriced
machine

152
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,638
that doesn't really play nice
with anything else in the
technological landscape,

153
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
what we're really
looking at...

154
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,351
Oh. Well, please...

155
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,478
- Is this.
- ...be my guest.

156
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,522
A tiny little
desert island

157
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,690
that nobody
gives a shit about.

158
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,774
( chuckles )

159
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,777
Cameron?
What do you think?

160
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,615
Okay.

161
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,536
Um...

162
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,620
say we're all talking
the same way.

163
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,749
Cool.
What are we saying?

164
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,626
Are we just
shooting the breeze?
Are we playing games?

165
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,921
Are we looking
to get laid?

166
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,631
- Are we just
mindlessly shopping?
- That's an excellent point.

167
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,552
Content is paramount,
but this box is
the equivalent

168
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,637
of a 500,000-seat
state-of-the-art stadium,

169
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,559
and we build that,
we own that, we win.

170
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,394
But what's the point
of having a giant stadium

171
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,354
if you don't
have a kickass band
to play the venue?

172
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,399
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys,
the last thing that we need
to do right now

173
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,527
is hop in the car and
race out to the parking lot
of an empty stadium

174
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,819
before rock and roll
is even invented.

175
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,448
Hey, guys,
we are early.

176
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,657
And I'm not talking,
"Let's all just run down
to the IHOP

177
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,659
and grab
some silver dollar
pancakes" early.

178
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,912
We are years and years
early on this.

179
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,956
Trust me, okay?
This is what I do.

180
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,375
- I can't believe
you don't see this.
- Look, I agree.

181
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,669
Okay, the World Wide Web
could be the next best thing
since sliced bread.

182
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,423
But right now, it's a tiny
little academic petri dish

183
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,425
- running on a NeXT computer.
- In Europe.

184
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,553
- Yes, is Europe.
- Then what exactly
are we all doing here?

185
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:40,599
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Just-- let's not lose
the shared idea here.

186
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,685
There's a shared protocol.
This is a universal language.

187
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,397
- So it's Esperanto.
- What the heck is Esperanto?

188
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,690
It's a language for idiots
that failed.

189
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,693
Okay, you know what?
Let's-- why don't we
take a break for lunch?

190
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,695
It's, like, 10:30.

191
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,906
I mean, I could eat.
Sure.

192
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,920
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

193
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,884
Gordon went out
to get some pizza.

194
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,762
I figured maybe
it'd been a while since
you had that in Japan.

195
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,683
There's a Domino's
around the corner
from our apartment.

196
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,059
Oh.

197
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,814
Look, you came all this way.

198
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,108
It just seems like
you don't want to be here.

199
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,735
I said I'd listen.

200
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,656
<i>Donna, it's not like</i>
<i>this is the only thing</i>
<i>we're doing stateside.</i>

201
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,783
I have a meeting with Atari.
Tom has to meet with SEGA U.S.--

202
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,704
And you're doing Christmas
in Texas with his family,
I know.

203
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,914
Cam, we planned
this whole thing
around your travel.

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,752
In Vegas you said
this was a good idea.

205
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,717
It is a good idea.

206
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,177
But is also has severe
limitations in reality.

207
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,781
It's good
to see you, Joe.

208
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,452
Thanks.

209
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,957
It's good to see you
doing so well.

210
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,836
- As opposed to...?
- No, it's just--

211
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,716
Cameron said--
she said at COMDEX
you were--

212
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,135
you were having a bit
of a rough go of it,
that's all.

213
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,846
I'm sorry to hear
about what happened.

214
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:30,977
I never met Ryan,
but Cameron spoke
really highly of him.

215
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,023
It was difficult.

216
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,858
For a long time.

217
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,986
But I'm doing
so much better

218
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,781
since I've reconnected
with your wife.

219
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,216
- Donna: Hold on--
- ( groans )

220
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,177
I feel like we're
talking in circles.

221
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,887
What we're
really looking at is...

222
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,223
Ow!

223
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:13,186
You know, I'd like to
take things in a different
direction, if I could.

224
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,605
I'd like to talk about
what I learned in Paris.

225
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,939
Paris?

226
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,608
The whimsical art
of mime?

227
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,152
I went to the Hypertext
Conference a few weeks ago.

228
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,945
- The what conference?
- Hypertext.

229
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,907
Some pretty big names
were there-- Apple, Xerox.

230
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,035
- I'm surprised you
didn't hear about it.
- Yeah, me, too.

231
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,911
It was right after
I saw you in COMDEX.

232
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,039
Okay, so,
Hypertext Conference.

233
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,835
<i>Berners-Lee was there</i>
<i>and he was talking to</i>
<i>anyone who would listen.</i>

234
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,920
He handed out
the entire Web toolkit,
the transfer protocol,

235
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,174
the mark-up language,
the server software,
everything.

236
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,885
- Wait, you met him?
- You have all of that?

237
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,929
-<i> Yeah.</i>
- That would have been useful
to know this morning, maybe.

238
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,226
What's so interesting
about a programming language
like Hypertext--

239
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,936
It's not a programming language,
it's just a text that accesses
other texts.

240
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,232
Yes,
I'm actually talking about
HTML, the mark-up language.

241
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,942
What's so interesting
about it is its simplicity.

242
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,737
With a very basic
set of rules,

243
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,239
you can create pages
of information, objects,

244
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,242
and eventually media
when the bandwidth increases.

245
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,952
So, I cornered
the guys at CERN.

246
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,872
Sorry, what is CERN?

247
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,916
CERN.
European Organization
for Nuclear Research.

248
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,043
Oh, right, nuclear research.
Okay, I see the connection.

249
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,128
Sorry, I'm not hearing
the "C" word in it.

250
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,297
Nobody was paying
any attention to them.

251
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,926
In a way, they reminded me
of Gordon and Donna,
COMDEX '81.

252
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,636
- Oh, yeah.
- What, pathetic?

253
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,137
Devastatingly handsome?

254
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,973
Geniuses ahead of their time.

255
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,143
Berners-Lee handed out
guidebooks not only for HTML,

256
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,063
but HTTP,
the transfer protocol,

257
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,901
the call-and-response process
for moving information like this
across to potential networks.

258
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,318
Addressing protocol
is TCP/IP.

259
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,280
But HTTP is the abstraction
application layer protocol

260
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,909
that sits on top of TCP/IP
symbiotically, right, Tom?

261
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,994
With HTTP,
any machine can
become a client,

262
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,790
any machine
can become a server,
easily exchanging files.

263
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,165
No, files are FTP,

264
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,126
as in File Transfer
Protocol.

265
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,086
It's the one that has
"file" in the name of it.

266
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,924
What I am saying is
HTTP will eventually
supplant FTP.

267
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,760
What I'm saying is
it can do it all.

268
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,136
That's interesting.

269
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,012
Really? FTP?
That's interesting?

270
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,015
I'd like to get back
to an important point--

271
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,768
simplicity.

272
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,814
Both HTML and HTTP
are breathtakingly simple.

273
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,775
And this kind of elegance
allows for versatility,

274
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,777
it allows for universality--

275
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,946
Yes, a universal language,
like I said.

276
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,031
And the best part is,
the online catalogue viewer,

277
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,076
the transfer protocol,
the Web server software,

278
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,329
all of it is free.

279
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,372
I have a problem
with open source.

280
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,040
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

281
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,960
Do you know how many
bad video game pitches

282
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,837
I sit through
every single day?

283
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,214
The only way SEGA stays SEGA,
or Nintendo stays Nintendo,

284
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,177
is by not turning
those pitches into products.

285
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,012
- That's not--
- No, no.

286
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,097
Because open source

287
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,224
allows the lunatics
to run the asylum.

288
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,977
And every time--
every time--

289
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,061
you put well-made code
out into the world,

290
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,023
for people
to screw around with,

291
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,067
it causes major problems.

292
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,029
I mean,
just look what happened
to MacMillan Utility.

293
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,990
- What are you doing?
- What?

294
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,240
What happened
to MacMillan Utility?

295
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,994
Um, gee.
The release of their
source code online

296
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,078
vaporized millions
of shareholder dollars.

297
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,373
- And, long story short,
you're not around anymore.
- Okay!

298
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,085
- Or you could look at it
a different way.
- Uh-huh.

299
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,964
That with everyone
creating something
like the Web together,

300
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,132
some potentially amazing
things could happen.

301
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,176
One, it gets built
very fast.

302
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,387
Two, it becomes
huge in size.

303
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:38,224
Three, it's constantly
being edited and refined,

304
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,810
so it's improving
at a massive rate.

305
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,021
And four,
there's no overlord
controlling things.

306
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,147
Gordon:
<i>And what network</i>

307
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,359
is this giant, miraculous
nebula of collaboration
happening on?

308
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,237
You know as well as I do
that something like this could
change the face of the Internet.

309
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,407
The Internet
is not available
for commercial use.

310
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,036
Do you know how much money
I poured into lobbying, trying
to get deregulation through?

311
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,039
<i>Look, everybody wants this</i>
<i>and it's gonna happen</i>
<i>eventually.</i>

312
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,124
But we are early,
and it's all about timing.

313
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,169
If the timing's off, we're dead.
Timing's what killed Mutiny.

314
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,923
- Timing didn't kill Mutiny.
- I'm sorry...

315
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,299
The right people
make it the right time.

316
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,134
We can move this forward.

317
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,429
We can be the people
that make that future happen.

318
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,305
- Oh, my God.
- What?

319
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,308
I'm so sick of hearing
about the future.

320
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,146
What is that?
The future is just another
crappy version of the present.

321
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,858
It's some bribe
people offer you

322
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,985
to make you do what they want
instead of what you want.

323
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,155
This future
can be different.

324
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,544
( laughs )

325
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,338
Oh, Jesus, that should be
on your business card, Joe.

326
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,092
How many times
are you people
gonna fall for this?

327
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,929
You know,
I'm with Joe.

328
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,431
I can't believe
I'm saying that,
but I'm with Joe.

329
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,892
Of course you're with Joe.
You guys are the money people.

330
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,061
But it's me and Cameron
that actually have to do it.

331
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,354
- Look, nobody's doing
anything yet--
- Exactly.

332
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,109
( knocks on table )
Yeah, uh, guys,
it's been fun,

333
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,485
but I think we're
gonna hit the road.

334
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,278
Yeah, it's been,
uh, thorough.

335
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,156
Yeah, okay, we can call it
a day and reconvene
in the morning.

336
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,206
Well,
you know, maybe--

337
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,292
maybe tomorrow
will go better.

338
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,920
There's not gonna
be a tomorrow.

339
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,178
Hey, Cameron?

340
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,602
Come back tomorrow.

341
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,354
You flew halfway
across the world.

342
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,315
Donna's trying.
Just give her a chance.

343
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,942
Joe...

344
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,194
We got to see if there's
something here.

345
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,241
This is a mess, Joe.

346
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,036
It's just a mess.

347
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,332

348

Permission granted.

( turns off radio )

359
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,640
- Careful there
with them city shoes.
- Oh, sorry.

360
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,976
Might wanna wait a sec
till you get your sea legs
under you.

361
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,269
That's all right.

362
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,148
Huh.

363
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,779
Cool boat.

364
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,447
Hard to sail
in a driveway,
though.

365
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,200
Yup.

366
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,244
Well, I was beating
that slot

367
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,495
up between Angel Island
and Golden Gate last month,

368
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,498
and I didn't
heel fast enough
in the shallows

369
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,001
and I scratched the shit
out of my gelcoat.

370
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,462
( laughs )
Well, look at you!

371
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,547
The salty sailor.

372
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,341
Look at you.

373
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,679
Yeah, I know.
Just all grown up, right?

374
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,267
Well, hell, Cameron,
you were all grown up
before I ever met you.

375
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,185
- Beer?
- Yeah.

376
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,360
How'd it go this morning
with Donna?

377
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,321
How did you...?

378
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,531
Oh, Diane told me.
Whose driveway you
think you're in?

379
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,200
( can pops )

380
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,037
How is Diane?

381
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,081
She's good.
Good.

382
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,374
- Yeah? You guys
are still--
-<i> Yup.</i>

383
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,711
She still goes to work
and I stay retired.

384
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,548
Some weekends we sail
up to Sausalito or Tiburon.

385
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,426
Mostly go to the vineyard
if we got a couple
of extra days.

386
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,096
So Californian.

387
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,472
You take her to Texas yet?

388
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,516
I have, yeah.

389
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,686
Loved the rodeo.
Hated everything else.

390
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,689
- ( laughs )
- And I think she was just
being polite about the rodeo.

391
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,320
So, what's next?
Wedding bells?

392
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,404
Oh, sure, we've talked
about it, but, no.

393
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,325
Hell, between us
we got three kids

394
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:50,244
aged 35 to 14,
and that's enough.

395
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,664
Hey,
how's old Tommy Rendon?

396
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,541
- Uh--
- Kids on the radar
for you yet?

397
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,417
Ooh, no.

398
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,419
No, I--

399
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,755
Tom wants them, but...

400
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,799
No. If it was up to me,
we'd just get them

401
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,801
out of a vending machine
like everything else
in Japan.

402
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,096
- Like what?
- Uh... edible underwear.

403
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,806
- Come on!
- Yeah.

404
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,353
Plus, you know,
we're just so far
from home these days.

405
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,437
Although, what the hell
is home anymore?

406
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,606
Well, you're here now,
ain't ya?

407
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,110
Yeah, I'm here.

408
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:27,405
It only took me 24 hours
to realize that coming back
was a mistake.

409
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,331
Well, Donna says
it's a pretty hot idea.

410
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,416
Had to be
to get all you yokels
in the same room again.

411
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,337
It is.
It's just...

412
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,172
too many cooks.

413
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,301
Fool me twice, right?

414
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,472
Was that what happened?

415
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,807
You got fooled?

416
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,481
And also I just have
my own thing going on
that I'm busy with, so...

417
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,817
Yeah. Space Bike.

418
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,485
Yeah.

419
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,654
That's right, I got it.
I tried it out.

420
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,449
- Really?
- Well, look--

421
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,826
well,
it's not for me.

422
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,454
I am just amazed
that you even installed it.

423
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,874
I couldn't make
heads or tails of it,
to tell you the truth.

424
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,502
Well,
who's that little bastard
with the chainsaw?

425
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,796
Who's that one?

426
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,881
And then you got
the force field thing.

427
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,218
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
- Hell, it's like
you can't even win.

428
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,511
Nope.

429
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,513
No, you can't.

430
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,476
<i>( knocking )</i>

431
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,693
( stammering )
Sorry, I'm just here
for Haley's retainer.

432
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,821
She conveniently
forgot it again.

433
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,657
Yeah, I think
I saw it upstairs.

434
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,203
Oh, did you
want me to--
'cause I can go--

435
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,538
No, no, I can get it.
Come on in.

436
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,541
You know, I, uh...

437
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,544
still sleep up there
every night.

438
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:10,550
Hey, why don't
you get yourself
a glass of wine?

439
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,511
- Uh...
- You look like
you could use one.

440
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,185
You know where it is.

441
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,772
<i>( jazz music playing )</i>

442
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,569
The key to the bisque
is the Parmesan toast.

443
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,573
Four years ago,
the only Parmesan
you knew about was powdered.

444
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,368
Yeah, well,
I still got that, too.

445
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,371
Joanie eats it
by the spoonful.

446
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,746
Dirty little secret?

447
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,958
Teenage girls
are just as disgusting
as teenage boys.

448
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,295
Well, have you seen
this thing that she does
with the chocolate syrup?

449
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,297
And the milk?
It's atrocious.

450
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,590
- Oh, my God.
- Ugh.

451
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,550
Yeah,
speaking of cheese,

452
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,845
seems like Joe MacMillan
is back in rare form.

453
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,597
Yes, you've gone
and woken up the beast.

454
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,599
Well, it was my only way
to get to Cameron.

455
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,311
It was a long shot
and it didn't even work.
I had to go myself.

456
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,355
I don't know, maybe that
didn't even work either.

457
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:07,565
Yeah, well, what were you
gonna do all these years,
you know?

458
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,318
Between work
and the kids?

459
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,695
You know, get on a plane
and fly to Tokyo?

460
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,824
Well, I could pitch
a terrible video game
to Tom.

461
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,701
No, no, no.

462
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,620
You would never get
a meeting with someone
as important as Tom.

463
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,956
( both laughing )

464
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,751
- You know, if they do
come back tomorrow...
-<i> Yeah?</i>

465
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,920
I got this really
great idea for them.

466
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,796
-<i> Yeah, what's that?</i>
- For a video game.

467
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,426
Basically,
it's this conveyor belt

468
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,344
filled with
all these light bulbs,

469
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,513
but you have to shit on them
before they turn on.

470
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,557
Wait, I have
the perfect title.

471
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,682
- Mm-hmm.
- Ready?

472
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,269
"You're an Asshole."

473
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,821
Listen, I--

474
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,657
I apologize today
for calling you
a money person.

475
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,368
- Oh.
- I didn't mean it.

476
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,661
It just kind of
came out.

477
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,790
Oh. It's true, though.

478
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,959
These days.

479
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,962
I don't know,
maybe it was a mistake--

480
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,924
bringing everybody
back together and trying
to fix things.

481
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,595
Yeah, well,
if nobody shows up tomorrow,
I'm still interested.

482
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,598
Really?
It didn't seem
like that today.

483
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:24,393
What the--
all I said was,
you're early.

484
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:27,020
Okay, it's a disservice
to everyone if I didn't
say that.

485
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,356
<i>You know, and look,</i>
<i>I've--</i>

486
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,690
I've been wrong before.

487
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,650
I'll be the first
to admit that.

488
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,699
Can I ask you
a weird question?

489
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,659
Yeah, shoot.

490
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,873
Are you having just
a ton of sex these days?

491
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,669
Um...

492
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,716
I do all right.

493
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,719
How about you?

494
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,847
Yeah. Same.

495
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,559
Huh.

496
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,396
Uh, are you--

497
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,731
are you seeing anyone
right now?

498
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,694
Nope.

499
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,909
Good. 'Cause there's
something really weird
I want to ask you.

500
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,541
Would you be open to...

501
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,417
meeting someone?

502
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,045
Like, for a date?

503
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,423
I think you and this guy
would really hit it off.

504
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,757
What?

505
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,427
Yeah, there's this
really great guy I know.

506
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,138
He runs the computer lab
programs at Cal.

507
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,767
He's really nice
and I just thought,

508
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,729
you're free, he's free...

509
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:58,904
I don't know.

510
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,837
<i>( keyboard clicking )</i>

511
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,881
What are you doing?

512
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,092
I'm trying to finish
this presentation.

513
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,761
My battery died,
so I'm using yours.

514
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,767
Is that okay?

515
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,644
Yeah, it's fine.

516
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,899
How's Bos?

517
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,817
Yeah, he's good.

518
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,195
Oh, look...

519
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,531
I know today
wasn't fun for you,

520
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:46,785
so if you don't want
to come back tomorrow,
you don't have to.

521
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,829
- So, you're going?
- Well...

522
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,833
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Okay, well, I guess
I'm going, too.

523
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,586
Good.

524
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,798
Let me get in the shower.

525
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,806
<i>( door closes )</i>

526
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,979
<i>( shower running )</i>

527
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,789
<i>( marker squeaking )</i>

528
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,683
What's up with him?

529
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,892
He says he needs
five minutes.

530
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,520
Huh.

531
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:01,943
Wow. Man, did I wake up
with a headache
this morning.

532
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,572
<i>Hey, you left</i>
<i>kind of fast last night.</i>

533
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,157
I hope I didn't
say anything dumb.

534
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,160
You know,
about the date.

535
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,911
Gordon, it's fine.

536
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,998
Oh, great.
I mean, you know, good.

537
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,543
I'd love his number.

538
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,756
Unless, you know--
if it would be weird...

539
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,885
No.

540
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,179
No, I mean...

541
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,889
Yeah, no problem.

542
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,895
( door slams )

543
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:39,939
Oh, you're here.

544
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,943
( laughs )
You're all here.

545
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,904
Let's get started.

546
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,114
Berners-Lee wrote HTML
to view and edit the Web,

547
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,950
HTTP so that it
could talk to itself.

548
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,328
The chatter
could be cacophonous.

549
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,749
It could be
deafeningly silent.

550
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:02,003
Big picture--
what will the World
Wide Web become?

551
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,131
Short answer--
who knows?

552
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,966
Okay, so,
what's your point?

553
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,719
It's a waste of time
to try to figure out

554
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,679
what the Web will become.
We just don't know.

555
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,138
Because right now,
at the end of the day,

556
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,099
it's just an online
research catalogue

557
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,142
running on
NeXT computers

558
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,270
on a small network
in Europe.

559
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,979
So, you're saying
everything we've
talked about

560
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,732
since we got here
has been a waste of time?

561
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:24,860
I'm saying,
let's take a step back.

562
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:28,363
Literally, a step back.

563
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,115
Yeah, but what is this
on the board?

564
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,991
It's the code
for the Web browser.

565
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,368
And you wrote it all
on the whiteboard.

566
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,746
The online catalogue
of research?

567
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:39,708
Full of Norwegian dudes,
physics papers, and particle
diagrams and stuff?

568
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,293
Yeah, and we care
about this because why?

569
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,086
How did we all
get here today?

570
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,005
The choices we made,

571
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,675
the sheer force of our will,
something like that?

572
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,970
Here's another answer--
the winds of fate.

573
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,306
Random coincidence,
some unseen hand

574
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,016
just pushing us along.

575
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,977
Destiny.

576
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,980
How did we all
get here today?

577
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,069
We walked through
this door.

578
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,030
We don't have to build
a big white box or a stadium,

579
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,032
or invent rock and roll.

580
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,118
The moment we decide
what the Web is,
we've lost.

581
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,120
The moment we try
to tell people what
to do with it,

582
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,705
we've lost.

583
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,040
All we have to do

584
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,042
is build a door

585
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,044
and let them inside.

586
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,007
When I was five,

587
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,926
my mother took me
to the city.

588
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:34,137
And we went through
the Holland Tunnel,
and it was basic.

589
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,932
Concrete and steel.

590
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:40,101
But it was also my excitement
sitting in the backseat,

591
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,730
wondering when it was
going to be our turn
to emerge.

592
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,983
It was the explosion
of sunlight.

593
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,985
And when we exited
the tunnel,

594
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,989
all of Manhattan
was laid out before us.

595
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,073
And that was the best part
of the trip--

596
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:58,787
the amazing possibility
to be able to go anywhere

597
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,374
within something
that is magnificent
and never-ending.

598
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,627
This is the first
Web browser,

599
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,214
the rudimentary one
CERN built to view
and edit research.

600
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,175
I wrote it up here for you
to see how simple it is.

601
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:16,137
It takes up one whiteboard--
that's basic concrete and steel.

602
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,099
But we can take this
and we can build a door,

603
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,228
and we can be
the first ones to do it.

604
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,105
Because right now,
everyone else sees this as--

605
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,858
As an online
research catalogue.

606
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,275
Running on NeXT.

607
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,070
On a network in Europe.

608
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,741
And with this handful of code,
we can build the Holland Tunnel.

609
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,081
I don't see it.

610
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,127
I don't.
I mean, is it a door,
or is it a tunnel?

611
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,129
Or is it the Tower of Babel?

612
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,799
Or is it a Rosetta Stone,
or is it a stadium?

613
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,217
<i>You can't even decide</i>
<i>on a metaphor.</i>

614
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,095
And if the big idea here
is the browser,

615
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:00,933
and it's that easy
to build, then it's
not a big idea at all.

616
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,142
<i>It's a foregone</i>
<i>conclusion.</i>

617
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,812
And how can we win
at something when anyone--

618
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,065
anyone, including
Xerox and Apple

619
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,026
and all the actual
players from your little
Hypertext shindig,

620
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,152
can step in
at any moment
and crush us?

621
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,322
It will be
competitive,

622
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,158
because whoever owns the door
can charge admission.

623
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,411
But I sincerely believe
that with the people
in this room,

624
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,329
we have a chance
to build the best--

625
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,875
And what makes you think
you have all the people
in this room, Joe?

626
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,004
Come on, Cam,
let's go.

627
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,135
Come on, Cam.
Let's go.

628
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,896
Let's cut
the bullshit, Tom.

629
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,944
- Your problem isn't the idea.
- You're right, Joe.

630
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,071
Do you know
what my problem is?

631
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,948
I don't want to see
Cameron end up like Ryan.

632
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,116
Tom!

633
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,450
You say his name
one more time--

634
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,494
Ryan.
Do you remember him?

635
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,336
Well, hey, lucky for us,
wives don't get a vote.

636
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,879
You--

637
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,547
- Donna:<i> Oh, my God.</i>
- Tom!

638
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,181
( both panting )

639
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,560
<i>( wood cracking )</i>

640
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,187
( screams )

641
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,983
Joe!

642
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,233
Cameron:
Joe?!

643
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,196
Cameron:<i> Go!</i>

644
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,325
( groans )

645
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,206
<i>( woman speaking over P.A. )</i>

646
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,423
I know.
You're lucky
you're not dead.

647
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,177
Listen, Joe,
if we have any chance
in hell at this,

648
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,220
it's this kind
of personal bullshit

649
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,139
that's going to sink us
before we even start.

650
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,349
- Us?
- Yeah,
Cameron was right.

651
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,186
There's no such thing
as the future, hey?

652
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,146
All there is is now.

653
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,981
Maybe we're not early.

654
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:17,443
Maybe if we do it now,
we could be the first.

655
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:21,156
Regardless,
I am done waiting.

656
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,615
I can't let
this one get away.

657
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,117
Then don't.

658
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,457
Hey, he's fine.

659
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,212
He broke his wrist,
but he's okay.

660
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,638
What happened at COMDEX?

661
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,267
What?
Nothing.

662
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,315
Nothing happened.

663
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,031
I need some air.

664
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,412
( sighs )

665
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,563
You okay?

666
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,071
So easy to make Joe
the bad guy.

667
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,241
I mean...

668
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:49,535
making him the villain
takes the blame away,

669
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,456
but in everything
that's happened with him,

670
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,084
every single time...

671
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,003
I deserve some
of the blame, too.

672
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,055
And it's the same
with you, you know?

673
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,390
<i>Things fell apart.</i>

674
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,393
And you did
what you did,

675
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:19,024
but a lot of it
was my fault.

676
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,528
This is a really
cool idea.

677
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,490
Yeah,
I think so, too!

678
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,492
<i>And, look,</i>

679
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,078
if Joe is
a problem for you,

680
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,413
then he doesn't
have to be here.

681
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,540
We can get rid of him.

682
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:59,356
- We all patched in?
- Yeah, give it a try.

683
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,400
Yup, we're in,
good and speedy.

684
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,611
So, this is
your baby, huh?

685
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,822
Yeah, the little
network that could.

686
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,326
The DSP in this cube
is amazing.

687
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,661
Not only are
we getting clean 56K,

688
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,454
we can do this
at the same time.

689

694
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,468
Okay, so through NSFNET,
we can connect to CERN?

695
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,389
Yes, but we're gonna crawl
once we jump to Europe.

696
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,349
Why? The TAT-8
is fiber optic.

697
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,642
Yeah, but it's also buried
along the continental shelf

698
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,478
and constantly being
attacked by sharks.

699
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,648
Apparently, they can sense
the electrical radiation.

700
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,319
- I know.
- I love your mind.

701
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,407
You know,
seven grand a pop
is still insane,

702
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,409
and I don't know
why the cube is magnesium,

703
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,494
but I still appreciate
a good machine.

704
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,580
Yeah, well...

705
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,499
you know what they say,
software comes and goes...

706
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,501
Both:
But hardware is forever.

707
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,421
( Donna chuckles )

708
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,511
Okay. Do you have
everything?

709
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,181
- Yeah.
- Okay, this is good.
This is good.

710
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,766
Yeah, I'll knock out
my meetings today

711
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,227
and get in
a few days early,

712
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,853
I'll see the family,
get my bearings.

713
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:25,858
I think-- I think
it will help me
recalibrate.

714
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,526
Yeah, this is good.

715
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,196
Yeah,
and I'll pick you up
at the airport

716
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,448
day after tomorrow,
okay?

717
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,491
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

718
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,543
Wait, um...

719
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,671
I'm really sorry
that I didn't trust you.

720
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,843
I don't like
who I've been
this weekend.

721
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:58,308
It's been a weird
situation for me, too.

722
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,938
The other night
at the hotel,

723
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,566
I was reading your emails
on your laptop.

724
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,944
I can't believe
that I did that.

725
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,570
I just couldn't get
Joe out of my head,

726
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,657
and it was completely
irrational and I'm sorry.

727
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,539
I just-- don't want us
to lie to one another.

728
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,919
Because I love you.

729
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,758
I love you, too.

730
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,604
( sighs )

731
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,607
- Okay.
- Okay.

732
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,531
Joe...

733
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,536
Joe, I am...

734
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:06,667
Joe, I-- I just wanted
to apologize again
for yesterday.

735
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,628
The way I behaved...

736
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,797
I was way, way,
way out of line.

737
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,967
I was out of line, too.

738
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,598
Sorry.

739
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,484
- I love you.
- Love you.

740
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:36,989
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,823
I can't work with you.

747
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,701
It will never
be like it was.

748
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,869
It can't be.

749
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,586
But last night,
we-- we talked.

750
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:32,962
It was good.

751
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,797
I don't understand.

752
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:41,053
You know
why I wanted us
to meet here?

753
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:45,850
I just didn't want
to forget what had happened,

754
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,894
how painful that was.

755
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,022
Why?

756
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,066
And then I almost
did forget last night

757
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,403
when we talked,
when it felt good,

758
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,821
when I was with
my friend again.

759
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:04,619
And then
you reminded me

760
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,413
how easily you toss
people aside

761
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,081
when you feel like
they're in your way.

762
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,459
This about Joe.

763
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,879
No, this is about you.

765
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,758

to do was help you.
