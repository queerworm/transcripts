00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:23,273
Donna:
<i>On our network, users can</i>
<i>already have a conversation,</i>

3
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:27,068
send mail,
share information,
connect.

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,947
But this promises
to be far more.

5
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:33,074
This is the world's first
virtual handshake deal.

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,077
- A trade.
- A trade made
on your computer

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,288
that swaps tangible items
between users.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,082
You get everything
you want without ever
leaving your home.

9
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,084
You do everything
from your keyboard.

10
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,086
The only person
you'll ever see
is the mailman.

11
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,297
We're looking
for the right partner.

12
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,552
We've currently got
100,000 dedicated users
and we're growing,

13
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,263
so expansion like this
requires another level
of funding.

14
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,683
We need to add
more bodies to
the coding team,

15
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,019
- enhance our interface,
and purchase--
- How much?

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,272
In the back of our
prospectus you'll find
a detailed breakdown of--

17
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,108
I saw the number.
I'd just like to hear it
said out loud.

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,152
( chuckles )

19
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,112
$1.4 million.

20
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,281
Donna:
<i>Our base is loyal</i>

21
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,325
<i>and costs only rise</i>
<i>in success.</i>

22
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:19,914
So our churn rate, page 25,
and our burn rate, 26,

23
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,957
are practically
nonexistent.

24
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,126
<i>In its first year alone,</i>
<i>we believe Mutiny Exchange</i>

25
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,923
will see upwards
of a half a million deals.

26
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,551
Today, we're offering you
the opportunity to make
the first one.

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,807
Told you, Mac.

28
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,935
You were right.
First-rate.

29
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:45,188
( clears throat )
Best I've heard in a while.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,149
Why am I one
of the last to hear it?

31
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:53,154
Because we've been
assessing the VC
landscape--

32
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,741
I've heard you've been
up and down Sand Hill Road
with this.

33
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,160
Well, we're new in town.
We're hungry and we want
to move fast.

34
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,662
Okay, I get that.

35
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:04,165
Our portfolio
is 27 companies deep
as of Q2 '86.

36
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,418
We are in on 3Com
and Cisco and--

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,212
shit, Tim, that reminds me,
I gotta call Sandy back.

38
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,215
One of your best
was Oracle.

39
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,177
IPO'd last month,
two million shares,
$55 a pop.

40
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,847
Sure did.
Larry made us $55 million.

41
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,641
Are you telling me
you could do the same?

42
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,436
Well, lend us
1.4 of that 55
and we'll show you.

43
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,191
We've been burned
in the past.

44
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,069
We will throw
our hat in the ring

45
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,362
only to have
our offer shot up
and down the Valley.

46
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,700
I don't like games
and I don't want to be
used as a stalking horse.

47
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,412
<i>If we were to move on this</i>
<i>and give you a term sheet,</i>

48
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,666
we'd want a no-shop
in return.

49
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,335
We wouldn't be here
if we weren't ready
to do business.

50
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,900
Excuse me,
Mr. MacMillan, sir.

51
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,444
<i>If I can have</i>
<i>a moment of your time.</i>

52
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,447
Sir.

53
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,410
3,000 to one.

54
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,246
Those are the odds
of getting hit by lightning
in your lifetime.

55
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,249
They're also the odds
of getting hit by
a computer virus.

56
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,294
But in, like, five years,
those odds are gonna
go way up.

57
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,296
For-- for viruses,
not lightning.

58
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,256
But that's why your work
is so critical.

59
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,425
Because people
are focused on today

60
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,427
and you're already
into tomorrow.

61
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,514
- Do you have a name?
- Yeah, of course.
It's Ryan.

62
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,932
Ryan Ray.

63
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,433
Ryan, it's 52 degrees
in that water.

64
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,269
I'm gonna get into
some dry clothes.

65
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,980
I work for Mutiny

66
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,273
with Cameron Howe
and Gordon Clark.

67
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:56,987
MacMillan Utility
is basically Sonaris
virus with lipstick.

68
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,281
And only two KLOCs
out of 452 separate it.

69
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,283
And those two KLOCs
completely changed

70
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,661
the functionality
and purpose of
the entire program.

71
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,496
It's completely amazing.

72
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:10,125
And, you know,
I pulled it apart
in less than a day.

73
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,335
Trying
to impress me, Ryan?

74
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,172
Uh, yeah, that was
sort of the point.

75
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,007
Can I ask you a question?

76
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,550
Yeah, sure, anything.

77
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,389
The Bay Area has 13 breaks
worth surfing.

78
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,392
How many did you go to
before you found me?

79
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,270
Honestly? Four.

80
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,314
11.

81
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,275
( engine starts )

82
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,749
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

83
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,529
12 days and the same old
song and dance.

He's still working on Mac.

85
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,534
Okay, so then Tim's
either full of shit
or he's got no juice.

86
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,204
Harpor was our last shot.

87
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:33,000
We've got a couple
more meetings, but they're
smaller boutique firms.

88
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,294
If we get denied first-round
funding across the board,

89
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,256
then it'll be impossible
to get that stink off
no matter what we do next.

90
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,259
I don't get it.
The idea is great.

91
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,678
The prospectus kicks ass
every meeting we've gone into.

92
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,265
14 VC firms and nobody's
stepped up, why?

93
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,391
Well, these clowns
love to make you wait.

94
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,560
They think it gives them
some kind of an allure.

95
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,314
But it just takes one of them
to ask you to the dance.

96
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,774
God, I love how even
the metaphors in this
business are sexist.

97
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,069
We can hit them
with all the data and
all the hard facts we want,

98
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,905
but the minute we walk in there,
they still see just one thing.

99
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,074
You guys can't take
this stuff so personally.

100
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,618
-<i> But this company is us.</i>
- Well, just give it time.

101
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,788
Bos, we haven't
heard back from a single
investor in weeks.

102
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,665
Bosworth:
<i>What do you</i>
<i>want me to say?</i>

103
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,336
Look, the fact that
you two are women I'm sure
doesn't help matters.

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,217
I think I liked it better
when you were lying to us.

105
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:27,888
These smiling VCs
out here love to grin
and screw you, don't they?

106
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,682
At least in Texas
they stab you in the front.

107
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,226
-<i> ( knocks )</i>
- What?

108
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,103
Tim Hankel
from Harpor Capital.

109

( clears throat )

110
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,529
Tim, hey, have you
heard from Mac yet

111
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,116
or do I have to keep
calling you until you take out
a restraining order on me?

112
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,327
- ( chuckles )
- Tim:<i> Ha, I know, I know.</i>

113
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,330
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>it's taking so long,</i>
<i>but it was worth it.</i>

114
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,165
<i>We are a go.</i>

115
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,752
<i>I told you I'd get Mac on board</i>
<i>and I'm a man of my word.</i>

116
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,380
<i>He just got back from Aspen,</i>
<i>but he's off to LA tomorrow,</i>

117
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,132
<i>so he wants something</i>
<i>in place before he leaves.</i>

118
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,425
<i>You two free to talk</i>
<i>first steps tonight?</i>

119
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,848
Yes, let me

Yep.

That's three
already this month.

137
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,324
Dogget:
Is that intimidating?
Getting grilled

138
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,910
with Joe MacMillan
staring at you with
those eyes of his?

139
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,247
No, he's not there.
It's just me and
the lawyers.

140
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,416
More boring than brutal.

141
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,919
You know, they ask you
the same stupid questions

142
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,546
over and over,
hoping you'll slip up.

143
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,716
Give anything if it was
to be over so I can collect
the damn check already.

144
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,429
That'd be sweet.
Better brush the nacho dust
off your tie first.

146
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,433
Bosworth:
Okay, gentlemen.

147
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:40,228
Gentlemen, it's that time
of the week again.

148
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,523
- ( coders groan )
- Bosworth:<i> I know.</i>
<i>I love it, too.</i>

149
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,569
All right, I need
some clarification
on your supply needs

150
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,366
because, well,
there was a bit
of confusion last time.

151
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,035
<i>After we made the deal</i>
<i>with Hayes for the 2400s,</i>

152
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,496
<i>I got on the phone with</i>
<i>the fella from Fulfillment</i>

153
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,042
and he asked
if I wanted those
additional RS-232 cables

154
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,253
to which I,
per your wise
instruction, reply,

155
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,589
"No, sir, those are
not the droids that
I'm looking for."

156

( laughing )

157
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,470
So after he got done
laughing his ass off,

158
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,264
he explained that someone
must be messing with me.

159
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,975
Well done, boys.
I appreciate it.

160
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,601
Moving on.

161
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,980
All right, I need an update
on the graphics extension

162
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,982

y'all are working on

163
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:30,195

interface with existing
neighborhood graphics.

164
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,280
We have the sprite engine
mostly working,

165
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,200
but we still have a problem
with the scan line rendering.

166
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,993
Yeah, we're getting
a tile map cache miss,

167
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,619
so we're losing
synchronization
on the palette.

168
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,414
Okay, well, hold it.

169
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,623
So is the thing
with the palette
connected to the--

170
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,085
- ( pounds table )
As I said last time...
- Hey.

171
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,046
...we should be using
a blitter on a bitmap
so we can do it in software

172
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,091
and not freeze out devices
that don't have support
for hardware sprites.

173
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,343
Okay, slow down.
Slow down. Are we
in agreement here?

174
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,262
You're talking
about a whole new
change of course.

175
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,514
Doesn't matter.
Just scribble down
what we say,

176
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,640
give it to Cameron,
she'll understand what
we're talking about

177
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,309
and stop wasting
our time.

178
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,322
You know, I'm not sure
I got all that.

179
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,575
See, sometimes
I'm a bit slow.

180
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,078
Need things repeated
to me twice.

181
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,663
Why don't you stand up
and say that to my face?

182
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,626
You want to stand
right up and repeat
that to my face, son?

183
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,671
Hey, Bos.
Bos, you got a sec?

184
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,632
Real quick.
Bos.

185
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,890
Hey, listen, look, I know
you hate these meetings.

186
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,684
Oh, yeah, compared
to a prostate exam, no,
I positively love them.

187
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,686
- Look, this is not
my forte, Gordon.
- I understand.

188
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,730
The girls got
their plates full,
but Cameron says,

189
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,567
- "Bos, you want to come in"--
- Okay, okay, let me run them.

190
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,569
Okay? I speak
their language,

191
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,572
so they can't mess with me
and it could be more efficient.

192
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,491
Look, I'm not trying
to step on your toes--

193
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,659
Wake me
if there's a problem.

194
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,173
- Gordon.
- Yeah?

195
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:17,093
Um, thanks for
having my back.

196
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,970
Yeah, sure.

197
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,679
Listen...

198
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,810
I know what it's like
to be the smartest
guy in the room

199
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,148
and I also know it's a waste
of time trying to prove it.

200
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,900
Let your work
speak for itself

201
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,611
and be open
to the possibility

202
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,530
that people that
don't understand you,

203
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,115
they're not necessarily
trying to get in your way.

204
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,619
How can I if no one
can see the work?

205
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,745
I have ideas.

206
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,207
Real ideas.

207
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,751
They might sound
theoretical,

208
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,337
but I can make
them happen.

209
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,674
I told Cameron and Donna,
but they didn't even listen.

210
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,302
They just had Bos
pay me to shut up.

211
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,432
What ideas?

212
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,766
<i>"Bonna Rue" playing</i>

213
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,602
Mac:
On the way back
to the lodge,

214
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,564
Dawkins says,
"Let's make snow angels."

215
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,192
He lies down in the snow,
sticks out his arms,

216
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,071
and then passes out
just drunk as a skunk.

217
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,948
We called him Snow Jesus
the rest of the trip.

218
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,493
<i>( laughter )</i>

219
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,162
Okay, glad you had
a good ski thing.

220
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,583
Tim said that you wanted
to discuss first steps.

221
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,710
- I want to level with you.
- Donna:<i> Okay.</i>

222
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,795
- I'm sure you heard about
AT&amp;T axing Viewtron.
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,174
Some folks in town
think that is the end
of online newspapers,

224
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,844
but I have got some insight
into what's really going on
over at Knight Ridder

225
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:46,349
and I think that
just real opportunity
is being vacated there.

226
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,394
Which means?

227
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,979
Which means I'm gonna
go in big on videotex.

228
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,274
It's gonna tie up
more of our capital,

229
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,694
which also means
I don't think I can do 1.4.

230
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,071
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

231
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,823
- Oh.
- Oh, so...

232
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,409
it's a pass, then.

233
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,202
No, hold on.
It's not that
black and white.

234
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,621
We still want you
in the portfolio.

235
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,457
Your concept has
just great potential.

236
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,626
And, honestly,
the two of you,

237
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,502
- really sharp.
- Mm-hmm.

238
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,297
- Oh, thank you, but--
- Tim, you want to walk
them through it?

239
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,507
Yeah, okay,
so we can't do 1.4,

240
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,677
but what if we aim
for a leaner, meaner
Mutiny Exchange?

241
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,845
- You mean cheaper?
- No, smarter.

242
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,681
Doing more with less.

243
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,642
Like, for instance,
I think you can make do

244
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,144
with half as many
new hires as you have
laid out in the prospectus.

245
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,522
Yeah, and I think you can skip
the server computer upgrades,
at least initially.

246
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,108
Less risk, more reward.
It's a surefire way to go.

247
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,487
- Does that sound good?
- You know, let's just
hold off on the--

248
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,781
just for a second.

249
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,743
What I'm hearing is that
you want to lock us up

250
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,245
by investing a fraction
of what we're asking.

251
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,289
No, you're misinterpreting
what we're saying.

252
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,667
Oracle was the same deal.
Investment grew over time.

253
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,710
It's how things
get done out here.

254
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,588
Okay, so then how much money
are you offering us?

255
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,132
Mac:
<i>That is a number that we are</i>
<i>still trying to figure out.</i>

256
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,593
That's what
this was all about,
getting the ball rolling,

257
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,262
assuming that
you are amenable.

258
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,598
Well, we've put a lot
of thought into this

259
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,558
and there really
isn't much fat.

260
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,727
Yeah, you know,
there's no fat.

261
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,147
Well, ahem, you two
are new to the Valley

262
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,609
and I know you want
everything that you want
right away.

263
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,946
But out here, funding
is like doubles tennis.

264
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:28,702
- Mm-hmm.
- You got to know who
you're partnering with.

265
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,371
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you trust each other?

266
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,914
Do you play well
together?

267
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,584
Is it a good fit?

268
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,923
And that's not easy to know
after just one meeting

269
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,925
or even over dinner.

270
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,011
Yeah, listen,

271
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,390
we both know that success
in this industry comes
down to timing.

272
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,600
We have to be first
to market,

273
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,310
and without
sufficient funding,

274
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,396
our ability to do so
is seriously compromised.

275
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,605
And then we all lose.

276
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,191
I hear that,
but let's just...

277
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,943
( exhales )
just take a beat,

278
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,822
enjoy our meal,
see how the evening goes.

279
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,616
And then maybe I will
look into cutting you

280
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,910
a good-faith check
in the morning.
( chuckles )

281
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,584
I'm gonna pop out
for a call.

282
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,836
Just think it over.

283
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,261
I thought this
was a serious meeting.

284
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,055
- We are serious.
- What the hell was that?

285
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,684
It was an opportunity
for you guys to jump to
the front of the line.

286
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,728
Isn't that what you wanted?

287
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,649
Wow, okay, my apologies
if he misread things.

288
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,777
What could he have
possibly misread?

289
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,986
We have been nothing
but professional.

290
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,989
Are you kidding?
You guys call every day
for two weeks.

291
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,992
You drop everything
the night he calls
you to dinner.

292
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,579
And I'm sorry,
but nobody wears
that shade of lipstick

293
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,956
unless they
have come to play.

294
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,671
We're going.

295
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,927
No, you know what?
I'm going to tell him---

Joe:
<i>I want our discs</i>
<i>available beyond stores</i>

298
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,943
aimed at the computer crowd.

299
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,403
What's the point
of making something free
if no one can find it?

300
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,324
<i>Listen, be creative.</i>
<i>We're after first-time</i>
<i>PC users.</i>

301
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,327
<i>We should be</i>
<i>in grocery stores,</i>
<i>video stores, malls.</i>

302
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,329
We want to be
everywhere they are.

303
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,038
I want people
sick of seeing us

304
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,750
the same way I'm sick
of seeing you. Go.

<i>( door opens )</i>

308
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,289
- Are you Ryan Ray?
- Yeah.

309
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,500
Mr. MacMillan
will see you.

310
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,474
Every day this week
at 9:00 A.M.,

311
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,060
I've got a meeting
scheduled with Ryan Ray.

312
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,107
How long
did this take you?

313
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,027
Two hours.

314
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,362
<i>Okay, you're here.</i>

315
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,990
You've gone to a lot
of trouble to be here.

316
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,533
You've got three minutes.

317
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,328
Okay, then I'll cut
to the chase.

318
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,831
I want to work
at MacMillan Utility.

319
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,000
Want is very different
than need.

320
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,294
- Okay, I need
to work here.
-<i> Why?</i>

321
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,923
Because I'm fascinated
by antivirus software.

322
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,424
I'm not.
It bores me.

323
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,134
<i>Okay, um, because you set</i>
<i>the gold standard</i>

324
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,178
and you're looking
for your next challenge.

325
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,306
- I am, too.
- What makes you think you
know what I'm looking for?

326
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,141
I don't.

327
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,436
Yeah, that was presumptuous.
Only you know that.

328
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,355
What makes you think
I know what I'm looking for?

329
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:30,317
Because you're brilliant.
Wait, don't you?

330
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,071
<i>I mean, you don't</i>
<i>have to answer that.</i>

331
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,448
Why would you? I
just--

332
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,701
Whatever you
want to do next,
I'm in.

333
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,166
This is a test
and that was the wrong
answer, right?

334
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,924
This is a test and that
was the right answer?

335
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,385
I don't know what
you want me to say.

336
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,346
Whatever you actually
came here to say.

337
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,641
I can't imagine
that I've heard it yet.

338
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,977
<i>I feel like you're judging me.</i>
<i>It doesn't matter what I say.</i>

339
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,687
Even when you're not talking,
you seem disappointed.

340
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,606
You could ask me
what color the sky is

341
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,484
and I would say blue
and somehow I'd be wrong.

342
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,820
You would be.
It's overcast.

343
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,283
You plucked Gordon Clark
out of obscurity, right?

344
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,868
<i>He was nothing</i>
<i>before he met you.</i>

345
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,412
<i>I know him.</i>
<i>I work with him.</i>

346
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,123
So you keep saying.

347
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,457
I'm just as good as he is

348
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,877
and a hard worker
with initiative.

349
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,631
I learned you surfed,
so I woke up at 5:00
in the morning

350
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:37,593
for two weeks straight
and cased 11 beaches
to find you.

351
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,720
I hacked
a security company.

352
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,264
Your security company.

353
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,642
Doesn't any
of that prove that...

354
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,857
Okay, this is gonna
sound weird

355
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,692
<i>and I feel ridiculous</i>
<i>even saying this,</i>

356
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,236
but I know
that something's coming.

357
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,238
Something big.

358
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,242
<i>Like a train and all I want</i>
<i>is to jump on board.</i>

359
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,246
But it's getting faster
and faster and I'm terrified
that I'm gonna miss it.

360
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,458
<i>That night--</i>
<i>that night that you</i>
<i>spoke at the Castro,</i>

361
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,669
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>finally,</i>

362
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,755
<i>somebody sees</i>
<i>the world the way I do.</i>

363
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,592
And I knew right then
that this was my ticket
on that train.

364
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,888
I don't know what else
to tell you, man.

365
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,558
I just want
to work with you--
need to work with you.

366
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,186
On anything.

367
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,562
Please.

368
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,314
<i>Nobody listens to me.</i>

369
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,567
<i>No one takes me</i>
<i>seriously.</i>

370
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,195
I don't want to get
left behind.

371
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,251
Your three minutes
are up.

372
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,266
You look great.

373
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,394
<i>( door opens )</i>

374
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,312
Mrs. Clark,
Miss Howe.

375
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,065
Follow me.

376
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,615
Thank you.

377
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,491
We're just going
right down there.

378
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,619
Oh.

379
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,790
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

380
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,750
- Okay.
- Should we sit?

381
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,627
- Hello.
- Hi.

382
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,714
- Oh, Diane.
- Donna, hi.

383
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,800
Oh, my God,
I feel so stupid.

384
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,928
I had no idea
you were the Gould
in Amador Gould Gilson.

385
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,805
Small world.
Smaller valley.

386
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,765
But this is great.
Now we don't have
to waste time

387
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,433
exchanging pleasantries
or small talk.

388
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,644
- Except for...
- Yes, Cameron Howe.

389
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,273
Oh, Diane is a mom
at Joanie's school.

390
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,941
Okay.

391
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,985
Oh, wait, the mom
of the girl that
Joanie beat up?

392
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,654
I heard it was
more of a draw.

393
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,739
( laughs )

394
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,366
This is Elias Amador.
He'll be joining us.

395
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,577
Hello.

396
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,371
Full disclosure,
I haven't had time
to read this,

397
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,667
but love how you've
grown Mutiny and can't wait
to hear what you've got.

398
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,588
I can't tell you
what a nice change
this is,

399
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,341
pitching to
a familiar face
and Elias.

400
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,346
- Shall we just...?
- Whenever you're ready.

401
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,394
Imagine a place
you could go

402
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,024
where whatever your passion,
whatever you collect or love,

403
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,860
it's available to you
at the push of a button.

404
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,612
A rare Spider-Man comic,
a bootleg Dylan concert,

405
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:48,117
<i>first edition Fitzgerald,</i>
<i>even a hard-to-find part</i>
<i>for your Apple II.</i>

406
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,829
- It's all there.
- You don't have to scour
the local flea market.

407
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,664
On the chance that
they might have it.

408
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,834
- Or hit every garage sale.
- On the chance that they
might have it.

409
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,045
Or even leave your home.

410
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,421
Cameron:
<i>Because you're connecting</i>
<i>to people across the country</i>

411
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,716
- who are all part of--
- Let me stop you right there.

412
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,427
<i>Everything you're saying</i>
<i>sounds terrific, but just</i>
<i>to cut to the chase,</i>

413
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,431
you're shifting your core
business from chat
to trade, yes?

414
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,059
No, not shifting.
We're expanding.

415
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,936
And it isn't the first time.
We started with games.

416
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,898
We noticed that our users
were chatting during games,

417
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,151
so we moved into chat
and our base jumped
exponentially.

418
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,821
And then we noticed
that our users were
trading during chat,

419
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:29,449
so we go where the user
behavior takes us.

420
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,536
It's our business model
and it's proven to be
highly effective.

421
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,538
Right, just to be clear,
though,

422
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,542
your expansion is predicated
on the idea of swapping goods
through a BBS?

423
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,711
- Yes.
- Yes, exactly.

424
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,547
Elias, anything
you'd like to ask?

425
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,133
I'm good.
Thank you.

426
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,177
Okay, thank you
for coming in.

427
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,971
Our pleasure.
We'll look forward to--

428
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,681
But I'm afraid
it's a pass.

429
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,183
I'm sor--
I don't understand.

430
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,185
Don't you want to at least
look at the numbers?

431
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,312
No, sorry.

432
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:05,319
Okay, well, thank you
for your time.

433
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,904
Thank you.

434
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,240
- Thank you for coming in.
- Yeah.

435
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,290
Unbelievable.

436
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,499
So much for sisters
doing it for themselves.

437
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:23,003
Jesus, they say the next best
thing to a yes is a quick no.

438
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,546
You can't get
much quicker than that.

439
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,506
Yeah, well, that was
too goddamn quick.

440
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,509
It's like she made up
her mind when she saw
it was me.

441
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,978
No, she didn't.

442
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,946
Aaron:
<i>Mr. Clark, you created</i>
<i>the Sonaris virus</i>

443
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,531
<i>that took down WestNet,</i>
<i>yes?</i>

444
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,534
No, I created a fetch program
to detect network size.

445
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,536
Due to an error,
it self-propagated.

446
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,747
I had nothing to do
with it infecting WestNet.

447
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,750
But it's your contention
that the MacMillan
antivirus software

448
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,710
is a variation
of this fetch program?

449
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,754
No, no, it's not
a variation.

450
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,799
Only two kilo lines of code
out of 452 were changed.

451
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,552
I know this because
I changed them myself and
hand-delivered it to Joe.

452
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,805
Yes, he may have added
some bells and whistles
since then,

453
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,766
but, come on,
he's not fooling anyone.

454
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,602
Aaron:
<i>When you say you</i>
<i>hand-delivered the program,</i>

455
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,813
<i>was that a gift</i>
<i>or a transaction?</i>

456
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,566
Aren't gifts a type
of transaction?

457
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,194
<i>You give a gift</i>
<i>to a friend.</i>

458
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,155
You have a transaction
with a business partner.

459
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:35,326
Okay, did you
just make that up
or is that a real thing?

460
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:41,081
Mr. Clark, at what
address did you live

461
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,583
on the date
of July 30, 1985?

462
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,587
Same address that I lived at
on February 17, 1985,

463
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,591
and January 27, 1985,
and May 1, 1985,

464
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,760
and every other date
that you've asked me about.

465
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,639
<i>Could you please</i>
<i>repeat the address?</i>

466
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,894
2824 DePue Drive,
Richardson, Texas.

467
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,605
<i>And did Mr. MacMillan</i>
<i>visit you</i>

468
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,067
<i>at your residence</i>
<i>at 2824 DePue Drive</i>

469
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,694
<i>on July 30, 1985?</i>

470
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,612
Yes.

471
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,615
<i>And how did he know that</i>
<i>you lived at said address?</i>

472
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,493
Because he had
been there before.

473
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,619
And why had he
been there before?

474
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,123
Because we were
business partners.

475
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,625
And friends?

476
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,878
Yeah, and friends.

477
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,884
So, when he visited you
on July 30, 1985,

478
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,845
at 2824 DePue Drive,

479
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:41,100
was that as a business
partner or a friend?

480
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,018
I don't know.

481
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,728
You'd have to ask him.

482
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,646
From your perspective.

483
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,566
From my perspective?

484
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,735
From my perspective,
Joe MacMillan does things
for one reason

485
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,488
and one reason only
and th--

486
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,533
Hey, excuse me,
we are right--

487
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:01,703
We had an agreement
to keep these depositions
private, Mr. MacMillan.

488
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,663
Please,
finish that thought.

489
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,960
Because he's a selfish,
self-loathing, self-serving
piece of shit.

490
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,716
I'm prepared to offer
you 50% of my stake
in the company.

491
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,676
Aaron:
<i>Mr. MacMillan,</i>
<i>this is completely--</i>

492
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,929
Joe:
<i>It's an even split.</i>
<i>I've got one condition.</i>

493
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,307
I want you to come
run it with me.

494
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,142
<i>Mr. MacMillan,</i>
<i>I'd really prefer that you</i>
<i>run something like this--</i>

495
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,977
Aaron, it's fine.

496
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,692
60%.

497
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,700
70%.

498
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,702
Come be my partner

499
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,831
and 70% of the company
is yours.

500
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,003
Mr. Clark, my professional
advice would be to seriously
consider--

501
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,880
I'd like to state
for the record that this
is not a legitimate offer.

502
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,217
It's fully legitimate.
I'll sign anything you put
in front of me.

503
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,929
Just say the word, Gordon.

504
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,060
I don't want to work
with you, Joe.

505
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,242
I think we now know what
this lawsuit is really about.

506
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,761
Aaron:
<i>Returning to the date</i>
<i>of July 30, 1985,</i>

507
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,390
<i>Mr. Clark, from your</i>
<i>perspective,</i>

508
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,227
<i>did Joe MacMillan</i>
<i>come to your residence</i>

509
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,771
<i>at 2824 DePue Drive</i>

510
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,859
<i>as a business partner</i>
<i>or a friend?</i>

511
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,989
I have no idea.

512
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,285
Joanie:
<i>What are we looking</i>
<i>for anyway?</i>

513
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,663
A mistake.

514
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,623
<i>My parents are up</i>
<i>in their bedroom</i>

515
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,083
<i>wrapping presents</i>
<i>for my birthday party.</i>

516
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,752
Like I don't know exactly
what they're doing.

517
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,800
<i>They still think</i>
<i>of me as little.</i>

518
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,802
Well, it's 'cause
they've never seen you

519
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,804
throw back a whiskey
and smoke a cigar
like I have.

520
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,306
I never did that!

521
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,267
( chuckles )

522
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,811
You're joking.

523
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,732
I wish I didn't have
to have a birthday party.

524
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,108
I don't believe
in birthday parties.

525
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,817
You can do that?

526
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,737
Yeah, it's your birthday.
You can do whatever you want.

527
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,947
( sighs )

528
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,665
Did you find the mistake?

529
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,166
No.

530
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,716
So who's coming
to this stupid party

531
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,802
your parents are making you
throw that you don't really
want to have anyway?

532
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,728
Okay, let's take it
outside, okay?

533
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,855
All right,
everybody, let's move it
on out to the backyard.

534
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,942
Slip'N Slide is out there.
Let's go, let's go.

535
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,860
Everybody out.
Move it.

536
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,863
Get out of here.
Go. Go.

537
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,157
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

538
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:29,869
Joanie, you've got
another guest to greet.

539
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,789
Joanie!

540
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,291
Oh, thank goodness.
( laughs )

541
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,917
Come on in.

542
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,878
Jennifer knew the name
of the street, but not
the address.

543
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,340
So we parked, prayed,
and followed the screams.

544
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,342
Donna:
<i>I wasn't expecting you.</i>

545
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,052
Diane:<i> Joanie invited</i>
<i>Jennifer and seeing as how</i>
<i>I am her chauffeur,</i>

546
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,888
we're part
of a package deal.
Where should I put this?

547
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,850
You know what?
The girls and the gift
table are all out back.

548
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,149
I cannot believe
she's here.

549
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,777
I guess Joanie patched
things up with Jennifer.

550
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:05,155
God, I'm telling you,
girls at this age,
it's crazy.

551
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,365
One day
they're mortal enemies,

552
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,158
the next day
they're best friends.

553
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,995
What?

554
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,913
Well, I mean,
she's here.

555
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,917
Should we take
advantage of it?

556
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,796
No, I don't want to face
that humiliation again.

557
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,798
<i>"I Need That Record" playing</i>

558
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,384
Daddy, Daddy!
Watch me!

559
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,101
Hey, Ryan,
you made it.

560
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,937
Yeah.
I can't stay long.

561
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,400
- Not that it's not
a nice party.
- Thanks.

562
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,820
I wouldn't know; I've never
been to a 10-year-old's
birthday party.

563
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:47,947
Well, not since
I was 10.

564
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,325
What do grown-ups do
at these things?

565
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,244
Oh, well, drink.

566
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,496
Hey, so--

567
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,877
so listen,
we're not supposed
to be talking shop today,

568
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,338
but I had a few ideas
on how to move your
chat idea forward.

569
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,964
Oh, yeah?
Really? How?

570
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,133
Yeah, well,
all right, listen.

571
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,011
A few years back,
CompuServe had this
CB Simulator

572
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,971
that I was totally
obsessed with.

573
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,015
We could start with that
as a rudimentary template.

574
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,142
My idea
is way more advanced
than CompuServe.

575
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,772
I know, I know.
All we would take
from CompuServe is--

576
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,567
is the shared memory
virtual array manager
from the CBSIM code.

577
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,985
We make it bigger
so we can support more users

578
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,196
and the rest
we build from scratch.

579
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,784
That would be
a time-saver.

580
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,952
Yeah, totally.

581
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,955
Come here.

582
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,917
No one designs
in a vacuum.

583
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,919
What's the point
in reinventing the wheel

584
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,379
if your true innovation
is creating the tire?

585
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,839
Yeah.

586
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,049
Take the Giant, okay?

587
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,678
Say what you will about it,
but I started with a IBM PC

588
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,097
and made something
that was twice as fast
at half the cost

589
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,099
and portable
at 15 pounds.

590
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,018
I thought
that was Joe MacMillan.

591
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,896
( coughs )

592
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:04,065
Joe MacMillan
might have pulled
the specs out of his ass,

593
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,025
but turning them
into a working product?

594
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,027
No, not really
his bag of tricks.

595
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,029
- Hey.
- Hey.

596
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,240
Howdy, Ryan.
Look at this.

597
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,284
- What you got there?
- Got it for Joanie.

598
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,036
- Robo Butler.
- That looks ridiculous.

599
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,080
Yeah, well, it ain't
your birthday, is it?

600
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,918
- What's it do exactly?
- Here, look at this.

601
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,128
( laughs )

602
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,046
Lookit here.

603
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,048
Come here,
let me show you.
Come on.

604
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,886
Look, all right, here.

605
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,681
Get your beers right there
into the metal paws. Come on.

606
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,934
If you got to put the beers
in his hands, why don't you
just take them with you?

607
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:42,061
I mean, what's the point
of having the robot
bring them to you?

608
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,272
'Cause he's a butler, man.
It's what he does.

609
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,942
- All right.
- Now back up.
Back up. Watch.

610
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,027
Joanie gonna love this.

611
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,865
Hey!
( laughs )

612
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,074
Look at him.
Come on there, butler.

613
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,953
Look at me,
I'm Robo Butler.

614
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,121
Would you gentlemen
care for more beers?

615
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,082
Bos, it's so slow.

616
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,002
<i>I mean, look, it's taking</i>
<i>forever to get here.</i>

617
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,879
<i>I could've walked</i>
<i>over here faster.</i>

618
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,255
- ( laughs )
- I got the receipt.

619
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,091
Don't give that
to Joanie, all right.
You're only gonna upset her.

620
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,635
She gonna love it.

621
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,526
Hey, nice to see Joanie
and Jennifer getting along.

622
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,113
Just so you know,
I get 60 proposals a week.

623
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,115
Most weeks
I pass on all 60.

624
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,910
It really had nothing
to do with you.

625
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,245
No, I completely
understand.

626
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:46,084
It was a really
quick no you gave us
in there, though.

627
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,130
All right, let's talk,
but not out here.

628
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,132
Are you laughing
at my butler, children?

629
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,134
Get out of here.
Scram, all of you.

630
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,387
- ( girls laughing )
- Get out of here.
Dang butler.

631
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,390
Oh, hell.
Oh, for Christ's sake.

632
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,935
I've been combing
over our prospectus,
replaying our meeting,

633
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,144
trying to figure out why
Elias's note derailed things.

634
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,313
I've narrowed it down
to three possibilities.

635
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,400
A: Elias doesn't believe
our user base will embrace

636
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,237
Mutiny Exchange as rapidly
as our projections,
which is wrong.

637
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:18,075
B: Elias thinks
our timeframe from
development to beta

638
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,160
is overly optimistic,
which is also wrong.

639
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:26,165
C: Elias is a sexist jerk
who doesn't believe two women
can run a company, which--

640
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,167
- Okay.
- I'm leaning towards C.

641
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,213
Elias is a sexist jerk,
but better than most.

642
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,341
He doesn't care who runs
a company as long as it
makes him money.

643
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,344
Okay, then I'm at a loss
because you're a smart woman

644
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,179
and Exchange
is a great idea.

645
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,432
I am smart
and it is a great idea.

646
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:46,227
And that's your problem.
You didn't allow for D.

647
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,563
Another company
is already doing this.

648
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,356
What? Who?

649
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,193
It's a small outfit
Elias has been tracking
as a potential investment.

650
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,487
SwapMeet.

651
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,281
It's a good name.

652
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,283
I wasn't aware of it.
Otherwise I never would
have had you come in.

653
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,910
What do you know
about them?

654
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,287
Only that they have
an 18-month head start.

655
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,205
( groans )

656
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,292
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>
<i>that's what informed</i>
<i>our decision.</i>

657
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,294
<i>It made no sense</i>
<i>to bet on Mutiny</i>

658
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,463
<i>in a battle</i>
<i>you weren't just losing,</i>

659
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,548
<i>but didn't even know</i>
<i>you were fighting.</i>

660
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,469
<i>( girls laughing,</i>
<i>chatting )</i>

661
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,680
Jennifer:
Hey, wait, guys,
do you want to come play?

662
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,389
Okay, let's play a game.

663
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,351
Hey, sweetie.
You doing okay?

664
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:33,191
Oh, she's really pulling
focus, isn't she?

665
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,278
Kind of like
it's her birthday
party and not yours.

666
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:44,077
Look, honey,
I just want you to know
how proud I am of you

667
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,704
for inviting Jennifer.

668
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,288
It shows real maturity.

669
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,416
- Okay.
- A birthday's
not just a party.

670
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,878
It's marking a passage
of time in your life.

671
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,921
You're showing me you're not
just a little girl anymore--

672
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,091
Okay, I heard you.
Growing up and you're
proud of me.

673
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,260
- Can we just
do the cake now?
- No, no. Come here.

674
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,263
I want to make sure
you hear what I'm saying.

675
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,933
Okay, you did a really
grown-up thing today

676
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:10,269
and your dad, he couldn't
be more proud of you than
he is right now.

677
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,522
Stop saying that.

678
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,650
Cameron paid me 20 bucks
to invite Jennifer to come.

679
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,318
Okay?

680
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,487
I hate Jennifer.

681
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,281
Can we just do
the cake now, please?

682
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,701
- Everyone's asking for it.
- Yeah, sure.

683
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,411
Let's do the cake.

684
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,003
Okay, I've been on Mutiny
asking around,

685
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,296
trying to figure out
what I could about
this SwapMeet.

686
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,174
- And?
- From what I can tell,

687
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,094
it sounds seriously
less robust than what we
have in mind for Exchange.

688
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,470
Plus, it's focused
on sports memorabilia,

689
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,556
so I just can't see it
reaching anywhere

690
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,934
near the size and scope
of our user base.

691
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,895
Hey, sure was weird
that Jennifer came to
the party, wasn't it?

692
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,397
Yeah. We will not lose
to an inferior product.

693
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,984
- I refuse to be Betamax.
- 'Cause I don't remember
inviting her.

694
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,320
Oh, no, we didn't.
Joanie did that all
on her own.

695
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,615
- Wasn't that mature of her?
- Yeah, it was.

696
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,326
It shows a hell of a lot
of maturity that she
would invite Jennifer.

697
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,412
Which, you know,
reminds me.

698
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,709
What?
What is this for?

699
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,795
For all your help today.

700
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,175
Okay.

701
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,676
Thanks.

702
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,680
Uh, I'll be in my room.

703
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,768
She went out
and grabbed some cups
for us at the party.

704
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,074
( phone rings )

705
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,993
Ryan Ray.

706
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,828
Joe:
<i>Ryan.</i>

707
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,872
Mr. MacMillan.

708
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,792
<i>Ryan, I want you to do</i>
<i>something for me.</i>

709
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,213
Um, okay.

710
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,589
What?

711
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,800
<i>I want you to stand up.</i>

712
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:09,973
<i>I want you to take</i>
<i>a long look around.</i>

713
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,975
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to make sure you see</i>

714
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,769
<i>every single person</i>
<i>in that room.</i>

715
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,189
-<i> Are you doing that?</i>
- Uh, yeah.

716
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,440
<i>Good.</i>

717
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,110
<i>Now forget them,</i>

718
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,863
<i>because you don't work</i>
<i>with those people anymore.</i>

719
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:30,869
<i>I'll see you tomorrow</i>
<i>at my office, 9:00 A.M. sharp.</i>

720
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,872
Oh, my God.

721
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,253
I'll be there.

722
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,880
Thank you.

723
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:46,134
<i>Now, Ryan,</i>
<i>there's one more thing</i>
<i>I want you to do for me.</i>

724
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,426
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

725
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,428
- Incredible.
- Look.

726
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,890
It's her.
Turn around.

727
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,434
Isn't this a bit
formal for us?

728
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,645
We could just meet
at Jennifer's birthday
party next month.

729
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,439
Oh, no, we'll just
be a minute.

730
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,817
I admire persistence,
I really do,

731
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,443
but we've been over this.

732
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,445
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't convince

733
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,655
my partners to fund
your expansion.

734
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,699
- I'm sorry.
- No, we understand.

735
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,617
- That's not why we're here.
- No, because you're right.

736
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,953
SwapMeet is our competition.
It'd be foolish for you
to invest

737
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,373
over a million dollars just
to see if we can catch up.

738
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,623
And that's why
we've done our homework.

739
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,459
And what we found
is that while SwapMeet
does have

740
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,047
a functional program
that it would take us a year
or more to compete with,

741
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:29,468
what they don't have
is anywhere near the size
of our user base.

742
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,930
We don't want you to help us
compete with SwapMeet.

743
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,723
We want you
to help us buy them.

744
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,726
It's not a million
to fight a war,

745
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,437
it's a few hundred
thousand to win it.

746
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,489
( laughs )
Yes!

747
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,491
Yes!

748
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,744
Oh, my God, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

Hey, Ryan.
Great news.

751
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,305
I tracked down
that CBSIM code,

752
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,514
so we can get
started today.

753

You know, just--
just you and me.
