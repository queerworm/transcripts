14

Let me start
by asking a question.

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,388
How many
of you desire to be
computer engineers?

16
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,598
Hmm.

<i>Keep your hands up,</i>
<i>keep your hands up.</i>

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,482
Now I'm going to list off
several categories.

21
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,568
When you hear a category
you don't have hands-on
experience in...

22
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,445
-<i> ( music stops ) </i>
- Put your hand down.

Circuit design.
Microprocessing.

26

Firmware design.
Very large-scale integration.

- ( chuckles )
- Something funny?

28
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,752
I don't think you really
know what that is.

29
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,921
Why?

30
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,881
Because nobody who knows
what it is calls it that.

31
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,341
"VLSI."
How's that?

32
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,846
Operating systems.

33
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,892
P-ROM configuration
and PLC design.

34
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,648
Personal computer design.
Very good.

35
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,608
Now, tell me one thing
that will be true

36
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,110
about computers
10 years from now.

37
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,113
Well, fully
intelligent machines

38
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,782

of neurons more closely,

39
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,119
Okay, thanks.
You.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,748
Uh, computers
will be connected together
across one network

41
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,125
with a standard
protocol.

42
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,336
- Like phone lines.
- Obviously phone lines.

43

- Cameron.

what do you wanna do?
Microcode? PCs? Video games?

49

Do you need
a quarter?

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,982
- Got it.
- Nice.

51
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,781
I want to work

Defense Initiative

52

Are you afraid to give me
a straight answer?

-<i> ( video game rumbles ) </i>
- A straight answer?
Uh, let's see.

55

Everything I'm studying here
is so totally 10 years ago

56
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,003
that no one who matters
pays attention to anything I do.

57
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,005
- I'm paying attention.
- Yeah, but do you matter?

two more?

What is this anyway,
some kind of job interview?

61
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,932

that ain't IBM is cheaper,
faster, and better,

117

this company lives by.

what Hitachi thought.

173
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,858
that deserves
an outrageous price tag.

174
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,152
And we get no
Big Blue guarantee.

175
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,612
I don't think
there is such a thing.

176
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,906
Well, they
had me fooled.

177
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,991
- ( man laughs )
- Me, too.

178
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,995
I worked here.

179
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,165
I grew up there.

180
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:33,127
And I was
brought up to believe
that the work we did,

181
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,963
the things we built were
the singular contribution
to computers

182
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,882
that history
would remember.

183
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,051
And I believed it
for a long time.

184
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,513
For a long time,
it was true.

185
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,727
Nobody ever got fired
for buying an IBM, right?

186
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,398
What a fearful way
to do business.

187
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,900
You've made
just enough safe choices

188
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,237
to stay alive,
but not enough to matter.

189
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,740
Is that
what you want?

190
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,909
You can be more.

191
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,995
You want to be more,
don't you?

192
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,417
The window of opportunity
is closing.

193
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,169
This is your chance.

194
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,756
<i>This is not</i>
<i>about not losing.</i>

195
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:22,510
This is about you
finally having the confidence

196
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:27,014
to walk out on the ledge
and know that you're
not going to fall.

197
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,103
Are we still talking about
systems software here?

198
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,230
Amen, let's get
this guy another drink.

199
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,609
I'm not going to apologize
for caring about your business,

200
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,444
even if the people
who work for you don't.

201
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,698
I'll ask you
one more time.

202
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,034
Are you ready
to be more?

203
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,678
- There's also free install--
- Gordon, please.

204
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,560
I'll think about it.

205
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,407
Look, it's better
than a flat-out no.

206
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:33,331
Hey, man, look,
Applied Data hasn't bought
jack-all from anyone in years.

207
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,082
You did a solid job
explaining the software,

208
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,335
but I need you
to do me one favor.

209
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,086
Okay.

210
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,047
Next time I move to close,
this is what you do.

211
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:45,134
- Okay, what?

00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,465
- It won't turn on.

225
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,385

Joanie:

230
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,148
Okay.

231
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,151

No.

00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,493

Haley:

238
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,292
- I don't care who broke it.
-<i> That probably breaked it.</i>

239
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,502

Okay, girls,

( sighs )

243
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,030
You want to
take a look and see
what's wrong with that?

244
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,283
They make that
where you work,
not where I do.

245
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,453
Okay, Gordon, do you want
to maybe get me the salt?

246
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,996
Maybe you could reach
into the cabinet

247
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,456
about seven inches
from your head,

248
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,541
take out the salt,
and put it in my hand

249
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,251
so I can finish
cooking this.

250
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,712
Do you think you could
at least get me the salt?

251
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,217
Here's the salt.

252
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,053
Thank you.

253
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,074
- ( object slaps )
- A-16.

254
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,330
- What is this?
- Page 33.

255
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,000
- Man, if you think
it's funny--
- Page 33.

256
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,293
I'm not in the mood,
all right?

257
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,005
Why don't you go blow-dry
your hair some more
or something?

258
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,798
Don't you realize
what you wrote?

259
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,470
You wrote
a treasure map.

260
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,683
If you see him around,
I wanna meet that guy.

261
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,311
There's a project
I want to discuss with him.

262
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,605
Hey, hey.

263
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,401
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

264
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,945
"This puts the future
squarely in the hands

265
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,280
of those who know computers
not for what they are,

266
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,534
but for everything
they have the potential to be."

267
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,785
What?

268
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,579
You know who said that?

269
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,539
No, no, I don't.

270
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,290
You did.

271
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,004
Page 36,
closing paragraph.

272
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:12,132
Computers
aren't the thing.

273
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:16,596
They're the thing
that gets us<i> to</i> the thing.

274
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,125
Over here
on the circuit board,
you've got the ROM chip.

275
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,294
That's like the brain
that remembers all the words--

276
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,923
128 kilobits worth.
That is a lot of words.

277
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,801
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

278
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,054
And then you've got
your VFD display right here.

279
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,389
That's the part
that shows you the words.

280
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,559
And the speech synthesizer
chip right here,

281
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,021
that is the extra-special one
they make where Mommy works.

282
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,189
I got it.

283
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,568
<i>( ringing continues )</i>

284
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,988
Hello?

285
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,740
It's somebody
named Joe MacMillan.

286
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,659
We're headed
out the door to a movie.

287
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,868
-<i> Can I have him call you back? </i>
- What does the special chip do?

288
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,414
Oh, um, the chip
makes it talk.

289
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,125
You know,
like you and me.

290
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,669
- Can you make it talk?
- Not right now, kiddo.

291
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,588
Hey, Joanie,
why don't you go get ready
for the movie, 'kay?

292
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,390
He wanted to know
if you thought about
what he said.

293
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,768
That article
I wrote in "Byte."

294
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,895
What about it?

295
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,856
He had some ideas
about it.

296
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,817
Oh, yeah?
What kind of ideas?

297
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,568
I don't know.

298
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,070
It doesn't
really matter.

299
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,035
...go home and watch
the other two "Star Wars"?

300
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,495
- You wanna do that tonight?
-<i> Hi, Joe MacMillan.</i>

301
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,956
We spoke
on the phone earlier.

302
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,541
( chuckles )

303
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,043
Did you
follow me here?

304
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,878
Your husband
is the best SE

305
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,504
I've worked with
at Cardiff Electric.

306
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,506
Now, granted,
I've only been
there a week.

307
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,925
Do you mind if I borrow
Gordon for one second?

308
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,388
- Donna: Come on.
- Hey, I'll see
you guys outside.

309
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,141
Donna:
Yeah, maybe,
if Daddy lets us.

310
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,018
( chuckles )

311
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,562
Reverse engineer
an IBM PC with me.

312
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,481
What? Why?
What would be the point?

313
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,858
Because I want to
build a machine

314
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,152
that nobody else
has the balls to build.

315
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,907
Wow, you're serious.

316
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,034
Look, that's
a terrible idea.

317
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,787
- Why?
- For such a multitude
of reasons

318
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,499
that I--
because it's illegal.

319
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,045
Worst-case scenario,
IBM sues us into the ground.

320
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,339
Uh, Cardiff finds out,
then both of us would
be on the street.

321
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,885
Apple, IBM, they have
the market sewn up.

322
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:05,556
Plus, you got Commodore,
Tandy, Texas Instruments.

323
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,769
I'm sorry,
but you missed it.
We all did.

324
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,732
Gordon, wait, wait.

325
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,734
That's why we do it
as Cardiff Electric.

326
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,069
Scale up instantly.

327
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,987
Are you
out of your mind?

328
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,031
Buzzards like Bosworth
and Cardiff would never
go for something--

329
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,075
- So we force their hand.
- Force their hand?

330
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,035
How are you gonna
force their hand?

331
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,079
Let me worry
about that part.

332
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,457
Haley, Joanie:
<i>Dad!</i>

333
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,709
- Come on, Dad!
- Hurry!

334
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,631
Do you have
a family, Joe?

335
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,177
That's what I thought.

336
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,596
Look, thanks,
but no thanks.

337
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,729
<i>( car horn honks )</i>

338
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,279
So, that was
Joe MacMillan, huh?

339
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,202
He stalked our family
to the movies, Gordon.

340

He's just keyed up
about something.

342
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,791
What does he want?

343
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,586
He wants to build
a computer.

344
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,548

have to do with you?

345

Gordon?

346
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,266
Gordon, we can't
do this again.
You know we can't.

347

I know.

348
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,145
Do you know?
Because I just had
to spread the payments

349
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,439
- for Joanie's next dental visit
over three credit cards.
- Oh, my God, Donna.

350
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,488
It's just literally
a mistake that we can't
afford to make again.

351

Look, the Symphonic
was a good idea.

00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,339
<i>Joe walked out the front door</i>
<i>of our offices last March.</i>

507
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,174
And?

508
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,593
And he never came back.

509
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,308
You lost me, Dale.

510
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,603
No one has seen or heard
from Joe MacMillan

511
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,312
in more than a year.

512
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,898
<i>We even filed</i>
<i>police reports.</i>

513
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,900
<i>Up until we caught wind</i>
<i>he was working for you,</i>

514
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,737
we believed the worst,
but here we are.

515
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,906
<i>He's damaged goods, John.</i>

516
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,409
<i>I wish I could've warned you,</i>
<i>but now it might be too late.</i>

517
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,370
How so?

518
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,916
I'm here with Rebecca Taylor,
our in-house legal counsel.

519
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:45,631
Hi, John.
We've got a problem.

520
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,354
- You two-- sit down.
-<i> ( door closes )</i>

521
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,442
<i>This here</i>
<i>is Nathan Cardiff.</i>

522
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,235
<i>He owns the company</i>
<i>you destroyed.</i>

523
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,279
<i>We just got done with</i>
<i>a two-and-a-half-hour jaw</i>

524
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,739
with IBM's legal team,

525
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,491
including your old boss,
Dale Butler.

526
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,700
Oh, yeah?
How's he doing?

527
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,746
Oh, he's doing
pretty splendid,

528
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,666
given the fact
that Big Blue is gonna
liquidate this company

529
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,794
to the tune
of several dozen million
dollars in legal damages

530
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,463
because two
idiot children
in our employ

531
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,757
decided to rip off
their flagship product.

532
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,467
Sir, that wasn't
the idea.

533
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,010
We did this
solely on our own.

534
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,595
It turns out
that doesn't matter--

535
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,556
and, believe me,
we tried to feed you
to the wolves, boys.

536
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,642
But because
MacMillan here
worked at IBM

537
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,060
and you two were
in our employ at the time
of your little project,

538
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,814
that project is ours now,
for better or worse.

539
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,607
Worse,
in this case.

540
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,443
Butler and that woman Taylor
are headed down here tomorrow.

541
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,571
Sir, how the hell
did IBM find out
about this?

542
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,365
I told them.

543
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,661
Hey! Hey!

544
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,955
That's how you
force their hand?
You call IBM?

545
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,456
Just let
everybody cool off.

546
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,001
This is exactly what my wife--
Joe, look at me.

547
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,714
I'm not like you, okay?
I have a wife, kids,
a mortgage, okay?

548
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,300
I was fine until you threw
that stupid article in my face
and gave me some--

549
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,969
What? What did
I give you, Gordon?

550
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:17,389
- Oh, go to hell, Joe.
- Good! Get angry, get angry!

551
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,683
Feel something,
like you did in
that garage,

552
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,811
because this
is the only way
we get what we want.

553
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:25,605
- There is no "we," Joe.
- There is now.

554
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,483
I was at COMDEX
two years ago.

555
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,905
I saw the Symphonic demo.
It was ahead of its time.

556
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:36,324
That was then,
this is now--
and a year from now,

557
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,911
you're gonna thank me.
You're a builder, Gordon.

558
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,413
No, I'm not, okay?
Not anymore.

559
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,540
All right?
Get that through
your head.

560
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,299
Hey.

561
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,346
- Yeah.
- Yes.

562
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,768
I figured
you needed a break.

563
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,561
Joanie:
<i>Daddy, you fixed it!</i>

564
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,772
Yeah, well, turn it on.

565
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,275
<i>( toy beeps )</i>
<i>Hello, Joanie.</i>

566
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,736
How'd you get it
to say my name?

567
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:16,406
Well, I programmed it.
Now spell something for me.

568
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,324
( both giggle )

569
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,746
Electronic voice:
<i>D-A-D-D-Y.</i>

570
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,414
What's that spell?

571
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,380
<i>( dishes clatter )</i>

572
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,842
Look, I've been awful.

573
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,553
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,599
I know you think
you need this.

575
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:46,269
And whatever it is,
I'm pretty sure
I can't stop you.

576
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:50,482
Yeah, I know.
I've already stopped, okay?

577
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:56,362
Computers, my job--
none of that matters.

578
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,573
Not without you.

579
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,965
Build it.

580
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,511
Whatever it is you're
dreaming of, build it.

581
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,389
I know you
can make it great.

582
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:30,063
But here's the deal.

583
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,774
You wanna partner
with Joe MacMillan...

584
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,488
then you partner
with me and this family.

585
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,699
Yeah.

586
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,408
Deal.

587
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,960
Why can't we fire
these peckerheads?

588
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,503
Because then you'll
lose this lawsuit.

589
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,088
Fire them,
shelve their work,

590
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,589
you're essentially
admitting guilt.

591
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,842
Okay, so what's
the solution, Barry?

592
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,385
We legitimize
the project.

593
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,387
- What?
- Go the other way.

594
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,347
We say Cardiff Electric
as a company

595
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,224
has been pursuing
PC development all along.

596
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,851
I don't see how the hell
that'd solve any--

597
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,686
You take Clark's findings
on the BIOS chip,

598
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,855
you tell an engineer
to build a unit that operates
and performs

599
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,691
in exactly the same way,
but you don't tell him
how to do it.

600
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,359
Hell, I don't think
we have one engineer

601
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,028
capable of building
a BIOS from scratch

602
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,030
other than "Sonny Bono"
over here.

603
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,866
And you can't use him
or any other engineer
we currently employ.

604
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:26,619
- So we have to hire?
- Yes, someone who doesn't
know us or IBM

605
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,039
and certainly hasn't seen
the contents of this binder.

606
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,166
Essentially,
all the law stipulates

607
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,752
is that he can't be hands-on
in the actual chip creation.

608
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,712
- And we can't fire them.
- Barry:<i> No, not right now.</i>

609
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,591
So we get out of this
by actually building
a PC clone?

610
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,719
This is your brilliant idea
to save our hides, Barry?

611
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,721
For God's sake, man!

612
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,140
No.

613
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,560
Actually,
it was MacMillan's.

614
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,819
You son of a bitch.

615
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,988
Now, why didn't you tell me
about this yesterday?

616
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,074
I needed you
to exhaust your options

617
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,076
so that you would
take this one seriously.

618
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,912
Do you know
how many futures you're
toying with here, son?

619
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:12,707
Selling systems software,
I probably would've made you
a couple hundred thousand--

620
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,710
( screams )
You listen to me, boy!
You listen to me!

621
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,840
I admire
your tenacity,

622
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:25,720
but I draw the line
at you claiming that
you did me a favor.

623
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,935
Don't screw this up.

624
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,772
'Cause in Texas, you put
a man's livelihood on the line
and you don't follow through,

625
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,941
there's not gonna be
another new job

626
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,152
'cause ain't nobody
gonna be able to find
where you're buried.

627
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,863
You've got something
to say, Gordon?

628
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,033
No. No, sir.

629
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,035
Bosworth:
<i>Where are we gonna find</i>
<i>this new engineer?</i>

630
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,871
We needed him yesterday.
IBM legal's here first
thing tomorrow.

631
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,832
- I need time
to vet a candidate.
- Barry:<i> We don't have time.</i>

632
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,959
You think IBM
is just sitting around
on their asses?

633

you haven't bedded down with.

673
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:54,202
- Who are you again?
- I'm the guy who figured out
the boot code in four days.

674
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,247
- What have you done?
- You heard him-- a thousand
other engineers.

675
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,624
No.

676
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,918
You need me, otherwise
you wouldn't be here.

677
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,045
What do you want?

678
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,424
I want you to go dangle
your little opportunity
in someone else's face.

679
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,927
- Then why are you still here?
- I wanted to see what I was so
wrong about the first time.

680
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,429
I regret that happened.

681
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,722
I'm sorry you feel bad
for hurting my feelings,

682
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,808
but don't worry,
you didn't.

683
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,935
It wasn't
supposed to be personal.
I was scouting you.

684
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,646
Scouting you
for this exact moment.

685
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,855
- Humph.
- No, wait.

686
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,111
This is too important
to get wrong.

687
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,946
"No one who matters
pays attention," right?

688
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,281
Okay, stop selling me.

689
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,116
I don't need you.

690
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,909
You think
I don't see it?

691
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,453
This takes off,
I write my own ticket,

692
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,831
but if it goes wrong,
I'm a college dropout

693
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,208
repairing VCRs
for $3.25 an hour,

694
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,336
so forgive me
for weighing my options.

695
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,296
See?

696
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,006
Now you're thinking
like a professional.

697
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,970
How much money
would you give me?

698
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,807
Junior engineer,
no experience-- 20 grand.

699
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,102
Double it.

700
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,104
My wife makes 15 at TI.

701
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,730
Well, then I feel
sorry for her.

702
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,735
So?

703
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:12,822

gonna be, Joe?

One, no bullshit.

- Sorry, what constitutes bull--
- Whatever I damn say it is.

you can't leave,

for about a year.

761

I didn't check
your references,
