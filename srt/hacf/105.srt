I really appreciate you
coming home this morning.
Thank you.

31
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,317
I gotta shower and shave
and get back to the office.

32
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,444
I just wanted
to bring you this.

33
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:36,115
- You were quoted
several times.
- Oh, you mean...

34
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,409
( whispers )
"Susan Fairchild"
was quoted?

35
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,038
- French toast.
What's the occasion?
- Dad's birthday.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,706
I thought that's
why you came home.

37
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,500
( whispers )
You got him a putter.

38
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,793
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat
dragged in.

39
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,461
Happy birthday.

40
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,547
He loves the putter.

41
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,633
Did you thank him,
sweetheart?

42
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,218
You should come to the
club with me today.
Play a quick nine?

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,473
Um, I gotta--
I got work I gotta do.

44
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,975
Good morning, girls.

45
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,769
Hey, no hello
for Daddy,

46
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,395
who you haven't seen
in almost two days?

47
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,064
Both:
Hi, Daddy.

48
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,816
Can we take this
to school?

49
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,610
- Is it a calculator?
- No, it's a TV.

50
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,194
Isn't that thing
incredible?

51
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,489
Yeah, now they can
watch TV all the time.

52
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,742
I just arranged
an exclusive deal
with Kazoku

53
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,619
to carry them
in our fall catalogue.

54
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,704
Mm.

55
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,669
( sighs )
Happy birthday
to me, right?

56
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,172
- Whoo-hoo!
- ( laughs )

57
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,633
Well, how will
your computer compare
to the IBM XT?

58
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,845
Ours has all the same
features as the XT,

59
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,891
plus-- plus
a few bonus extras.

60
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,475
- Retailer:<i> Like what? </i>
- John:<i> Like what?</i>

61
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,811
Like you can haul it
down to the no-tell motel

62
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,229
when you screw
your secretary

63
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,689
and you'd still get
your memos typed up.

64
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,024
"Like what?"

65
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,526
You try that
with an IBM PC,

66
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,612
hell, you'd
throw out your back.

67
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,239
Retailer #2:
<i>Now, what about speed?</i>

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,949
<i>That seems to be all</i>
<i>our customers care about.</i>

69
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,868
I heard you guys
were flirting
with the 286.

70
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,204
Yep.

71
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,963
Oh, I'm just
a carpetbagger
from New York.

72
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,798
They won't
listen to me.

73
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,552
Gentlemen, I think--
I think all the specs

74
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,972
are right there in those
packets that we gave you.

75
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,183
Y'all can read, right?

76
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,979
Joe:
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>to clarify,</i>

77
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,690
- secretary isn't
included at that price.
-<i> ( retailers laughing )</i>

78
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,944
As for the specs,
we were experimenting
with the 286,

79
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,446
<i>but in the end,</i>
<i>it would only cost your</i>
<i>customers an arm and a leg,</i>

80
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,157
<i>so we're going with</i>
<i>an eight megahertz 8086.</i>

81
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,743
<i>That's almost twice as fast</i>
<i>as any PC on the market,</i>

82
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,704
<i>plus we're including</i>
<i>a floating-point math</i>
<i>coprocessor</i>

83
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,957
that will run circles
around any IBM PC.

84
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,708
Let's cut to the chase

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,920
and get to the question
you came here to
have answered.

86
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:59,466
The question your CEO
will ask you at your
post-COMDEX powwow.

87
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:03,053
"What do we put
on our third shelf?"

88
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,847
Not the first shelf--
that's reserved for IBM.

89
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,557
Not even
the second shelf.

90
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,935
That's where
your name brand
computer goes.

91
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,853
The ones you have
manufactured in Taiwan

92
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,772
and slap
your insignia on.

93
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,232
The third shelf.

94
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,777
<i>The "kludge" shelf.</i>

95
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,946
<i>The shelf</i>
<i>your stock boys detest...</i>

96
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,948
because the computers
are so heavy...

97
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,741
and the shelves
are so low.

98
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,785
That's the shelf
we're talking about.

99
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,789
That's the shelf
us schmucks are aiming
for, am I right?

100
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,124
Wrong.

101
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,876
This isn't
an IBM compatible clone.

102
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,129
This is
the new compatible.

103
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,798
IBM will have to
clone<i> us.</i>

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,968
Tell that to your CEO
and I promise you this
time next year,

105
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,013
you'll be sitting
in his chair asking,

106
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,683
"What do<i> we</i> put
on our third shelf?"

107
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,895
( overlapping questions )

108
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,732
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

109
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,057
( employees chattering )

110
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,984
Welcome back.
How was your trip?

111
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,444
- Who are all these people?
- New team of software
engineers.

112
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,572
This is Steve, our software
development manager.

113
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,199
Steve,
this is Cameron.

114
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,825
I told them
all about you.

115
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,285
You didn't tell me
she was a girl.

116
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,871
I knew your keen analytical
skills would sniff it out.

117
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,998
Hey--

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,792
Run those to Gordon.

119
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,920
Look, I can handle
all the software myself.

120
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,255
I already mapped out
the design on the plane.

121
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,215
Who told you
to do that?

122
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,175
No one.
I thought that--

123
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,344
Why? How do you think
a project this big works?

124
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,389
Throwing as many people
at the problem as Bosworth
will approve.

125
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,391
Wait, did you
send me to Cincinnati

126
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,976
so that you could hire
Steve and his little minions
behind my back?

127
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,437
Don't be paranoid.
I sent you to Cincinnati
'cause you needed the rest.

128
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,273
Writing the BIOS
almost killed you.

129
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,193
Have you guys
thought of a name yet?

130
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,737
I'm deciding between
"Alamo," "Death Star,"
and "George."

131
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,781
I can't believe
you guys don't like "Khan."

132
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,157
"Khan!"

133
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,118
Excuse me?

134
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,870
I wrote the BIOS.
I name it.

135
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,414
"Lovelace."

136
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,665
- "Lovelace."
- ( all laughing )

137
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,588
Not Linda Lovelace,
you pervs, Ada Lovelace.

138
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,341
As in the first computer
programmer ever?

139
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,428
Good name.

140
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,680
All right,
let's turn this baby on.

141
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,066
( tapping drumroll )

142
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,119
( clicks )

143
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,456
( faint whirring )

144
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,793
All:
Yeah!

145
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,253
- Larry:<i> Yes! </i>
- ( cork pops )

146
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,964
Champagne.

147
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,882
- Champagne.
- Good work.

148
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,177
Why is everyone celebrating?
The screen didn't even turn on.

149
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,847
- There is no screen.
- We're getting there.

150
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,142
I just promised a room
full of retailers a briefcase.

151
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,019
You couldn't fit
this crap in a gym bag.

152
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,937
You mean overpromised.

153
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,440
It must be nice to have a job
where you get to say words

154
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,233
without having
to actually do anything.

155
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,820
Did you ever
sell a computer
before I showed up here?

156
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,530
Did any of you?

157
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,494
Well, we should
probably turn it off.

158
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,330
I think it's
starting to smoke.

159
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,790
Then turn it off,
Stan.

160
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,504
What the hell
is this?

161
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,006
I asked you to do
a failure analysis
report.

162
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,341
I did.

163
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,092
I don't understand.
Can I see that?

164
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,972
It's here.
It got mixed up

165
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,350
with the supplemental
report I did.

166
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,355
Okay, thanks.

167
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,606
Next time, just make sure
the report I need is on top.

168
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,778
( sighs )

169
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,033
Stan:
<i>If we get rid of fans,</i>
<i>we have a heat problem.</i>

170
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,868
<i>If we get rid</i>
<i>of the coprocessor,</i>

171
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,871
we lose
floating-point speed.

172
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,706
That'll get weight
out of the case.

173
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,833
That'll give us
one, two pounds max.

174
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,086
Joe wants this to be
10 pounds lighter.

175
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,463
Yeah, I want my wife
to be 10 pounds lighter.

176
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,340
Life is about
compromise.

177
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,841
This isn't
a joke, Ed.

178
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,844
Everything is riding
on us getting this right.

179
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,846
And no one's leaving here
until we do, you got that?

180
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,391
Yes.
Rangers scored.

181
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,059
- Give me that watch.
- Ow, relax.

182
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,894
Would you rather be
pounding Shiners with Brian

183
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,440
at 3:00 in the afternoon?
'Cause that can be arranged.

184
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,900
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,245
What if we swapped out
the CRT for an LCD?

186
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,330
It's lighter and smaller.

187
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,082
And way over
our budget.

188
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,377
Not if you know
a guy.

189
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,094
( fizzling )

190
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,138
Man:
<i>What's up?</i>

191
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,890
I'm Lev.
That's Kenneth,

192
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,683
<i>but everyone</i>
<i>calls him Yo-Yo.</i>

193
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,112
<i>( keyboard clicking )</i>

194
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,954
- Are you playing games?
- Jesus, do you mind?

195
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:07,000
I assigned you
to write print drivers,
not play games.

196
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,252
- What, when?
- Well, didn't you
check the flowchart?

197
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,588
I mapped out all
the subroutine assignments
and which order to do them in.

198
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,131
Print drivers
are remedial.

199
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,508
Why aren't I working
on a compiler?

200
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,468
Because I already have
a team on it, number one.

201
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,970
Number two, I hear
you can't be trusted
to document your code,

202
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,890
and, number three,
I need you to document
your code.

203
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,769
Welcome
to the short bus.

204
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,149
Is that "Adventure"?

205
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,484
Yeah.

206
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,111
( chuckles )
Classic.

207
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,530
I could tell
by your keystrokes.

208
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,323
That thing's heroin.

209
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,326
Took out my graduate seminar
the night before our final.

210
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,245
<i>We all flunked.</i>

211
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,915
( fizzling )

212
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,626
Hey, Yo-Yo, I'm putting
this up on the mainframe,

213
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,419
so consider
yourself warned.

214
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,926
Gary: Perfect time
for you to come out.

215
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,720
This place empties out
for the long weekend.

216
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,140
You won't slow down
anyone's game.

217
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,690
That was a really nice
gift you got the girls,
the Kazoku watch.

218
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,441
I know you think
I spoil them.

219
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,776
No, no, you should
spoil them.

220
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,531
It sounds like you got
a really good relationship

221
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,740
with the guys over
at Kazoku Electronics.

222
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,081
Look, all I'm asking
for is an introduction.

223
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,874
I need a new LCD screen
for my computer

224
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,127
and Kazoku has
the best technology.

225
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,047
For a second there,
you had me convinced

226
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,966
you actually wanted
to play a round of golf
with me for my birthday.

227
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,095
I'm sorry, Gary.
I just--

228
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,222
look, I really
need this.

229
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,642
Last time you came
to me for help--

230
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,768
I won't let Donna
go through that again.

231
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,272
This isn't like
last time, I promise you.

232
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,899
- How's it different?
- It's completely different.

233
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,651
Joe, he's running
the project.

234
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,237
He's got over a decade
at IBM under his belt.

235
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,239
- Joe MacMillan?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,742
Donna keeps telling me
he's all hat and no cattle.

237
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,703
No, no, no, no.
He's the real deal.

238
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,162
Honest to God.

239
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,706
And I got a whole team
of engineers

240
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,666
that are busting
their asses for me.

241
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,752
And you know
John Bosworth.

242
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,003
I mean, Cardiff's
a solid company.

243
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,926
The Japs love me.

244
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,429
You know,
I make 'em a bundle.

245
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,097
They'll have
to meet with you.

246
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,391
They don't do business
without a face-to-face.

247
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,518
Yeah, I'll clear
my schedule.

248
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,608
Thank you.

249
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,192
Sorry.

250
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,113
And these are
the directions
to Big Star Ball

251
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,364
in case you
decide to come.

252
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,783
We had a ball
last year.

253
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,367
Are you forgetting?
I'm from New York.

254
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,119
I'm trying.

255
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,996
- Do you want me
to call your father?
- What?

256
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,706
Your father.
You just missed him.

257
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,293
He has a layover
this Thursday in Dallas
on his way to Hong Kong.

258
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,438
-<i> ( intercom clicks ) </i>
- Did he say where
he's staying?

259
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,357
Debbie:
<i>The Kerrington Hotel.</i>

260
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,236
Call him
and tell him I'll meet him
at the lobby bar at 1:00.

261
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,489
<i>( switch clicks )</i>

262
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,341
What are you doing,
arranging a vendor
meeting without me?

263
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,801
They were headed back
to Tokyo in the morning.

264
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,344
It was now or never.

265
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,555
- Never. Cancel it.
- What? No.

266
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,390
I don't have time
to explain this to you.

267
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,183
- Just cancel it.
- You keep asking me
for the moon

268
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,143
and I finally get it for you
and now you're saying no.

269
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,187
How is Kazoku's
screen the moon?

270
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,980
<i>They've developed</i>
<i>cutting-edge</i>
<i>LCD technology.</i>

271
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,691
You want our computer
to be under 12 pounds

272
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,778
and slim as a briefcase?
This is how we do it.

273
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,529
They'll gouge us.

274
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,489
I have a connection.
He can get 'em down on price.

275
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,908
How do you
have a connection?

276
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,452
It's a small industry.
You meet people.

277
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,037
Look, I'm meeting them
at Sushi on McKinney
at 7:00.

278
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,123
<i>Are you in</i>
<i>or are you out?</i>

279
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,711
IBM doesn't even make them
with LCD screens.

280
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,380
Change the reservation
to Woodson's.

281
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,257
Japanese don't come
to Dallas to have
a shrimp cocktail

282
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,885
dressed up
like a sushi roll.
They come for steak.

283
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,679
Good call.

284
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,807
<i>Hey...</i>

285
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,142
nice work.

286
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,647
- What?
- ( chuckles )

287
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,191
Your comments.
They're funny.

288
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,779
You be careful.
I might ask you
to document all my code.

289
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,281
- Check this out...
-<i> ( key clicks )</i>

290
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,785
Oh, no, the printer
only prints text.

291
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,912
Wait, you added
a graphics mode?

292
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,831
And auto grayscale
conversion?

293
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,208
( whirring )

294
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,419
Oh! Cool.

295
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:47,173
Uh, Friday, a bunch of us
are going to that KCYD
car thing,

296
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,217
then to dinner
if you're interested.

297
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,678
Yeah, maybe.

298
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,262
Steve:
<i>Now, how are we</i>
<i>doing over here?</i>

299
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,224
I'm finished.

300
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,435
Did you check off
your module on the flowchart?

301
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,772
No, just told you
I'm finished.

302
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,525
Well, I still need you
to put a check by your name.

303
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,234
It's part
of the protocol.

304
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,987
Learned it
at Stanford B-School.

305
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,490
Mm, does the B
stand for bullshit?

306
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,367
If you have a problem,
you can come by my office

307
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,452
and we can discuss it
like adults.

308
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,622
No need to get
your panties in a wad.

309
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:23,292
Oh, I'm not
wearing any panties.

310
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,212
But you can stick that
in your flowchart.

311
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,925
You have to get rid
of that tool.

312
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,720
- Which one?
- I'm not kidding.
He's a terrible manager.

313
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,972
He can't see
the forest for the trees.
You have to get rid of him.

314
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,559
I don't have to do anything.
Learn to work with people.

315
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,769
He's assigning drivers
to the fastest coders

316
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,689
and compilers
to the lunkheads.
It's inefficient.

317
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,816
Cut him some slack.
He's under a lot of pressure.

318
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,568
What-- I could
handle the pressure.

319
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,612
Why is that so crazy?

320
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,699
Let's see-- you're not
exactly a people person.

321
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,911
You have no management
experience or any job
experience, really.

322
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,413
- You dropped out of college...
- Because you begged me,
asshole.

323
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,498
...and you lack
professionalism.

324
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,500
A manager doesn't
swear at his superior,

325
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,586
certainly not with
his office door open.

326
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,511
Is that
more professional?

327
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,805
Look, if I've given you
the impression

328
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,849
that because of this thing
we've got going on

329
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,770
that you're entitled
to special treatment,
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,989
Cameron, what
are you doing?

331
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:42,538
I'm just taking
this little thing we've
got going off the table.

332
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,792
Maybe that'll
wake you up.

333
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:53,007
- Uh, I left some stuff
at your apartment, so...
- ( keys clatter )

334
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,134
you can tell Steve
I'll report for duty
tomorrow.

335
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,770
I read that they don't
expect Westerners to bow,

336
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,397
but you're supposed
to receive their business
cards with both hands.

337
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,232
It's a sign of respect.

338
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,735
I've been to Tokyo
nine times.

339
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,200
Gordon Clark.
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

340
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,871
Guest:
The pleasure is ours.

341
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,835
- Hirohiko Taketa.
- Thank you.

342
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,004
Hirohiko Taketa.

343
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:35,424
"Hirohiko Taketa, head
of International Sales,
Kazoku Electronics."

344
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,886
Mr. Taketa,
thank you for being
our guest tonight.

345
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:43,474
We would do anything
for the son-in-law
of Gary Emerson.

346
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,645
( stammers )
I-I-I'm Gary's
son-in-law.

347
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,355
Oh,<i> hai.</i>

348
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,859
( chuckles )

349
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,366
<i>( door closes )</i>

350
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,453
Oh, sorry.
Hope I didn't scare you.

351
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,663
<i>I'm Joe MacMillan.</i>

352
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,958
I know
Joe MacMillan.

353
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,961
Senior.
He's my son.

354
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,379
<i>Do you know when Joe</i>
<i>will be back?</i>

355
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,176
Uh, no, he's--
how did you get in here?

356
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,511
<i>I showed the super</i>
<i>my license.</i>

357
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,138
You say something
with the right authority,

358
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,348
you generally
get what you want.

359
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,477
Huh, that's fascinating.

360
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,064
I'm just here
to get my stuff.

361
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,448
I bought this bat
for him.

362
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,454
Spent hours teaching him
how to swing correctly.

363
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,500
He wasn't exactly
a natural.

364
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,922
<i>Didn't know Joe</i>
<i>had a girlfriend.</i>

365
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,799
I'm not
his girlfriend.

366
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,136
Well, Joe's not exactly
the girlfriend type.

367
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,138
So, what did he do
to make you so mad at him?

368
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,557
What did he do
to make<i> you</i> so mad
at him?

369
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,308
Is that
what he told you?

370
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,770
No, he never
talks about you.

371
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,480
But if you had to lie
to the super to get
into his apartment,

372
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,649
I'm guessing
you're not exactly chummy.

373
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,069
Touché.

374
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,157
Actually, he stood me up
this afternoon.

375
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,160
Maybe we could
commiserate over a drink.

376
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,079
Thanks, but I've
got to get going.

377
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,164
Someone waiting
for you?

378
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,166
Yeah.

379
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,588
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Miss--

380
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,173
you know, I never
caught your name.

381
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,758
Cameron.

382
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,885
Not Cameron Howe?

383
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,721
How do you
know my name?

384
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,848
When my guys
came back to New York,

385
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,061
they couldn't stop talking
about this prodigy
named Cameron Howe.

386
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:56,107
- Right.
- Oh, yes.

387
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:00,111
They said you're
the modern Ada Lovelace.

388
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,159
Tomorrow, I'm taking
a 20-hour flight to Hong Kong

389
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,204
with Bill Gates and he's
gonna talk circles around me

390
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,124
and I could use
some liquid courage.

391
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,459
I hate to drink alone.

392
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,631
Don't mind me,
I'm just gonna check

393
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,842
the weather report
on the local news.

394
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,885
( all chuckle )

395
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,889
No, but it's-- it's really
an amazing work of engineering.

396
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,018
The one question I have
is how do you scale this

397
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,603
to a bigger size
without the display blurring?

398
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,605
Oh, we make
the voltage higher.

399
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,732
Five volts
usually enough, yeah.

400
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,568
But if you zap a pixel
with a voltage that high,

401
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,571
the adjacent pixels twist, too.
Don't you get ghosting?

402
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,079
What if you laid
in a third layer
of microcapacitors?

403
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,748
Aren't you experimenting
with that technology already?

404
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,626
Sony is.

405
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,505
It would
cost you more.

406
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,716
- Well, maybe--
- We can't drive up the price

407
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,510
till we're no
longer competitive.
Here's our offer.

408
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,263
You take a lower margin
on the individual screens,

409
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,183
we'll give you a percentage
of our profits on the back end.

410
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,101
It's the best I can do,
and, frankly,

411
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,855
I don't think you'll get
a better deal from another
PC manufacturer.

412
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,114
( sighs )

413
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,283
-<i> Kanpai. </i>
- All:<i> Kanpai.</i>

414
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,998
- ( coughs )
- Easy.

415
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,210
Lev:<i> Is anyone else stuck</i>
<i>in the maze of twisty</i>
<i>little passages?</i>

416
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,587
Yo-Yo:
<i>Try dropping an item.</i>

417
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,130
<i>( keyboards clicking )</i>

418
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,798
What?

419
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,843
A pirate just pounced on me
and stole my treasure.

420
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,804
No, no, no,
no, you shut up!

421
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,057
You have bad grammar.

422
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,560
<i>( clicking continues )</i>

423
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,812
You, come with me.

424
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,940
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

425
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,983
Any of you.
All of you.

426
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,319
Get your asses
in here, come on.

427
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,116
Come on.

428
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,286
Come here,
get in.

429
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,955
How the hell do I get out
of this godforsaken cave?

430
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,124
( all laugh )

431
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,964
Really looking forward
to working with you.

432
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,757
Hai.

433
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,094
And the sales guys,
they don't get what we do.

434
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,013
You know, the artistry
that's involved.

435
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,099
All they care
about's profit.

436
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,143
Take my father-in-law.

437
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,813
Have you ever even looked
through the "Razor's Edge"?

438
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:44,775
I mean, you wouldn't believe
the schlock that guy sells.

439
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:52,866
Schlock, you know,
like stupid stuff.

440
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,161
Hai.
( flushing )

441
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,708
Schlock.

442
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,173
Schlock.

443
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,091
I noticed an Air Force pin
on your backpack.

444
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,136
- Your father's?
- Yeah.

445
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,680
Vietnam?

446
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,682
Helicopter
crew chief.

447
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,058
Tough job.

448
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,145
I was a naval officer
in the Pacific.

449
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,063
If anyone had told me
one day I'd be flying

450
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,982
to Tokyo every month
and bowing to them...

451
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,234
( chuckles )

452
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,404
So, when did you
start working for IBM?

453
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,740
Oh, they recruited me in 1945
to work on the Mark I.

454
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,952
- With Grace Hopper?
Did you meet her?
- Oh, sure.

455
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,788
- Did it really
weigh four tons?
- Five.

456
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,042
We used it in the Navy to
calculate artillery firing.

457
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,336
I knew right then
I wanted to work for
Big Blue when I got out.

458
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,713
Best company
in the world.

459
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,674
And I still
don't understand what
possessed Joe to leave.

460
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,139
I was surprised
you turned us down.

461
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,099
You could've been
the next Grace Hopper.

462
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,769
Instead, you're in line
to be another programmer
no one remembers.

463
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,772
( chuckles )
Oh, my God, you're right.

464
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,108
Yeah, instead of writing
software for a brand-new
machine,

465
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,818
I could've been
getting coffee for the guy

466
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,363
who warms the seat
for the guy who writes
the software.

467
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,698
What was I thinking?

468
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,452
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was out of line.

469
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,287
You're not the one
I'm angry at.

470
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,623
It's a tricky thing,
fathers and sons.

471
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,792
Your dad's lucky
to have a daughter.

472
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,254
I bet you'd never
stand him up if he
came to see you.

473
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,467
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

474
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,973
He didn't make it
back, did he?

475
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,935
You couldn't have been
more than 10 years old
at the time.

476
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,396
I-- excuse me.

477
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,153
Joe:
<i>They picked up the check.</i>

478
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,781
Are you too drunk
to comprehend that means
they're done with us?

479
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,324
I should never
have let you come.

480
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,119
Let<i> me</i> come?
I arranged this deal.

481
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,413
No, Gary did,
and then you insulted him.

482
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,997
Nothing says,
"Don't trust us"

483
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,375
quite like bad-mouthing
your own father-in-law.

484
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,086
Look, your father works
at IBM and you shit on them
all the time to everyone.

485
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,171
Not to the Japanese.

486
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,006
Look, you may be good
with a soldering iron,

487
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,758
but when it comes
to business,

488
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,803
the big picture,
you have no idea.

489
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,056
Hey, hey.
I'm not the one screwing
"Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs."

490
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,849
- Leave her out of this.
- Like that's not gonna
blow up in our face!

491
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,435
Go back to your workstation
with the rest of the grunts.

492
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,978
I'll fix this
in the morning.

493
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,854
With what, Joe,
your words?

494
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,731
Donna was right.
You're all hat
and no cattle.

495
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,442
Why don't you build
a computer with Donna?

496
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,361
Oh, wait,
you tried that.

497
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,780
<i>( engine starts )</i>

498
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,830

499
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,082

Gordon on phone:
<i>Your dad's gonna kill me.</i>

501
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,758
Well, I bet it wasn't
as bad as you think.

502
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,177
Look, I'm telling you,
it was.

503
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,179
I really screwed
the pooch this time.

504
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,432
Well, I'm sure
it'll work out somehow.

505
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,185
- ( rings )
- Oh, honey, I've got
pies in the oven.

506
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,521
-<i> We can talk more about this</i>
<i>when you get home. </i>
- Okay.

507
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,813
<i>Okay, yeah, I'll--</i>

508
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,283
<i>( phone rings )</i>

509
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,743
What, Gordon?

510
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,622
<i>Uh, it's Hunt.</i>

511
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,333
<i>Am I catching you</i>
<i>at a bad time?</i>

512
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,918
No, no, no.
It's wonderful.

513
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,339
I mean...
what's up?

514
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:39,343
Well, the reason I'm calling
is 'cause I had a chance

515
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,470
to go over that
other report of yours,

516
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:45,474
<i>and I wanna say</i>
<i>I was really impressed.</i>

517
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,686
<i>I love that you took</i>
<i>the initiative.</i>

518
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,355
Well, thank you.

519
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,899
Listen...

520
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,777
I wanted to apologize
for snapping at you
the other day.

521
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,573
I was getting hammered
from upstairs and,
what can I say?

522
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,032
<i>I shouldn't have</i>
<i>taken it out on you.</i>

523
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,617
Oh, it's
no big deal, really.

524
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,744
I just yelled at my kids
when I got home.

525
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,914
<i>Well, that's what</i>
<i>they're there for.</i>
<i>( Hunt chuckles )</i>

526
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,543
Well, I don't want to
cut into your evening
any more than I already have.

527
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,254
<i>Oh, no, I'm just</i>
<i>making some peach pies</i>

528
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,673
<i>for my parents'</i>
<i>barbecue.</i>

529
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,799
Peach pies?

530
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,595
I love peach pie.

531
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,430
<i>( Hunt chuckles )</i>

532
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,601
Do you put vodka
in your dough?

533
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,810
<i>Vodka?</i>

534
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:35,357
My granny, she used
to substitute half the water
for a shot of vodka.

535
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,943
She said it kept the crust
from getting all soggy

536
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,861
from the fruit filling.

537
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,448
I think she did it
so if her pie didn't turn out,

538
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,283
<i>everyone would be</i>
<i>too drunk to notice.</i>

539
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,785
Oh, well, she sounds
like a smart lady.

540
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,955
<i>Yeah, she was</i>
<i>the best.</i>

541
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,500
Well, I...

542
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,961
better let you
get back to bakin'.

543
00:29:56,002 --> 00:30:00,549
<i>If you have any left over,</i>
<i>feel free to save me a slice.</i>

544
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,050
Okay.

545
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,802
I'll see you tomorrow.

546
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,430
Good night, Donna.

547
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:27,576
Can he call you in the morning?
Now's not a really good time.

548
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,537
- It's kinda urgent.
-<i> ( faint chatter )</i>

549
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,583
Sweetheart, can you
come to the door
for a second?

550
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,960
We're hosting
game night.

551
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,379
Fun.

552
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,840
( quietly )
He's drunk.

553
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,634
What happened?

554
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:47,429
( stammers )

555
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,495
Are you okay?

556
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,079
Sorry, I don't usually...

557
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,456
No, it's perfectly
all right.

558
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:18,502
I think you're under
a lot of stress at work.

559
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,880
Joe's all wrong
about you.

560
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:26,301
( chuckles )
Joe's wrong about
a lot of things.

561
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:32,516
How close is he
to giving up on
all this?

562
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,894
I don't know.
He's pretty determined.

563
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,647
He just hired
a whole team
of programmers

564
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,733
and a manager
behind my back.

565
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,068
Really
pissed me off.

566
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,071
I hate to say it,
but that sounds
like Joe.

567
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,198
Did he pull this
at IBM?

568
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,701
All the time.

569
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:53,953
You know how he got
his three promotions
at IBM?

570
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,456
He took them.

571
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,250
One time,
he actually lied
to a supervisor--

572
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,627
guy who'd been with us
for over 20 years--

573
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,796
warned him that he
was going to be let go

574
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,090
and then strongly
suggested that he
tender his resignation

575
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,176
to maintain his dignity.

576
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:11,137
Poor guy believed him.

577
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,809
Hmm.

578
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,103
Well, if you say something
with the right authority,

579
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,898
you generally
get what you want.

580
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,652
You're so
full of shit.

581
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,114
What, did you actually
think I was gonna roll over

582
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,533
and just tell Joe
what a great guy you were?

583
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,912
You're both disgusting.

584
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:39,792
I don't think you
understand who you've
gotten into bed with.

585
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,044
It's only a matter of time
until he blows everything up.

586
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,672
He always does.

587
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:49,802
- Well, you would know.
- I gave him the world...

588
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,805
and he spat
in my face.

589
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,265
<i>He thinks everything</i>
<i>belongs to him...</i>

590
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,851
you included.

591
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,189
<i>( card taps )</i>

592
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,400
For when
you figure that out.

593
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,615
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

594
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,207
<i>( tapping keyboard )</i>

595
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:29,716
<i>( playing</i>
<i>"Fantaisie-Impromptu" )</i>

596
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:39,601
<i>( car approaches )</i>

597
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:45,106
<i>( car door opens,</i>
<i>closes )</i>

598
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,609
<i>( music continues )</i>

599
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,575
I'll only be
a minute.

600
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,869
We made a mistake
last night.

601
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:42,581
We offended you,
and for that,
I am sorry.

602
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,207
Mr. Clark
was too ashamed to come,

603
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,752
so I promised I would
apologize on his behalf

604
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,670
for getting drunk,
for giving the impression

605
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,923
that he doesn't respect
his father-in-law,

606
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,259
the man who was
gracious enough to put us
into contact with you.

607
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,803
That is not the case.
Not for him,

608
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,848
and certainly
not for me.

609
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,059
I'm not exaggerating
when I say

610
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,686
that I wouldn't be where
I am today if it weren't
for my father.

611
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,188
<i>The day I graduated</i>
<i>from his alma mater,</i>

612
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,067
<i>he brought me</i>
<i>into his company, IBM.</i>

613
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,904
He taught me the ropes.
He taught me everything
I know.

614
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:17,240
He told me to swing
for the fences and I've
never stopped swinging.

615
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,660
<i>I know it's a risk</i>
<i>showing up like this,</i>

616
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,245
but I will do
anything

617
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,998
to make you reconsider
being in business with us.

618
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,339
Excellent.

619
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,970
Bellboy:
<i>Sir?</i>

620
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,805
You forgot
your magazine.

621
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,807
I'm done with that.

622
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,405
Cameron:
Oh, don't bother.

623
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,117
- You're fired.
- Excuse you?

624
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,744
Oh, and it's not
'cause you're a tool,
which you are.

625
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,371
You can't fire me.
I'm<i> your</i> boss.

626
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,376
Hey.

627
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,211
Do you want
all your software
programmed in 11 weeks

628
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,755
for half of what
you're spending?

629
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,841
Is this
a trick question?

630
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,884
Brooks' Law,
"The Mythical
Man-Month."

631
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,095
The one useful book
I read in college.

632
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,930
Brooks said that
adding programmers

633
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:24,557
to speed up
a software project
only makes it later.

634
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,101
She's got
a real attitude problem.

635
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,186
Oh, also, I'm taking
over Steve's job.

636
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,856
- See what I mean?
- How would you know
which programmers to keep?

637
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,191
Do you even
know their names?

638
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,153
Hey!
( whistles )

639
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,237
Coder monkeys,
come here.

640
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,158
How many of you
got sucked into "Adventure"
last night?

641
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,829
I knew it.
She's sabotaging
the project, Joe.

642
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,040
Okay, just curious--
how many of you figured out

643
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,250
what order to push
the buttons in at the dam?

644
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,421
And how many of you
got out of the cave
by breaking the code?

645
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,137
I had to get home
to feed my cat.

646
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,805
Cameron:
<i>Which back doors</i>
<i>did you use?</i>

647
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,891
- Programmer:<i> "Xyzzy." </i>
- "Plover."

648
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,143
- "Plugh."
- Okay.

649
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,229
Lev, Yo-Yo, the rest
of you guys who cheated,

650
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,106
you get to keep
your jobs.

651
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,649
Those of you who played
fair and square,

652
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:18,070
thank you very much,
but you can go home.

653
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,863
Explain.

654
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,657
To play an honest game,
you have to be good
at solving puzzles.

655
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,410
But to cheat, you have
to be great at solving code.

656
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,245
Those are the guys
I need on my team--

657
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,455
the ones who can
break into the code,
find the back doors,

658
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,583
figure out "Plover"
and "Xyzzy"

659
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,418
and "Fee Fie Foe Foo"
to get it done.

660
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,336
- Did you find
"Fee Fie Foe Foo"?
- No.

661
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:41,384
Steve, I'll write you
a nice letter
of recommendation.

662
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,599
( tapping )

663
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,559
When I first heard
I'd be working
for Gordon Clark,

664
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,562
I wasn't sure
he even knew his way
around a motherboard.

665
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,398
Well, I've been proven wrong
a hundred times over,

666
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,027
and, today, my respect
for this guy has been
taken to a whole new level.

667
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:02,321
To Gordo,
for kicking ass
and taking names.

668
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,949
All:
To Gordo.

669
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,951
Thanks, Gordon.
Good job, buddy.

670
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,411
Hey, I see you told them
the good news about
the LCD screen.

671
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,623
Yeah, everyone's excited.

672
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,459
Good, I thought maybe
you didn't get my message.

673
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,461
No, I did.

674
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,296
Figured you'd
come by my office.

675
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,548
I've got work to do.

676
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,467
Don't you think
you owe me a thank-you?

677
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,430
No, Joe.
Actually, I don't.

678
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,641
Joe:
<i>Right.</i>

679
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,601
I only saved
your ass, the deal,

680
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,646
and your relationship
with your father-in-law.

681
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:38,066
( chuckles )
Gordon tell you how
he almost tanked the deal?

682
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,818
Joe, don't.

683
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,569
First, he does
eight shots of whiskey

684
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,322
trying to keep up with
the Japanese-- huge mistake.

685
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,867
So now he's wasted
and he follows the
chief engineer into--

686
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,995
Joe, I hate
to bust your bubble,

687
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,080
but you didn't save
a damn thing.

688
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:55,834
Gary did after
I went to his house
and asked him--

689
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,670
no, I begged him--
got down on my knees

690
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,299
to convince them
to reconsider.

691
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,636
The deal was done
before you ever got
to the hotel.

692
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:10,598
Do you want
his phone number
to thank him?

693
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,316
Look, you guys
take off.

694
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,485
I'll figure out
the heating problem.

695
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,949
Joe:
<i>Cameron...</i>

696
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,537
are you going
to this bowling alley
thing later?

697
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,455
I don't know.
It sounds dumb,

698
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,209
but some of the coders
are going.

699
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,295
It's amazing
what passes for
culture in Dallas.

700
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,551
I saw you took
your stuff out of
my apartment last night.

701
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,513
And a few things
that don't belong to you.

702
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,891
What things?

703
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,976
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>I think it's sweet</i>

704
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,395
that you wanted
to read the article in the
"Wall Street Quarterly."

705
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,106
I didn't take it.

706
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,734
<i>There's no shame</i>
<i>in caring about our project.</i>

707
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,737
I just need it back
so I can send it to
some retailers.

708
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,699
Your dad came
by the apartment.

709
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:13,661
<i>He took it.</i>

710
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,248
Did you talk to him?

711
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:20,252
Uh, I didn't
stay long.

712
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,756
The guys
are waiting for me.
