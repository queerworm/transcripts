00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,802
<i>( gunshots )</i>

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,646
So, we've got about
six grand in the bank.

3
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,690
It's not enough
to fund our own network,

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,566
but if we skip
payroll again--

5
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,361
No, we can't.
The coders are burnt.

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,070
We have to go back
to them with a plan.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,615
So most of our users
are gonna wake up,
log on,

8
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,827
and wonder
why we changed
our name to WestNet.

9
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:37,538
Look, I know
you want to strap Joe
to a rail and so do I--

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,123
- He's not a priority.
-<i> ( machine whirring )</i>

11
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,210
Okay, so,
all we've really
got at this point

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,587
is a house full
of Commodore 64s,

13
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,257
- the XTs, the furniture--
- And our games.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,135
I mean,
that's the only thing
they didn't steal, right?

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,680
"Extract &amp; Defend"
is our freshest title.

16
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,598
I think
it can fetch enough
to keep us afloat.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,267
You would do that?
You would sell?

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,687
Donna, this is
about survival.

19
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,147
Put out some feelers
to Sierra On-Line,

20
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,692
the cartridge market,
I'll reach out to
the independents.

21
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,653
What about WestNet?
It's too bad we can't
sue 'em.

22
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,864
- ( bullet clatters )
- Your turn.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,920
- ( gunshot )
- ( phone ringing )

24
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,341
Mm.

25
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,638
Yeah?

26
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,310
You gotta be kidding me.
Which-- I mean, where?

27
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,980
( groans )

28
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,941
Yeah, I know the one.

29
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,818
( sighs )

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,988
For God's sakes, Gordon,
you can shut up and wait.

31
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,953
- ( groans )
- What does he even want?

32
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,997
A ride home from jail.

33
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,316
- You need anything else?
- Nah, I'll make it.

34
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,820
Thanks.

35
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,073
Go straight home,
Gordon.

36
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,950
Clean yourself up.

37
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,663
Get on that damn plane.

38
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,581
Put all this behind you.

39
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,031
( exhales )

40
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,617
- Hey.
- Hey.

41
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,494
Is it true,
what I just heard?

42
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,455
Uh, probably.

43
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,083
That you're selling
what we've just spent

44
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,710
the last four months
of our lives on?

45
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,920
It's not like I have
much of a choice, Tom.

46
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:36,424
Okay, can we just--
can we just take it
slow for a second?

47
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,929
( scoffs )
Yes, I really wish
I had that luxury.

48
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,099
I just don't want you
to act too hastily, okay?
Or-- or-- or panic.

49
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,935
Can you--
I know what I'm doing.

50
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,770
Well, at what point
were you gonna tell me?

51
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,731
You know, the guy
who wrote the game.

52
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,566
- Cowrote it.
- Oh, we're splitting
hairs now.

53
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,359
Tom.

54
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,361
I'm tired, okay?

55
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,905
I smell like
gunpowder and beer

56
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,656
and I don't remember
my last shower.

57
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,243
Can you just--
here.

58
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,912
Whoever's still awake,
buy them breakfast, okay?

59
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,788
Tell them everything's
gonna be okay.

60
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,333
I'll take anything
with eggs and--

61
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,668
Green chilies,
yes, sir.

62
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,172
Jesus, can you
just do it?

63
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,931
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

64

<i>( car door opens, shuts )</i>

( pounds on door )

67
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,213
Can I help you?

68
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,008
Uh, is this JGL?

69
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,177
Who wants to know?

70
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,139
Uh, I'm Jim Clark.
I was interested
in their work.

71
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,974
( scoffs )
You're late.

72
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,433
Really?

73
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,019
Yeah, they're
out of business.

74
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,770
Cleared out on Friday.

75
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,605
We're hiring, though,
if you're interested.

76
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,650
Lot of late shifts,
but it's steady.

77
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,111
No. Thanks anyway.

78
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,030
All right.

79
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,160
Our lawyers advised us
to sue immediately,

80
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:11,121
but we're holding off
pending your cooperation.

81
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,708
That number represents
two years of our overhead

82
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,211
plus treble damages.

83
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,963
I only took this meeting
because, as a former client,

84
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,923
I thought you deserved
an explanation.

85
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,258
That's sort of like
a ransom note

86
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,676
after the victim's
already dead.

87
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,595
- I prefer transformed.
- ( scoffs )

88
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,057
Some ideas need
a larger ecosystem.

89
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,767
Give a buffalo
a million acres,
it thrives.

90
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,562
Stick it
on a desert island,
in four generations,

91
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,190
- it's the size of a poodle.
- That's a charming anecdote,

92
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,608
but I work for a living,
so can we move this
along, please?

93
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,028
- We violated no copyrights.
- We own proprietary
algorithms--

94
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,612
You were making
it up as you went,
at least admit it.

95
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,740
Connecting subscribers
in discreet communities--

96
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,326
- The Source does a version
of that-- Delphi, CompuServe.
- Not like us.

97
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,745
Not the same way as us.

98
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,497
This idea belongs
to its originators.

99
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,709
If that were true,
Coca-Cola would still
be a cough syrup.

100
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,878
This community
doesn't like copycats.

101
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,630
We are prepared to reach
out to every trade magazine
in the country,

102
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,841
every reporter
on the tech beat.

103
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,136
Like Leslie Wu Foley
from "PC Magazine"?

104
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,305
Reese Jenkins?
John Krinkey?

105
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,267
Not so close together,
please, guys.

106
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,062
They'll all be sitting here,
right here, in a few hours.

107
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,772
And since
I invited them weeks ago,

108
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,191
I suspect they'll view
your claims as sour grapes.

109
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,485
- We'll do a side-by-side.
-<i> If they can even find Mutiny.</i>

110
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,738
When are you guys
going back up,
by the way?

111
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,408
<i>Look around, Donna.</i>

112
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,785
We're announcing today.

113
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,620
We're all in.

114
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,580
And you're gonna sit there
and tell me, what?

115
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,416
I should've
nobly stepped aside,

116
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,668
watched you guys flop around
for years gasping for air,

117
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,879
shopping your little
regional product

118
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,007
door-to-door
like Thin Mints?

119
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,842
- I'll see you in court.
- Oh, come on.

120
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,928
We both know that's
not gonna happen.

121
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,601
Sorry we couldn't
help each other out.

122
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,646
Holding hands
with Joe MacMillan
never ends well.

123
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,274
Trust me, I know.

124
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,402
What makes you think Joe
had anything to do with this?

125
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,744
You gotta be kidding me.

126
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,132
I think I found
my book idea.

127
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,009
I'm gonna start outlining
it on the plane.

128
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,219
- That's great.
What's it about?
- You.

129
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,887
( laughs )

130
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,889
No, not you individually.

131
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,309
It's more like
the price of adaptation
on modern life.

132
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,562
You know,
transformation, pain.

133
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,105
How many of those pills
have you taken?

134
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,150
( laughs )
No, seriously.

135
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,110
Creative disruption,
you know?

136
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,030
You upset people,
but so does anybody
who rocks the boat.

137
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,658
But you also
gave birth to some
pretty special things.

138
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,580
- ( laughs )
- I'm taking one
for the road.

139
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,041
The movers don't
get here till 3:00.

140
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,418
<i>( knock on door )</i>

141
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,169
Oh.

142
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,677
Joe.

143
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,055
May I?

144
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,725
- Dad.
- Hey, sunshine.

145
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,394
I'm sorry, I'm a mess.

146
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,145
Oh, nonsense.
You look terrific.

147
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,189
( kisses )

148
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:10,068
I just wanted to wish
the happy couple
bon voyage.

149
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,657
So...

150
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,368
Go West, young man.

151
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,412
Still a wide-open business.

152
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,664
Do well, blaze a trail,
who knows?

153
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,751
Maybe Westgroup will open
an office out there someday.

154
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,795
I have no doubt.

155
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,922
Dad, this is beautiful.

156
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,092
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,094
Oh, you're gonna
love it out there.

158
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,846
<i>It's the land</i>
<i>of second chances.</i>

159
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,182
Joe, may I have a word?

160
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,729
- Bye, sweetheart.
-<i> Bye.</i>

161
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,898
You didn't seriously
think that bullshit
would buy my silence?

162
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,275
No.

163
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,776
You're far too
emotional for that.

164
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,070
You stole
intellectual property.

165
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,948
Actually,
I tried to buy it.

166
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,409
A very generous offer,
as I recall.

167
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,620
Only the deal
went south somehow.

168
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,164
No need to dance.
I went behind your back.

169
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,583
I told Mutiny
not to sell and I'm glad.

170
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:11,129
Every instinct I had
about you was correct,
except how low you'd stoop.

171
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,424
- We're done.
- Are we?

172
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,217
What if I went public?

173
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,346
I'm your son-in-law.
I string together

174
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,640
the right 10 words,
your stock's in the toilet.

175
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,808
You don't
want to do that.

176
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,978
Do you have any idea
how hard it's gonna be
for you to start over?

177
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,315
Without Westgroup,
your resume reads
like a rap sheet.

178
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,359
I'll try my luck.

179
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,070
And Sara? How would
your little stunt
affect her?

180
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,782
There's no upside
to grudges.

181
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,204
Come to our shareholders'
meeting this afternoon.

182
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,122
The day
I vouch for you...

183
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,542
There'll be a lot
of very important
people there.

184
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,503
People who can
make a difference
to your future.

185
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,588
Sara will be delighted.

186
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,507
And we can part friends.

187
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,305
We're not friends.
We're family.

188
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,807
We'll see each other
at Christmas every
other year.

189
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,809
We'll nod to each other
across the room,

190
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,270
and after about
45 minutes of fake
chit chat and eggnog,

191
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,649
I'll make an excuse.
"We have to be somewhere.
I'm so sorry."

192
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:16,277
And when my children
ask me who that tall gray
stranger in the window is,

193
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,863
I'll remind them,
"That's your grandpa."

194
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,577
I'll see you there.

195
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,162
<i>( engine starts )</i>

196
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,874
- Ahem.
- ( knocks )

197
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,419
Oh, no, it's not
a two-person shooter,

198
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,837
<i>it's a two-perspective</i>
<i>shooter, so it's--</i>

199
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,384
No, we're not compatible
with that platform.

200
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,886
Okay, no, thank you
for your time.

201
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,305
Bye.

202
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,015
Hey, cut that out.

203
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,225
What?

204
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,643
That down-in-the-mouth crap.

205
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,895
Come on, buyers hear defeat,
they scatter quicker

206
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,813
than crawfish
at a church boil.

207
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,900
You're the boss bitch
around here.

208
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,362
Queen of the Nile.
Sittin' on a gold mine.

209
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,282
People be lucky
you don't charge
admission, get me?

210
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,202
You look sharp.

211
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,872
( sighs )

212
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,124
What's that?

213
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,544
Oh, this is...

214
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,129
our next interface.

215
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,339
See these
quick link boxes?

216
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,634
<i>They'll kick users</i>
<i>right over to their</i>
<i>favorite area.</i>

217
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,302
<i>I've already started</i>
<i>coding it.</i>

218
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,264
I'm sorry, did you
want to talk to me
about something?

219
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,017
No, nothing important.

220
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,734

00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,989

I'm just, uh,
looking for my car.

223
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,410
Sir, this area
is for employees only.

224
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,370
You can't get in
without a pass.

225
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,373
- Do you have a pass?
- No, I, uh...

00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,250
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>what level you were on?</i>

227
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,379
I wasn't really
paying attention.

228
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,007
- Maybe 5F?
-<i> There is no 5F.</i>

229
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,176
This is basement
level west.

230
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,805
Maybe it was an E you saw.
Did you park in 5 East?

231
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,974
Maybe that's it.

232
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,810

- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

235
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,367
I'm fine, thanks.

236
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,503
Who are these people?

237
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,630
Out of, like,
100 cold calls,

238
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,841
they're the ones
that called back.

239
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,009
Word is they're just
a few weeks old.

240
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,345
Yeah.

241
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,430
So Westgroup
didn't back down?

242
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,434
No, the creep
practically blew his nose
in our settlement offer.

243
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,729
What did Joe say?

244
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,772
He wasn't there.

245
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,693
I don't think Joe
knew about WestNet.

246
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,903
I think maybe he was
telling us the truth.

247
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,825
Okay, we're
ready for you.

248
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,046
Oh, actually, guys,
we're in here today.

249
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,970
( whispers )
Okay, well, 
here we go.

250
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,389
Sara:
<i>Maybe you should go.</i>

251
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,140
To the shareholders'
meeting?

252
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,393
Yeah, I mean,
he'd never expect it.

253
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,186
He thinks
you're too proud.

254
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,150
But think about it.
You know, you go there
in front of everyone.

255
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,780
Let them see that
it started with you,
your vision.

256
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,784
Just try and pull
something good out
of this fiasco.

257
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,828
Then we can just
leave it all behind.

258
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,080
Make a clean break.

259
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,710
Look, it's up to you.

260
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,087
I'll be by your side
either way.

261
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,429
Cameron:
<i>So, half the game</i>
<i>is a spy thriller.</i>

262
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,640
Your mission
is to infiltrate
the Soviet prison

263
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,267
and rescue the starving
dissident or...

264
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,894
You're an elite
KGB prison guard.

265
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,854
Your orders--
find and shoot
the American

266
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,522
<i>before he escapes</i>
<i>with your prisoner.</i>

267
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,691
So each level can be played
as either hide or seek.

268
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,444
While totally scrambling
our Cold War preconceptions.

269
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,780
Right, it's like
"Gorky Park" meets
"Red Dawn."

270
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,907
If we can port
the code.

271
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,367
Graphically,
there's no reason

272
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,911
it can't run
off a cartridge.

273
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,830
But without the live
two-player aspect,

274
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,625
- isn't it just
"Battlezone" in a prison?
- No.

275
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,544
No, we like to think
that the tension

276
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,464
and the claustrophobia
really set it apart.

277
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,591
Cool.
It's definitely cool.

278
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,845
Man:
<i>Bryce, a couple</i>
<i>of coffees?</i>

279
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,848
Um, one second, guys.

280
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,017
- I gotta just go that way.
- Oh, sure.

281
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,523
Look, conceptually,
it's really strong.

282
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,400
I just wish we could cover
your development costs.

283
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,279
What you're asking,
it's kind of out
of our price range.

287
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,585

just get out of here.

Let's see.

294
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,527
Looks like you're
headquartered up
in Redmond.

295
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,779
What is this?
Distribution network?

296
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,575
- That's confidential.
-<i> That's nationwide, mm-mm.</i>

297
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,827
Gents must have
some serious backers.

298
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,204
Mr. Bosworth,
I'm gonna have
to insist--

299
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:04,500
Oh, hell, I got no interest
in blowin' your grand plans,
whatever they are.

300
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,711
Yeah, it's a free country.

301
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,463
Couple things, though.

302
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,633
One, well, there ain't
no need to cold-room us

303
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,053
with the toddlers
just to drive down
our price.

304
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,014
Hell, we're
reasonable people.

305
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:22,977
Two, it's a lot easier
to establish a beachhead
under a friendly flag.

306
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,898
Why do you think Toyota's
building cars in Fremont
rather than Fuji-what-now?

307
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,026
Well, four little words--
Made in the U.S.A.

308
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,653
<i>Your partners,</i>
<i>say they land their product</i>

309

<i>with strictly</i>
<i>Japanese games--</i>

310
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,741
ones they hire you
to retitle and repackage--

311
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,785
man, that sounds
kind of sneaky, huh?

312
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,578
Kind of like an invasion.

313
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,163
But say they ship
some homegrown titles,

314
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,832
ones they developed
on these shores.

315
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,167
Boy, that's
kumbaya time.

316
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:51,338
Hands across the ocean.
Might be worth acquiring
for the PR value alone.

317
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,133
Hell, it'll also
make you look smart,
out ahead of the curve.

323
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,796

When do we get paid?

- Who made the purchase?
- How much?

325
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,883
- 50 grand.
- 50 grand?

326
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,510
Enough to hire
a new network

327
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,929

00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,515
Congratulations.

343
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,184
Thanks.

344
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,605
Must've been hard, right?

345
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,941
No, actually.

346
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,026
I feel lighter.

347
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,904
I feel clearer
than I've been in a while.

348
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,615
What's that
supposed to mean?

349
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,039
Look, if this company's
gonna survive, it needs
me 100% focused.

350
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,500
- What we've been doing--
- You mean our relationship?

351
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,045
Yeah.

352
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,924
I got too complacent
and happy.

353
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,468
I let my guard down
and it cost us.

354
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:47,014
Happiness is not
some side effect.

355
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,642
- It's kind of
the whole point.
- Okay.

356
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,102
I'm not blaming you.

357
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,979
I'm taking
responsibility.

358
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,355
I made this happen.

359
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,899
Actually, I think Joe
is making this happen,

360
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,651
and I think you
can't get over it.

361
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,820
<i>Maybe you never have.</i>

362
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,863
<i>You used me.</i>

363
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:06,242
You made me believe
in what we were doing here.

364
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,001
You know...

365
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,794
you're a lot more like him
than you think.

366
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,508
Do you mind?

367
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,391

Need help with that?

371
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,463
It's technical.

372
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,759
( sighs )
Keynote in front
of the board,

373
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,012
that's quite
the wedding gift.

374
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,515
Do me a favor,
get off the stage
before I throw you off.

375
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,602
By the way, a reporter
wants a word with you.

376
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,313
She says she's
an old friend.

377
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,089
I assume you're here
to humiliate me in front
of hundreds of people?

378
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,258
Tempting.

379
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,261
But, no, I guess that's
no longer necessary.

380
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,846
Yeah.
I'm done.

381
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,932
I guess when my life
goes up in a mushroom cloud,

382
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:57,644
I just naturally assume
you're behind it somehow.

383
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,980
Old habits.

384
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,650
You leaving town?

385
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,195
<i>That's right.</i>

386
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,239
With your fiancée?

387
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,242
Wife, actually.

388
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:18,332
Going to California
was my idea.

389
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,666
Remember?

390
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,172
( sighs )

391
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,091
At COMDEX.

392
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,428
You almost convinced me.

393
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:40,187
Someone close to me
said that there must
be a reason

394
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,522
why you're still
a part of my life.

395
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,526
<i>Do you ever wonder?</i>

396
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,029
I mean, what if

397
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,949
instead of chasing

398
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:56,494
what each of us wanted
separately and obsessively...

399
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,293
we just held on
to each other instead?

400
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,801
( sighs )

401
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,137
I know you didn't
copy our interface.

402
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,850
I know it wasn't
your fault.

403
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,566
I didn't want you to leave
without hearing that.

404
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,867
And...

405
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,495
I must be totally mental,
because part of me

406
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:40,706
doesn't want you
to go away at all.

407
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,085
You have no idea--

408
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,099
Cameron,
I can't do this.

409
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,393
No.

410
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,772
You're Joe MacMillan.
I think you can do
whatever you want.

411
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,661
Sorry.

412
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,054
Here.

413
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,059
That's what
it could've been.

414
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,347
- One last run-through?
- Yeah, just a sec.

415
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,192
Okay, let's go.

416
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,361
( applause )

417
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,036
Welcome.

418
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,165
It's wonderful
to see you all here.

419
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,041
I hope you all
got a chance

420
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,419
to check out our
communication terminals.

421
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,089
Now you might ask,
"Why is an energy company

422
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,509
messing around
with computers?"

423
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,263
I want to introduce you
to the man who conceived
of our grand strategy,

424
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,850
<i>whose passion convinced</i>
<i>even a stubborn old</i>
<i>fossil like me.</i>

425
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,686
My son-in-law,
Joe MacMillan. Joe?

426
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,565
( applause )

427
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,203
From the cave paintings
to the funny pages,

428
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,664
the stone tablets
to the telephone,

429
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:31,001
we humans seek,
we crave connection.

430
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,587
The exchange of our
thoughts and ideas

431
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,340
from the trivial
to the sublime.

432
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,970

With just a few
keystrokes on a PC,

435
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,438
talk to loved ones
across the country.

436
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,234
Share a stock tip,
a story, tell a joke.

437
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,819
Or, better yet,
find new friends.

438
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,072
People who share
your interests--

439
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,908
music, politics,
movies, sports.

440
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,662
It's a never-ending
conversation on tap 24/7.

441
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,707
No boundaries,
no borders.

442
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,334
It's a pathway
to a new world.

443
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:18,173
The key, of course,
is the unique interface.

444
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,384
It makes participation
not just fun,

445
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,178
not just exciting,
but addictive.

446
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,930
And all this--

447
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,275
I mean...

448
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,859
all this--

449
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,835
This all began
with a very talented

450
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,547
young programmer
named Cameron Howe.

451
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,175
<i>She saw the future</i>
<i>and she got there first.</i>

452
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:06,096
I didn't build this.
I don't own it,

453
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,390
and neither
does anyone here.

454
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:12,519
If we skate past that,
we're doing violence
to the one thing,

455
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:16,898
maybe the only sacred thing
in our business-- innovation.

456
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,443
<i>Cameron couldn't</i>
<i>be here today,</i>

457
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,613
but her genius
is all around us.

458
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,866
And will be, I suspect,
for years to come.

00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,127
It might be time for me
to move on outta here.

518
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,379
Yeah.

519
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,341
Wait, what?

520
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,805
- Are you quitting?
- I'm afraid so.

521
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:02,475
I went for an interview,
and, hell, I guess
they're desperate.

522
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,394
( laughs )
You can't.

523
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,022
We just got back
on our feet. We won.

524
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,482
Yep, and I wish
I could say I was
looking forward

525
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,318
to the next all-night
down-and-dirty scrap,

526
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,737
but I--

527
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,826
what've I got, five years
left of my career?

528
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,745
10, tops?

529
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,247
I gotta get something
stable for my family.

530
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,458
Hell, soon my grandkids.

531
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,001
I'll give you a raise.

532
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,670
It ain't
about the money.

533
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:41,473
I'm just too damn old
to be eating three meals
a day out of a toaster.

534
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:45,102
It's undignified.
( laughs )

535
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,271
It's fun.

536
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,984
Well, yeah.
It has been.

537
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,740
Well, what if I don't
accept your resignation?

538
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,159
It'd disappoint me
if you did.

539
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,132
I'll call you tomorrow.

540
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,468
<i>You know, Catherine...</i>

541
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,306
get some sleep, hon.

542
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,071
The next thing you know,
I'm at the bottom
of a stairwell.

543
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,239
So you blacked out?

544
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,492
Maybe,
I don't know.

545
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,285
I just sort of
lost track.

546
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,412
I mean, you know
how I get.

547
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,752
Doc, like
a bad penny, huh?

548
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,338
Can't get rid of me.
( chuckles )

549
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,923
You gonna slap
a cast on this thing,

550
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,300
send me back out
into the wild or what?

551
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,386
Got your juice,
I see.

552
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,262
Yep.

553
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,849
- Just a moment?
- Yeah.

554
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,315
I'm so sorry.
Gordon told me his CTE
was under control.

555
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,442
It is.
We did an MRI last week.

556
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,695
The disease
hasn't progressed.

557
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,489
Then I don't understand.

558
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:25,493
This episode
was not symptomatic.

559
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,245
It was psychological.

560
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:31,083
He was dehydrated.
He got lost.

561
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:34,586
For seven hours,
Donna?

562
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,671
The paramedics said
that he broke down
in the ambulance.

563
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,256
Did he mention that
to you?

564
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:45,805
A serious diagnosis
can sometimes bring out
underlying problems.

565
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,975
Has Gordon ever
experienced manic behavior

566
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,019
or paranoia
in the past?

567
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,855
Um...

568
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,529
That bad, huh?

569
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,117
So...

570
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,577
I don't think
you're gonna get
to come home tonight.

571
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,832
Dr. Semel thinks,
and I believe him,

572
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:16,335
that this goes beyond
what we talked about.

573
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,504
- He thinks--
- I know, I know.

574
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,591
I need help.

575
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,473
I was set up.
She sabotaged me.

576
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:32,560
Christ, can you
even hear your own
rationalizations anymore?

577
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,313
You know,
I'm getting tired
of being second-guessed

578
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,565
and manipulated
and distrusted

579
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,985
when I have
done absolutely
nothing wrong.

580
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,903
Well, why should I
believe a word you say?

581
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,197
Because you're
my goddamn wife!

582
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,164
Ahem.

583
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,750
I don't care about
what you did to my dad.

584
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,463
You two
deserve each other.

585
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,965
It's why you did it.

586
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,928
All this time,
I thought that you

587
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,555
were a victim
of your genius,

588
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,391
some sidetracked prophet...

589
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,812
( voice breaks )
and that I was your
second chance.

590
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,691
But you're not,
are you, Joe?

591
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,945
You're an accident.

592
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,948
You're something
that happens

593
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,117
to people
who deserve better.

594
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,621
I'm not an accident.

595
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,250
I deserve better.

596
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,628
I deserve you.

597
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,934
( sobbing )

598
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,943
I just wish
that you knew what
this felt like.

599
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:10,616
That you could
just see your face
when you say her name.

600
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,080
Say it, Joe.

601
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,500
Say Cameron.

602
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,183
God, you're lost.

603
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,316
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

604
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,318
We'll take anything
you can give us--

605
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,695
programming notes,
level layouts.

606
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,365
Yeah, okay, I'll pack
it up and have someone
drop it off tomorrow.

607
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:54,119
Thanks.
I know it's not easy
letting go of your baby.

608
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,454
Yeah, so what's
your plan?

609
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,332
Did you guys
find a platform
to launch it on?

610
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:03,253
Yeah, I think we've got
someone in mind.

611
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,088
Probably have to change
the name, though.

612
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,258
"Extract &amp; Defend,"
was that your idea or Tom's?

613
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,803
- What?
-<i> Tom Rendon.</i>
<i>He's so talented.</i>

614
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,263
Tried to poach him
from you guys,

615
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,931
but he said
he'd rather go it alone.

616
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,100
<i>You've seen</i>
<i>his "Parallax" clone, right?</i>

617
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,018
<i>Genius.</i>

618
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,395
Do you know him?

619
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:23,106
Yeah, we've been
trading hacks for years.

620
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,857
How do you think
we found out about you?

621
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,609
<i>He tipped us off.</i>

622
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,445
<i>Practically broke my arm</i>
<i>till I took the meeting.</i>

623
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,072
-<i> ( rustling on phone ) </i>
- Amy:<i> Hello?</i>

624
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,201
Hey.

625
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,911
Why didn't you tell me?

626
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:40,457
What was there to say?
You already made
your decision.

627
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,375
Wait.

628
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,127
Tom, stop.

629
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,712
Stop!

630
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,344
You'll come back.

631
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,056
You'll wake up
tomorrow morning

632
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,767
and you'll ride
your stupid bike
back here

633
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,062
and I'll make coffee
and you'll pour
your Raisin Bran

634
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,564
and we'll just come up
with something new.

635
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,608
Wait.

636
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,444
I couldn't have done
any of this without you!

637
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,945
<i>No, Cameron.</i>

638
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,365
You did this
all by yourself.
