1
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,554
( whirring )

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,641
You know why vegetables
are a better way to start
your morning?

3
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:19,269
Because they contain fiber,
which helps with your digestion.

4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,104
You know what that is?

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,941
I just did number two.
Can I have Frosted Flakes?

6
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,610
Remember our little talk
about trying new things?

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,992
98.7.
Get dressed for school.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,204
Mommy, I still don't
feel well and Daddy's
making me go to school.

9
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,081
Sweetheart,
Mommy really can't afford
to get sick right now.

10
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,834
Let me make you
a pot of coffee.

11
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:45,671
Oh, thanks,
but I gotta get
to the office.

12
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,257
Could you feel my forehead?
I'm afraid I'm coming down
with whatever Joanie has.

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,634
Had.

14
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,890
Cool as a cucumber,
just like you.

15
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,892
( chuckles )

16
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,310
Come on,
you know I'm late.

17
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,603
All right,
I get it.

18
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,438
Gordon, I'm not mad.
I really am late.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,524
No, I know.
I don't want you
to be late for work.

20
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,739
Uh, thank you
for squeezing me
into your schedule.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,993
Happy to.
You've got my ear until
the day begins in earnest.

22
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,496
- What's on your mind?
- Opportunity.

23
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,331
Well, let me
stop you there.

24
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,208
I don't have
any job openings.

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,335
Well, that works out well
because I don't want a job.

26
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,922
You're sitting
on a gold mine.

27
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,716
Give me six months,
I'll turn Network
and Computer Systems

28
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,593
into an income-generating
department.

29
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,554
( laughs )
Okay, I'll play.

30
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,723
I work right next
to the mainframe sites.

31
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,225
They're powered on
all day, every day.

32
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,520
On nights and weekends,
they're just sitting there idle.

33
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,064
We lease
our mainframe space

34
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,774
and our network
during off hours

35
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,525
to third-party
businesses

36
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,611
who need a larger,
more powerful network.

37
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,154
Overhead is near zero.
It's pure profit.

38
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,407
It's too big
a security risk.

39
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,118
We have sensitive
business transactions
running on our mainframe.

40
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,203
Now, see,
you don't understand
how a mainframe works.

41
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,330
We can configure
the privilege settings

42
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,499
to lock these users into
a tightly controlled area.

43
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,460
Think of it
as a padded cell.

44
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,129
No outside user can access
our company files.

45
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,256
And that's
just the beginning.

46
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,427
This department
would be an incubator
for a large-scale operation.

47
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,471
We can turn
this juggernaut

48
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,015
into one massive,
forward-thinking entity

49
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,517
and you, you'll be
on a first-name basis
with Jacob Wheeler.

50
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:27,022
<i>All we have to do</i>
<i>is imagine it, trust it,</i>

51
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,190
and flip the switch.

52
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,487
If you believe so much
in this vision for Westgroup,

53
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,031
why don't you share it
with your future
father-in-law?

54
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,994
Oh, I know who you are.

55
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,371
You didn't think I'd take
a meeting with some plebe
from the data center, did you?

56
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,046
I was here before
her first marriage blew up

57
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,674
and I'll be here
after she's done
with you, too.

58
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,178
( sighs )

59
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,822
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,533
- So do your thing
and then I'll--
- Yeah, I got it.

61
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,211
Okay, so, I just wanted
to thank everyone

62
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,464
for busting their asses
the last few days,

63
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,008
pretty much
without sleep.

64
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,427
<i>It's no secret</i>
<i>that we're struggling,</i>

65
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,180
through no fault
of anyone here,

66
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,973
<i>to keep the lights on.</i>

67
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,599
<i>Every penny counts,</i>

68
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,062
so thank you, guys,
for being such good sports.

69
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,023
It's not game over,
but we are on life support.

70
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,316
We're operating
with a third of our XTs

71
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,779
and our subscribers
keep cancelling.

72
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,992
( laughs )
I don't know, I guess
there's no honor among gamers.

73
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,748
So we're kind of--

74
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,666
look, we're spending more
than we're making,

75
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,002
which is
a mathematical--

76
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,088
We're almost out of money.

77
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,550
What little we have we need
to cover operating costs,

78
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:23,180
so what that means
is that we can't afford to pay
your salaries right now.

79
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,515
But in exchange for you
forgoing your salaries,

80
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,142
we're offering you
shares of the company,

81
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,436
which will be worth
a lot more in the long run.

82
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,776
- In success.
- Yes.

83
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,903
Yes, in success.

84
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,697
Look, this is what
we all signed up for.

85
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,366
It's the risk of working
at a company like this,

86
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,955
but don't forget
that the upside is
also so much greater.

87
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,748
I think it's a risk
worth taking,

88
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,668
but each of you
need to decide that
for yourself.

89
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,347
I'm in.

90
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,309
Me, too.

91
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,769
Yep.

92
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,020
( speaks Russian )

93
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,396
In.

94
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,857
( laughs )

95
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm out.

96
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,195
C-come on, man.

97
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,490
It's been a sweet ride.

98
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,784
Student loans, sorry.

99
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,832
Hey, can we talk
about this?

100
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,542
I'm not going to take
that kind of risk

101
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,253
on a bunch
of online games.

102
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,840
<i>( zips bag )</i>

103
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,675
Have fun
writing cartridges.

104
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,635
That's what you've
always wanted to do,

105
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,387
so I just gave you
an easy excuse.

106
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,432
Or maybe I don't
think the shares

107
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,976
are gonna
be worth anything.

108
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,241
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

109
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,067
<i>( paper rustling )</i>

110
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,614
( sighs )

111
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,792
Two days in a row.

112
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,212
What, are you angling
to come back to work?

113
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:04,423
Work? You ain't paying
anybody anything.

114
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,177
More like volunteerin'.

115
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,554
No, I had an errand
to run this side of town.

116
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,766
Thought I'd bring you
over some breakfast tacos

117
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,642
'cause y'all are starting
to look like POWs around here.

118
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,270
Mm.

119
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,106
And I noticed this file
with your invoices in it

120
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:24,403
and a couple places where
you could cut some costs
popped out at me.

121
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,989
If you're interested
in hearing my suggestions.

122
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,783
Yeah.

123
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
That's it, I'm going
back to games.

124
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,209
Oh, no, Lev,
you're doing great.

125
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,002
You can handle this.
It's just six rooms.

126
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,837
18.

127
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,298
You really do
tune me out.

128
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,300
Come on,
how did that happen?

129
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,343
You told me any time
there's a lot of chatter
on a subject

130
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,471
to create a new room
for those users.

131
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,848
This is really
incredible, Lev.

132
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,601
I just finished creating
a new room and now a bunch
of bird feeder enthusiasts

133
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,229
have hijacked the Catty Cathys
to discuss using cat litter

134
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,773
- in the bottom
of bird feeders.
- Let me see, let me see.

135
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,608
So now the Catty Cathys
are pissed off

136
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,153
because they can't
follow their urine odor
removal thread,

137
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:10,865
which pisses me off
because I hate cats
and Chatty Cathys.

138
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,369
We have users
coming into our rooms
just to complain?

139
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,621
Do we have people signing up
just for Community?

140
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,459
Do you need me
to draw you a Venn diagram
of cat ladies and gamers?

141
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,794
Not a whole lot
of overlap.

142
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,965
Now can we please
ask Cameron for another body?

143
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,762
When we get up to 30 rooms,
you let me know.

144
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,267
We already
sent out mailers

145
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,519
with instructions on
reinstalling the software.

146
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,771
- They're still cancelling.
- Well, of course they are.

147
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,648
You just gave
your girlfriend
the clap.

148
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,817
You think
sendin' out mailers
is gonna fix that?

149
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,611
- ( laughs )
- You gotta send her flowers,
not penicillin.

150
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:53,116
- What do you suggest we do?
- First of all, your image
needs rehabilitation.

151
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:57,204
I noticed an invoice here
for prepaid ad space
in "Byte Magazine."

152
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,332
Look, use this
to change the story.

153
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,335
That sounds great,
but we can't afford
an ad agency right now.

154
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,838
No, you don't need one.
Two words in bold black
lettering-- we're hiring.

155
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,632
Folks see that,
they think you're cooking
on the front burner.

156
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,511
Look, and a little splash
of color would be nice
in there somewhere.

157
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,429
Draw the eye,
won't break the bank.

158
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,765
Yeah, maybe a photo
of our staff at work.

159
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,642
- Bosworth:<i> Mm-hmm. </i>
- ( laughs ) Yeah,
that'll really pop.

160
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,978
What, Bodie and Wonderboy
hunched over their keyboards?

161
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,232
Yeah, or it'll remind people
of Steve Jobs starting Apple
in his garage.

162
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,192
People can't
seem to get enough
of that old chestnut.

163
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,820
Hey, no more cold calls.
You've got to go door-to-door.

164
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,241
- Boz, we don't
have the manpower.
- Just go after the whales.

165
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,244
- Hmm?
- Your whales,
your top dogs.

166
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,746
Those 10 names
that I highlighted here,

167
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,122
these are
your biggest spenders.

168
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,623
Start with them.

169
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,626
Uh, okay, I guess
we could send Lev out.

170
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,712
He k-kind of passes
for normal.

171
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,464
Oh, no, no,
I need Lev for Community.

172
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,092
- Why?
- We're up to
almost 20 rooms.

173
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,594
- What? That's huge.
-<i> I know, that's a little bit</i>
<i>of good news, right?</i>

174
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,388
- W-when did that happen?
- Ahem.

175
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,889
- Just this morning.
He showed me--
- Ahem!

176
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,974
Ladies, this is
where you say,

177
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,768
"Could you please do this
for us, Bosworth?

178
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,562
You are an unbelievable
salesman."

179
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,481
And I say,
"No, that chapter
in my life is closed."

180
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,733
And then you say,
"Please do us this favor?"

181
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,360
And I say,
"No, I cannot."

182
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,945
And then it goes
back and forth like that

183
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,030
a couple more times
and I say yes.

184
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,709
Thanks.

185
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,253
I can take it from here.

186
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,670
What am I supposed to write
on the work order?

187
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,214
What work order?

188
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,763
What's going on?
Why am I the only one
pitching today, guys?

189
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,601
Come on, sky's the limit.
Whatever-- whatever
comes to mind.

190
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,394
Come on, guys,
let's get serious.

191
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,895
There's shares
on the line here.

192
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,190
- ( laughs )
- Oh...

193
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,900
Yeah.

194
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,069
Uh, we could do
our version of "Bard's Tale,"

195
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:57,865
but the players try to free
a princess who's actually
a hobbit in disguise.

196
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,075
<i>( men murmur )</i>

197
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,744
Okay, I think
we need to go bigger.

198
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,247
Uh, maybe I'm not
explaining it very well.

199
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,915
You see,
the players, um--

200
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,668
What if we create
a shooter game

201
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,420
that's totally
immersive?

202
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,381
That shows the player's
perspective of his surroundings.

203
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,217
- And you want to try
to do this online?
- Yeah. What?

204
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,261
I mean, I know we're
more limited in the kind
of graphics we can do,

205
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,805
but if we pulled it off,
it would be amazing.

206
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,184
Uh, what's a good enemy?
And no tanks or aliens.

207
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,270
- We need something fresh.
-<i> ( door closes )</i>

208
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,897
- Morning.
- Sorry, I got held up.

209
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,400
- Okay, leave
a little earlier.
-<i> ( men snicker )</i>

210
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,944
- Bodie:<i> Okay,</i>
<i>I-- I got it. </i>
- Yeah.

211
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,864
Find and kill E.T. before
he eats your Reese's Pieces.

212
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,033
- No!
- ( men laugh )

213
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,243
Amit:
<i>Bodie, that's,</i>
<i>like, the worst.</i>

214
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,786
Okay, let's stop
while we're stuck

215
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,163
and then we can
pick up again tomorrow.

216
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,333
- Good?
- Well, that was...

217
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,460
Arki:
Bodie, it was a bad idea.

218
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,463
He will eat candy.
You cannot kill E.T.

219
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,590
Bodie:
It's just
some Reese's Pieces.

220
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,509
- Hey.
- Hey.

221
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,844
Sorry, would you be
more comfortable in one
of the bedrooms?

222
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,348
No, no, I'm good.
I just need to fuel up.

223
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,685
- What's going on
with you?
- Nothing.

224
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,436
I just-- I slept
through my alarm

225
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,770
and I guess
I'm just really tired.

226
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,315
Okay, we're all
really tired.

227
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,983
Just because you're not
getting paid anymore

228
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,610
doesn't mean you can
show up late for work.

229
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,279
- It's bad for morale.
- It won't happen again.

230
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,906
- Okay.
- Okay.

231
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,667
- ( panting )
-<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

232
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,589
<i>( distant dog barking )</i>

233
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,734
Hey.

234
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,278
I didn't see you there.

235
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,363
- You been waiting long?
- Just got here.

236
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,116
Oh, I was out
doing my miles.

237
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,784
Did-- did nine miles.

238
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,746
Whoo!
( panting )

239
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,914
You want a smoothie?
I'm making one for myself.

240
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,166
Sure. When did you start
drinking smoothies?

241
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,085
Um...

242
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,255
- hold on, let me get closer.
- ( button clicking )

243
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,549
I wasn't kidding there
when I told you I was
getting back into shape.

244
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,509
You know,
1985's my year, man.

245
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,762
I'm eating better,
I'm exercising.

246
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:27,098
You know, I haven't jogged
regularly since, I mean,
I don't even know.

247
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,891
Adidas came out
with that track suit.

248
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,145
Exactly.
It's already
paying off, too.

249
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,897
Doctor called yesterday,
said that my blood work's good.

250
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,775
Said I've got the body
of a 25-year-old.

251
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,151
Hmm.

252
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,694
All right.

253
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,196
-<i> ( blender whirring ) </i>
- Ah.

254
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,199
I programmed the remote
to turn on all the electrical
appliances in the house.

255
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,701
- Pretty innovative, huh?
- You know, I've been doing

256
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,620
some innovative stuff
at Westgroup Energy.

257
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,247
Oil's taking a big hit
and the industry needs
to diversify, so...

258
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,207
-<i> ( whirring continues ) </i>
- Hmm.

259
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,630
- ( whirring stops )
- Joe:<i> It's a perfect moment</i>

260
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,590
<i>to take Westgroup</i>
<i>into the Information Age.</i>

261
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,384
Um, have you heard
about time-sharing?

262
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,470
Yeah, I've heard
of time-sharing.

263
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:09,223
Westgroup's got
a brand-spankin'-new
IBM 3090 mainframe

264
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,059
still in beta
at headquarters
downtown.

265
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,647
<i>I'm starting there</i>
<i>and then moving to the 3081</i>
<i>in London and New York.</i>

266
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,441
Wow, shit.
Profit margins 
will be huge.

267
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,027
Yeah, it'll make ARPANET
look like two tin cans
and a fishing line.

268
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,029
So I'm looking for
a ground-floor engineer

269
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,406
to convert the mainframes
for outside dial-in access.

270
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,492
Wait, you're not trying
to sell me on this, are you?

271
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,952
No, we're just talking.
You're reading too much
into it.

272
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,622
I'm looking for someone.
You're the best engineer
I know.

273
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,749
I wanted to give you
the first right of refusal.

274
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,628
- Be flattered.
- I am flattered, all right?
And I refuse.

275
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,339
- I thought
we were getting along.
- We are getting along.

276
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,800
Let's not ruin it
by jumping back into
business together.

277
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,468
Come on,
it's one day's work.

278
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,136
They're still running
Cardiff Systems software.

279
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,763
You could do it
with your eyes closed.

280
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,850
When you invited me and Donna
to dinner last week,

281
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,601
was that to butter me up
for this?

282
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,229
I didn't even have this idea
when I invited you to dinner.

283
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,898
Is Sara even your fiancée,
or is that just some person
that you hired

284
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,901
- to make yourself seem
normal and trustworthy?
- Now you just sound crazy.

285
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,611
No, crazy is doing
the same thing over
and over again

286
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,405
and expecting
a different result.

287
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,408
You do understand this area
of tech is exploding, right?

288
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,870
In 18 months,
we'll be bigger than
CompuServe by a power of five.

289
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,330
Where will you be
in 18 months?

290
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,792
I don't know.
Maybe drinking mai tais
poolside in Maui

291
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,002
off all the money
I made on the Giant.

292
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,423
I'm sorry, Joe.
You're gonna have
to find somebody else.

293
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,344
( knocks )

294
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,307
- Oh, hey there, son.
Is your daddy home?
- No.

295
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,769
- When do you expect him?
- Well, that's the
million-dollar question.

296
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,604
Look, whatever
you're selling,
I'm not interested.

297
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,021
Ma'am, I'm not
selling anything.

298
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,274
My name's John Bosworth,
by the way.

299
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,984
I'm head of Customer
Satisfaction at a company
called Mutiny.

300
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,114
I just came by this morning
to apologize to your son here

301
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,908
about all our
network hassles this week

302
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,160
and see what I can do
to bring him back into
the Mutiny family.

303
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,748
Nothing.
I'm the one that cancelled
the subscription, okay?

304
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,042
He's been racking up
hundreds of dollars
on my credit card.

305
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,045
Can't remember the last time
that he had a friend home
from school.

306
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,756
I mean...
( scoffs )

307
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,175
You video game companies
are no better than
drug peddlers.

308
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,804
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't realize our services

309
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,889
had disrupted
your boy's social life.

310
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,349
- What grade
are you in, son?
- Ninth.

311
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,227
Yeah, your mama's right.
You gotta spend more time
with your buddies at school.

312
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,438
All they talk about
is sports.

313
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,774
Well, that's not true.
What about Gavin?

314
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,151
Have any of these Mutiny users
become friends of yours?

315
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,570
Oh, yeah, like 32.

316
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,489
Well, that I talk to
regularly.

317
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,741
Maybe six or seven
that just want to
play against me,

318
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,243
- which is also fun.
- ( scoffs )

319
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,871
I don't understand
how you're talking
to all these people.

320
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,123
I never hear
a peep out of you
when you're down there.

321
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,167
( sighs )
My mother's a Luddite.

322
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,085
We type messages
to each other.

323
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,296
That's how you
talk online.

324
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,467
Ma'am, you and I
are too old school
to understand this,

325
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,512
but to your son here
and his friends,

326
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,097
Mutiny is the church.

327
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,976
It's where
they find community.

328
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,020
Sometimes that's
the only place.

329
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,523
<i>( Bosworth chuckles )</i>

330
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,901
You have a good day.
I'm sorry to have taken up
so much of your time.

331
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,991
Wait, um,
what'd you say
your name was again?

332
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,534
It's John.

333
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,830
John Bosworth.

334
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,544
-<i> ( knocks ) </i>
- Hmm?

335
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,880
I heard you were
looking for me?

336
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,717
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um, okay, so I've been
doing some inventory,

337
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,259
<i>trying to figure out</i>
<i>what games we can</i>
<i>afford to lose</i>

338
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,928
to help lighten the network.

339
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,890
That's smart.
Did you want
suggestions or...

340
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,767
Well, I was thinking
that Backgammon and Checkers
are no-brainers.

341
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,187
They're our lowest performers
and not one of our originals.

342
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,647
Yeah, that's great.

343
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,901
And I'm gonna have
to cut Community.

344
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,195
- Huh? Why?
- Well--

345
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,364
The only bandwidth it takes up
is people on it typing,

346
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,701
and no one types
as fast as even the slowest
telephone modem.

347
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,995
It's not about bandwidth.
It's about security.

348
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,080
Community's our
most vulnerable spot.

349
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,374
<i>Someone shares</i>
<i>the wrong file,</i>
<i>we get infected again.</i>

350
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,126
I just--
I can't take a chance
on that happening.

351
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,173
If you want
to make this a place
where people can connect,

352
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,800
then there's going
to be risk involved.

353
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,677
I know.

354
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,805
I'm just not willing to take
a risk on something so small.

355
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,225
We've tripled in a week.

356
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,062
A lot of our users
aren't even gamers

357
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,940
and it requires
very little manpower,

358
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,733
so I have to be
honest with you,

359
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,860
I think this
is a huge mistake

360
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,195
from a business
standpoint.

361
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,365
Noted.

00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,178

365
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,180
Sorry, sorry!

366
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,059
Uncle!

367
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,527
Jesus!

368
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,404
God, you scared
the shit out of me.

369
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,616
What are you do--
how long have you
been in here?

370
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,994
Since you and the girls
got home.

371
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,621
It's the only place
they don't look for me.

372
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,625
( voice breaks )
I've had a day.

373
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,336
Okay, well,
I know that feeling.

374
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,464
I had weeks like that.
What happened?

375
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:38,094
Cameron's cutting
all of my Community rooms
just when they're taking off.

376
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,638
And she was so polite
about it, too.

377
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,391
All business.
It was unbearable.

378
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,811
Well, you're always saying
how you wished she'd be
more professional.

379
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,271
Yeah, but not
against me.

380
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,774
( scoffs )
We're supposed
to be partners.

381
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,194
Why don't you get undressed
and take an actual bath, okay?

382
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,446
I'll put the girls to bed
and I'll order takeout for you

383
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,116
- from whatever
restaurant you want.
- No, I'm not hungry.

384
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,289
Do you remember
how you felt the first time
you powered on the Giant

385
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,793
-<i> and you knew it was</i>
<i>something special? </i>
- Yeah.

386
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,338
Well, I felt the same way
when the first user entered
my Community room.

387
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,632
It was like--

388
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,177
I don't know,
it was like giving birth.

389
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,012
You know?
I know that sounds crazy.

390
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,139
Look, it doesn't
sound crazy at all.

391
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:26,767
Look, you created it.
It is your baby.

392
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,394
Yeah.

393
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,899
( voice breaks )
It's really nice
that you get it.

394
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,696
I don't know.
I don't know if I'm
cut out for this.

395
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,741
Hey, look,
you can do this, okay?

396
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,368
You're too lost to see it,
but I can see it.

397
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,913
Forget what Cameron thinks.

398
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,208
This is a big idea.

399
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,584
You have to see it
through.

400
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,545
But what's the point?
Even if--

401
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,173
even if we get
all the XTs back
up and running,

402
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,635
we can't survive
long-term on a rickety,
homemade network.

403
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,264
Look, you'll-- you'll
figure something out.

404
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:13,272
Would I be a terrible mother
if I stayed in here until
the girls went to sleep?

405
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,482
Yes.

406
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,233
- Hey.
- Hey.

407
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,779
You're--
you're out late.

408
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,949
Or early, depending
on your sleep schedule.

409
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:09,745
Uh, yeah, I couldn't get
any work done during the day
with the phones ringing,

410
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,249
so I-- I'm just here
to get snacks.

411
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,752
- Right, yeah...
- Grocery store, so...

412
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,674
- I didn't know you worked here.
- I'm actually here undercover.

413
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,843
Um, for our games.
I'm doing some research.

414
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,805
I got one already.
"Stock Boy."

415
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,600
It's where the players
have 10 minutes to try
and stock all the shelves

416
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:36,563
while dodging senior citizens
on the hunt for adult diapers.

417
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,649
- ( laughs )
- I used to work here
in high school

418
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,277
and the manager let me
pick up a couple shifts.

419
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,779
- Yeah, of course, it's--
- It's just till the shares
are worth something.

420
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,405
That's great.

421
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,116
I-- I mean,
it's not, like, great.

422
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,868
Yeah, the FireBall
Jawbreakers,

423
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,996
they're at the bottom shelf
at the end of aisle six,

424
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,291
and the Good &amp; Plentys are
halfway down the same aisle,

425
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,376
but they're on the right.

426
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:02,089
It's hard to miss.
You always leave a trail
of wrappers in your wake.

427

<i>( car engine starts )</i>

428
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,885
Cool.
Uh... right.

429
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,138
( laughs )
I'll see you in a few.

430
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,057
- Yep.
- Okay.

431
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,105
Here are my terms.
First off, I'm in charge.

432
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,649
Second, I'll provide
my services for free

433
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,527
in exchange for Mutiny being
your first client, all right?

434
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,738
And third, dude,
this is a pilot program.

435
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,615
I expect a discounted rate.

436
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,952
So, what did you screw up
over at Mutiny?

437
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,705
Nothing. I'm just trying
to help out my wife.

438
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,374
All right, let me
get this straight.

439
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,251
Donna asked you
if Cameron's company

440
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,668
could be
my pilot program.

441
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,837
They're desperate.

442
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,173
They're not desperate.
Look, the company's
in great shape.

443
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,050
Do we have a deal or not?

444
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,848
All right, I put together
an equipment list.

445
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,185
Just so you know,
converting the mainframes
for time-sharing

446
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,187
isn't as easy
as just flipping a switch.

447
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,731
I mean, the T-1
connections alone
are gonna take a few days.

448
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,983
I already had three
T-1 high-speed lines
installed.

449
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,402
I just need you
to finish the connections

450
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,862
and install IBM's
time-sharing option.

451
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,782
All right.
Well, we should use
Michigan Terminal Systems.

452
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,742
You know, it's much more
reliable than IBM.

453
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,827
Could you do it tonight?

454
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,205
- Why tonight?
- Can you do it
or can't you, Gordon?

455
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,790
Yeah, yeah,
I could do it.

456
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,375
Great, why don't
you grab this stuff

457
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,210
and meet me at the bar
across the street at 8:00?

458
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,841
Why don't you grab this stuff
and meet<i> me</i> at the bar at 8:00?

459
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,306
Okay, um, before I go
screw myself,

460
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:37,143
when was the last time
that you got the head of
CompuServe on the phone?

461
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,812
Also, we're not
CompuServe!

462
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,399
-<i> ( knock on door ) </i>
- Yeah?

463
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,401
- This a bad time?
- Huh? No, no, come in.

464
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,779
Just doing
some customer service.

465
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,741
Can I ask you a question?
Have you ever used
Mutiny Community?

466
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,534
Yeah.

467
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,996
- What's your question?
- That. That was my question.

468
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,748
I just thought
you should try it before
you decide to drop it.

469
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,127
But you have,
so I'll leave it to you.

470
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,087
Okay.

471
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,922
What's your favorite room?

472
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:10,550
- What?
- Your favorite room.
All the guys have one.

473
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,052
I'm just curious.

474
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,475
I know what Community is.

475
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,602
With respect,
I disagree.

476
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,980
It's simple text

477
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,899
with no graphical capability
or playability.

478
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,943
- Oh.
- Am I wrong?

479
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,655
The code might not be
revolutionary,

480
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,701
but the interactions between
users are a completely new way
of communicating.

481
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,162
People can be more authentic
online than in real life,

482
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,538
and that is addictive.

483
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,042
Okay, fine.

484
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,584
I'll give a spin
in Community.

485
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,671
Just don't expect me
to change my mind.

486
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,887
Because you just
don't like it

487
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,847
or because it didn't
come from you?

to tape them all
to one sheet,

I'll give you the rest

Why are you reimbursing me
with your own money?

Did you get me
that security badge?

540

You don't need
a security badge.

- Why not?
- It's after hours.

I need a security badge?

I tried to do this
all by the book,

546
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,293
but I was getting stonewalled
by some half-wit lifer

547
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,129
- who couldn't even understand
the concept of passive income.
- Oh, unbelievable.

548
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,798
Look, I don't think
you understand the concept
of good faith.

549
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,883
I knew if I told you
I was doing this on the side,

550
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,552
- you'd make
a big deal about it.
- Oh, "on the side."

551
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,554
No, it is a big deal.

552
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,098
Why didn't you take this
to your future father-in-law?

553
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,143
- Okay? It's a great idea.
- He wouldn't get my vision
the way you did.

554
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,852
It would just be words.

555
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,188
I needed evidence
to back it up so he
could trust me.

556
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,982
And what better way
to earn his trust

557
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,817
than to break into his building
in the middle of the night

558
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,236
and mess with his
state-of-the-art mainframe?

559
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,324
- It's a better play.
- Oh, it's a better play.

560
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,909
- Does Sara know about this?
- She's in Austin
for the night.

561
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,079
Mm, all right, well,
let's call her up, tell her
what we're about to do,

562
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,665
and if she's okay with it,
then I'm happy to help.

563
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,750
Okay, after we
call up Donna

564
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,627
and tell her that
she'll be leasing her
new network from me.

565
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,295
Listen, Donna and I,

566
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,005
we don't hide anything
from each other.

567
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,424
Great, let's call her up.
I'd love to say hi.

568
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,219
You know,
I'd like to punch you
in the face right now.

Be my guest.

570
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,653
Okay, I lied.
I don't know how
to use Community.

571
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,906
How is anybody
supposed to respect me

572
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,534
when you're
disrespecting me?

573
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,994
- Did you think
about that?
- No.

574
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,079
Did you think about that
at all when you were
messaging with Tom?

575
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,499
No, I-I-- honestly,
I wasn't thinking at all.

576
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,210
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to go
apologize to everyone?

577
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,671
No, don't do that.
Don't do anything.

578
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,173
Donna, haven't you ever
said something shitty

579
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,759
about somebody in private
that you'd never say in public?

580
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,595
- That you don't really mean?
- That's not what we're
talking about.

581
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,930
If you have a problem
with Gordon, you come to me.

582
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,016
You don't talk about it
behind my back

583
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,687
and you don't ever--
don't<i> ever</i> talk about
my kids.

584
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,525
- Whoa, are you okay?
- Yeah.

585
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,402
- Do you want water?
- No, I'm fine.

on top of everything else
I have Joanie's flu.

I'm really sorry.

589
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,668
You know that feeling
of freedom that you had

590
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,587
when you're sending
private messages with Tom?

591
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,714
That feeling that you
had a place to go

592
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:07,843
where you could say things
you wouldn't say in person?

593
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,887
That--

594
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,264
that is the value
of Community.

595
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,350
I need you in there.

596
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,644
We're doing
the group photo
for the "Byte" ad.

597
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,730
I'm doing a take
on class photos
from high school,

598
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:23,358

you two, it looks like

652
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,409
And I'm pretty sober, so...

653
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,785
No, it's...

654
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,954
just leave it up
for a few more days, okay?

655
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,248
Okay, great, that's good
'cause I'm not at all sober,
so...

Why? Because you stopped

689
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,643
- Yeah, something
along those lines.
- And you're imperious

690
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,354
and you're stubborn
and you never, ever give
constructive criticism.

691
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,730
I get it,
I'm a horrible boss.

692
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,984
Actually, I like
all that about you.

693
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:37,654
So... why haven't you
taken a shot at me yet?

694
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,323
I don't know.

695
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,825
'Cause I sure
as hell want to,

696
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,410
but I also kind of
want you in the game.

697
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,996
Yeah?

698
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,877
- That's it.
- What's it?

699
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,920
This.

700
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,715
We create
this game online.

701
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,967
- We can't compete
with box games, right?
- Yeah.

702
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,720
But what we have going for us
is we're networked.

703
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,139
Instead of shooting
at a tank or a robot,

704
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,225
what if you're shooting
at another user
on our network?

705
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,268
I mean, human players
aren't predictable

706
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,396
like a computer-generated
enemy.

707
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,065
I mean, how cool
would it be

708
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,274
if you're looking
right at them, eye to eye?

709
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,027
- Your friend
is also your enemy.
- Yeah.

710
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,570
I mean, who doesn't want
to shoot their friend
sometimes?

711
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,030
But how would
we do the graphics
over the network?

712
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,948
We'd have to do--
build half of it on the C64

713
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,449
- and then the other half
on our network.
- Yes.

714
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,744
And the C64,
that can manage
the scenery graphics

715
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,704
and the player movement,
and we can manage
the user's location,

716
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,789
whether or not they can--
they can see each other,

717
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,209
the score,
all that sort of thing.

718
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,586
And we'd have to
build a protocol between
the user's computer and ours

719
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,462
- so that we can
control the game graphics.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

720
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,756
As long as they're short,
encoded instructions.

721
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,340
Yeah, to keep
the game speed up and--

You sound like my girls
on a road trip.

740
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,351
You're slower
than you used to be.

741
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:36,189
Well, you want me
to slap this thing together
like the Giant Pro?

742
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,774
I'm almost done slotting.

743
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,317
Then I gotta upload
the hosting

744
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,236
and time-sharing options
that'll switch the TSO--

745
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,697
That's not on you,
the Giant Pro.

746
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,533
No one machine
can be everything
to every customer.

747
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,036
We're all guessing in the dark
to a certain extent.

748
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,956
Yeah, well, I have no idea
what consumers want

749
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,667
and I'm sick and tired
of trying to figure it out.

750
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,129
You know, I wish--
I wish people would just
tell me exactly what they want

751
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,713
and then I would
go and build it.

752
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,008
Like a tailor
making a custom suit.

753
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,427

I can build anything.

00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,018
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

819
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,311
Okay.

820
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,491
Donna, how much longer
you gonna be in there?

821
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,159
Donna:
<i>I don't know.</i>

822
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,247
Mm.

823
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:07,252
You know, maybe you should
go see a doctor, you know?

824
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,962
Just to rule out
anything serious.

825
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,883
<i>No, I think I--</i>
<i>I must've just got</i>
<i>what Joanie had.</i>

826
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,761
Well, I got
some great news

827
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,638
that I think'll make you
feel better.

828
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,559
You know that consulting gig
I did last night?

829
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,772
Well, I convinced, uh,
my contact over there

830
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,984
to lease their network
to Mutiny for $3 an hour.

831
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,487
Okay, nobody's getting
that kind of deal.

832
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,865
You'll be able to run
thousands of Community rooms.

833
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:41,119
How's that
for turning lemons
into lemonade?

834
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,288
<i>Donna, did you hear me?</i>

835
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,958
Yeah.

836
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,419
I'm sorry.

837
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,921
Um, that is amazing news.

838
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,673
Are you throwing up?

839
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,176
<i>Hmm?</i>

840
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,220
Yeah.

841
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,848
Can you give me a sec?

842
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,310
Yeah, sure.

843
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,145
I'll be in the kitchen.

844
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,372
( sighs )

845
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,921
