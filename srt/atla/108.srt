00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:20,291
LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS
LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:24,542
THEN, EVERYTHING CHANGED
WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.

7
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,250
ONLY THE AVATAR,
MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,

8
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,959
COULD STOP THEM.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,375
BUT WHEN THE WORLD
NEEDED HIM MOST,

10
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:32,125
HE VANISHED.

11
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,166
A HUNDRED YEARS PASSED,
AND MY BROTHER AND I

12
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:37,959
DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR,
AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,250
AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING
SKILLS ARE GREAT,

14
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,959
HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE
HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,125

CAN SAVE THE WORLD.

HE'S REINCARNATED

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,250
INTO THE NEXT NATION
IN THE CYCLE.

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,709
BUT THERE'S NO ONE
WHO COULD TEACH ME
HOW TO BE THE AVATAR.

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,041

AVATAR ROKU WOULD HELP ME.

HE DIED OVER 100 YEARS AGO.

21

HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO HIM?

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,083
- THERE'S A TEMPLE
ON A CRESCENT-SHAPED ISLAND,

23
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,083
AND IF I GO THERE
ON THE SOLSTICE,

24
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,250
I'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK
WITH HIM.

25
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,458
BUT THE SOLSTICE IS TOMORROW.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,000

ONE MORE PROBLEM.

27
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,583

AFFORD TO LOSE YOU

00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,667
WRONG WAY!

180
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:05,458
Fire sage: COME BACK!

181
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,417
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU.
I AM A FRIEND.

182
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,291
FIREBENDERS
AREN'T OUR FRIENDS.

183
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,166
I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE, AVATAR.

184
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,959
YOU DO?

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,333
YES. YOU WISH TO SPEAK
TO AVATAR ROKU.

186
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,083
I CAN TAKE YOU
TO HIM.

187
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,125
HOW?

188
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,208
UH!

189
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,125
THIS WAY.

190
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,208
Zhao: FIND HIM!

191
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,417
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!
QUICKLY!

192
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,250
WHAT'S HE UP TO,
UNCLE?

193
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,417
WHY DIDN'T COMMANDER
ZHAO ARREST ME?

194
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,875
BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO FOLLOW YOU.

195
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,375
HE KNOWS
YOU'LL LEAD HIM

196
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:00,625
TO THE PRIZE
YOU'RE BOTH AFTER--

197
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,375
THE AVATAR.

198
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,583
IF ZHAO WANTS TO FOLLOW
OUR TRAIL OF SMOKE,

199
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,542
THEN THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'LL LET HIM DO.

200
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,792
Fire sage:
AVATAR ROKU ONCE CALLED
THIS TEMPLE HIS HOME.

201
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:14,083
HE FORMED THESE SECRET
PASSAGES OUT OF THE MAGMA.

202
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,667
Aang: DID YOU KNOW
AVATAR ROKU?

203
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,834
NO, BUT MY GRANDFATHER
KNEW HIM.

204
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,709
MANY GENERATIONS
OF FIRE SAGES

205
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,583
GUARDED THIS TEMPLE
LONG BEFORE ME.

206
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,667
WE ALL HAVE
A STRONG SPIRITUAL
CONNECTION

207
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:27,125
TO THIS PLACE.

208
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,208
IS THAT HOW YOU KNEW
I WAS COMING?

209
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,333
A FEW WEEKS AGO,
AN AMAZING
THING OCCURRED.

210
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,750
THE STATUE
OF AVATAR ROKU--

211
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,625
ITS EYES
BEGAN TO GLOW.

212
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,834
Katara: THAT'S WHEN WE WERE
AT THE AIR TEMPLE.

213
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,667
AVATAR ROKU'S EYES
WERE GLOWING THERE, TOO.

214
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:45,500
AT THAT MOMENT,
WE KNEW YOU HAD
RETURNED TO THE WORLD.

215
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,583
IF THIS IS
THE AVATAR'S TEMPLE,

216
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,458
WHY DID THE SAGES ATTACK ME?

217
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,959
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,166
IN THE PAST,
THE SAGES WERE LOYAL

219
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,375
ONLY TO THE AVATAR.

220
00:11:55,417 --> 00:12:00,333
WHEN ROKU DIED, THE SAGES
EAGERLY AWAITED FOR THE NEXT
AVATAR TO RETURN,

221
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,125
BUT HE NEVER CAME.

222
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,125
THEY WERE WAITING FOR ME.

223
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,208
HEY, DON'T FEEL BAD.
YOU'RE ONLY 100 YEARS LATE.

224
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,125
THEY LOST HOPE
THAT THE AVATAR
WOULD EVER RETURN.

225
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,000
WHEN FIRE LORD SOZIN
BEGAN THE WAR,

226
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,959
MY GRANDFATHER
AND THE OTHER SAGES

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,291
WERE FORCED
TO FOLLOW HIM.

228
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,333
I NEVER WANTED
TO SERVE
THE FIRE LORD.

229
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,041
WHEN I LEARNED
YOU WERE COMING,

230
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,834
I KNEW I WOULD HAVE TO
BETRAY THE OTHER SAGES.

231
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,083
THANK YOU
FOR HELPING ME.

232
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,166
WE'LL FOLLOW THESE STAIRS
TO THE SANCTUARY.

233
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,542
ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE,

234
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,333
WAIT FOR THE LIGHT TO HIT
AVATAR ROKU'S STATUE.

235
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,166
ONLY THEN WILL YOU BE
ABLE TO SPEAK WITH HIM.

236
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,792
[GASP]

237
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,959
NO!

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,500
SHYU, WHAT'S WRONG?

239
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:54,625
THE SANCTUARY DOORS--
THEY'RE CLOSED.

240
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,041
CAN'T YOU JUST
OPEN THEM
WITH FIREBENDING,

241
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,792
LIKE YOU OPENED
THAT OTHER DOOR?

242
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:02,166
Shyu: NO. ONLY A FULLY
REALIZED AVATAR

243
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,250
IS POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO OPEN THIS DOOR ALONE.

244
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,542
OTHERWISE, THE SAGES MUST
OPEN THE DOORS TOGETHER

245
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,542
WITH 5 SIMULTANEOUS
FIRE BLASTS.

246
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,583
5 FIRE BLASTS, HUH?

247
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,000
[DING]

248
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,500
I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT.

249
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,792
Zuko: UNCLE,
KEEP HEADING NORTH.

250
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,166
ZHAO WILL FOLLOW
THE SMOKE TRAIL

251
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,208
WHILE I USE IT
AS A COVER.

252
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,333
HMMM.

253
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,208
Sokka:
THIS IS A LITTLE TRICK

254
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,166
I PICKED UP
FROM MY FATHER.

255
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,166
I SEAL THE LAMP OIL
INSIDE AN ANIMAL
SKIN CASING.

256
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,792
SHYU LIGHTS
THE OIL-SOAKED TWINE,

257
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,083
AND TA DA!

258
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,041
FAKE FIREBENDING.

259
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,375
YOU'RE REALLY
OUTDONE YOURSELF
THIS TIME, SOKKA.

260
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,333
THIS MIGHT
ACTUALLY WORK.

261
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,083
THE SAGES WILL HEAR
THE EXPLOSION,

262
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,917
SO AS SOON AS
THEY GO OFF,
YOU RUSH IN.

263
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,875
IT'S ALMOST SUNSET.
ARE YOU READY?

264
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:01,667
DEFINITELY.

265
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,250
OOH!

266
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,375
UH! UH!

267
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,041
THEY'RE STILL LOCKED!

268
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,959
IT DIDN'T WORK.

269
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:38,792
WHY WON'T IT OPEN?! UH!

270
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,709
AANG, STOP.

271
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,667
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
WE CAN DO.

272
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,834
I'M SORRY I PUT YOU
THROUGH ALL THIS
FOR NOTHING.

273
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,125
Sokka:
I DON'T GET IT.

274
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,709
THAT BLAST
LOOKED AS STRONG

275
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,041
AS ANY FIREBENDING
I'VE SEEN.

276
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,709
SOKKA,
YOU'RE A GENIUS!

277
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,834
WAIT. HOW IS SOKKA
A GENIUS?

278
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,458
HIS PLAN DIDN'T
EVEN WORK.

279
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,041
COME ON, AANG.
LET HER DREAM.

280
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,333
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SOKKA'S PLAN
DIDN'T WORK,

281
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,625
BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE IT DID.

282
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,208
DID THE DEFINITION
OF GENIUS CHANGE

283
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,917
IN THE LAST
HUNDRED YEARS?

284
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,625
Fire sage: COME QUICKLY!
THE AVATAR HAS ENTERED
THE SANCTUARY!

285
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,125
HOW DID HE GET IN?

286
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,667
I KNOW, BUT LOOK
AT THE SCORCH MARKS,

287
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:17,667
AND DOWN THERE.

288
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:23,125
HE'S INSIDE.
OPEN THE DOORS IMMEDIATELY

289
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,041
BEFORE HE CONTACTS
AVATAR ROKU.

290
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,041
HUH!
HUH!

291
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,959
[SNEEZE]

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,709
IT'S THE AVATAR'S
LEMUR.

293
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,041
HE MUST HAVE CRAWLED
THROUGH THE PIPES.

294
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,375
WE'VE BEEN TRICKED!

295
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,291
[YOWLING]
AAH!

296
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,291
NOW, AANG.

297
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,166
AANG, NOW'S
YOUR CHANCE!

298
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,250
THE AVATAR'S
COMING WITH ME.

299
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,625
UH! UH!

300
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,000
UH!

301
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,125
CLOSE THE DOORS,
QUICKLY!

302
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,542
UH!
AAH!

303
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,583
GO!

304
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:22,792
HE MADE IT!

305
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,250
THE LIGHT HITS THE STATUE,
AND I TALK TO ROKU.

306
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,709
SO WHY ISN'T ANYTHING
HAPPENING?

307
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,291
HUH!
HUH!

308
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,875
WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?
IT'S SEALED SHUT.

309
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,834
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE LIGHT.

310
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,166
AVATAR ROKU DOESN'T
WANT US INSIDE.

311
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,458
Aang: WHY ISN'T
ANYTHING HAPPENING?

312
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,041
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

313
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,583
ALL I KNOW IS AIRBENDING.

314
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,709
PLEASE, AVATAR ROKU,
TALK TO ME.

315
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,166
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, AANG.

316
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,125
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,917
Zuko: WHY DID YOU
HELP THE AVATAR?

318
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,834
BECAUSE IT WAS ONCE
THE SAGE'S DUTY.

319
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,583
IT IS STILL OUR DUTY.

320
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,959
[ONE PERSON CLAPPING]

321
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:35,166
WHAT A MOVING
AND HEARTFELT PERFORMANCE.

322
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,125
I'M CERTAIN
THE FIRE LORD WILL UNDERSTAND

323
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,625
WHEN YOU EXPLAIN WHY
YOU BETRAYED HIM.

324
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:41,959
COMMANDER ZHAO--

325
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,083
Zhao: AND, PRINCE ZUKO,

326
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,375
IT WAS A NOBLE EFFORT,

327
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,583
BUT YOUR LITTLE SMOKESCREEN
DIDN'T WORK.

328
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,333
TWO TRAITORS
IN ONE DAY.

329
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,583
THE FIRE LORD
WILL BE PLEASED.

330
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,125
YOU'RE TOO LATE,
ZHAO.

331
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,750
THE AVATAR'S
INSIDE,

332
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,041
AND THE DOORS
ARE SEALED.

333
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,959
NO MATTER.
SOONER OR LATER,

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,625
HE HAS TO COME OUT.

335
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,583
I HAVE SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT
TO TELL YOU, AANG.

336
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:16,041
THAT IS WHY, WHEN YOU WERE
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD,

337
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,583
I SENT MY DRAGON
TO FIND YOU.

338
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,208
IS IT ABOUT
THAT VISION--

339
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,208
THE ONE OF THE COMET?

340
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,500
YES.

341
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,834
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

342
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,083
100 YEARS AGO,

343
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,375
FIRE LORD SOZIN
USED THAT COMET

344
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,250
TO BEGIN THE WAR.

345
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,834
HE AND HIS
FIREBENDING ARMY

346
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,083
HARNESSED ITS
INCREDIBLE POWER

347
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,083
AND DEALT A DEADLY
FIRST STRIKE

348
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,291
AGAINST THE OTHER
NATIONS.

349
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,667
SO THE COMET
MADE THEM STRONGER?

350
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:45,542
YES, STRONGER THAN YOU
COULD EVEN IMAGINE.

351
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,709
BUT THAT HAPPENED
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

352
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,792
WHAT DOES THE COMET
HAVE TO DO WITH
THE WAR NOW?

353
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,792
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

354
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:55,208
SOZIN'S COMET WILL RETURN
BY THE END OF THIS SUMMER,

355
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,083
AND FIRE LORD OZAI
WILL USE ITS POWER

356
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,125
TO FINISH THE WAR
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

357
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,083
AAH!

358
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,041
IF HE SUCCEEDS,
EVEN THE AVATAR

359
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,250
WON'T BE ABLE TO RESTORE
BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

360
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,709
AANG, YOU MUST
DEFEAT THE FIRE LORD

361
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,083
BEFORE THE COMET
ARRIVES.

362
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,333
BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN
STARTED LEARNING
WATERBENDING,

363
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,583
NOT TO MENTION
EARTH AND FIRE.

364
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,583
MASTERING THE ELEMENTS
TAKES YEARS OF DISCIPLINE
AND PRACTICE,

365
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,000
BUT IF THE WORLD
IS TO SURVIVE,

366
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,750
YOU MUST DO IT
BY SUMMER'S END.

367
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,291
Zhao: WHEN THOSE DOORS OPEN,

368
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,083
UNLEASH ALL YOUR FIREPOWER.

369
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,917
HOW'S AANG GONNA
MAKE IT OUT OF THIS?

370
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,417
HOW ARE WE GONNA
MAKE IT OUT OF THIS?

371
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,959
WHAT IF I CAN'T MASTER
ALL THE ELEMENTS
IN TIME?

372
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,291
WHAT IF I FAIL?

373
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,542
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT,
AANG,

374
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,917
FOR YOU HAVE DONE IT BEFORE.

375
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:59,542
THE SOLSTICE IS ENDING.

376
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:04,166
WE MUST GO OUR SEPARATE
WAYS FOR NOW.

377
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,291
BUT I WON'T BE ABLE
TO COME BACK
TO THE TEMPLE.

378
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,125
WHAT IF I HAVE
QUESTIONS?

379
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,166
HOW WILL I TALK
TO YOU?

380
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,959
I AM A PART OF YOU.

381
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,041
WHEN YOU NEED TO TALK
TO ME AGAIN,

382
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,458
YOU WILL FIND A WAY.

383
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:23,208
A GREAT DANGER AWAITS YOU
AT THE TEMPLE.

384
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,834
I CAN HELP YOU FACE
THE THREAT,

385
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,375
BUT ONLY IF YOU
ARE READY.

386
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,750
I'M READY.

387
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,709
Zhao: READY...

388
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,375
NO! AANG!

389
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,458
FIRE!

UH!
UH!

392

UH!

393
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,417
OH!
OH!

394
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,375
AVATAR ROKU IS
GOING TO DESTROY
THE TEMPLE.

395
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,834
WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE!

396
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,792
NOT WITHOUT AANG!

397
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:13,834
HUH!

398
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,417
WE GOT YOUR BACK.

399
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,166
THANKS. WHERE'S SHYU?

400
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,458
I DON'T KNOW.

401
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:53,792
UH!
UH!
UH!

403
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,083
NO PRINCE, NO AVATAR.

404
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,542
APPARENTLY THE ONLY THING
I DO HAVE

405
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,750
IS 5 TRAITORS.

406
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:23,291
BUT, COMMANDER,
ONLY SHYU HELPED
THE AVATAR.

407
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,667
SAVE YOUR STORIES
FOR THE FIRE LORD.

408
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,208
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

409
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,542
YOU ARE ALL GUILTY.

410
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,000
TAKE THEM TO THE 
PRISON HOLD!
