00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,458
IT'S JUST
LIKE THE ONE IN
THE OTHER AIR TEMPLE.

AN AIRBENDER
CAN OPEN IT.

SO INSIDE,
IT'S COMPLETELY
UNTOUCHED.

LEFT IT.

I'M SORRY. THIS
IS THE LAST PART
OF THE TEMPLE

TERRIBLE. I CAN'T SEE.

THEY'LL GET LOOSE.

A NONFLAMMABLE
LIGHT SOURCE.

AND HOLD YOUR BREATH.

192
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,709
OK. SO YOU BROUGHT ME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE

MY FIRST TIME HERE.

IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.

NOT AN AIRBENDER,

I THINK I KNOW
HOW THEY WORK.

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,792
I REMEMBER MY DAD TINKERING
WITH A COUNTERBALANCING SYSTEM,

350
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,417
SOMETHING TO DO WITH WATER.

351
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,083
WORKS GREAT, HUH?

352
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,083
WATER?
CAN YOU GET ME
CLOSE TO ONE?

353
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,667
NO PROBLEM.

354
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,875
HUH!

COME ON, SOKKA.
WHERE'S THAT WAR BALLOON?

359
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:25,041
HEY, WHY AREN'T THEY
SHOOTING AT US?

THE INSIGNIA.

361
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,750
THEY THINK
WE'RE ON THEIR SIDE.

362
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,458
THEN I GUESS THEY
WON'T SEE THIS COMING.

363
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,750
BOMBS AWAY.

364
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,208
UH!
HEY!
AAH!

365
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,125
OH, NO.
THAT WAS THE LAST ONE.

WAIT A SECOND.
[SNIFFS]

367
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,250
YOU SMELL THAT?

368
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,375
ROTTEN EGGS. THERE.

369
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,041
THAT'S WHERE
THE GAS IS ESCAPING.

370
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT'S OUR FUEL SOURCE.

371
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,333
IT'S THE ONLY BOMB
WE'VE GOT.

372
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,125
Aang: LOOK.
THEY'RE RETREATING.

373
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,083

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,041
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS
ALL LIVE HERE NOW.

380
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,208
I REALIZED IT'S LIKE
THE HERMIT CRAB.

381
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,250
MAYBE YOU
WEREN'T BORN HERE,

382
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,041
BUT YOU FOUND
THIS EMPTY SHELL
AND MADE IT YOUR HOME,

383
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,083
AND NOW YOU
PROTECT EACH OTHER.

384
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,000
THAT MEANS A LOT
COMING FROM YOU.

385
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,166
AANG, YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT AIR POWER.

386
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,000
AS LONG AS WE'VE
GOT THE SKIES,

387
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,792
WE'LL HAVE
THE FIRE NATION
ON THE RUN.
