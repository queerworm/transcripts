1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:08,709
Katara: WATER...

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,750
EARTH...

3
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,917
FIRE...

4
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:15,500
AIR.

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:19,375
LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS
LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.

6
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:23,834
THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED
WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,333
ONLY THE AVATAR,
MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,041
COULD STOP THEM.

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,500
BUT WHEN THE WORLD
NEEDED HIM MOST,

10
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,458
HE VANISHED.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,250
A HUNDRED YEARS PASSED,

12
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,166
AND MY BROTHER AND I
DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR,

13
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,375
AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG,

14
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:39,500
AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING
SKILLS ARE GREAT,

15
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:43,000
HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN
BEFORE HE'S READY
TO SAVE ANYONE.

16
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:46,000
BUT I BELIEVE AANG
CAN SAVE THE WORLD.

17
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,333
AANG, HOW LONG WERE
YOU IN THAT ICEBERG?

18
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,917
I DON'T KNOW.
A FEW DAYS MAYBE.

19
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,125
I THINK IT WAS MORE LIKE
A HUNDRED YEARS.

20
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:15,166
NO ONE HAS SEEN
AN AIRBENDER IN
A HUNDRED YEARS.

21
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,625
WE THOUGHT THEY
WERE EXTINCT.

22
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,667
ACCORDING TO LEGEND,
YOU NEED TO FIRST
MASTER WATER,

23
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,709
THEN EARTH,
THEN FIRE, RIGHT?

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,250
THAT'S WHAT
THE MONKS TOLD ME.

25
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,417
WELL, IF WE GO
TO THE NORTH POLE,

26
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,458
YOU CAN MASTER
WATERBENDING.

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,458
WAIT, MY UNCLE. TELL THEM I
FOUND THE AVATAR.

28
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,125
Aang: WAIT TILL
YOU SEE IT, KATARA.

29
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,875
THE AIR TEMPLE
IS ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN THE WORLD.

30
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,500
AANG, I KNOW
YOU'RE EXCITED,

31
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,792
BUT IT'S BEEN
A HUNDRED YEARS

32
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:57,333
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HOME.

33
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,625
THAT'S WHY
I'M SO EXCITED!

34
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:01,750
IT'S JUST THAT
A LOT CAN CHANGE
IN ALL THAT TIME.

35
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,000
I KNOW,

36
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,709
BUT I NEED TO SEE IT
FOR MYSELF.

37
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,625
[SNORING]

38
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,291
WAKE UP, SOKKA.

39
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,834
AIR TEMPLE,
HERE WE COME!

40
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,000
[GROAN]

41
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,291
SLEEP NOW.
TEMPLE LATER.

42
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,000
[SNORING]

43
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,250
SOKKA, WAKE UP!

44
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,375
THERE'S
A PRICKLE SNAKE IN
YOUR SLEEPING BAG!

45
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,875
AAH!

46
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,291
GET IT OFF!
GET IT OFF!

47
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,417
AAH!

48
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,667
HEH HEH HEH!

49
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:32,625
GREAT.
YOU'RE AWAKE.

50
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,417
LET'S GO.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,250
UNCLE, I WANT
THE REPAIRS MADE

52
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,834
AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE.

53
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,375
I DON'T WANT
TO STAY TOO LONG

54
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,333
AND RISK LOSING
HIS TRAIL.

55
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,333
YOU MEAN THE AVATAR?

56
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,792
DON'T MENTION
HIS NAME
ON THESE DOCKS.

57
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,667
ONCE WORD GETS OUT
THAT HE'S ALIVE,

58
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,709
EVERY FIREBENDER
WILL BE OUT
LOOKING FOR HIM,

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,875
- AND I DON'T WANT
ANYONE GETTING
IN THE WAY.
- GETTING IN THE WAY OF WHAT?

60
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,250
PRINCE ZUKO.

61
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,458
CAPTAIN ZHAO.

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,166
IT'S COMMANDER
NOW.

63
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,750
AND GENERAL IROH,

64
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,500
GREAT HERO
OF OUR NATION.

65
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,375
RETIRED GENERAL.

66
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,041
THE FIRE LORD'S
BROTHER AND SON

67
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,166
ARE WELCOME GUESTS
ANYTIME.

68
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,917
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO MY HARBOR?

69
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,500
OUR SHIP
IS BEING REPAIRED.

70
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:15,375
THAT'S QUITE A BIT
OF DAMAGE.

71
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:18,792
YES. YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED.

72
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,917
UNCLE, TELL
COMMANDER ZHAO
WHAT HAPPENED.

73
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,333
YES, I WILL DO THAT.

74
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,333
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

75
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,125
WHAT, DID WE CRASH
OR SOMETHING?

76
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,500
YES! RIGHT INTO
AN EARTH KINGDOM SHIP.

77
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,458
REALLY?

78
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,875
YOU MUST
REGALE ME WITH ALL
THE THRILLING DETAILS.

79
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,041
JOIN ME FOR A DRINK?

80
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,375
SORRY, BUT WE
HAVE TO GO.

81
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,291
PRINCE ZUKO,

82
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,834
SHOW COMMANDER ZHAO
YOUR RESPECT.

83
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,125
WE WOULD BE HONORED
TO JOIN YOU.

84
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,500
DO YOU HAVE
ANY GINSENG TEA?
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

85
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,667
[GRUNT]

86
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,458
[RUMBLES]

87
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,125
HEY, STOMACH,
BE QUIET, ALL RIGHT?

88
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,208
I'M TRYING TO
FIND US SOME FOOD.

89
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,417
HEY! WHO ATE ALL
MY BLUBBERED SEAL JERKY?

90
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,834
OH. THAT WAS FOOD?

91
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,291
I USED IT TO
START THE CAMPFIRE
LAST NIGHT.

92
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,750
SORRY.

93
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,583
YOU WHAT?

94
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,083
AWW.

95
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,291
NO WONDER THE FLAMES
SMELLED SO GOOD.

96
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,959
Aang: THE POTOLA
MOUNTAIN RANGE!

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,417
WE'RE ALMOST THERE!

98
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,542
AANG, BEFORE WE
GET TO THE TEMPLE,

99
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,625
I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THE AIRBENDERS.

100
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:32,625
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

101
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,250
WELL...

102
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,458
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE PREPARED

103
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,083
FOR WHAT
YOU MIGHT SEE.

104
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,291
THE FIRE NATION
IS RUTHLESS.

105
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,583
THEY KILLED MY MOTHER,

106
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,333
AND THEY COULD HAVE
DONE THE SAME
TO YOUR PEOPLE.

107
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,208
JUST BECAUSE NO ONE
HAS SEEN AN AIRBENDER

108
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,250
DOESN'T MEAN
THE FIRE NATION
KILLED THEM ALL.

109
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,792
THEY PROBABLY ESCAPED.

110
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,667
I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT.

111
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,291
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
KATARA.

112
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,583
THE ONLY WAY TO
GET TO AN AIRBENDER TEMPLE
IS ON A FLYING BISON,

113
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,417
AND I DOUBT
THE FIRE NATION
HAS ANY FLYING BISON.

114
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,625
RIGHT, APPA?

115
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,125
[APPA GROWLS]

116
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,834
YIP YIP!

117
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:21,375
Aang: THERE IT IS,
THE SOUTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

118
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:24,458
AANG, IT'S AMAZING!

119
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,583
WE'RE HOME, BUDDY.
WE'RE HOME.

120
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,000
AND BY YEAR'S END,

121
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,333
THE EARTH KINGDOM CAPITAL
WILL BE UNDER OUR RULE.

122
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:39,250
THE FIRE LORD WILL
FINALLY CLAIM VICTORY
IN THIS WAR.

123
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,959
IF MY FATHER THINKS
THE REST OF THE WORLD

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,166
WILL FOLLOW HIM
WILLINGLY,

125
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,792
THEN HE IS A FOOL.

126
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,000
TWO YEARS AT SEA

127
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,458
HAVE DONE LITTLE TO
TEMPER YOUR TONGUE.

128
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,250
SO, HOW'S YOUR SEARCH
FOR THE AVATAR GOING?

129
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,583
[CRASH]

130
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,709
UH... MY FAULT
ENTIRELY.

131
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,667
WE HAVEN'T
FOUND HIM YET.

132
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,917
DID YOU REALLY
EXPECT TO?

133
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,125
THE AVATAR DIED
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO

134
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,125
ALONG WITH THE REST
OF THE AIRBENDERS.

135
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,083
UNLESS YOU FOUND
SOME EVIDENCE

136
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,542
THAT THE AVATAR
IS ALIVE.

137
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,000
NO. NOTHING.

138
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,625
PRINCE ZUKO, THE AVATAR
IS THE ONLY ONE

139
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,125
WHO CAN STOP
THE FIRE NATION

140
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,000
FROM WINNING
THIS WAR.

141
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,917
IF YOU HAVE AN OUNCE
OF LOYALTY LEFT,

142
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,875
YOU'LL TELL ME
WHAT YOU FOUND.

143
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,208
I HAVEN'T FOUND
ANYTHING.

144
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,000
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID--

145
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,667
THE AVATAR
PROBABLY DIED
A LONG TIME AGO.

146
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,083
COME ON, UNCLE.
WE'RE GOING.

147
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,166
Man: COMMANDER ZHAO,

148
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,041
WE INTERROGATED
THE CREW
AS YOU INSTRUCTED.

149
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,709
THEY CONFIRMED
PRINCE ZUKO

150
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,333
HAD THE AVATAR
IN CUSTODY

151
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,041
BUT LET HIM ESCAPE.

152
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,625
NOW REMIND ME,

153
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:48,834
HOW EXACTLY
WAS YOUR SHIP
DAMAGED?

154
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,125
SO WHERE DO I GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?

155
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,709
YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO BE ONE OF
THE FIRST OUTSIDERS

156
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,917
TO EVER VISIT
AN AIRBENDER TEMPLE,

157
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,000
AND ALL YOU CAN
THINK ABOUT IS FOOD?

158
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,709
Sokka: I'M JUST A SIMPLE
GUY WITH SIMPLE NEEDS.

159
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,333
SO THAT'S WHERE
MY FRIENDS AND I

160
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,208
WOULD PLAY AIRBALL,

161
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,750
AND OVER THERE
IS WHERE THE BISON
WOULD SLEEP.

162
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:15,750
AND...

163
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:16,917
[SIGH]

164
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,083
WHAT'S WRONG?

165
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,250
THIS PLACE USED
TO BE FULL OF MONKS
AND LEMURS AND BISON.

166
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,083
NOW THERE'S JUST
A BUNCH OF WEEDS.

167
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,083
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW MUCH THINGS
HAVE CHANGED.

168
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,834
Sokka: SO, UH,

169
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,917
THIS AIRBALL GAME--
HOW DO YOU PLAY?

170
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,041
UGH!

171
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,083
OOH!

172
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,250
HA HA HA!

173
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,041
AANG 7, SOKKA 0.

174
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,500
MAKING HIM
FEEL BETTER

175
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,000
IS PUTTING ME
IN A WORLD OF HURT.

176
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,875
KATARA,
