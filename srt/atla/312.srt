WHEN WE WERE IN PRISON TOGETHER

GO THROUGH ALL THOSE THINGS

THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

330
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,875
I'D LIKE YOU TO TEACH ME.

331
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:11,041
THANK YOU.

332
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,667
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'VE ACCEPTED ME
INTO YOUR GROUP.

333
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,583
Aang: NOT SO FAST.

334
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,083
I STILL HAVE TO ASK MY FRIENDS
IF IT'S OK WITH THEM.

335
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,667
TOPH, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT ZUKO BURNED.

336
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:23,208
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

337
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,667
GO AHEAD AND LET HIM JOIN.

338
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:28,709
IT'LL GIVE ME PLENTY OF TIME
TO GET BACK AT HIM
FOR BURNING MY FEET.

339
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,083
SOKKA?

340
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,959
HEY, ALL I WANT IS TO DEFEAT
THE FIRE LORD.

341
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,250
IF YOU THINK THIS IS THE WAY
TO DO IT, THEN I'M ALL FOR IT.

342
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,917
KATARA?

343
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:53,083
I'LL GO ALONG WITH
WHATEVER YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

344
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,792
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN, I PROMISE.

345
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,750
SO HERE YOU GO, HOME SWEET HOME.

346
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,417
I GUESS, YOU KNOW, FOR NOW.

347
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:15,834
UNPACK... LUNCH SOON.

348
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:20,250
UH... WELCOME ABOARD?

349
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,792
YEAH.

350
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,417
OK, THIS IS REALLY,
REALLY WEIRD.

351
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:39,166
IF I HAVE TO, I WILL SPEND
EVERY DAY OF THE REST OF MY LIFE
HUNTING THE AVATAR.

352
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,000
I KNOW IT'S MY DESTINY
TO CAPTURE HIM.

353
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:46,333
YOU KNOW, PRINCE ZUKO,
DESTINY IS A FUNNY THING.

354
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,875
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW THINGS
ARE GOING TO WORK OUT

355
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:54,166
BUT IF YOU KEEP AN OPEN MIND
AND AN OPEN HEART

356
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,083
I PROMISE YOU WILL FIND
YOUR OWN DESTINY SOMEDAY.

357
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,709
Katara: YOU MIGHT HAVE
EVERYONE ELSE HERE BUYING
YOUR TRANSFORMATION.

358
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,375
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
YOU'VE STRUGGLED WITH DOING
THE RIGHT THING IN THE PAST.

359
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:18,291
SO LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW.

360
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:23,208
YOU MAKE ONE STEP BACKWARD,
ONE SLIP-UP, GIVE ME ONE REASON
TO THINK YOU MIGHT HURT AANG

361
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,792
AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR DESTINY ANYMORE

362
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:30,750
BECAUSE I'LL MAKE SURE
YOUR DESTINY ENDS
RIGHT THEN AND THERE...

363
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,125
PERMANENTLY.

364
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,625
