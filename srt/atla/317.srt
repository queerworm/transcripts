WHAT YOU SAID IN THERE?

00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,542
IN WHERE?

350
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,250
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

351
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,250

JUST LIKE A BROTHER TO YOU

352

AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ME.

353

I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

BUT IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

356
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:02,583
