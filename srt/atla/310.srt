and then a land stage.

To gain sea access
to the Fire Nation capital,

157
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,333
we have to get past
our first major obstacle here.

The Great Gates of Azulon.

159
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,041
Next, we hit the land,
and we hit hard.

160
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,625
We must fight
past their battlements

161
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,917
and secure the plaza tower.

162
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,709
Once we do that,
it's up to the royal palace.

163

At that point,
the eclipse will begin.

Isn't the point to invade
during the eclipse?

167

When the Firebenders
are powerless?

168
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,000
- The eclipse
only last eight minutes.

169
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,000
Not enough time
for the whole invasion.
