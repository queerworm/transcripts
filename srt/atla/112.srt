FIRST YOU FORM A BALL.
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GET ON QUICK.

174
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,750
HA HA HA!

175
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,959
YEAH! HA HA HA!

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,917
WHOO-HOO! YEAH!

177
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,583
OK, HERE GOES.

178
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,917
QUICK. GET ON.

179
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,333
WHOA. WHOA...

180
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,208
UHH!

181
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,500
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BALANCE
ON IT LIKE IT'S A TOP.

182
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,417
MAN, THAT'S HARD.

183
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,000
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
THAT TRICK, AANG?

184
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,208
I MADE IT UP.

185
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,959
WOW!

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,125
Gyatso: AANG, COME WITH US.

187
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,959
WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

188
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,291
Aang:
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ME?

189
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,834
WE HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE THE AVATAR
FOR SOME TIME.

190
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,291
DO YOU REMEMBER
THESE?

191
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,208
THOSE WERE SOME
OF MY FAVORITE TOYS
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

192
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,333
YOU CHOSE THEM
FROM AMONG THOUSANDS
OF TOYS, AANG.

193
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,375
THE TOYS YOU PICKED
WERE THE 4
AVATAR RELICS.

194
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,458
THESE ITEMS BELONGED
TO AVATARS PAST.

195
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,834
YOUR OWN PAST LIVES.

196
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,333
I JUST CHOSE THEM
BECAUSE THEY SEEMED FUN.

197
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,667
YOU CHOSE THEM
BECAUSE THEY
WERE FAMILIAR.

198
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,041
NORMALLY,
WE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
OF YOUR IDENTITY

199
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,041
WHEN YOU TURNED 16.

200
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,750
BUT THERE ARE
TROUBLING SIGNS.

201
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:13,917
STORM CLOUDS ARE GATHERING.

202
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,709
I FEAR THAT WAR MAY BE
UPON US, YOUNG AVATAR.

203
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,250
WE NEED YOU, AANG.

204
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,166
I'M SICK
OF TAKING HIS ORDERS,

205
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,291
AND I'M TIRED
OF CHASING HIS AVATAR.

206
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,041
I MEAN, WHO DOES ZUKO
THINK HE IS?

207
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,750
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO KNOW?

208
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,875
GENERAL IROH,
WE WERE JUST--

209
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,375
IT'S OK.

210
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,875
MAY I JOIN YOU?

211
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:41,834
OF COURSE, SIR.

212
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,625
TRY TO UNDERSTAND,

213
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,208
MY NEPHEW IS
A COMPLICATED YOUNG MAN.

214
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,542
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH MUCH.

215
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,959
LET ME IN!

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,709
PRINCE ZUKO,
WHAT'S WRONG?

217
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,208
I WANT TO GO
INTO THE WAR CHAMBER,

218
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,166
BUT THE GUARD
WON'T LET ME PASS.

219
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,000
YOU'RE NOT
MISSING ANYTHING.
TRUST ME.

220
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,834
THESE MEETINGS
ARE DREADFULLY BORING.

221
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,041
IF I'M GOING TO RULE
THIS NATION ONE DAY,

222
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,375
DON'T YOU THINK
I NEED TO START LEARNING
AS MUCH AS I CAN?

223
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:20,291
VERY WELL,
BUT YOU MUST PROMISE
NOT TO SPEAK.

224
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,917
THESE OLD FOLKS ARE
A BIT SENSITIVE, YOU KNOW?

225
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,792
THANK YOU, UNCLE.

226
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,000
THE EARTH KINGDOM DEFENSES
ARE CONCENTRATED HERE,

227
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,583
A DANGEROUS BATTALION
OF THEIR STRONGEST EARTHBENDERS

228
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,583
AND FIERCEST WARRIORS.

229
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,875
SO I AM RECOMMENDING
THE 41st DIVISION.

230
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:45,792
BUT THE 41st IS
ENTIRELY NEW RECRUITS.

231
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,500
HOW DO YOU EXPECT THEM
TO DEFEAT

232
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,583
A POWERFUL EARTH KINGDOM
BATTALION?

233
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,834
I DON'T.

234
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,458
THEY'LL BE USED
AS A DISTRACTION

235
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,125
WHILE WE MOUNT AN ATTACK
FROM THE REAR.

236
00:11:56,166 --> 00:12:00,166
WHAT BETTER TO USE AS BAIT
THAN FRESH MEAT?

237
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,500
YOU CAN'T SACRIFICE
AN ENTIRE DIVISION
LIKE THAT.

238
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,834
THOSE SOLDIERS LOVE
AND DEFEND OUR NATION.

239
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,208
HOW CAN YOU BETRAY THEM?

240
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,959
ZUKO WAS RIGHT, YOU SEE?

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,125
BUT IT WAS NOT HIS PLACE
TO SPEAK OUT.

242
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,875
AND THERE WERE
DIRE CONSEQUENCES.

243
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,458
SO YOU WERE UPSET
THAT YOU WERE
THE AVATAR?

244
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,041
WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE
EXCITED ABOUT IT?

245
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,917
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO FEEL ABOUT IT.

246
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,834
ALL I KNEW WAS
THAT AFTER I FOUND OUT,

247
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,291
EVERYTHING BEGAN CHANGING.

248
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,917
HEY, NOT BAD.

249
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,375
YOU GUYS HAVE
BEEN PRACTICING.

250
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,750
NOT ONLY THAT;

251
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,959
WE MADE UP A GAME
YOU CAN PLAY
WITH THE AIR SCOOTERS.

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,041
GREAT!

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,291
WHAT'S GOING ON?

254
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,959
NOW THAT YOU'RE
THE AVATAR,

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,792
IT'S KIND OF
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

256
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,375
FOR WHICHEVER TEAM
YOU'RE ON.

257
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:53,875
BUT I'M STILL THE SAME.

258
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:56,041
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

259
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,625
SO, WHAT? I CAN'T PLAY?

260
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,333
THAT'S THE ONLY
FAIR WAY.

261
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,959
OH. OK.

262
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,875
SORRY, AANG.

263
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,750
OK, NOW, WHO WANTS
TO HAVE JINJU ON THEIR TEAM?

264
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:09,834
[LAUGHS]

265
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,041
VERY INTERESTING MOVE,
YOUNG ONE.

266
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,709
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

267
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,834
HEY! HA HA HA!

268
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,959
HA HA HA!

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,333
YOU'RE PLAYING GAMES
WITH HIM?

270
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,709
THE AVATAR
SHOULD BE TRAINING.

271
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,500
AANG HAS ALREADY TRAINED
ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

272
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,041
TIME IS SHORT.
COME WITH ME.

273
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,917
I MUST TEST YOU ON SOME
HIGH-LEVEL TECHNIQUES.

274
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,542
NO. AS LONG AS
I AM HIS GUARDIAN,

275
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,750
I WILL DECIDE
WHEN HE TRAINS

276
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,291
AND WHEN HE GETS
HIS BUTT KICKED AT PAI-SHO.

277
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,583
HMMPH!

278
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,458
AFTER ZUKO'S OUTBURST
IN THE MEETING,

279
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,041
THE FIRE LORD BECAME
VERY ANGRY WITH HIM.

280
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,458
HE SAID THAT PRINCE ZUKO'S
CHALLENGE OF THE GENERAL

281
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,583
WAS AN ACT
OF COMPLETE DISRESPECT.

282
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,041
AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY
TO RESOLVE THIS.

283
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,917
AG NEE KAI.

284
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,834
A FIRE DUEL.

285
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,041
THAT'S RIGHT.

286
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,500
ZUKO LOOKED UPON THE OLD GENERAL
HE HAD INSULTED

287
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,375
AND DECLARED
THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID,

288
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,875
BUT ZUKO MISUNDERSTOOD.

289
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,625
WHEN HE TURNED
TO FACE HIS OPPONENT,

290
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,041
HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE
IT WAS NOT THE GENERAL.

291
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,959
ZUKO HAD SPOKEN OUT
AGAINST THE GENERAL'S PLAN,

292
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,166
BUT BY DOING SO
IN THE FIRE LORD'S WAR ROOM,

293
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,750
IT WAS THE FIRE LORD
WHOM HE HAD DISRESPECTED.

294
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:55,583
ZUKO WOULD HAVE TO DUEL
HIS OWN FATHER.

295
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,834
THEN, JUST WHEN I WAS
STARTING TO FEEL BETTER,

296
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,834
SOMETHING WORSE HAPPENED.

297
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,500
AANG NEEDS TO HAVE
FREEDOM AND FUN.

298
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:08,208
HE NEEDS TO GROW UP
AS A NORMAL BOY.

299
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,709
HMM. YOU CANNOT
KEEP PROTECTING HIM
FROM HIS DESTINY.

300
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,417
GYATSO, I KNOW
YOU MEAN WELL,

301
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,083
BUT YOU ARE LETTING
YOUR AFFECTION FOR THE BOY
CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT.

302
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,875
ALL I WANT IS WHAT
IS BEST FOR HIM.

303
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:25,041
BUT WHAT WE NEED
IS WHAT'S BEST FOR THE WORLD.

304
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:31,083
YOU AND AANG
MUST BE SEPARATED.

305
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,875
THE AVATAR WILL BE SENT AWAY
TO THE EASTERN AIR TEMPLE

306
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,917
TO COMPLETE HIS TRAINING.

307
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,542
THAT'S AWFUL, AANG.

308
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,583
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

309
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,291
HOW COULD THEY
DO THAT TO ME?

310
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,917
THEY WANTED TO TAKE AWAY
EVERYTHING I KNEW

311
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,250
AND EVERYONE I LOVED!

312
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,792
WHOA! HOT CINDERS.

313
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,959
I'M SORRY I GOT SO MAD.

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,792
YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE ANGRY

315
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,333
AFTER THE MONKS
SENT YOU AWAY LIKE THAT.

316
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,375
WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

317
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,000
[LAUGHTER]

318
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,542
I WAS AFRAID AND CONFUSED.

319
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,166
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

320
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,750
AANG?

321
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,458
I'M NOT GOING
TO LET THEM TAKE YOU
AWAY FROM ME.

322
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,125
AANG?

323
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,041
[GASPS]

324
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,709
I NEVER SAW GYATSO AGAIN.

325
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,750
[SCREAMS]

326
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,875
[ROARING]

327
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,667
NEXT THING I KNEW,
I WAS WAKING UP IN YOUR ARMS

328
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,917
AFTER YOU FOUND ME
IN THE ICEBERG.

329
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,875
YOU RAN AWAY.

330
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,542
AND THEN THE FIRE NATION
ATTACKED OUR TEMPLE.

331
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,834
MY PEOPLE NEEDED ME,
AND I WASN'T THERE
TO HELP.

332
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,750
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAVE--

333
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,709
THE WORLD NEEDED ME,
AND I WASN'T THERE
TO HELP.

334
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,792
AANG--
THE FISHERMAN
WAS RIGHT.

335
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,458
I DID TURN MY BACK
ON THE WORLD.

336
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,709
YOU'RE BEING TOO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

337
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,041
EVEN IF YOU DID RUN AWAY,

338
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,875
I THINK IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

339
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,375
IF YOU HAD STAYED,
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED

340
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,041
ALONG WITH ALL
THE OTHER AIRBENDERS.

341
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,875
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

342
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:28,875
I KNOW IT'S MEANT
TO BE THIS WAY.

343
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,041
THE WORLD NEEDS YOU NOW.

344
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,125
