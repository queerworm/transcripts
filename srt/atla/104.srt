00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:11,834
Katara: WATER, EARTH,

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:16,208
FIRE, AIR...

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,375
LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS
LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.

4
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:24,750
THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED
WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.

5
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,792
ONLY THE AVATAR,
MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
COULD STOP THEM.

6
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,625
BUT WHEN THE WORLD
NEEDED HIM MOST,

7
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,375
HE VANISHED.

8
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:36,250
100 YEARS PASSED,
AND MY BROTHER AND I
DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR,

9
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,208
AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,375
AND ALTHOUGH HIS
AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,

11
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:44,000
HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN
BEFORE HE'S READY
TO SAVE ANYONE.

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,917
BUT I BELIEVE AANG
CAN SAVE THE WORLD.

13
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:59,250
BUT BEFORE I LEARN WATERBENDING,
WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS
BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.

14
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,625
HERE WE'LL RIDE
THE HOPPING LLAMAS.

15
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:05,000
THEN WAY OVER HERE
WE'LL SURF ON THE BACKS
OF GIANT KOI FISH.

16
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,000
YOU'RE JUST
A BANISHED PRINCE.

17
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,208
NO HOME, NO ALLIES.

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,208
YOUR OWN FATHER
DOESN'T EVEN WANT YOU.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,792
YOU'RE WRONG.

20
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,458
ONCE I DELIVER THE AVATAR
TO MY FATHER,

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,542
HE WILL WELCOME ME HOME
WITH HONOR

22
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,000
AND RESTORE
MY RIGHTFUL PLACE
ON THE THRONE.

23
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,500
Katara: WHEN
THE AVATAR DIES,

24
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:25,250
HE'S REINCARNATED
INTO THE NEXT NATION
IN THE CYCLE.

25
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,917
Aang: FIREBENDERS?

26
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,417
GYATSO.

27
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,041
I REALLY AM
THE LAST AIRBENDER.

28
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:02,917
THE ONLY REASON
YOU SHOULD BE
INTERRUPTING ME

29
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,375
IS IF YOU HAVE NEWS
ABOUT THE AVATAR.

30
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,959
WELL, THERE IS NEWS,
PRINCE ZUKO,

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,375
BUT YOU MIGHT NOT
LIKE IT.

32
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,083
DON'T GET TOO UPSET.

33
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,291
UNCLE, YOU TAUGHT ME
THAT KEEPING A LEVEL HEAD

34
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,875
IS A SIGN
OF A GREAT LEADER.

35
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,291
NOW, WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO SAY,

36
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,500
I'M SURE I CAN TAKE IT.

37
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,250
OK, THEN.

38
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,291
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

39
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,250
WHAT?

40
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,083
YOU REALLY
SHOULD OPEN A WINDOW
IN HERE.

41
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,125
GIVE ME THE MAP!

42
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,083
THERE HAVE BEEN
MULTIPLE SIGHTINGS
OF THE AVATAR,

43
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,959
BUT HE IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO TRACK DOWN.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,875
HOW AM I GOING TO
FIND HIM, UNCLE?

45
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,166
HE IS CLEARLY A MASTER
OF EVASIVE MANEUVERING.

46
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,291
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE YOU'RE GOING, DO YOU?

00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,166

IT'S NEAR WATER.

PLEASE.

50
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,000
HEY, KATARA,

AIRBENDING TRICK.

51
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,166
THAT'S GREAT, AANG.

STOP BUGGING HER,

56
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,750
YOU NEED TO
GIVE GIRLS SPACE

57

WHEN THEY DO
THEIR SEWING.

58
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,208
WHAT DOES ME BEING A GIRL
HAVE TO DO WITH SEWING?

59
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,834
SIMPLE. GIRLS ARE BETTER
AT FIXING PANTS THAN GUYS,

60
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,750
AND GUYS ARE BETTER
AT HUNTING AND FIGHTING
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

61
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,083
IT'S JUST THE NATURAL
ORDER OF THINGS.

63
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,792

A GREAT JOB I DID.

YOU WON'T NEED
ANY PANTS.

A PIT STOP YESTERDAY.

69
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,041
SHOULDN'T WE GET
A LITTLE MORE FLYING DONE
BEFORE WE CAMP OUT?

70
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,625
HE'S RIGHT.

71
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:49,500

TO THE NORTH POLE
UNTIL SPRING.
