THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

346
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,959
OF COURSE IT
DOESN'T CHANGE THE WAY
I FEEL ABOUT YOU, TOPH.

347
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
IT'S MADE ME
REALIZE SOMETHING.

348
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,208
IT HAS?

349
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,208
YES. I'VE LET YOU
HAVE FAR TOO MUCH
FREEDOM.

WILL BE CARED FOR
AND GUARDED

THIS FOR YOUR
OWN GOOD, TOPH.

Mr. Bei Fong: PLEASE
ESCORT THE AVATAR
AND HIS FRIENDS OUT.

WELCOME HERE.

I'M SORRY, TOPH.

357
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:24,625
I'M SORRY, TOO.
GOOD-BYE, AANG.

358
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,750
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND YOU
A TEACHER.

TOPH, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

363
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,000
MY DAD CHANGED
HIS MIND.

364
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:53,333
HE SAID I WAS
FREE TO TRAVEL
THE WORLD.

365
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,291
WELL, WE'D BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE

366
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,417
BEFORE YOUR DAD
CHANGES HIS MIND
AGAIN.

367
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,417
GOOD IDEA.

368
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,917
YOU'RE GONNA BE
A GREAT TEACHER, TOPH.

369
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:05,709
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

ARE VERY DIFFERENT,

00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:25,208
BUT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
A COMMON INTEREST.

378
