LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.

MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
COULD STOP THEM.

BUT WHEN THE WORLD
NEEDED HIM MOST,

00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,667

DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR,

10
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,166

AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,

11
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,792

BEFORE HE'S READY
TO SAVE ANYONE.
