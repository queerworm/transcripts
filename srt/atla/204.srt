00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,834
Ah!

187
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,458
Katara!

188
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,875
Appa!

189
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,291
Hello?

190
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,041
<i>Who are you?</i>

191
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,083
[laughs]

192
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:21,959
<i>Hey!</i>

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,792
Come back.

194
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,875
[laughing]

195
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,000
[laughs]

196
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,959
[laughs]

197
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,417
Lookee there, Tho.

198
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,250
Is that a little hairy
fella riding that thing?

199
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,667
No, that's what
they call a "lemu."

200
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,250
Saw one at a traveling show
once--real smart, they say.

201
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,500
Bet he tastes a lot
like possum-chicken.

202
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,250
You think everything tastes
like possum-chicken.

203
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,625
Come on, now, fellas,
just a little closer.

204
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,583
Nice and easy.

205
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,583
Nothin' to worry about.

206
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,458
We just fixin' to eat ya.

207
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,917

208
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,625
What'd ya say that fer?

209
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:25,917
Well, we are.

210
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,834
But you don't have
to tell them that.

211
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,667
Well, how'd I know
they'd understand me?

212
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,709
Come on.

213
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,709
[laughing]

214
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,709
Who are you?

215
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:07,250
[both]
Ah!

216
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,458
Ugh.

217
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,917
[all]
Ugh.

218
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,542
What do you guys think
you're doing?

219
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,500
I've been looking
all over for you.

220
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,917
Well, I've been wandering
around looking for you.

221
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,208
I was chasing some girl.

222
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,208
What girl?

223
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,625
I don't know.

224
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:25,000
I heard laughing, and I saw
some girl in a fancy dress.

225
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,917
Well, there must be
a tea party here,

226
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,333
and we just didn't get
our invitations.

227
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,166
I thought I saw Mom.

228
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,083
Look, we were all
just scared and hungry,

229
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,917
and our minds were
playing tricks on us.

230
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,750
That's why we all
saw things out here.

231
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,000
You saw something, too?

232
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,709
I thought I saw Yue.

233
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,125
But that doesn't
prove anything.

234
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,250
Look, I think about
her all the time.

235
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,458
And you saw Mom,
someone you miss a lot.

236
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,125
What about me?

237
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,250
I didn't know
the girl I saw.

238
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,000
And all our visions
led us right here.

239
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,208
Okay, so where's here,
the middle of the swamp?

240
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,792
Yeah...

241
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,125
<i>the center.</i>

242
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,709
<i>It's the heart</i>
<i>of the swamp.</i>

243
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,709
It's been
calling us here.

244
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,125
I knew it.

245
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,125
It's just a tree.
It can't call anyone.

246
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,291
For the last time,
there's nothing after us,

247
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,417
and there's nothing
magical happening here.

248
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,750
[all]
Ah!

249
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,250
Ah!

250
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,417
[yelling]

251
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,500
Ugh.

252
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,625
[grunting]

253
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,125
Ah!

254
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,250
Ugh!

255
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,041
Ugh.

256
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,083
Ah!

257
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,333
Ugh!

258
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,500
Ah!

259
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,583
Ugh!

260
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,041
Ah!

261
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,166
[grunting]

262
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,208
Ugh.

263
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,208
[grunting]

264
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,333
Now, what would a "lemu"
need a shirt fer?

265
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,500
Ah!

266
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,542
Ugh!

267
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,375
[growling]

268
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,208
[grunting]

269
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,333
[both]
Ugh!

270
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,041
Ah!

271
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,709
Ugh.

272
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,375
Ah!

273
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,333
Ugh.

274
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,875
There's someone in there.

275
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,750
He's bending the vines.

276
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,667
Uh!

277
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:17,917
Ah!

278
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,458
Why did you call me here
if you just wanted to kill us?

279
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,542
Wait.

280
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,625
I didn't call you here.

281
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,792
We were flying over, and I heard
something calling to me,

282
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,041
telling me to land.

283
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,500
He's the Avatar.

284
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,500
Stuff like that
happens to us a lot.

285
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,250
The Avatar?

286
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,667
Come with me.

287
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,750
[Katara]
So who are you, then?

288
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,792
I protect the swamp from
folks that want to hurt it,

289
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,458
like this fellow
with his big knife.

290
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,542
See?

291
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,375
Completely reasonable--
not a monster,

292
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,750
just a regular guy
defending his home.

293
00:18:57,792 --> 00:19:00,166
Nothing mystical about it.

294
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:04,125
[man]
Oh, the swamp
is a mystical place, all right.

295
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,333
It's sacred.

296
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,834
I reached enlightenment

297
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,041
right here under
the banyan grove tree.

298
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,250
I heard it calling me,
just like you did.

299
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,041
Sure you did.

300
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,583
It seems real chatty.

301
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,000
See, this whole swamp
is actually just one tree

302
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,208
spread out over miles.

303
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,375
Branches spread then sink
and take root

304
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:31,625
and then spread some more--
one big, living organism,

305
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:35,917
just like the entire world.

306
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:40,208
I get how the tree is one big
thing, but the whole world?

307
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,333
Sure.

308
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,875
You think you're any different

309
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:46,458
from me or your friends
or this tree?

310
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,417
If you listen hard enough,

311
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:52,333
you can hear every living thing
breathing together.

312
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,458
You can feel everything growing.

313
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,375
We are all living together even
if most folks don't act like it.

314
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,709
We all have the same roots,

315
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,917
and we are all branches
of the same tree.

316
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,917
[Katara]
But what did
our visions mean?

317
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:11,208
In the swamp, we see visions
of people we've lost,

318
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,041
people we loved,
folks we think are gone.

319
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,333
But the swamp tells us
they're not.

320
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,000
We're still connected to 'em.

321
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,291
Time is an illusion,
and so is death.

322
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,208
But what about my vision?

323
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,083
It was someone
I had never met.

324
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,959
You're the Avatar.
You tell me.

325
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:38,417
Time is an illusion,
so it's someone I<i> will</i> meet.

326
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,291
Sorry to interrupt
the lesson,

327
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,333
but we still need
to find Appa and Momo.

328
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,500
I think I know
how to find them.

329
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:48,667
Everything is connected.

330
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,291

How you like
that possum-chicken?

Tastes just like
arctic hen.

349
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:08,667
So why were you guys
so interested in eating Appa?

350
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:11,333
You've get plenty of those
big things wandering around.

351

Where'd you say
you was from?

359
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,834
The South Pole.

360
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,750
Didn't know there was
Waterbenders anywhere but here.

361
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:32,208
They got a nice
swamp there, do they?

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,834
No, it's all ice
and snow.

Mm, no wonder you left.

364

Well, I hope
you realize now

365
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:42,000
that nothing strange
was going on here--

366
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,125

people living in a swamp.

00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,208
What about the visions?

368
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,458
I told you: we were hungry.

369
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,792
I'm eating a giant bug.

370
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,834
Mm-ugh.

371
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,458
But what about when
the tree showed me

372
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,125
where Appa and Momo were?

373
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,208
That's Avatar stuff.
That doesn't count.

374
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,959
The only thing
I can't figure out

375
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,375
is how you made the tornado
that sucked us down.

376
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,750
I can't do anything like that.

377
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:08,667
I just bend the water
in the plants.

378
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:11,417
Well, no accounting
for weather.

379
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,208
Still, there's absolutely
nothing mysterious

380
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,750
about the swamp.

381
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:19,917
[screaming]

382
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:20,750
thwack!

383
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,750
Who's there?

384
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,750
Whoa!

385
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:36,834
Ugh.

386
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,458
