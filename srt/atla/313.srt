THE ULTIMATE FIREBENDERS

YOUR FIREBENDING TALENTS
WOULD BECOME LEGENDARY

THEY JUDGED YOU,
AND GAVE YOU VISIONS OF
THE MEANING OF FIREBENDING.

IROH WAS THE LAST OUTSIDER
TO FACE THE MASTERS.

ON TO HIM AS WELL.

TO PROTECT THEM, SO NO ONE
ELSE WOULD HUNT THEM.

ALL THIS TIME, I THOUGHT
FIREBENDING WAS DESTRUCTION.

TOO AFRAID AND HESITANT

BECAUSE FOR SO MANY YEARS,
HUNTING YOU WAS MY DRIVE.
