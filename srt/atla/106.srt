THEY TOOK HARU AWAY!
WHAT?

179
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,709
THE OLD MAN TURNED HIM
IN TO THE FIRE NATION.

180
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,208
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
I FORCED HIM INTO EARTHBENDING.

181
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,000
SLOW DOWN, KATARA.
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

182
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,333
HARU'S MOTHER SAID
THEY CAME FOR HIM
AT MIDNIGHT.

183
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,625
THEN IT'S TOO LATE
TO TRACK HIM.
HE'S LONG GONE.

184
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,959
WE DON'T NEED
TO TRACK HIM.

185

IS GOING TO

186
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,750
TAKE ME RIGHT
TO HARU.

187
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,208
AND WHY WOULD
THEY DO THAT?

188
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,834
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO
ARREST ME FOR EARTHBENDING.

189

I THOUGHT YOU WERE CRAZY
AT FIRST, KATARA,

190
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,041
BUT THIS MIGHT WORK.

191
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,750
THERE ARE VENTILATION
SHAFTS THROUGHOUT THESE MINES.

192
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,792
ALL AANG HAS TO DO IS
SEND AN AIR CURRENT

193
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,500
FROM THAT VENT
TO THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.

194
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:50,583

AND TA-DA--

ALL THAT?

THE FUN OUT OF THIS.

INTENTIONALLY BEING CAPTURED

RUTHLESS FIREBENDERS?

203

THOSE THINGS.

212
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,500

213
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,709

00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,417
ONE WEEK IN SOLITARY
WILL IMPROVE HIS MANNERS.

SIMPLY TREAT ME WITH
THE COURTESY I GIVE YOU

243
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,750
AND WE'LL GET ALONG
FAMOUSLY.

244

THAT THIS RIG IS MADE
ENTIRELY OF METAL.

FROM ANY ROCK OR EARTH.
