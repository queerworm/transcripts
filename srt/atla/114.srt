THIS IS THE MOST
RELIABLE METHOD OF
TELLING YOUR FORTUNE.

181
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,625
THE BONES NEVER LIE.

00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,375
GO ON. PICK ONE.

183
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,417
NOW THROW IT
ON THE FIRE.

184
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,041
THE HEAT MAKES
CRACKS IN THE BONES,

185
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:07,041
AND I READ THE BONE CRACKS
TO TELL YOUR DESTINY.

OH, MY!

190
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,083
YOUR DESTINY--
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

191
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:29,125
YOU WILL BE INVOLVED
IN A GREAT BATTLE--

192
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,875
AN AWESOME CONFLICT
BETWEEN THE FORCES
OF GOOD AND EVIL.

193
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:37,291
A BATTLE WHOSE OUTCOME
WILL DETERMINE THE FATE
OF THE WHOLE WORLD.

194
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,625
YEAH, YEAH.
I KNEW THAT ALREADY,

195
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,166
BUT DID IT
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
A GIRL?

196
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,500
A GIRL?

197
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,125
YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT LOVE?

198
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,875
YES!

199
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,542
I'M SORRY,
BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

200
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,917
OH, LOOK!

201
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,583
I MUST HAVE
MISSED SOMETHING.

202
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,917
RIGHT HERE.

00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,917
IT SAYS, "TRUST YOUR HEART,
AND YOU WILL BE WITH
THE ONE YOU LOVE."

204
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,125
REALLY?

205
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,083

THAT FORTUNE-TELLING

STUPID HOAX.

YOU'RE JUST
SAYING THAT

BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE YOURSELF UNHAPPY

WELL, I LIKED
MY PREDICTIONS.

216
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,291
CERTAIN THINGS
ARE GONNA TURN
OUT VERY WELL.

217
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,250
THEY SURE ARE.

218
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,709

SOME STUFF.

221
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:35,583
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,166
WHAT'S WITH THE SKY?

223
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,834
WE'RE WAITING
FOR AUNT WU TO COME
AND READ THE CLOUDS

224
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,667
TO PREDICT THE FATE
OF THE WHOLE
VILLAGE.

225
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:50,291
THAT CLOUD KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A FLUFFY BUNNY.

226
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,625
YOU BETTER HOPE
THAT'S NOT A BUNNY.

227
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,792

HEAR YOURSELF?

00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,250
THE CLOUD READING
WILL TELL US
IF MOUNT MAKAPU

WILL REMAIN DORMANT
FOR ANOTHER YEAR

231

00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,917
WE USED TO HAVE
A TRADITION
ONCE A YEAR

OF GOING UP
THE MOUNTAIN

234

TO CHECK THE VOLCANO
OURSELVES,

MOVED TO THE VILLAGE
20 YEARS AGO,

WE HAVE A TRADITION
OF NOT DOING THAT.
