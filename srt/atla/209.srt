00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,709
BESIDES,
YOU STILL HAVE

176
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,375
A LOT
OF WATERBENDING
TO WORK ON, OK?

177
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,917
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

178
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,417
YEAH, WHATEVER.
GO SPLASH AROUND
UNTIL YOU FEEL BETTER.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,208
WHY CAN'T I DO IT?

180
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,667
INSTEAD OF LIGHTNING, IT
KEEPS EXPLODING IN MY FACE,

181
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:46,875
LIKE EVERYTHING ALWAYS DOES.

182
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,625
I WAS AFRAID
THIS MIGHT HAPPEN.

183
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:51,208
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO MASTER LIGHTNING

184
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,500
UNTIL YOU HAVE DEALT

185
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,291
WITH THE TURMOIL
INSIDE YOU.

186
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,750
WHAT TURMOIL?

187
00:10:56,792 --> 00:11:00,166
ZUKO, YOU MUST
LET GO OF YOUR
FEELINGS OF SHAME

188
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,375
IF YOU WANT YOUR
ANGER TO GO AWAY.

189
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,417
BUT I DON'T FEEL
ANY SHAME AT ALL.

190
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,709
I'M AS PROUD
AS EVER.

191
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,917
PRINCE ZUKO, PRIDE
IS NOT THE OPPOSITE
OF SHAME,

192
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,542
BUT ITS SOURCE.

193
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,792
TRUE HUMILITY IS
THE ONLY ANTIDOTE
TO SHAME.

194
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:16,417
WELL, MY LIFE
HAS BEEN NOTHING
BUT HUMBLING LATELY.

195
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,125
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

196
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,250
I WILL TEACH YOU
A FIREBENDING MOVE

197
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,291
THAT EVEN AZULA
DOESN'T KNOW,

198
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,333
BECAUSE I MADE
IT UP MYSELF.

199
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,458
YOU PROBABLY THINK I
DESERVE THIS, DON'T YOU?

200
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,542
LOOK, I'M SORRY I HUNTED YOU,

201
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,500
BUT THAT'S JUST THE NATURAL
ORDER OF THINGS.

202
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,959
BIG THINGS EAT SMALLER THINGS.
NOTHING PERSONAL.

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,792
BUT THIS TIME,
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY.

204
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:46,709
[CALLS]

205
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,291
I ADMIT IT, YOU'RE CUTE.

206
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,750
OK, YOU CONVINCED ME.

207
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,959
IF I GET OUT OF THIS ALIVE,

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,417
IT'S A KARMICALLY CORRECT
VEGETARIAN EXISTENCE FOR ME.

209
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,959
NO MEAT, EVEN THOUGH MEAT
IS SO TASTY.

210
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:18,250
HEY, IT LOOKS
LIKE MY KARMA'S
ALREADY PAYING OFF.

211
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,208
THAT'S OK. I GOT IT.

212
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,417
NOW COME BACK,
BOOMERANG.

213
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,667
[CROAKING]

214
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,834
YOU KNOW THIS BLOCK
YOU'RE HAVING IS
ONLY TEMPORARY,

215
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,917
RIGHT?

216
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,000
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

217
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,000
YOU DO REALIZE
THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
DON'T YOU?

218
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,000
IF YOU FACE
THIS ISSUE INSTEAD
OF AVOIDING IT...

219
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,834
I KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

220
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,250
I GET IT, ALL RIGHT?
I NEED TO FACE IT
HEAD-ON LIKE A ROCK.

221
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,041
BUT I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

222
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,250
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
CAN'T, BUT I CAN'T.

223
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,291
AANG, IF
FIRE AND WATER
ARE OPPOSITES,

224
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,291
THEN WHAT'S
THE OPPOSITE OF AIR?

225
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,917
I GUESS IT'S EARTH.

226
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,125
THAT'S WHY
IT'S SO HARD FOR
YOU TO GET THIS.

227
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,917
YOU'RE WORKING
WITH YOUR NATURAL
OPPOSITE.

228
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,500
BUT YOU'LL FIGURE
IT OUT.

229
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:06,959
I KNOW YOU WILL.

230
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,542
THINK FAST.

231
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,333
EXCELLENT. YOU HAVE
THE REFLEXES OF
A WATERBENDING MASTER.

232
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,959
THANKS, KATARA,
SIFU KATARA.

233
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,000
FIRE IS THE ELEMENT
OF POWER.

234
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,333
THE PEOPLE OF
THE FIRE NATION
HAVE DESIRE AND WILL

235
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,500
AND THE ENERGY
AND DRIVE TO ACHIEVE
WHAT THEY WANT.

236
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,917
EARTH IS THE ELEMENT
OF SUBSTANCE.

237
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,000
THE PEOPLE OF
THE EARTH KINGDOM

238
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,834
ARE DIVERSE
AND STRONG.

239
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,500
THEY ARE PERSISTENT
AND ENDURING.

240
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:47,625
AIR IS THE ELEMENT
OF FREEDOM.

241
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,792
THE AIR NOMADS
DETACHED THEMSELVES

242
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:52,917
FROM WORLDLY
CONCERNS

243
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,959
AND FOUND PEACE
AND FREEDOM.

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,792
ALSO, THEY
APPARENTLY HAD

245
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,458
PRETTY GOOD SENSES
OF HUMOR.

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,291
WATER IS THE ELEMENT
OF CHANGE.

247
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,417
THE PEOPLE OF
THE WATER TRIBE

248
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,750
ARE CAPABLE
OF ADAPTING
TO MANY THINGS.

249
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:14,375
THEY HAVE A DEEP
SENSE OF COMMUNITY
AND LOVE

250
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,917
THAT HOLDS THEM
TOGETHER THROUGH
ANYTHING.

251
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,667
WHY ARE YOU TELLING
ME THESE THINGS?

252
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,375
IT IS IMPORTANT TO
DRAW WISDOM FROM MANY
DIFFERENT PLACES.

253
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,041
IF WE TAKE IT FROM
ONLY ONE PLACE,

254
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,208
IT BECOMES RIGID
AND STALE.

255
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,041
UNDERSTANDING
OTHERS--THE OTHER
ELEMENTS

256
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,375
AND THE OTHER
NATIONS--

257
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,667
WILL HELP YOU
BECOME WHOLE.

258
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,834
ALL THIS 4 ELEMENTS
TALK IS SOUNDING

259
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,458
LIKE AVATAR STUFF.

260
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,792
IT IS THE COMBINATION
OF THE 4 ELEMENTS
IN ONE PERSON

261
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,875
THAT MAKES THE AVATAR
SO POWERFUL,

262
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,709
BUT IT CAN MAKE
YOU MORE
POWERFUL, TOO.

263
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,917
YOU SEE, THE TECHNIQUE
I AM ABOUT TO TEACH YOU

264
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,208
IS ONE I LEARNED
BY STUDYING
THE WATERBENDERS.

265
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:04,709
AANG...

266
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,208
I FOUND THESE NUTS
IN YOUR BAG.

267
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,875
I FIGURED YOU
WOULDN'T MIND.

268
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,208
AND BESIDES,
EVEN IF YOU DID,

269
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,041
YOU'RE TOO MUCH
OF A PUSHOVER TO DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

270
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,709
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DON'T MIND.

271
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,875
I'M HAPPY TO SHARE
ANYTHING I HAVE.

272
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,667
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
GLAD YOU FEEL THAT WAY,

273
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,375
BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE
THIS GREAT NEW NUTCRACKER.

274
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,625
ACTUALLY, I'D PREFER
IF YOU DIDN'T--

275
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,875
[SMASH]

276
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,250
THAT'S AN ANTIQUE,
HANDCRAFTED BY
THE MONK--

277
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,000
IT'S A DELICATE
INSTRUMENT.

278
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,667
IT'S NOT THE ONLY
DELICATE INSTRUMENT
AROUND HERE.

279
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,750
OM.

280
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,375
HEY, AANG,
HAVE YOU SEEN--

281
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,000
MEDITATING HERE.

282
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,291
IT'S IMPORTANT.
IT'S ALMOST SUNDOWN,

283
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,458
AND SOKKA ISN'T
BACK YET.

284
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,417
I THINK WE SHOULD
SEARCH FOR HIM.

285
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,083
WE'LL FIND HIM FASTER
IF WE SPLIT UP.

286
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,417
OK, KARMA PERSON OR THING,

287
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,709
WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE
OF THIS STUFF,

288
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,417
IF I CAN JUST GET OUT OF
THIS SITUATION ALIVE,

289
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:08,000
I WILL GIVE UP MEAT
AND SARCASM, OK?

290
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,417
OW! THAT'S ALL I GOT.

291
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,417
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
MY WHOLE IDENTITY.

292
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,083
SOKKA, THE MEAT AND SARCASM GUY.

293
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,000
BUT I'M WILLING TO BE SOKKA,

294
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,917
THE VEGGIES
AND STRAIGHT-TALK FELLOW.

295
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:20,917
DEAL?

296
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,125
AANG!

297
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,250
THANK GOODNESS.
HAVE YOU GOT ANY MEAT?

298
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,041
SOKKA, ARE YOU OK?

299
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,500
STOP, STOP!
YOU'RE GONNA PULL
MY FINGERS OFF.

300
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,709
AND I DON'T THINK
THE REST OF ME
IS COMING.

301
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,041
HMM, I BET I CAN AIRBEND
YOU OUT OF HERE.

302
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,875
SERIOUSLY, AANG, I KNOW
YOU'RE NEW AT IT,

303
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,333
BUT I COULD USE A LITTLE
EARTHBENDING HERE.
HOW ABOUT IT?

304
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,000
I CAN'T.

305
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,083
I CAN'T DO IT.

306
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,583
WELL, IF YOU
CAN'T EARTHBEND ME
OUT OF HERE,

307
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,709
GO GET TOPH.

308
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,834
I CAN'T DO THAT EITHER.

309
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,583
YOU CAN'T? WHY NOT?

310
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:07,834
IT WOULD JUST BE
REALLY...UNCOMFORTABLE.

311
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,166
"UNCOMFORTABLE."

312
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,417
WELL, I WOULDN'T
WANT YOU TO FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE.

313
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,250
THANKS, SOKKA.

314
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,709
THIS WHOLE
EARTHBENDING THING

315
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,291
REALLY
HAS ME CONFUSED.

316
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,041
THERE'S SO MUCH
PRESSURE.

317
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,166
EVERYONE EXPECTS ME
TO GET IT
RIGHT AWAY.

318
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,875
IT PUTS ME IN
A REALLY AWKWARD
POSITION.

319
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,208
AWKWARD POSITION? I THINK
I KNOW THE FEELING.

320
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,208
IF I TRY, I FAIL.

321
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,125
BUT IF I DON'T
TRY, I'M NEVER
GONNA GET IT.

322
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,917
I FEEL LIKE I'M
CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK
AND A HARD PLACE.

323
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,125
HMM, HOW ABOUT THAT?

324
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,625
AANG, THIS IS MY FRIEND,
FUFU CUDDLY POOPS.

325
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,875
FUFU CUDDLY POOPS,
AANG.

326
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:43,250
AW. WHAT A CUTE NAME
FOR A LITTLE BABY
SABERTOOTH MOOSE LION CUB.

327
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,875
REALLY? HE LOOKS

328
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,417
NOTHING LIKE
A SABERTOOTH
MOOSE LION.

329
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,709
IT'S HARD TO TELL BEFORE
THEIR GIANT TEETH
AND HORNS GROW IN.

330
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,291
WHAT YOU DOING OUT
HERE, LITTLE GUY?

331
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,542
DID YOU LOSE YOUR MAMA?

332
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,250
[ANIMAL GROWLING]

333
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,709
WATERBENDERS DEAL
WITH THE FLOW OF ENERGY.

334
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,709
A WATERBENDER LETS
THEIR DEFENSE BECOME
THEIR OFFENSE,

335
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,542
TURNING THEIR OPPONENT'S
ENERGY AGAINST THEM.

336
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,000
I LEARNED A WAY TO
DO THIS WITH LIGHTNING.

337
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,375
YOU CAN TEACH ME TO
REDIRECT LIGHTNING?

338
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:20,208
IF YOU LET THE ENERGY
IN YOUR OWN BODY FLOW,

339
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,208
THE LIGHTNING WILL
FOLLOW IT.

340
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,041
YOU MUST CREATE
A PATHWAY FROM
YOUR FINGERTIPS

341
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,417
UP YOUR ARM
