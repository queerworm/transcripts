00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,542
Katara: WATER...

2
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,166

3
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,583
FIRE...

4
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,667
AIR.

5
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:20,083
LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS
LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.

6
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:24,667
THEN, EVERYTHING CHANGED
WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.

7
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:27,333
ONLY THE AVATAR,
MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,875
COULD STOP THEM.

9
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,667
BUT WHEN THE WORLD
NEEDED HIM MOST,

10
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:31,875
HE VANISHED.

11
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,959
100 YEARS PASSED,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
AND MY BROTHER AND I
DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR--

13
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,000
AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,917
AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING
SKILLS ARE GREAT,

15
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,750
HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE
HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,375
Aang: OOF.

17
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,875
Katara: BUT I BELIEVE AANG
CAN SAVE THE WORLD.

18
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,166
I'VE DECIDED TO GO
TO THE SOUTH POLE.

19
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,709
WHAT ABOUT AANG?

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,250
HE STILL NEEDS TO LEARN
WATERBENDING.

21
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,083
THEN HE BETTER GET
USED TO CALLING YOU

22
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,458
MASTER KATARA.

23
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,166
I'M TIRED.

24
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,625
THEN YOU SHOULD REST.

25
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,291
A MAN NEEDS HIS REST.

26
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,500
PRINCE ZUKO IS
A FAILURE.

27
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,208
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU.

28
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,625

DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

32
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,500
NAH. JUST A NIGHTMARE.

33
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,000
I WAS IN THE AVATAR
STATE,

34
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,250
BUT I WAS OUTSIDE MY
BODY WATCHING MYSELF.

35
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,166
IT WAS SCARY.

36
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,041
I WAS SCARY.

37
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,458
KATARA, I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,333

WATER FROM
THE SPIRIT OASIS.

39
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,083

UNIQUE PROPERTIES.

40
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,959

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,792
THANK YOU,
MASTER PAKKU.

WILL HELP YOU MASTER

BUT REMEMBER,

45

THEY'RE
NO SUBSTITUTE FOR
A REAL MASTER.

00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:52,083
I SEE. IT'S
THE ANNIVERSARY,
ISN'T IT?

63
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,709
3 YEARS AGO
TODAY, I WAS BANISHED.

64
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,166
I LOST IT ALL.
I WANT IT BACK.

65
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,333
I WANT THE AVATAR.
I WANT MY HONOR,
MY THRONE.

66
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,417
I WANT MY FATHER NOT
TO THINK I'M WORTHLESS.

67
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,834
I'M SURE HE DOESN'T.
WHY WOULD HE BANISH YOU
IF HE DIDN'T CARE?

68
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,250
UH, THAT CAME OUT
WRONG, DIDN'T IT?

69
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,333
MY BROTHER AND MY UNCLE
HAVE DISGRACED
THE FIRE LORD

70
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,667
AND BROUGHT SHAME
ON ALL OF US.

BUT I ASSURE YOU,

74

HESITATE TO BRING YOU DOWN.

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,917
THE TIDES WILL NOT
ALLOW US TO BRING
THE SHIP INTO PORT

78

BEFORE NIGHTFALL.

79
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,917
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN,
BUT I DO NOT KNOW
MUCH ABOUT THE TIDES.

80
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,250
CAN YOU EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO ME?

I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

WOULD NOT ALLOW US
TO BRING THE SHIP IN.

85

COMMAND THIS SHIP?

86

NO, PRINCESS.

YOU THROWN OVERBOARD,

TWICE ABOUT SMASHING YOU

NO, PRINCESS.

WORRY LESS ABOUT THE TIDES,

ABOUT IT TOO MUCH.

TO MASTER ALL

THERE'S A RIGHT
WAY TO DO THIS--

158

AND DISCIPLINE.

00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,959
I GUESS HE COULD TALK
THE FIRE LORD TO DEATH.

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,875
UH!

175
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,959
MAYBE I CAN SHOCK YOU
INTO THE AVATAR STATE.

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,959
I LOVE SURPRISES.

177
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,000
AAH!

178

179

UH! UH! AAH!

PIECE OF CLOTHING

181

FROM EACH OF
THE BENDING NATIONS.

182
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:31,083

INTO ONE.

183
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:37,208

184
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,750
FOUR ELEMENTS TOGETHER AS ONE.

185
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,041
THIS IS JUST MUD.

186
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,291
SO, DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING?

187
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:49,500

USELESS THINGS.

192

YOU FORGET, WE HAVE
TO CARRY EVERYTHING
OURSELVES NOW.

193
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,917
HELLO, BROTHER,

194
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,208

195
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

196
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:18,709
IN MY COUNTRY, WE
EXCHANGE A PLEASANT HELLO
BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS.

197
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,333
HAVE YOU BECOME
UNCIVILIZED
SO SOON, ZUZU?

198
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,125
DON'T CALL ME THAT.

199
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,917
TO WHAT DO WE OWE
THIS HONOR?

200
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,417
HMM, MUST BE A FAMILY TRAIT.

201
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,625
BOTH OF YOU SO QUICK
TO GET TO THE POINT.

202
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,208
I'VE COME

203
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,083
WITH A MESSAGE
FROM HOME.

204
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,000
FATHER'S CHANGED
HIS MIND.
FAMILY IS

205
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,166
SUDDENLY
VERY IMPORTANT
TO HIM.

206
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,709
HE'S HEARD
RUMORS OF PLANS
TO OVERTHROW HIM--

207
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,792
TREACHEROUS PLOTS.

208
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:46,959

THE ONLY ONES YOU
CAN REALLY TRUST.

209

FATHER REGRETS
YOUR BANISHMENT.
HE WANTS YOU HOME.

210
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:58,000
DID YOU HEAR ME?
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY,
EXCITED, GRATEFUL.

211
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,000
I JUST GAVE YOU
GREAT NEWS.

212
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,041
I'M SURE YOUR BROTHER
SIMPLY NEEDS A MOMENT--

213
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,542
DON'T INTERRUPT,
UNCLE.

214
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,667
I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD
MY THANK YOU.

215
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,709
I'M NOT A MESSENGER.
I DIDN'T HAVE TO COME
ALL THIS WAY.

216
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,208
FATHER REGRETS?
HE WANTS ME BACK?

217
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,125
I CAN SEE YOU NEED
TIME TO TAKE THIS IN.

218
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,667
I'LL COME TO CALL
ON YOU TOMORROW.
GOOD EVENING.

219
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,834
Katara: CAN WE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING?

220
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,750
Aang: SURE.

221
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,500
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE AT
THE AIR TEMPLE

222
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,625
AND YOU FOUND
MONK GYATSO'S
SKELETON?

223
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,417
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
SO HORRIBLE AND
TRAUMATIC FOR YOU.

224
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,208
I SAW YOU GET
SO UPSET

225
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,709
THAT YOU WEREN'T
EVEN YOU ANYMORE.

226
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,583
I'M NOT SAYING
THE AVATAR STATE

227
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,125
DOESN'T HAVE INCREDIBLE
AND HELPFUL POWER.

228
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,375
BUT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND, FOR
THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU,

229
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,583
WATCHING YOU BE IN
THAT MUCH RAGE AND PAIN
IS REALLY SCARY.

230
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,125
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU TOLD ME THAT,

231
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,041
BUT I STILL NEED
TO DO THIS.

232
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,792
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

233
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,375
NO, YOU DON'T.

234
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,792
EVERY DAY, MORE
AND MORE PEOPLE DIE.

235
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,041
I'M ALREADY
A HUNDRED YEARS LATE.

236
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,792
DEFEATING THE FIRE LORD
IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP
THIS WAR.

237
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,750
I HAVE TO TRY IT.

238
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,125
I CAN'T WATCH YOU
DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

239
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,125
I'M NOT COMING
TOMORROW.

240
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,792
GOOD NIGHT.

241
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:15,667
GOOD NIGHT.

242
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,417
WE'RE GOING HOME

243
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,083
AFTER 3 LONG YEARS.

244
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,500
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

245
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,333
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.

246
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,041
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN MY BROTHER
TO REGRET ANYTHING.

247
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,125
DID YOU LISTEN
TO AZULA?

248
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,125
FATHER'S REALIZED
HOW IMPORTANT
FAMILY IS TO HIM.

249
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,375
HE CARES ABOUT ME.

250
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,208
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

251
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,625
I MEAN, IF OZAI
WANTS YOU BACK,
WELL,

252
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,500
I THINK IT MAY NOT
BE FOR THE REASONS
YOU IMAGINE.

253
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,709
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
MY FATHER FEELS ABOUT ME.

254
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,250
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

255
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,834
ZUKO, I ONLY MEANT
THAT IN OUR FAMILY,

256
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,500
THINGS ARE
NOT ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM.

257
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,000
I THINK YOU ARE EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SEEM--

258
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,125
A LAZY, MISTRUSTFUL,
SHALLOW OLD MAN

259
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,458

JEALOUS OF HIS BROTHER.

HUH?

263
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,792
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD BE TRYING
TO BRING ON

264
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,041
THE AVATAR STATE.

265
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,041
YOU SURE?

266
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,083
YES.

267
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,083
OK.

268
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,917
DO YOU THINK
THE GENERAL
WILL BE MAD?

269
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,083
WHAT CAN HE SAY?
YOU'RE THE AVATAR.

270
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,542

THAN YOU?

271

CHANGED YOUR MIND.

TOGETHER, RIGHT?

GOING HOME.

ABLE TO TRIGGER IT

00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,083
ON PURPOSE.

279
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,041
SO I GUESS THAT'S IT.

280
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,000
SURE I CAN'T
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

281
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,083
I'M SURE. I CAN ONLY
REACH THE AVATAR STATE

ABOUT TO GET RESULTS.

THE AVATAR STATE IS
A DEFENSE MECHANISM
DESIGNED

347
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,542
TO EMPOWER YOU WITH
THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE

348
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,959
OF ALL THE PAST AVATARS.

349
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,125
THE GLOW IS THE COMBINATION
OF ALL YOUR PAST LIVES

350
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,083
FOCUSING THEIR ENERGY
THROUGH YOUR BODY.

351
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,583
IN THE AVATAR STATE,

352
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,250
YOU ARE AT YOUR MOST POWERFUL...

353
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,875
BUT YOU'RE ALSO
AT YOUR MOST VULNERABLE.

354
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

355
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,041
IF YOU ARE KILLED IN
THE AVATAR STATE,

356
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,542
THE REINCARNATION CYCLE
WILL BE BROKEN

357
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,083
AND THE AVATAR
WILL CEASE TO EXIST.

358
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:31,834
I'M SORRY, KATARA.
I HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE
TO SEE ME LIKE THAT AGAIN.

359
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,333
HA! ARE YOU JOKING?
THAT WAS ALMOST PERFECT.

360
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,208
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT
A WAY TO CONTROL YOU
WHEN YOU'RE LIKE THAT.

361
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,083
YOU'RE OUT OF
YOUR MIND.

362
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,083
I GUESS WE'LL FIGURE
IT OUT ON THE WAY
TO THE FIRE NATION.

363
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,208
ANYBODY GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

364
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,625
DO YOU STILL
WANT AN ESCORT
TO OMASHU?

365
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,041
I THINK WE'RE
ALL SET.

366
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,959
ANYONE WHO HARBORS
THESE TRAITORS

367
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,417
WILL FACE THE WRATH OF
THE FIRE LORD.

368
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,000
THERE WILL BE

369
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,959
NO PLACE LEFT TO HIDE.

370
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,375
I THINK WE'RE
SAFE HERE.
