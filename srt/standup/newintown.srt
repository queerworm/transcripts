13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,000
Hi!

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,666
Hi!

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,633
Hello!

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,566
Hi!

17
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:49,900
[laughing]
How are you?

18
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,333
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,266
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

20
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,466
Thank you very much.
That's so nice of you.

21
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,100
I hope you're having
a good week.

22
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,200
Thank you for being here.

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,933
I am doing well myself.

24
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:02,133
In a couple days,
I'm gonna turn 29 years old

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,833
And I'm very excited
about that.

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,233
I was hoping by now
that I would look older

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,033
But it didn't happen.

28
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,900
I don't look older,
I just look worse, I think.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600
Honestly, when I'm walking
down the street,

30
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,733
No one's ever like,
"Hey! Look at that man."

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,900
I think they're just like

32
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,733
"Whoa! That tall child
looks terrible."

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,666
Get some rest, tall child.

34
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:25,400
You can't keep burning
the candle at both ends.

35
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,266
You ever seen on
<i>America's Most Wanted</i>

36
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,033
when they age a photo
of someone?

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,666
Just take my kindergarten photo
and yellow the teeth

38
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,433
And put bags under the eyes
and be like,

39
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,000
"This is what
he would look like now."

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,366
I was a very nervous kid.

41
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,366
I was anxious all the time
when I was younger.

42
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,200
But what's nice is that some of
the things I was anxious about

43
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:44,100
don't bother me at all
anymore.

44
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,800
Like, uh, I always thought

45
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:49,166
that quicksand was gonna be
a much bigger problem

46
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,333
than it turned out to be.

47
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:55,866
Because if you watch cartoons,
quicksand is like the third

48
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,466
biggest thing you have
to worry about in adult life...

49
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,433
Behind real sticks of dynamite

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,800
And giant anvils
falling on you

51
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:03,966
from the sky.

52
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:06,066
I used to sit around
and think about

53
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,700
what to do about quicksand.

54
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,733
I never thought about
how to handle real problems

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,666
in adult life.

56
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,333
I was never like,
"Oh, what's it gonna be like

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,933
when relatives ask
to borrow money?"

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,166
Now I've gotten older.

59
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:17,066
Not only have I never stepped
in quicksand,

60
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,766
I've never even
heard about it.

61
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,966
No one's ever been like, "hey,
if you're coming to visit,

62
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:25,200
take I-90 'cause I-95 has a
little quicksand in the middle.

63
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,600
Looks like regular sand,

64
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,500
but then you're gonna start
to sink into it."

65
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,533
I was nervous all the time,
but I had a good family.

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,033
I have wonderful parents.

67
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
A lot of guys my age,

68
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,400
I'll hear them say this--
they go,

69
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:39,933
"Every day I think I'm becoming
more like my dad."

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,166
I think I'm becoming
more like my mom

71
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,833
because I was watching
that show <i>Access Hollywood</i>

72
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,366
and one of the reporters said,

73
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,833
"Up next, we have an exclusive
interview with Sandra Bullock's

74
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,266
former husband Jesse James."

75
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,366
And out loud, I went
"Ugh, this oughta be good!"

76
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,100
That's pure mom.

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,400
My parents are both lawyers.
They are both lawyers.

78
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,833
And sometimes they would
be like lawyers with us

79
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
when we were kids.

80
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,466
I remember one time
I was in bed

81
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,333
and my dad came in and he said,
"Good night, John.

82
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,300
Did you brush your teeth?"

83
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:15,366
And I said "Yes."
But here's the thing.

84
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,633
I hadn't.
But who cares?

85
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,533
I didn't have like a job
interview or anything.

86
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,266
So my dad comes back
in a couple minutes

87
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,666
holding my toothbrush.

88
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,900
He says, "John,
is this your toothbrush?

89
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,233
And I said, "Yes."

90
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,633
And he said, "So we agree
that this is your toothbrush."

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,633
Then he said, "John,
this toothbrush is bone dry."

92
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,400
Like, he looked down
and he said, "Bone dry."

93
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:40,533
He said, "you lied to me."
I said, "dad, I did not lie.

94
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,866
"I said
that I brushed my teeth.

95
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,133
I never specified
that I brushed
my teeth tonight.

96
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
And if the court reporter
reads back my remarks,

97
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,700
you will see that I did not
perjure myself."

98
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
My mom's also a lawyer.

99
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,433
She was a different kind
of lawyer with us

100
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
when we were kids.

101
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,333
My mom was more like
Nancy Grace.

102
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,733
She would just make
wild accusations all day long

103
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,300
and wait for something
to stick.

104
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,766
My mom would blame me
for things that happened

105
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,500
on the news.

106
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,500
That is true.

107
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,766
I woke up one morning
when I was a kid

108
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,700
and my mom was standing
over my bed.

109
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:15,600
And she said, "I just heard
that Princess Diana
and her lover

110
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,200
Dodi Al-Fayed have been killed
in Paris"

111
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,333
Like I had something to do
with it.

112
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,233
I was like, "Mom, I have been
here all night.

113
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,866
You can feel the TV.
It's warm."

114
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,400
Luckily, I had a good alibi
since I was in
Wisconsin and 12.

115
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,900
My brothers and sisters and I
had this babysitter

116
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:39,633
named Veronica
when we were kids,

117
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,333
and I was in love with her.

118
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:42,866
I was in love with Veronica.

119
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,500
She would babysit us
on Saturday nights.

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
And in my head,
when I was a little kid,

121
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:50,666
I thought that Veronica
was like 25, 30 years old.

122
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,366
I was just talking to my mom
the other week.

123
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,900
I found out that when I was 10,
Veronica was 13.

124
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,200
So why was she in charge?

125
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:04,100
All she could do was dial
the telephone a little better

126
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,900
than I could.

127
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,300
Thirteen when I'm 10?

128
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:10,100
That's just like hiring
a slightly bigger child.

129
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,533
That would be like if you're
going out of town for the week

130
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,466
and you paid a horse
to watch your dog.

131
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,500
Like, "All right, here is
the number where we'll be,

132
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,566
and here's where we keep
the dog food.

133
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,266
And you're a horse.

134
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:25,800
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

135
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,933
Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh."

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,700
Why do people do that?
People always shush animals.

137
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,166
They go, "hey, shh, shh, shh."

138
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,133
They've never spoken.

139
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,666
I always wanted to live
in New York when I was a kid.

140
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,466
I'm so excited that I get
to live in New York.

141
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,366
I saw New York city in a movie
when I was a kid.

142
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:46,166
It was called <i>Home Alone 2:</i>
<i>Lost in New York.</i>

143
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,933
It is a sequel.
Yeah, how about that movie?

144
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,933
It was a sequel to the movie
<i>Home Alone.</i>

145
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:00,300
I remember in that movie--
oh, the kid in <i>Home Alone 2.</i>

146
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,700
He gets into a stretch
limousine on 5th avenue

147
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,500
with a large cheese pizza,
and I thought,

148
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:06,466
"This is
the height of luxury!"

149
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,066
Now I live in New York
and I'm psyched,

150
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,400
but that is a stupid
movie title.

151
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,333
Lost in New York?
The streets are numbered.

152
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,366
How'd you get
lost in New York?

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,333
I know it's kind of stupid
to complain about a movie

154
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,800
that came out 17 years ago.

155
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,966
But I wasn't a comedian
back then.

156
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,333
So I have to do it now.
I wish I'd been.

157
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,333
I wish I'd been a Def Jam comic
when that movie came out.

158
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,200
I would have torn it
to pieces.

159
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,166
Be like, "You seen this shit?

160
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:40,266
You seen this<i> Home Alone 2:</i>
<i>Lost in New York</i> shit?

161
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,966
It's a grid system,
motherfucker.

162
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,466
Where you at?
24th and 5th?

163
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,166
Where you wanna go?
35th and 6th?

164
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,500
11 up and 1 over,
you simple bitch!"

165
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:53,533
That'd be my big joke.
That'd be the closer.

166
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,300
If I was a Def Jam comic
when that movie came out.

167
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,300
But alas, I was not.

168
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,633
I think the bullying that young
people have to go through now

169
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,100
in schools is really rough.

170
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,633
I really sympathize, 'cause
I was bullied when I was a kid.

171
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,166
When I was in grade school,

172
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,866
I was bullied for being
Asian-American.

173
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,100
And the biggest problem
with that...

174
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:19,133
is that I am not
Asian-American.

175
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,366
But when I was younger,
and this is absolutely true,

176
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:25,300
People thought that I might be
Asian-American.

177
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,733
I have pretty thin eyes.

178
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,333
I had very thin eyes
when I was a little kid

179
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,666
And I had straight black hair
that I wore in a bowl cut.

180
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,500
And from the ages of three
to eight,

181
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,900
people thought that I might be
a young Chinese person.

182
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,666
On the first day
that he met me,

183
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,533
The guy that is now
my best friend--

184
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
He met me the first day
of kindergarten--

185
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:43,500
He went home that night
and said,

186
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:46,766
"Papa, today I met a boy
with no eyes."

187
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,966
And that was me.

188
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,400
Kids would make fun of me
in middle school.

189
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,933
Kids would call me
a "China man."

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,500
Which, of the racial slurs,
has got to be the laziest.

191
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:02,500
That is just pushing
two words together.

192
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,800
No work was done there.

193
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,533
It was very confusing to me
'cause I'm not Chinese.

194
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
No one in my family
is remotely Asian.

195
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,100
I mean, we take our shoes off
when we come inside,

196
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,833
But that was more
of a carpeting
thing than anything else.

197
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,666
Here's how bad it got though.

198
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,900
I remember when
I was in junior high,

199
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:21,666
We had this music
appreciation class
that we never appreciated.

200
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,700
And they took us to hear
some classical music once

201
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,066
At a symphony orchestra.

202
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,400
So we go
to a symphony orchestra.

203
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,933
In one of these classical
pieces,

204
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,266
There's a moment where they
bang a gong.

205
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,799
And every time they banged
the gong,

206
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,433
All the kids sitting
in front of me would stand up

207
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,000
turn to me and bow like that.

208
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:44,033
Which is some racist-ass
bullshit...

209
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,033
But also incredibly
well coordinated...

210
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:51,133
for a group of 13-year-olds.

211
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:55,500
Thirteen-year-olds
are the meanest
people in the world.

212
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:58,233
They terrify me to this day.

213
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,533
If I'm on the street
on like a Friday at 3:00 p.m.

214
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,166
And I see a group
of eighth graders

215
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,400
on one side of the street,

216
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:07,000
I will cross to the other side
of the street.

217
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,233
Because eighth graders
will make fun of you

218
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,966
But in an accurate way.

219
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:15,033
They will get to the thing
that you don't like about you.

220
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
They don't even need to look
at you for long.

221
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:19,133
They'll just be like
"ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

222
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,566
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

223
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,900
Hey, look at that
high-waisted man.

224
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:23,133
He got feminine hips."

225
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,600
And I'm like "No! That's
the thing I'm sensitive about!"

226
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,533
When I was a boy,
I was also confused

227
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,133
With a woman sometimes
over the phone.

228
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:41,533
Because before
I went through puberty,

229
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,866
I had a voice like
a little flute.

230
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:48,166
I was once on the telephone
with blockbuster video,

231
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,700
which is a very old-fashioned
sentence.

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
And--it is.

233
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,500
I was on the telephone
with blockbuster video.

234
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,100
That's like when your gram
would be like,

235
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,866
"We'd all go play jacks
down at the soda fountain."

236
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,666
And you're like, "No one knows
what you're talking about,

237
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,166
You idiot."

238
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,000
You know how you talk
to your grandma?

239
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,900
So...

240
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,666
I was on the phone
with blockbuster.

241
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:12,133
I'd called them a couple
of times in one day

242
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,666
To ask about a movie.

243
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:14,966
And I called for a third time.

244
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:17,733
I said, "Hey, yeah.
I was just calling to see

245
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,433
if you had
<i>Addams Family Values</i> yet."

246
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
And the guy at blockbuster
went, "Hey, lady...

247
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:26,433
I'll tell you when we get
<i>Addams Family Values."</i>

248
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,766
But look, I wasn't offended
as a boy being confused

249
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,833
with a lady.

250
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,933
I was offended as a lady
who was getting pushed around

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,833
by this chauvinist asshole
that works
at blockbuster video,

252
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,666
Talking to me
like I'm some floozy.

253
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,800
I am a proud Asian-American
woman

254
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:47,100
And you will treat me
with respect.

255
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,933
I am a tiger mom.

256
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,133
Now when people
make fun of me,

257
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,033
I deserve it.

258
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,500
Uh, I do.

259
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,266
When people get mad at me now,
it's my fault.

260
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,600
When people get mad at me
on the highway,

261
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,666
that's all my bad.

262
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm a terrible driver.
I know nothing about cars.

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I meant to learn about cars,
and then I forgot.

264
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,366
Nothing that
I know can help you
with your car ever.

265
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,733
Unless you're like,
"Hey, I've got a flat tire.

266
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,300
Does anyone here know a lot
about <i>the Cosby Show?"</i>

267
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,966
And then I could be like,
"Oh, perhaps I could be

268
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,666
of some assistance."

269
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,066
I'm one of the worst drivers
I have ever seen,

270
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,733
and I just want you all
to know

271
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,066
that if you're ever
on the highway behind me,

272
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:29,266
uh, I hear you honking
and I also don't want me

273
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,500
to be doing what I'm doing.

274
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,866
I don't like that
I'm in that lane either,

275
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,133
and I sure would like
to get out of it.

276
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,600
I was on the highway
in Texas recently

277
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,433
which was like a highway filled
with 13-year-olds.

278
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,700
And I was in
the far left lane.

279
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,000
And I was going
in the far left lane

280
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:48,066
and then it turned
into a U-turn only lane.

281
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,633
And I started to make a u-turn,
but then I panicked

282
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,133
'cause I didn't wanna make
a U-turn.

283
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,300
So I put the car in reverse
and then merged right

284
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:55,033
back onto the highway.

285
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,400
The best thing about that
was that, after that,

286
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,933
cars were pulling up
and looking over

287
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:03,200
to see who just did that piece
of shit move,

288
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:07,800
expecting to see like
a 100-year-old blind dog

289
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:11,333
who's texting while driving
and drinking a smoothie.

290
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,933
Instead, they see a 28-year-old
healthy man trying this best.

291
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,233
It's wrong to make fun
of people, you know,

292
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,133
But it's so fun sometimes.

293
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,866
I've written
for some TV shows,

294
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,766
and, you know,
on a major TV show,

295
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,333
you have to be careful about
what you say about people

296
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,900
'cause a lot of people
get offended,

297
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:35,533
or so it has been
explained to me.

298
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:37,866
I was once--
I'll tell you this.

299
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,466
I was writing for
an awards show once,

300
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:40,566
and I got into some trouble.

301
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,500
I wrote a joke
for this awards show

302
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,000
That had the word "midget"
in it.

303
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:47,033
And someone from the network
came down to our offices

304
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,533
And he said to me,

305
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,033
"Hey, you can't put the word
'midget' on TV."

306
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,700
And I said,
"I sure would like to."

307
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:58,400
And he said, "No, 'midget'
is as bad as the 'N' word."

308
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:01,033
First off, no.

309
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,333
No, it's not.

310
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:07,033
"Do you know how I know
it's not," I said to him,

311
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,333
"Is because we're saying
the word 'midget'

312
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,700
and we're not even saying
what the 'N' word is.

313
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,833
"If you're comparing
the badness of two words,

314
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,800
and you won't even say
one of them...

315
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,766
That's the worse word."

316
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,133
Also, I don't mean
to gloss over

317
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,100
what, like, little people have
been through in this country,

318
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,100
but you cannot compare
the plight of midgets

319
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,633
to African-Americans.

320
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,933
That is outrageous.

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,566
Midgets were never enslaved,

322
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:35,700
Unless you count
the wonka factory.

323
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,733
So we get into this argument,
we're going back and forth.

324
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,866
he goes, "You can't
put that word on TV."

325
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,166
And I said, "I want to."

326
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,700
And he goes, "If you put
that word on TV,

327
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:46,766
there could be a protest
of midgets on this building."

328
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,600
And I said, "Promise?"

329
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,866
How tempting would that be?

330
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,433
I don't mean to complain
about censorship at all though,

331
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,533
because as you probably
have seen by now,

332
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,366
you can basically say
whatever you want
on television.

333
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,766
It's ridiculous.

334
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,800
You can say anything you want.

335
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,000
And if you don't believe me,

336
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,633
You should watch
a little program called

337
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,933
<i>Law & Order:</i>
<i>Special Victims Unit.</i>

338
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,166
Yeah.

339
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,033
A show that I love.

340
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,333
Because on that show,
you can say the grossest things

341
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,800
you've ever heard
in your life.

342
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,366
No, you can't say like
the "F" word.

343
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,500
You can't say that
on <i>Special Victims Unit.</i>

344
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,700
But people walk around on <i>SVU</i>
going like,

345
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:26,700
"Looks like the victim had
anal contusions.

346
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:30,333
"Yo, looks like we found semen
and fecal matter

347
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,066
in the victim's ear canal."

348
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:35,233
Those are two real things
that I heard

349
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,666
On <i>Law & Order: SVU </i>
at 3:00 in the afternoon,

350
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:43,733
both spoken by Ice-T.

351
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,300
Ice-T is a detective
with the <i>Special Victims Unit.</i>

352
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:54,300
He handles New York's
most sensitive cases.

353
00:14:56,933 --> 00:15:00,066
I love Ice-T on <i>SVU. </i>
He is fantastic.

354
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:00,966
He's awesome.

355
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,500
What's so great about him

356
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:06,400
is that he's been with the <i>SVU</i>
for like, mm, 11 years now.

357
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,900
But he still treats every case
like it's his first

358
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:12,100
in terms of total confusion.

359
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:16,566
Sometimes they'll be in
the middle of an investigation

360
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,300
and Ice-T will be like,
"Yo, you telling me this dude

361
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:22,566
gets off on little girls
with pigtails?"

362
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,300
It's like, "Yeah, Ice.

363
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,800
He's a pedophile.

364
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,966
You work in the sex crimes
division.

365
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,666
You're gonna have to get
used to that."

366
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,266
You know how they try
and tie in, like,
current events

367
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,666
to every episode of <i>SVU?</i>

368
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,900
So there was this episode
I saw a while ago

369
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,200
that was about sex addiction.

370
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:49,500
'Cause a lot of celebrities
have come out as sex addicts.

371
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,066
So the episode's about
sex addiction.

372
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,700
There is a scene in the episode
where the other detectives

373
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:57,333
are trying to teach Ice-T
what sex addiction is,

374
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,666
and it takes a couple
of minutes.

375
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,800
And finally, Ice-T gets it.

376
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,033
And they cut to him
in this close-up

377
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,800
And he goes,
"Oh, I get it.

378
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,833
You mean like when someone
drinks too much...

379
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,466
Or snorts cocaine... Or bets
the house on the ponies?"

380
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
I was like,
"Yeah, you got it, man,"

381
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,066
and I was psyched
that Ice-T understood

382
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,600
so that they could continue
with the investigation.

383
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,300
But I could've watched
another four hours

384
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:29,766
of Ice-T just naming
examples.

385
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,933
Just that close-up
and Ice-T like,

386
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,433
"Or like when someone smokes
too many cigarettes?

387
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:40,966
Or like when someone shops
too much with credit cards?

388
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,700
Or like when someone plays
too many scratchy lotteries?

389
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,233
Or like when someone
eats too much chocolate cake?

390
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,833
Or like when eats too much
chocolate cake

391
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,466
And then barfs it up?"

392
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:57,700
And he would just keep talking
and it would slowly fade out

393
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,666
And say, "executive producer
Dick Wolf."

394
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:03,766
That'd be my ideal episode.
That'd be a good one.

395
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,866
I saw this <i>SVU</i> a little
while ago.

396
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,233
I saw this episode of <i>SVU,</i>

397
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,099
And Dean Cain was a rapist--
on the show.

398
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,366
And there was a scene
where they do a lineup

399
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,166
with Dean Cain
and four other guys.

400
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,766
And they bring in this woman
who's gonna look at the lineup

401
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,033
and it's her behind the glass
and they open the curtain

402
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,033
and she's standing with
the two other detectives.

403
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,633
And I knew she wasn't gonna
say this,

404
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,366
but part of me was hoping
she would just be like...

405
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,800
"Is that Dean Cain?

406
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
"Fucking Dean Cain?

407
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,133
That's pretty cool."

408
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,333
I also watch the show called
<i>Cold Case Files.</i>

409
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,866
On <i>Cold Case Files,</i>
they solve old murders

410
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:46,833
and it's really interesting.

411
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,333
'Cause what I learn from it
is that it was really easy

412
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,100
to get away with murder
before they knew about DNA.

413
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,833
It was ridiculously easy.

414
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,066
Like, what was even going on
back then?

415
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,866
What was a murder investigation
like in 1935?

416
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,333
One cop would just walk in
and be like, "Detective,

417
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,533
We found a pool of
that killer's
blood in that hallway."

418
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,100
And he would just be like,
"Hmm, gross.

419
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,500
Mop it up.

420
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:16,766
"Now then, back to my hunch.

421
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,266
Hmm...

422
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,133
Look for clues.

423
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,733
I'll tell you what we'll do.

424
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,400
We'll draw chalk
around where the body is.

425
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:29,233
That way,
we'll know where it was."

426
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,266
A couple years ago, I saw
this movie called
<i>Public Enemies</i>

427
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,300
with Johnny Depp.

428
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:35,900
It was about old bank robbers
and stuff.

429
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:38,200
Here's how easy it was
to get away with bank robbery

430
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,133
Back in the '30s.

431
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,433
As long as you
weren't still there

432
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,000
when the police arrived,

433
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,666
You had a 99% chance
of getting away with it.

434
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,933
To the point that, like,
those old bank robbers,

435
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,866
They take credit
for the bank robberies.

436
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,133
Like, they come
running out of there

437
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
and they're like,
"Ha, ha, ha!

438
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,833
"And if anyone asks,
you tell 'em it was Golden Joe

439
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,000
and the Suggins gang!"

440
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,666
And then they like
shoot "suggins"

441
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,533
into the side of the wall.

442
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,866
It's like, what?
Were bullets free back then?

443
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,700
And they don't even
disguise themselves.

444
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:07,200
They dress up
for the bank robbery.

445
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,633
They're rolling in there
in, like, big suits and hats

446
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,300
like they're going to Church
in Atlanta.

447
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,600
They make a day of it.

448
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,600
I don't know about that.

449
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,866
Oh, ho ho.

450
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,333
Oh, good, it has a mind
of its own.

451
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,266
That's very reassuring.

452
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,566
No, no, no, no.

453
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:36,266
I don't like robots...
Thinking of things.

454
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,566
Hope you don't mind
that I dressed up.

455
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:40,700
It was my first communion
today,

456
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,866
So I decided to come
right from it.

457
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,466
I was a very good
first communicant.

458
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,833
Thank you for coming
to this show by the way.

459
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,000
I really do appreciate
you coming to a thing,

460
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,566
because you didn't have to,
and it's really easy

461
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:57,300
not to go to things.

462
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:01,000
It is so much easier not
to do things than to do them,

463
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,800
that you would do anything
is totally remarkable.

464
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:08,666
Percentage-wise, it is
100% easier not to do things

465
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,000
than to do them.

466
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,433
And so much fun
not to do them!

467
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:15,033
Especially when you are
supposed to do them.

468
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,766
In terms of like
instant relief,

469
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,633
canceling plans
is like heroin.

470
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,666
It is an amazing feeling.

471
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,066
Such instant joy.

472
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,033
Kids don't like that.
Kids always wanna do stuff.

473
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
Kids get angry.

474
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,866
They go, "Aw, we didn't
do anything all day."

475
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,366
You ever ask an adult
what they did over the weekend

476
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:39,333
and they say they didn't do
anything, their faces light up.

477
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,700
Be like, "what'd you do
this weekend?"

478
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,733
"I, um... I did nothing.
I did nothing at all.

479
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,266
Did we do anything?
No, I didn't do anything."

480
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,400
People especially
don't wanna do their jobs.

481
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:51,266
I've found that out
recently too.

482
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,733
I have a friend named Megan.

483
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,133
She's an elementary
school teacher.

484
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,333
And I was out with her
one night

485
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,000
And she was drinking
like a monster.

486
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,500
And I said to her,
"Don't you have to do a shift

487
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:01,866
at school tomorrow?"

488
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:04,533
And she went, "Ahh, I'll just
show a video."

489
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,866
And I was like, "That's
why teachers show videos?"

490
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:14,100
She said this, she goes,
"Yeah, I don't wanna work!"

491
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,100
And I was like,
"You know,

492
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,200
the kids don't wanna
work either."

493
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,800
And she was like, "Good!"

494
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:25,733
I really do-- I was psyched
to do it in New York.

495
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,233
I'm really happy to live here,

496
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,466
and was glad that we could
do it in New York city.

497
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:33,500
And I'm not sure how
you all got here tonight,

498
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:35,333
but I did wanna say this.

499
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,600
I've never been killed
by hit men.

500
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,666
So I don't know what it's like
in the moments just before

501
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,566
you're killed by hit men.

502
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:45,200
But I bet it's not unlike
when you're on the subway

503
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:47,233
and you realize that
a mariachi band

504
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,733
is about to start playing.

505
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:53,166
Just that brief moment
where you're reading

506
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,133

00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:15,800
I was really excited
a lot of people showed up.

512
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,533
They told me that
it was a big theater

513
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,700

would come.

514
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:19,766
So, thank you for coming.

so I get in the <i>New York Post </i>
or something.

518
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:31,566
The <i>New York Post </i>
is my favorite newspaper.

519
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,166
I think it's great.
I read it every day.

520
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,700
I like reading
the <i>New York Post</i>

521
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:35,966
Because reading
the <i>New York Post</i>

522
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:38,533
is like talking to someone
who heard the news

523
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,766
and now they're trying
to give you the gist.

524
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,366
It's like you'd get the same
amount of information

525
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,600
if you grabbed someone
on the street,

526
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,233
and you were like,
"What happened today?"

527
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:51,966
They're like
"There's a perv in queens!"

528
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:53,566
You'd be like,
"All right, thank you."

529
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,766
Or rather, it's like someone
read a better newspaper

530
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,100
and now they're trying
to text you

531
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,533
everything
they can remember.

532
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:04,400
Doesn't have to be right.

533
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,933
Just has to be short.

534
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,666
I really do love the <i>Post.</i>

535
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,200
I read it a lot
and there's a hierarchy

536
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,466
in the <i>New York Post.</i>

537
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:15,400
Different people
that they like

538
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:17,333
and different people
that they don't like.

539
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,866
And if you pay attention,
you can start to identify

540
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,333
some of the <i>New York Post </i>
rankings that they have.

541
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:24,166
The number one thing
that you can be

542
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:26,100
in the eyes of
the <i>New York Post</i> is an angel.

543
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,266
An angel is a child
who has died.

544
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,900
That is the best thing
that you can be

545
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:31,500
in the eyes of
the <i>New York Post.</i>

546
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,933
The less amount of time
you live, the better...

547
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,366
In the eyes of the <i>Post.</i>

548
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:38,966
After that,
under an angel is a hero.

549
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:41,700
A hero is any man
who does his job.

550
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,866
You'll a lot of times
see headlines that are like,

551
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,666
"Hero tutor teaches
after school."

552
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:48,600
And you're like, "Yeah."

553
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Down towards the bottom
of the spectrum,

554
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:58,133
There are pervs.

555
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,366
Pervs touch tots.

556
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,733
Tots are angels
who haven't died yet.

557
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:09,400
There are no children in
the eyes of the <i>New York Post.</i>

558
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:14,266
You're either a tot or you're
dead and you're an angel.

559
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,966
I did leave one out.
Sorry.

560
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:18,733
Above perv is a bozo.

561
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,766
A bozo is any man
who cheats on his wife.

562
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,266
That guy's a bozo.

563
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,066
I remember seeing a headline

564
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,200
when Tiger Woods cheated
on his wife.

565
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:31,600
And it says, "Tiger says
he's sorry,

566
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:35,100
but Elin says
'Beat it, bozo.'"

567
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,933
No, she did not.

568
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,200
She is from another country.

569
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,800
And even if she was
from this country,

570
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:46,766
No one has said "bozo"
in 1,000 years.

571
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,666
Who was your source on that,
<i>New York Post?</i>

572
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:53,766
Some tiny old lady
that chain smokes all day long?

573
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,266
They met her
in a parking garage

574
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,366
and they were like,
"Madge, give us the scoop.

575
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:58,933
What did Elin say
to Tiger?"

576
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,333
"She told him
to 'Beat it, bozo.'"

577
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,633
I'm feeling good tonight,
though.

578
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,933
I got a massage recently.

579
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,766
Went to a spa
to get a massage.

580
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,766
I went into the room
to get the massage

581
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:15,233
And the woman there told me
to undress to my comfort level.

582
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,800
Those were her words.

583
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:17,933
She said,
"I'm gonna leave the room.

584
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,133
You undress
to your comfort level."

585
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,100
So I put on a sweater
and a pair of corduroy pants,

586
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,300
And I felt safe.

587
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:30,433
I'm trying to, in general,
take better care of myself.

588
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,966
I'm trying to stop smoking.

589
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,766
I've smoked since
I was 13 years old.

590
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,566
I started when
I was 13 years old

591
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:38,366
'cause I stole two cigarettes
from my older sister

592
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:41,100
and I hid them in a shoe box
under my bed

593
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,766
with a copy of
<i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine.

594
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,800
And one day, my mom cleaned
under my bed,

595
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,766
and she found the shoe box.

596
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,633
I came home from school
and my mom was standing there

597
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,500
holding it and she said,
"Hey, mister!

598
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:54,433
I found your treasure!"

599
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,566
And I never liked the way
she phrased that, you know.

600
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,433
'Cause that made me sound like
the world's lamest pirate.

601
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,600
Like, a guy
whose treasure chest
is two cigarettes

602
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,233
and a woman's magazine.

603
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:08,300
And my dad came home from work,
and my mom told my dad

604
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,800
that she had cleaned
under my bed

605
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:12,000
and found a shoe box
with two cigarettes

606
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:15,600
and a <i>Cosmopolitan,</i>
which prompted my dad to ask,

607
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:18,500
"How does John know
how to make a cosmopolitan?"

608
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:25,133
I'm trying to eat better.

609
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,166
I was out to lunch
with a friend
and I got a chicken sandwich.

610
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,433
And the waitress said to me,

611
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,733
"Oh, you're getting
a chicken sandwich.

612
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,733
Well, that comes with a choice
of either salad or fries."

613
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,633
Those were the choices--
salad or fries.

614
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,200
The two most different foods
in the universe.

615
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,466
That's like saying what kinda
day do you wanna have?

616
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,566
Do you wanna be active and go
to the bathroom and stuff?

617
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:45,800
Or do you wanna lay
on the floor moaning?

618
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,533
"Oh, you're getting
a chicken sandwich?

619
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,500
"Well, with that,
you can either go for a jog

620
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,666
or smoke crack cocaine."

621
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,166
"Oh, huh, well...

622
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,300
If I got a plate of crack
for the table,

623
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:56,633
Would you have some?

624
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,200
You'd have crack
if I got a plate of crack?

625
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:00,633
Yeah, okay. Yeah, we'll take
an order of crack."

626
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:03,566
Sometimes when people
order fries,

627
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:06,333
they act like
it's a little adventure.

628
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,266
They'll be like, "Should we get
a plate of fries for the table?

629
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,266
Should we do it?

630
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,066
Should we share some fries?"

631
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,000
They gotta make sure that
everyone's onboard with it.

632
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,666
It's like, "If I get fries,
you'll have a couple, right?

633
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,133
If I get fries for the table,
you'll have--

634
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,966
I know you'll have fries
if I get fries.

635
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,900
Should we do it?
Yeah, let's be bad.

636
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:21,200
Come on, let's do it.
All right.

637
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,200
We're gonna take a plate
of fries."

638
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,666
It's like a group of couples
agreeing to do
ecstasy together.

639
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,633
I have a girlfriend now myself

640
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,100
which is weird because I'm
probably gay based on the way

641
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,833
I act and behave, and...

642
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,733
I've walked
and talked for 28 years.

643
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,333
I think I was supposed
to be gay.

644
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,066
I think like in heaven
they built, like, 3/4
of a gay person

645
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,133
and then they forgot to flip
the final switch,

646
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,466
and they just sent me out
and it was like,

647
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:51,866
"You marked that one gay,
right?"

648
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:53,100
And it was like,
"Oh, no! Was I supposed to?"

649
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,466
And they were like,
"Oh, man.

650
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,300
This'll be a very
interesting person.

651
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,633
This'll be
a very silly person."

652
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,666
I was definitely gay
when I was a little boy.

653
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,966
A lot of little boys are gay.

654
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:11,500
You know, they're very flowy

655
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,266
and they have hard opinions
on things.

656
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,066
I don't mean that I was
a sexually active gay man

657
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:20,166
when I was a little boy,
that's not what I mean.

658
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,266
When I was a little boy,
I was more like a 67-year-old

659
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:26,233
gay man that's kinda over it,
sexually, you know.

660
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,633
I was just like
an old queen.

661
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,333
I would come out
of the recess yard and be like,

662
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,633
"Everyone get outta my way.

663
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:34,933
I just wanna sit here
and feed my birds."

664
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,700
The gym teacher would tell me
to play kickball

665
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:43,466
And I'd be like,
"You want me to do what?"

666
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,566
Real quick,
this happened pretty recently.

667
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:51,566
I was in a restaurant
near here in the west village,

668
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:54,100
and I was at the urinal
and an old gay man

669
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,500
came in the bathroom
with a walker like this.

670
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,833
And he said this to me.

671
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,233
He went, "I'm either having
a drink or I have to pee.

672
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,200
You're living the golden years,
kid, not me."

673
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:04,066
Like he spoke in rhymes.
It was crazy.

674
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:06,066
It was such a weird interaction
that I wasn't sure

675
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,966
If it actually happened.

676
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,633
I came out of the bathroom
and I asked my girlfriend.

677
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,100
I was like,
"Did you see like an old man

678
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,433
follow me in the bathroom?"

679
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,833
And she was like, "John,
that bathroom's been closed

680
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,166
for 40 years.

681
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:21,533
Whooooa! Whooooa!"

682
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:27,033
Where was I?
I'm not gay, but I might be.

683
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,533
And I have a girlfriend
and she's a female person.

684
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,400
It's going very well.
I love her very much.

685
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:34,966
And so a few months ago,
she was like,

686
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:38,366
"Okay, it's going well, so now
I should meet your parents."

687
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:40,300
Because that's what people do
when a relationship

688
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,733
is going well.

689
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,366
They meet each other's
parents.

690
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,233
And I've never
understood that.

691
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,500
I've never been
with my girlfriend

692
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,066
And thought like,
"Oh, honey,

693
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:50,066
tonight is going great.

694
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,300
But do you know what would
make it perfect?

695
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:55,866
Charles and Ellen Mulaney."

696
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,333
Come on!

697
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,566
Let's get them in the mix.

698
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,133
We've been going pretty
hot and heavy lately,

699
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:07,100
I think it's time we bring in
two older Catholic people.

700
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:15,166
My girlfriend's a female, and
then I had all these friends

701
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:16,500
That are female.

702
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,966
So when I started dating her,
I was like,

703
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,633
"Oh, great,
they'll all get along."

704
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:21,800
No.

705
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,933
Not even a little
at the beginning.

706
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,300
I don't wanna make
any generalizations about women

707
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:30,766
'cause I don't know shit
about women.

708
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,900
But this one thing
I've noticed

709
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,766
in my own personal experience
is that

710
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,900
I think women can be friends
with each other,

711
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:37,766
But I think it can be
tricky sometimes

712
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,266
when you try and force women
to hang out with each other.

713
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
I think that sometimes
doesn't work.

714
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:42,766
Like, I don't think--

715
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,100
Like, you could never
put together a heist of women.

716
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,133
Does that make sense?

717
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,000
Like <i>Ocean's Eleven</i> with women
wouldn't work.

718
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,100
'Cause two would keep
breaking off

719
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,866
to talk shit
about the other nine.

720
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,066
Or not even talk shit,

721
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:57,600
just say weird
passive-aggressive things

722
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,633
while they break
into the casino.

723
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,000
Just be like, "Oh, I love
how you just wear anything."

724
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,800
My girlfriend's wonderful,
though.

725
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:14,900
I listen to everything
my girlfriend says.

726
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:16,633
I don't mean
she bosses me around.

727
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,200
I just listen to everything
she says

728
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:20,200
because, before
I had a girlfriend,

729
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,866
I never had someone who's
always standing next to me

730
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:26,866
who can just point out obvious
things that are happening.

731
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,100
Like, we'll be
in a restaurant,

732
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,266
and my girlfriend
will be like,

733
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,000
"You ordered your food
an hour ago.

734
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:32,266
It should be here by now."

735
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,700
And I'm like,
"Yeah, it should!"

736
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:38,633
It's like having a lawyer
for everyday life.

737
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,100
She'll be like,
"the bus driver shouldn't talk

738
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,033
to you that way."

739
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,000
And I'm like,
"No, he shouldn't!"

740
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:46,700
Before I had a girlfriend,

741
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:48,900
I had no standard
for how I should be treated

742
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:50,400
as a human being.

743
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:52,000
You could do anything to me.

744
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,300
I was just like
a young motown singer.

745
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:57,566
I was just shiny and dumb
and easy to trick.

746
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,300
I was like, "Oh, man,
you gonna give me a whole $100

747
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:02,033
for all of my songs?

748
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,766
Where do I sign,
Mr. Berry Gordy?"

749
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:10,933
And now when I'm not
with my girlfriend,

750
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
you can still do
anything to me.

751
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:13,800
I will tolerate
any treatment.

752
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:16,066
Like, I travel alone
sometimes, you know.

753
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:18,033
And I'll put up
with anything.

754
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:20,600
Like, I'll book a ticket
on some garbage airline.

755
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,233
You know, I don't wanna name
an actual airline,

756
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,266
So let's just make one up.

757
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,500
Let's call it like
Delta airlines.

758
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:27,266
So I'll book a ticket
on Delta airlines.

759
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:29,000
And I'll show up
at the airport.

760
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:31,633
And I go, "Can I get
on the plane now, please?"

761
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:35,733
And they go,
"No, it's delayed nine hours."

762
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
[spits]

763
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:41,200
And I go, "Okay."
And then I go to the bathroom.

764
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,466
And then I come out
of the bathroom,

765
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,766
And I go, "Any updates?"
And they go, "Yeah.

766
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,333
We took off while you were
in the bathroom...

767
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,966
Because we hate you.

768
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,366
Now take this meal voucher
that doesn't work.

769
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:53,433
Go, fetch!"

770
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:56,066
And I go, "okay."

771
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,333
And I go over to
the Wolfgang puck express

772
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,166
And I go, "Can I have
a sandwich please?

773
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:02,466
And they go, "No!"

774
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,300
And I go, "Okay."

775
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,400
And they go, "You're
a little fat girl, aren't you?"

776
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:08,633
And I go, "No."
And they go, "Say it!"

777
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,533
And I go,
"I'm a little fat girl."

778
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,366
And then I go over
to the Delta help desk

779
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:14,966
which is an oxymoron
and I go,

780
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:17,833
"Can I please go home
on an airplane?"

781
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,433
And they go, "No.

782
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,966
In fact, we're gonna frame you
for murder.

783
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:26,300
And you're gonna go to jail
for 30 years."

784
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,300
And I go, "Why are you
doing this to me?"

785
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:32,100
And they go, [singsong]
"Because
we're delta airlines.

786
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:35,166
And life is a fucking
nightmare."

787
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,366
But with my girlfriend
she would just be like,

788
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,033
"Let's see if Southwest
has any flights."

789
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,966
So it's better.

790
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,366
My girlfriend
is a Jewish woman.

791
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,466
Which is--
I did on purpose.

792
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,633
Uh, that sounded creepy.

793
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:58,500
I don't mean like
"Ah, I got one!"

794
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:02,733
I mean like I--
Uh, I am not Jewish.

795
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,866
But I've always really liked
Jewish people.

796
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:06,166
I just like them a lot,

797
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:08,199
And I really like
dating Jewish women.

798
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,166
They're great.

799
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:10,466
Because, like, I think a lot
of problems

800
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:11,766
that people have
in relationships

801
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,866
are with communication

802
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:15,133
'cause guys don't know
what women are thinking.

803
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,300
And with Jewish women,

804
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:18,666
You do not have to guess
what they are thinking.

805
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,466
They will tell you.

806
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,633
Yeah, this is gonna get
playfully antisemitic,

807
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,666
so just allow it to go there.

808
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,466
Allow-- I'll get in trouble.
You won't.

809
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:33,133
I really do mean this,
though.

810
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,233
I really admire
that Jewish people,

811
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,666
in my own personal
experience,

812
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:40,166
Have-- are very, like, upfront
with their feelings.

813
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:42,199
You know, they're very vocal

814
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:43,900
about their thoughts
and feelings.

815
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:45,166
And I think that's
really admirable.

816
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,333
You know, I'm Irish.

817
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,633
And Irish people,
they don't tell you a thing.

818
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,466
Irish people keep it
so bottled up.

819
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,066
You know, like, the plan
with Irish people is like,

820
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:52,866
I'll keep all my emotions
right here.

821
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:55,033
And then one day, I'll die.

822
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,533
Like, in Ireland, it's like,
"Ah, your boy has died."

823
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,800
And it's like, "All right,
bury the boy.

824
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:02,700
"Do it, bury the boy.

825
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:05,266
Bury the boy."

826
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,033
Irish people
don't want comfort.

827
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,866
Look at a sweater
made in Ireland.

828
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:11,433
It's like a turtleneck
made out of brillo pads.

829
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,233
I used to date
gentile women and-- they--

830
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,166
I dated this girl.

831
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:22,766
She'd just stare
out the window all day long.

832
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,700
And I'd be like,
"What's wrong?"

833
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,433
She'd be like, "You wouldn't
even understand if I told you."

834
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,666
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with that?

835
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,433
My Jewish girlfriend, I don't
have to guess what's wrong.

836
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,833
She comes in the room and
she's like, "My stomach hurts!"

837
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:39,766
And then we can
move on from there.

838
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:41,733
That's what I mean.
She's very focused.

839
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,933
She's very in the moment,
you know.

840
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,100
And that's a good thing
in a significant other.

841
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,033
She's very present.

842
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,733
Jews don't daydream,
'cause folks are after 'em

843
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,366
and they gotta stay sharp,
you know what I mean?

844
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:50,700
They have to be there.

845
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,766
They haven't let their minds
wander since Egypt.

846
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,400
They just stay sharp.

847
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,200
They go, "Who's that?
Who are you?

848
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,200
What's that?
Put that down.

849
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,966
What's that over there?
Don't do that."

850
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,233
I'm Irish.

851
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,000
I keep things very bottled up,
and I don't drink.

852
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,100
Which is not what
you're supposed to do

853
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,566
When you're Irish.

854
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,333
I don't drink.

855
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:16,866
I used to drink
and then I drank too much

856
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:18,200
And I had to stop.

857
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:20,266
That surprises a lot
of audiences

858
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:23,033
Because I don't look like
someone who used to
do anything.

859
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:26,466
I look like I was just sitting
in a room in a chair

860
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,733
eating saltines
for like 28 years

861
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,766
and then I walked
right out here.

862
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,233
But I did.

863
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,900
I used to drink a lot
and then I stopped.

864
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:38,466
I don't know if anyone
here is thinking
about quitting drinking

865
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:40,100
But you need to know two things
if you're thinking about

866
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,000
quitting drinking.

867
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,733
The first is that
when you stop drinking,

868
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,166
and you still go to parties
where people are drinking,

869
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:48,133
They will have no idea
what to offer you.

870
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,666
Once people start
drinking for the night,

871
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:53,733
they forget everything
that isn't alcohol.

872
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,266
Like, I'll show up at a party,
and they'll be like,

873
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,966
"Hey, everybody.
All right.

874
00:36:57,033 --> 00:37:00,200
We got coronas in the fridge,
and oh, hey, Mulaney.

875
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:01,966
Would you like,
like, an old turnip

876
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,466
that we found in a cabinet?

877
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:07,333
Would that be good for you?
Would you like that?

878
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,100
I know you don't drink.

879
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:12,200
Or my girlfriend left
a nuva ring in the fridge.

880
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:16,100
Would you want that?
Would that be good for you?

881
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,233
I know you don't drink."

882
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:23,233
Also, if you quit drinking,

883
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,566
You're about to lose
the best excuse

884
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:25,966
You've ever had
in your life,

885
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,266
Which is, "I'm really sorry
about last night.

886
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,966
I was just so drunk."

887
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,666
that is a get out
of jail free card

888
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:33,200
That you don't even
realize you have

889
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:34,266
until you lose it.

890
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,600
I can't say that anymore.

891
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:37,533
I can never be like,
"I'm really sorry
about last night.

892
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,700
I was just so drunk."

893
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:39,766
Now I have to be like,

894
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,533
"I'm really sorry
about last night.

895
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,400
"It's just that
I'm mean and loud.

896
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,233
It probably
will happen again."

897
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:52,266
Now I, myself--
I quit drinking

898
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,933
'cause I used to drink
too much

899
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,100
and then I would black out
and I would "ruin" parties.

900
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:02,700
Or so I'm told.

901
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:04,633
When you do that enough--

902
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,566
When you black out drinking
and you do crazy things,

903
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:08,966
You kinda become
like Michael Jackson.

904
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:12,400
Like, any story anyone says
about you might be true,

905
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,866
and even you don't know
by the end.

906
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,066
I saw an interview with
Michael Jackson before he died

907
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:17,966
and they were like,

908
00:38:18,033 --> 00:38:19,833
"Is it true you bought
the elephant man's bones?"

909
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,233
And he was like,
"I don't know."

910
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,133
You know, 'cause how could
he keep track of that?

911
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:26,600
So I would hear stories
about myself.

912
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,200
Here's a story
I once heard about me.

913
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:33,100
I guess I was 20 and I was
at a party at someone's house

914
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,733
and I had blacked out
drinking,

915
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,500
and someone came out of one
of the rooms at this party

916
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,600
Holding like
an old antique bottle

917
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:41,166
with some liquid in it,
and they said,

918
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:44,166
"Hey, is this whiskey
or perfume?"

919
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,800
And apparently I grabbed it,
drank all of it,

920
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:50,033
And said, "It's perfume."

921
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:54,666
And it was.

922
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,800
Another story
I heard about myself--

923
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:01,566
This one happened
in high school.

924
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,633
We had this teacher
in high school

925
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,266
whose kid went
to our high school.

926
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,633
His name was Mr. McNamara
and his son Jake McNamara

927
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,733
Went to our high school.

928
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
He was a sophomore
when I was a senior.

929
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,300
So he was two years
behind me.

930
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:16,500
And Mr. McNamara
was an asshole.

931
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,433
And one weekend,
he and his wife

932
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,966
decided to leave town,

933
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,766
which you should never do
if you're an asshole.

934
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,733
And Jake McNamara
decided to throw a party

935
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,466
at the teacher's house.
Hooray!

936
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,766
And everyone around town
heard about it

937
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,866
and we all got up individually
and thought,

938
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:39,566
"Okay, let's go over there
and destroy the place."

939
00:39:39,866 --> 00:39:41,366
I walked into this party.

940
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:43,666
Everyone I had ever met
was there.

941
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:47,366
And everyone was drinking like
it was the end of the world.

942
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:49,700
People were drinking like
it was the civil war

943
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:52,600
and a doctor was coming
to saw our legs off.

944
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,400
It was totally unsupervised.

945
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:56,100
We were like dogs
without horses.

946
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,766
We were running wild.

947
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,500
I walked down--

948
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,733
I walked down to the basement.

949
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,933
They had a pool table
in the basement.

950
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,666
One dude took a running start

951
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,900
and threw his body onto
the pool table

952
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:10,433
and broke it in half.

953
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:14,933
Another kid found out
which room was Mr. McNamara's

954
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,133
And went upstairs
and took a shit
on his computer.

955
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,300
So the party was going great.

956
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:27,233
I'm standing in the basement,

957
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,433
and I'm holding a red cup
you see in movies.

958
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:32,333
And I'm standing there
and I'm holding a red cup

959
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,166
and I'm starting to black out
and I guess someone said like

960
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,533
"Something something police."

961
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,066
And in a brilliant moment
of word association,

962
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,333
I yelled "fuck da police!

963
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,333
Fuck da police!"

964
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,433
And everyone else joined in.

965
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,733
A hundred drunk white children

966
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,300
Yelling
"fuck...Da...Po-lice"

967
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,633
With the confidence of guys
who have already been to jail

968
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,533
and aren't afraid of it
anymore.

969
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,933
You know that like
"I served my nickel!

970
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,066
You come and take me"
confidence.

971
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,100
But white children.

972
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,166
The reason someone had said,
"Something something police"

973
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,166
was because the police
were there.

974
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:22,366
So a Chicago police officer
walked down the stairs

975
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:24,233
and got to the bottom
in the basement

976
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,700
And looked out over a sea
of drunk toddlers

977
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:32,733
Yelling, "Fuck the police"
in his face.

978
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,933
And he was almost impressed.

979
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:38,933
He was like
[whispering] "Wow."

980
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,166
And then he leaned
into his walkie-talkie

981
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,833
And went,
"Get the paddy wagon."

982
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
And my friend John,
who is now a father--

983
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:47,233
This man now has a baby--

984
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,066
He grabbed a 40,
smashed it on the ground,

985
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,733
And yelled "Scatter!"

986
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,733
And everyone ran
in a different direction.

987
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,466
We all ran in different
directions.

988
00:41:57,533 --> 00:41:58,900
It was like that scene
in <i>Ratatouille</i>

989
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:00,100
when the humans come
in the kitchen

990
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,566
and all the rats
go in different ways.

991
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:02,733
We all ran in different
directions.

992
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,900
I ran into the laundry room

993
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,233
and I jumped up
on the washing machine

994
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,200
and I crawled out through
a window into the backyard

995
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:08,600
and now I'm running
through the backyard

996
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:09,900
and there was this
big chain link fence

997
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:12,400
and I thought
I've never climbed
a fence that high before.

998
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:14,200
And then I woke up at home.

999
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:21,666
On Monday, I went to school.

1000
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:24,266
Because that's what we did
back then.

1001
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,300
And I'm walking
into the school building

1002
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:28,566
and who do I see
but Jake McNamara.

1003
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:29,533
And he says to me

1004
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
"Hey, were you at my party
on Saturday?"

1005
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:34,866
And I said "No."
You know, like a liar.

1006
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,066
And he said,
"Things got really outta hand.

1007
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:43,300
Someone broke the pool table.

1008
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:46,566
Someone took a shit
on my dad's computer.

1009
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:47,966
But the worst thing"
he says--

1010
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,133
"The worst thing is that
someone stole these old

1011
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,300
antique photos
of my grandmother

1012
00:42:52,366 --> 00:42:54,933
and my parents are
freaking out about it."

1013
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,533
And I had that thought

1014
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,933
that only blackout drunks
and Steve Urkel can have.

1015
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,900
Did I do that?

1016
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:16,200
I figured no,
I wouldn't have done that.

1017
00:43:16,266 --> 00:43:20,300
But I was never sure,
until two years later--

1018
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,233
Relax.

1019
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:25,266
I'm playing video games
with this kid named Alex

1020
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,533
that we also went
to high school with.

1021
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,133
Two years later,
we've graduated by now.

1022
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,133
We're playing video games
for a couple hours,

1023
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,466
And then Alex says to me,
"Hey, come here.

1024
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:34,133
I wanna show you something."

1025
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:36,133
And he takes me
into his bedroom

1026
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,233
and then he takes me
into a side room

1027
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,033
off of his bedroom.

1028
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,433
Never a good thing
to have.

1029
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:48,800
He shows me a tiny room
that is covered wall-to-wall

1030
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:53,066
in stolen antique photos
from different people's parties

1031
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,800
over the years.

1032
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:02,033
And I said, "Why?

1033
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:06,933
Why do you do this?"

1034
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,366
And Alex said,

1035
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:15,800
"Because it's the one thing
you can't replace."

1036
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:22,400
That's the end of that story,

1037
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:23,466
but how fucked-up is that,
right?

1038
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:24,566
That's crazy.

1039
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:26,766
So I don't drink anymore.

1040
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,066
And it's weird, you know.

1041
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,000
I miss it sometimes

1042
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:31,700
'cause drinking can kind of
calm your nerves.

1043
00:44:32,466 --> 00:44:33,666
And I live in New York now.

1044
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:35,533
And sometimes you see things
that can make you anxious.

1045
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,766
You'll see troubling things
out on the street.

1046
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:39,966
I was coming into my apartment
building one night

1047
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:41,833
and I saw in front
of my building

1048
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,733
a wheelchair knocked over
on its side with no one in it.

1049
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:51,833
That's a bad thing to see.

1050
00:44:51,966 --> 00:44:56,833
Something happened there.
You hope it was a miracle.

1051
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,633
But probably not.

1052
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,533
Probably something worse.

1053
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:08,900
I don't like arguments.
Some people like to argue.

1054
00:45:08,966 --> 00:45:10,833
They think it's like an art.
I don't like it.

1055
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,166
I think it's because
really ordinary arguments

1056
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:15,066
can get really dramatic
really quickly.

1057
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:16,800
I was talking to friend
recently,

1058
00:45:16,866 --> 00:45:18,600
and I told him that
I didn't think

1059
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,233
I believed
in the death penalty.

1060
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,633
And my friend said to me,
"Oh, so you're telling me

1061
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:27,633
that if you saw Hitler
walking down the street,

1062
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,766
you wouldn't kill him?"

1063
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:32,666
I said "That wasn't what
I was telling you.

1064
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,600
"But all right.
Let's talk about this...

1065
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,333
Entirely new topic.

1066
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:50,400
What would I do if I saw
Adolf Hitler just...

1067
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:53,100
just walking down the street?"

1068
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,800
Well, first off,
I wanted to know
what did my friend mean?

1069
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:59,100
Did he mean that I see a guy
in like the military outfit

1070
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:00,500
With the little mustache?

1071
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:01,833
'Cause then I would assume that

1072
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,866
That's someone dressed
as Hitler.

1073
00:46:04,066 --> 00:46:05,600
I'm not gonna kill that guy.

1074
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,466
I'm not gonna kill an actor
and ruin <i>Indiana Jones V</i>

1075
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:14,766
Just 'cause I don't
understand costumes.

1076
00:46:16,766 --> 00:46:18,766
Or does he mean
that I'm walking
down the street

1077
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:23,433
and I see like an old, old man
who I think might be Hitler

1078
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,600
based on my memory of
what Hitler looks like?

1079
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:32,633
I'm not gonna kill that guy
either because
I am often wrong.

1080
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,833
I'd murder him and then people
would run up and be like,

1081
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,700
"Whoa! You just killed
an old, old, man!"

1082
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,133
And then I'd be like,
"He looked like Hitler!"

1083
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,900
And they're like
"Yeah, a little."

1084
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,133
I have a lot of strange
interactions on the street.

1085
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,633
Years ago, I was walking
down the street

1086
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,033
And a homeless guy
came up to me

1087
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:57,166
and he walked up to me
and he pushed me like that.

1088
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:58,533
He pushed me in the chest.

1089
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,066
And then he said
these things in this order.

1090
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,633
Pushed me and he said,
"Excuse me, I am homeless.

1091
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,600
I am gay.
I have aids.

1092
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,900
I'm new in town."

1093
00:47:18,633 --> 00:47:22,366
You're gonna close with
"New in town"?

1094
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:27,100
That is not the most dramatic
thing that you just said.

1095
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,500
As they say in the movie
<i>Jerry Maguire,</i>

1096
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:31,533
"You had me at aids."

1097
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:36,266
Here's how I would've
ordered those things.

1098
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,933
I would've said,
"Excuse me.

1099
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,566
I'm new in town
and it gets worse."

1100
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:47,800
Didn't that guy practice
his pitch at all

1101
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,866
in the mirror that morning

1102
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,333
and just figure out
what he was gonna say?

1103
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,000
Just like in the morning
just be like,

1104
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:54,333
"All right,
what am I gonna do today?

1105
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,333
"What I'm gonna do?

1106
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,233
I'll walk up and say hello.
No, that's too subtle.

1107
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,700
I'm gonna push him."

1108
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:02,466
I'm gonna push him.

1109
00:48:03,466 --> 00:48:05,300
And I'm gonna say,
'I'm new in town.'

1110
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:07,933
No, no, hold back.
Hold back.

1111
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,166
Save it.
Build to that."

1112
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:14,633
I'll be like,
I'll walk up to him,

1113
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,866
I'll push him.

1114
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:17,833
I'll go, "I have aids."

1115
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,033
No, that's too strong.

1116
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,733
All right.

1117
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:28,033
I'll walk up to him
and-- and I'll push him.

1118
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,766
I will start with the fact
that I am homeless,

1119
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:32,366
as that is a given.

1120
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,566
Then, for a back story,

1121
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:42,333
I will pepper in the fact
that I am gay.

1122
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:45,066
Which I know, it's tough
for gay youths on the street,

1123
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:46,366
but that's not, like,
a reason for money.

1124
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:47,833
You can't be like,
"Hey, would you help me out?

1125
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,466
I'm very gay.
I'd like a few dollars."

1126
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:54,233
I always love how
he phrased it, by the way.

1127
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,633
He didn't say,
"I'm living on the street."

1128
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,833
He said, "I'm new in town,"

1129
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,733
Like it was intriguing.

1130
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,066
Like he wanted me to
set him up with somebody.

1131
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:04,266
Like I have a friend
who's like,

1132
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,400
"There's no single guys
left in Manhattan."

1133
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,266
And I'm like, "I know someone
who's new in town."

1134
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,833
"What are three other things
about him?"

1135
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,700
Just too anxious
for a lot of things.

1136
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:24,066
I get very nervous
all the time,

1137
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,533
Not even about, like,
major life things.

1138
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,733
Just, like, about in
everyday situations.

1139
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,866
Like, this is my regular
speaking voice,

1140
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:32,566
but if I'm in
a public bathroom

1141
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:35,400
and someone knocks too suddenly
on the stall door,

1142
00:49:35,466 --> 00:49:37,700
I go into a whole different
speaking voice,

1143
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,133
which is,
"Someone's in here.

1144
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,866
Someone's in here,"
so they're gonna be like,

1145
00:49:43,933 --> 00:49:46,266
"I think there's a carnival
barker in there.

1146
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:48,866
"I think someone's
trying to drum up business

1147
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:50,300
for a carnival."

1148
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,300
I decided to do something
about all this anxiety.

1149
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:57,266
recently I decided
I was gonna try and get

1150
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,733
a xanax prescription.

1151
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,766
I don't know if anyone here
has ever tried xanax,

1152
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:03,066
But it's fantastic.

1153
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,700
Very muted claps
for xanax.

1154
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,900
You don't really
get "whoos."

1155
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:11,400
It's more like,
"yeeeeeaaaaah."

1156
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,633
I didn't know how to get
a xanax prescription, though.

1157
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,966
Drugs like that
are tricky sometimes.

1158
00:50:18,033 --> 00:50:19,333
But I talked to a friend
of mine, and he said,

1159
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,533
"Hey, I did this."

1160
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,200
He said that he had a regular
doctor's appointment,

1161
00:50:23,466 --> 00:50:25,466
and at the end of it,
he said to his doctor,

1162
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:29,400
"Hey, doctor, sometimes
I get nervous on airplanes,"

1163
00:50:29,466 --> 00:50:32,266
and the doctor just wrote him
a xanax prescription.

1164
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,133
And I was like, "Yeah, that's
the type of lowbrow shit

1165
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,800
I'm looking for.

1166
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,400
I'll take your advice, friend
I've never listened to before."

1167
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,200
So I go to a clinic
and I go in,

1168
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:44,800
and I'm just gonna go in for,
you know,

1169
00:50:44,866 --> 00:50:46,100
a regular type of checkup,

1170
00:50:46,166 --> 00:50:48,066
and at the end,
I'll ask about xanax.

1171
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,533
So I get to the front desk,

1172
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,400
and they have a
"Why are you here?" Sheet.

1173
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:52,366
And I want to pick something

1174
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:54,133
that will get me in and out
really quickly.

1175
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,200
And I look down and I see
"frequent urination,"

1176
00:50:57,366 --> 00:50:59,100
And I was like, perfect.

1177
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:01,533
That'll be a super quick
visit, you know?

1178
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,833
I'll just be like, "Hey,
sometimes I pee a lot,"

1179
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,400
and the doctor will be
like, "Me too. Crazy, right?"

1180
00:51:07,866 --> 00:51:11,200
And I'll be like, "I get
nervous on airplanes."

1181
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,333
So I checked off
"Frequent urination,"

1182
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,066
and I sat down
in the waiting area,

1183
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:16,866
and I waited
for three hours.

1184
00:51:16,933 --> 00:51:19,266
I finally go back to
the observation room,

1185
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:20,900
And--oh,
in the observation room,

1186
00:51:20,966 --> 00:51:22,833
there is a male nurse
standing there,

1187
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,533
and he has a batman sticker
on his stethoscope,

1188
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,366
a batman necklace,
and a batman watch.

1189
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,866
He was kind of moving around
the whole time.

1190
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:32,566
You know, he was just like,
"All right.

1191
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:35,300
I am too blessed
to be stressed. Let's do it.

1192
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,900
What are you allergic to,
besides work?"

1193
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:39,133
And then
he'd take something

1194
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,400
and he'd throw it
over his shoulder

1195
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:41,566
and be like,
"Beats workin'."

1196
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:43,433
Like, all of his jokes
were very anti-work,

1197
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,466
Which is not always
what you want

1198
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:46,033
from a healthcare
professional.

1199
00:51:47,466 --> 00:51:48,800
The doctor
comes in the room,

1200
00:51:48,866 --> 00:51:50,166
And the doctor
looks at my chart,

1201
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:52,766
and he says, "oh, you're here
for frequent urination.

1202
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,733
How many times a day
are you urinating?"

1203
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,100
And I tried to think
of a number

1204
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:00,366
that would warrant
a doctor visit,

1205
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:02,666
so I said 11,

1206
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:06,466
And that was
too many times to say.

1207
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,566
The doctor looks at me
and he says,

1208
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:10,600
"You're peeing 11 times
a day?

1209
00:52:11,033 --> 00:52:13,633
"Then you may have something
wrong with your prostate,

1210
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,733
so what we need to do--"

1211
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,733
[audience laughter]

1212
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,366
Some of you are ahead of me.

1213
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:22,066
[laughter]

1214
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:25,133
So I don't know exactly
how he phrased it,

1215
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,100
but the gist of it was, "Hey,
if this visit is to continue,

1216
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:33,966
I'm going to stick part
of my hand up your ass."

1217
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,100
And I didn't know
what to say,

1218
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,566
'cause I couldn't be like,
"No, that's okay.

1219
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:42,533
I was lying.

1220
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,966
It was a lie.

1221
00:52:46,033 --> 00:52:48,400
To get drugs.

1222
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:50,400
You know, like a crime."

1223
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:57,866
So what I did was,
I pulled down my pants

1224
00:52:57,933 --> 00:53:00,333
and I walked over
to the observation table,

1225
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,733
and I put my hands down on the
observation table like this--

1226
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,233
And by the way, part of me
was like, whatever, you know?

1227
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:10,000
You know those days
when you're like,

1228
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:12,033
"This might as well happen"?

1229
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,966
Adult life is already
so goddamn weird.

1230
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,700
So I'm bent over like this
on the table,

1231
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,800
and the doctor
comes up behind me.

1232
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:24,866
He goes, "No, no, no,

1233
00:53:24,933 --> 00:53:26,066
not on your hands.
On your elbows,"

1234
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,733
and he knocks me down
like that.

1235
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,333
And this is so much worse
than this.

1236
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,433
I don't know why.

1237
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,866
I think it's that this has,
like,

1238
00:53:33,933 --> 00:53:36,366
a little remaining dignity
to it, you know what I mean?

1239
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:38,166
This is sort of like,
"Oh, stick it in.

1240
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:39,533
I am an American."

1241
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,633
This is like you're leaning
over the edge of a cruise ship

1242
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,566
and you're like, "Ah,
we are approaching Martinique."

1243
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,400
But he knocked me down
to my elbows,

1244
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:56,833
and then he stuck his hand in

1245
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,600
and, you know how sometimes
you're like,

1246
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:02,733
"I bet I know what most things
feel like," you know?

1247
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,266
You just think you'll know.

1248
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,500
I did not know what this
was gonna feel like.

1249
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,266
And this was
the actual sound I made.

1250
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,633
I went, "Ohhhhhh."

1251
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:20,033
But I didn't say it.

1252
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:22,833
Like, it came from
my vocal cords,

1253
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,000
but it was totally
involuntary.

1254
00:54:25,433 --> 00:54:28,466
It was as if a ghost had been
trapped in my belly

1255
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:31,133
and finally flew out
towards the light.

1256
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:36,400
And then...

1257
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:41,800
When he pulled
his hand out--

1258
00:54:42,633 --> 00:54:45,200
We've gotten to know
each other pretty well,

1259
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,866
So I will phrase this
as delicately as I can.

1260
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:55,066
I did not realize that when
the doctor pulls his hand out,

1261
00:54:55,133 --> 00:54:59,100
it feels like you're shitting,
because the only thing

1262
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:03,266
that's ever come out of
your butt before has been shit.

1263
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:09,533
So, he pulls his hand out
and I thought

1264
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:13,066
that I was shitting
into his hand,

1265
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,566
So I yelled, "I'm sorry!"

1266
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:26,966
This is a very routine
procedure, by the way,

1267
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,066
for most doctors,

1268
00:55:28,133 --> 00:55:31,200
and so far, he's had to
deal with "Ohhhhhh!"

1269
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:33,866
And "I'm sorry!"

1270
00:55:37,866 --> 00:55:40,200
And he didn't even let me
off the hook, you know?

1271
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:41,733
He wasn't like,
"Ah, don't worry.

1272
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,300
You didn't shit
into my hand."

1273
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:46,133
He just threw his glove away
and was like, "Ahgahah."

1274
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,133
And I was about to ask
about xanax,

1275
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,966
But then he said, "All right,
your prostate's fine,

1276
00:55:50,033 --> 00:55:51,666
but we still need to do
a blood test."

1277
00:55:52,066 --> 00:55:54,400
So I pulled up my pants
and shuffled away,

1278
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:56,266
feeling different.

1279
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,233
And he yells out
into the hall,

1280
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,800
He goes, "Hey, we're doing
a blood test. Get in here."

1281
00:55:59,866 --> 00:56:02,133
And batman dances back in,
and he's like,

1282
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,400
"All right. We're gonna
do a blood test.

1283
00:56:04,466 --> 00:56:06,733
You look different.
Let's do it."

1284
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,133
The doctor left the room,
so I'm alone with batman.

1285
00:56:13,366 --> 00:56:15,866
I just need this blood test
to be over, okay?

1286
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:17,400
But first I had to tell batman
something.

1287
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:19,466
I said, "Batman, look,
I'm one of those people

1288
00:56:19,533 --> 00:56:20,633
who when you take blood
from me,

1289
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,966
sometimes I can faint,

1290
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:24,633
and I was in the waiting area
for three hours,

1291
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,200
and I haven't eaten
all day,

1292
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:28,700
and I'm really worried
I'm gonna faint."

1293
00:56:28,766 --> 00:56:31,700
And batman said to me,
and I'll never forget it,

1294
00:56:31,766 --> 00:56:33,733
"Pssh!
You're not gonna faint."

1295
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,633
So... I stick my arm out,

1296
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,033
Batman puts the needle in,

1297
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,466
I immediately collapse
on the ground.

1298
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,733
I wake up
and I am covered in sweat,

1299
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,500
lying on
the observation table.

1300
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:49,166
I wake up, I open my eyes,
and I see batman's face.

1301
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:51,800
He's looking at me and he goes,
"You gotta go."

1302
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:56,500
And I said,
"Could I please talk
to the doctor, though, first?

1303
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:03,733
Because sometimes I get
nervous on airplanes."

1304
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,333
And batman said,
"The doctor's gone."

1305
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:15,633
So I got my stuff
and I left.

1306
00:57:19,466 --> 00:57:22,233
The moral of the story is,

1307
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,900
that if you've been nervous
your entire life,

1308
00:57:24,966 --> 00:57:27,633
you should ask your doctor
about xanax,

1309
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,633
because if you lie to him,

1310
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,300
he will stick his finger
in your ass.

1311
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,900
And if you do suffer
from frequent urination,

1312
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:38,500
Keep it to yourself.

1313
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:41,833
I went to that clinic
two years later

1314
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,466
for a different checkup,
and as I was leaving,

1315
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:46,666
who did I run into
but batman.

1316
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:48,700
And he smiled at me,

1317
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:51,300
And he was wearing
reading glasses

1318
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:53,400
to show that time
had passed.

1319
00:57:53,733 --> 00:57:55,333
