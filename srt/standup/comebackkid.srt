[instrumental music playing]

00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,447
[sighs]

3
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,535
-All right, Petunia.
-[dog panting]

4
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,245
Wish me luck out there.

5
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,041
[Petunia in French]
You will die on August 7th, 2037.

6
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,337
That's pretty good.

7
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,922
[growls softly]

8
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,716
All right.

9
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,929
[door closes]

10
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,275
[audience applauding and cheering]

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,042
Hello.

12
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,842
Hello, Chicago.

13
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,971
Nice to see you again.

14
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,934
Thank you. That was very nice.
Thank you.

15
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,811
Look, now, you're a wonderful crowd,

16
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,939
but I need you to keep your energy up
the entire show, okay?

17
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,817
Because--
No, no, no. Thank you.

18
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,363
Some crowds... some crowds,
they have big energy in the beginning

19
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,281
and then they run out of places to go.

20
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,825
So... I don't judge those crowds,
by the way, okay?

21
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:24,203
We've all gone too big too fast
and then run out of room.

22
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,081
-We've all made a "Happy Birthday" sign...
-[crowd chuckles]

23
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,583
Wait.

24
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,794
You get that poster board up,
and you're like,

25
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,256
"I don't need to trace it.

26
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,091
I know how big letters should be.

27
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:41,178
To begin with, a big-ass 'H'.
[laughs]

28
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,806
Followed by a big-ass 'A' and--

29
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,226
Oh, no!
Oh, God!

30
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:51,523
Okay, all right.
Real skinny 'P' with a high hump,

31
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,235
and then we'll put the second 'P'
below the hump of that first 'P',

32
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,946
sort of like
a motorcycle sidecar situation.

33
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,160
And now I have no room for the 'Y',
so I'll do a kind of curled-up noodle 'Y'.

34
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,830
Block letters and cursive
look good together."

35
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,832
And then you go to write "Birthday"

36
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,961
and you totally forget the lesson
you just learned with "Happy."

37
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,548
You're like,
"Yeah, but the past is the past.

38
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,259
Big-ass 'B'.

39
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,470
Surely more letters will fit
in the same space."

40
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,683
You're very friendly here in Chicago.

41
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,352
I mean, we're all violent here,
but you're very friendly.

42
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,396
No, really.
And I don't like confrontation,

43
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,356
'cause I've never been in a fight before.

44
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,860
Though, maybe you could tell that from
the first moment I walked out on stage.

45
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,779
I don't give off that vibe.
[chuckles]

46
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,532
Some people give off a vibe of...
Right away, they're like,

47
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,576
"Do not fuck with me."

48
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,702
My vibe is more like,

49
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:50,623
"Hey, you could pour soup in my lap
and I'll probably apologize to you."

50
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,708
[audience laughing]

51
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,503
When I walk, for real,
my feet go out like this.

52
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,005
I'm so open and vulnerable.

53
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,217
I look like a doll
that you point out molestation on.

54
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,635
[audience laughing]

55
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,722
"Show us on this white comedian
where the man touched you."

56
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,101
It's been a while since
I've been home to Chicago.

57
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,186
-I got married since then.
-[audience cheering]

58
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,771
Thank you.

59
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,150
I married my wife.

60
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,904
I love saying "my wife."
It sounds so adult.

61
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,156
"That's my wife." [laughs]

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,618
It's great, you sound like a person.

63
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,536
I said it even before we were married.

64
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,872
We were just dating,
and we were once getting on an airplane,

65
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,625
and Anna's ticket didn't say anything
and my ticket said "priority access."

66
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,751
It doesn't matter why.

67
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:39,130
But we were getting on and I said,
"Uh, can my wife board with me?"

68
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,673
And they were like,
"Yes, of course. Right this way."

69
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,843
And I was like, "Oh, that is so much
better than all those times I was like,

70
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,596
'Can my girlfriend come?'"

71
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,683
And, yeah, I shouldn't have
said it that way, but still.

72
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,352
"My wife" just has some
kick-ass to it, you know?

73
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,565
"Get away from my wife!
No one talk to my wife!"

74
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,942
Marriage is gonna be very magical.

75
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,819
"I didn't kill my wife!"

76
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,532
That's like, "Ooh, who's that fella?

77
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,950
I bet he did kill his wife."

78
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,162
Being married is so nice.

79
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,916
I never knew relationships were supposed
to make you feel better about yourself.

80
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,125
That's not really a joke,

81
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,878
that's just a little sweet thing
I like to say.

82
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,006
'Cause I'd been in relationships
where I got cheated on, like, long ones.

83
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,174
I don't know if you've ever been in

84
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,510
a long relationship
where you got cheated on,

85
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,386
but it changes your whole worldview.

86
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,347
'Cause when I was a kid,
I used to watch <i>America's Most Wanted.</i>

87
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,559
-You know how kids do.
-[audience laughing]

88
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,771
And I would always think to myself,
"How could another person kill someone?

89
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,857
How could a human being
kill another human being?"

90
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,445
And then I got cheated on,
and I was like, "Oh, okay."

91
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,655
[audience laughing]

92
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,533
"I'm not gonna do it,
but I totally get it."

93
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,703
And I don't mean in that way of, like,
"No one else can have you."

94
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,829
I don't care about that.

95
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,207
It's just creepy to have an ex out there
after things have ended badly.

96
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,375
They have a lot of information.

97
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,546
Anyone who's seen my dick
and met my parents needs to die.

98
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,297
I can't have them roaming around.

99
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,096
I talked to a lot of people
before I got engaged, you know.

100
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,682
And I heard this expression about
whether or not you should get married.

101
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,559
This is an old expression.
People say this.

102
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:19,564
They say, "Why buy the cow
when you can get the milk for free?"

103
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,065
You ever heard that before?

104
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,776
It's a bananas insulting expression...

105
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,072
to an entire gender.

106
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:31,451
But also, it makes no sense.

107
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,579
"Why buy the cow
when you can get the milk for free?"

108
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,207
You're not allowed to milk a cow
that you don't own.

109
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,879
That's not even a situation.

110
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,842
Was that a problem at one point?

111
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,052
Like, in the dairy community?

112
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,222
Was that happening
a hundred years ago in some village?

113
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:57,894
Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night
being like, "Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk."

114
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,564
And the farmer was like,
"Well, then, this is your cow now."

115
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,691
And he was like,
"No, no proof of purchase."

116
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,401
And he ran off into the night.

117
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,903
That sounded Dutch, right?

118
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,573
You know what that...
you know what that expression means?

119
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,786
It means, "Why would you marry a woman
if she's already having sex with you?"

120
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,164
Which has nothing to do with
what relationships are even like anymore.

121
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,458
Now, it's like,
"Why buy the cow?"

122
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,711
Uh, maybe because, every day,

123
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,463
the cow asks you when
you're gonna buy it. And...

124
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,382
[audience laughing]

125
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,761
...you live in a really small apartment
with the cow,

126
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,557
so you can't avoid that question at all.

127
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,143
And also, the cow is way better
at arguing than you are.

128
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:43,064
And the cow grew up in a family
that knows how to argue.

129
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,149
"Why buy the cow?"

130
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:48,360
Uh, maybe because every time
another cow gets bought,

131
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,446
you have to go to the sale

132
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,201
and you have to
sit next to your cow at the sale,

133
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,912
and your cow looks over at you
the entire time like...

134
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,831
[mooing angrily]

135
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,918
And does not enjoy the sale at all...

136
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,005
even though she's the one
that wanted to go to the sale.

137
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,842
And she's especially mad

138
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,762
because that farmer and cow met,
like, eight months after you guys met.

139
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,515
"Why buy the cow?"
Well, let's be real here.

140
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,686
You're very lucky to have the cow
that you do have.

141
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,105
"Roping in cows
and getting milk out of them

142
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,691
was never anything
you were known for, John."

143
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,027
By the most liberal of estimates,

144
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:35,950
there have been about eight cows total,
several unmilked, and...

145
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:40,162
a lot of people think that you like bulls,
and if you just bought--

146
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,998
They assume it.

147
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,209
When you search your name,
the third thing to come up is like,

148
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,461
"John Mulaney bull?"

149
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:51,591
And if you just bought the cow,
nobody would say that anymore.

150
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,014
They'll still say it.

151
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,974
'Cause there are those guys who,
they buy a cow,

152
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,434
and then on the side,
total matador, but...

153
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,061
[audience laughing]

154
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,563
But, for real, Chicago,
why buy the cow?

155
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,274
Let's be real.
Why buy the cow?

156
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,442
Because you love her.
You really do.

157
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,237
-And, yeah, yeah...
-[audience cheering]

158
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,407
Sure, she's a bossy little Jew, but...

159
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,117
[audience laughing]

160
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,369
...she takes care of you.

161
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,496
And you don't wanna be
some old man stumbling around, like,

162
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,999
"Hey, you seen any loose milk?"

163
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,793
[audience laughing]

164
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:33,257
My wife is Jewish.
She's a New York Jew. I did it!

165
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,385
Now, I was raised Catholic.

166
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:39,180
I don't know if you can tell that
from the everything about me.

167
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,890
[audience laughing]

168
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:47,396
My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic,
so we got married by a friend. [laughs]

169
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:51,483
Being married by a friend
is a beautiful ceremony

170
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,986
that alienates both families' religions,

171
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,489
while confusing the elderly people
at the wedding.

172
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,908
"What's the name of the bishop?"

173
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,869
"That's actually stand-up comedian
Dan Levy.

174
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,665
He was the host of MTV's
<i>Your Face or Mine?"</i>

175
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,753
I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though,
because I was an altar boy...

176
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,254
And a hush falls over the room.

177
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,093
Isn't it weird how
that became a scandalous thing?

178
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,179
That was just some boring shit
I had to do on weekends.

179
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,766
But now, it's like saying,
"I was a French maid for a period of time.

180
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:29,438
I was treated well in my day.
I worked for a variety of sirs."

181
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,190
[laughs]

182
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,650
No, being an altar boy
was just a boring gig, you know?

183
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,863
You'd serve Mass
and then you'd serve weddings sometimes.

184
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,240
My brother was once an altar boy
at a wedding,

185
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,158
and he was standing there
with another altar boy

186
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,995
in this big, packed church in Chicago
where we grew up.

187
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,373
And the bride was coming down the aisle,
and the organ was playing,

188
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,916
and all the pews were filled,

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,918
and the bride
got all the way to the altar,

190
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,587
and the groom
lifted the veil off of the bride,

191
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,840
and right at that moment
the other altar boy said,

192
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,550
"Aw, she's ugly."

193
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,470
And then they looked,

194
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,931
and they were right next
to the video camera.

195
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,057
[audience laughing]

196
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,725
And I know that's awful,

197
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,897
but wouldn't you give a million dollars
to see that wedding video?

198
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,233
It was the best moment
of this stupid woman's life,

199
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,069
and she's walking down the aisle,
and the organ's like...

200
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,072
[vocalizing]

201
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,492
And she gets all the way to the altar
to her betrothed,

202
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:27,079
and he unveils her to the world
and to the eyes of God.

203
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,332
And right at that second,
for no reason at all,

204
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:35,797
some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached,
13-year-old prick decides to go,

205
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,965
"Aw, she's ugly!"

206
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,386
Hopefully the videographer
knew some sound editing

207
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:45,597
so he could fix it to be like,
"Aw, she's beautiful.

208
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,642
She's enchanting."

209
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,814
I grew up Catholic.
I don't go to church anymore.

210
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,941
But I went on Christmas Eve
with my parents,

211
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,193
'cause you know how
you lie to your parents. So...

212
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,655
we go into the church and I was like,
"I got this under control."

213
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:05,868
And then I got schooled because
they introduced a bunch of new shit.

214
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,957
No, I was going through Mass
and I was batting, like, .400.

215
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,584
And then in the middle of Mass,
the priest said,

216
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,044
"Peace be with you."

217
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,505
And everyone said,
"And with your spirit."

218
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,802
And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going,
"And also with you.

219
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,764
What? Huh? What? Huh?

220
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,767
What? When? When?"

221
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,272
For those of you that aren't Catholic,
I don't mean to exclude you,

222
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,566
even though we love
to exclude you, but...

223
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,528
There's a part in church
where the priest says,

224
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,864
"Peace be with you."

225
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,282
And for many, many years,
we all said...

226
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,285
-[audience] "And also with you."
-Very good.

227
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:53,790
But they changed it to
"And with your spirit."

228
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,836
Because that's what needed revamping
in the Catholic Church.

229
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,132
That was the squeaky wheel
that needed the grease.

230
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,634
In Rome, they were like,

231
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,470
[imitating Italian accent]
"Let's see. What problems can we solve?

232
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,891
Problem one. No."

233
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,771
I'm actually glad
they changed that, though.

234
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,814
I never liked "And also with you."

235
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,816
I always found that clunky.

236
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,653
"And also with you."
That's not how you talk.

237
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,031
-"Have a nice day."
-"And also you having one."

238
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,450
It's just a little bit wrong, isn't it?

239
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,785
It's just a little off.

240
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,454
Like, when someone's like, "How are you?"
And you're like, "Nothing much."

241
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,373
And it sort of makes sense.

242
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,210
Never begin a sentence with "And also."

243
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,047
You just immediately sound
caught off-guard.

244
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,715
It sounds like
if at the first church ever,

245
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,467
like, they weren't expecting it.

246
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,635
Like, the priest was like,

247
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,762
"Hey, this is the first time
we've ever had church.

248
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,932
I just wanna say,
'Peace be with you.'"

249
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,183
And they were like... [mumbling]

250
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,395
"What? Oh. Uh, yeah.
And also you should have some."

251
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,521
[audience laughing]

252
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,441
"Hey, that's good.
Let's keep that for 2,000 years.

253
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,944
And then change it to trick John."

254
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:09,575
My wife and I don't have any children,
we have a dog.

255
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,203
We have a little puppy named Petunia.

256
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,996
[audience cheering]

257
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,999
She's a tiny little French bulldog puppy.

258
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,834
I like having a puppy that's a bulldog,

259
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,254
'cause it's like having a baby
that is also a grandma.

260
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,925
Her body is young,
her face is as old as time.

261
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,345
She definitely saw the Nazis
march into Paris.

262
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,804
She always gives me this look of like,

263
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:34,934
[imitating French accent] "Oh,
the things I have seen, you cocksucker.

264
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,810
You have no idea.

265
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,813
The Gestapo threw
my printing press into a river.

266
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:42,274
But, go, tell your fucking jokes.

267
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,569
Bring me my dish."

268
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,157
She said that. Petunia...

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,495
Petunia is my best friend in the world.
I give her a million kisses a day.

270
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,621
She does not like me,

271
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,581
and barks at me
and bites me all day long.

272
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,210
We had to get a dog trainer
into the apartment

273
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,919
because Petunia is a bad dog.

274
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,132
We tell her that every day.
We go, "Hey, you're bad at being a dog."

275
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,633
So, the trainer came into the apartment.

276
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,385
Sorry, didn't even
walk into the apartment,

277
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,012
walked into the threshold and went,

278
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,263
"Oh, okay."

279
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,849
[laughs] Like she was
an exorcist or something.

280
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,977
She said, "I see what the problem is."

281
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,813
She said, "Petunia has become
the alpha of the house."

282
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,149
And then she pointed at me, she said,

283
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,693
"You are no longer
the alpha of the house."

284
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,531
And in the back of my head, I was like,
"I was never the alpha of the house."

285
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,409
I turned to my wife, I was like,
"Let's pretend. It'll be fun.

286
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:39,373
Yes... My title of alpha,
which I once had, how can I reclaim it?

287
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,126
Because that was a thing
that existed at one time."

288
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,505
She said, "You need to show dominance
over your puppy."

289
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,340
These are things people say to me.

290
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:52,261
I said, "How do I do that?"

291
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,432
She said, "Well, let me ask you this.
Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?"

292
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,435
I was like, "Petunia eats dinner first.
She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m.,

293
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,603
'cause she's a foot long
and two years old."

294
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,357
She said,
"No, you need to eat dinner first.

295
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,486
Because the king eats
before anyone else eats."

296
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,407
Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be,

297
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,203
eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon.

298
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,455
[laughs]

299
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,417
"Look upon your sovereign, Petunia,
and tremble.

300
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,504
My lands stretch across
this entire one bedroom,

301
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,174
and I eat dinner whenever I choose,

302
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,260
as long as it works
for the schedule of a dog."

303
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:39,015
She said, "Now, you don't actually
have to eat dinner before Petunia.

304
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,853
You just have to convince Petunia
that you've already eaten."

305
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:51,820
So... for the past month,
I shit you not...

306
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:55,074
before my wife and I
give Petunia her dish,

307
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,369
we take down empty bowls and spoons,

308
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:04,708
and in front of her, we go,
"Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner."

309
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:09,296
Like we're space aliens
in a play about human beings

310
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,091
that they wrote,
but they didn't work that hard on.

311
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,925
"Mmm, we're eating dinner."

312
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,555
Meanwhile, Petunia's just staring at us
with her Paul Giamatti face, like...

313
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,480
[imitating French accent]
"You're not eating dinner, cocksucker.

314
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,482
Dish, now."

315
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,027
I have a wife and a dog,
and we just bought a house.

316
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,237
We have a new house.

317
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,990
It was built in the '20s,
but it was flipped in 2014.

318
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:40,327
Which means it's haunted,
but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash.

319
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,997
Actually, we didn't buy a house.
A bank bought a house,

320
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,916
and I'm allowed to keep
my shirts and pants there

321
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,001
while I pay it off for 30 years.

322
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,628
The woman from the bank came over

323
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,340
and she showed me my mortgage
broken down month by month for 30 years.

324
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:57,344
And she said, "So, for instance,
this is what you'll pay in July of 2029."

325
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,180
And I burst out laughing.
I was like,

326
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,558
"2029? That's not a real year.

327
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,147
By 2029, I'll be drinking moon juice
with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

328
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,150
I'm not gonna be writing you
a paper check."

329
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,613
I like having a house,
but I loved looking for a house,

330
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,324
'cause I love real estate agents.

331
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,742
I mean, they are the true heroes.

332
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,537
They really are.
Have you ever watched HGTV?

333
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,498
-[audience cheering]
-Real estate agents have to deal with

334
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,750
the dumbest people in the world

335
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,213
making the biggest decisions
of their lives.

336
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,590
Every episode of HGTV is like,

337
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,843
"Craig and Stacia are looking
for a two-story A-frame

338
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,596
that's near Craig's job in the downtown,

339
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,599
but also satisfies Stacia's need
to be near the beach

340
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,767
which is nowhere near Craig's job.

341
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,188
With three children and nine on the way,

342
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,316
and a max budget of $7...

343
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,777
let's see what Lori Jo can do

344
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,531
on this week's episode of
<i>You Don't Deserve A Beach House."</i>

345
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,745
I loved our real estate agent.
It was so fun to hang out with her.

346
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,872
It was like hanging out with my mom.

347
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,625
'Cause, you know, real estate agents
always look like your mom.

348
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,836
And they have various
Chico's accoutrements.

349
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,257
They always have kind of fun mom energy.

350
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,344
And they're always,
"So excited to see you two."

351
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,180
We would have little conferences
before we walked into a house.

352
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,100
She'd go, "Let's talk.
Let's talk before we go in."

353
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:29,019
We're, like, two feet from the door.

354
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,357
"So, there's no toilets.

355
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,195
And I know that was on your list.

356
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,619
But I think I can get him to budge.
Let's go."

357
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,414
So, we'd have a real estate agent,

358
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,416
and then, like,
the house would have a real estate agent

359
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,501
who's just some guy
sitting in a big chair.

360
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,127
And these two always hated each other.

361
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,380
They'd be like, "Hi, Tony."
"Hi, Kim."

362
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,258
It's like, "Jesus Christ!
What, were you two in the Eagles together?

363
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,967
What is the animosity about?"

364
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,597
Our real estate agent
wanted us to have a baby

365
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,017
more than anyone else in our lives,
more than anyone in our family.

366
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,061
She hinted about it constantly.

367
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,229
Every room she walked into,
she'd be like,

368
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,231
"So, this could be an office."

369
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,695
[audience laughing]

370
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,196
"Or maybe a nursery."

371
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,367
"Yeah. No, like we said,
we don't know if we're gonna have--"

372
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,910
"No, no. I know,
I know, you know.

373
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,037
You don't know if you're gonna have 'em,
but you know.

374
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,246
You know, you never know.

375
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,958
Sometimes you don't know
what's gonna happen, and then...

376
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,585
you know, something happens."

377
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,671
"Well, yeah,
that's how all of life works."

378
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,673
"Okay, all right. Okay.

379
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,050
Uh-huh. Mmm.

380
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,679
This is an on-fire garbage can.

381
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,018
Could be a nursery."

382
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,645
[audience laughing]

383
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,941
She showed me a backyard once.

384
00:21:58,024 --> 00:21:59,901
She goes,
"I don't even like this backyard for you."

385
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,277
I was like, "Oh, do tell."

386
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,571
She said, "It's all pavement.

387
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,448
I think you should have
some grass out there.

388
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,910
You know, in case you have
a couple... little guys...

389
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,621
running around in the grass."

390
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,500
And I got offended
on behalf of my imaginary kids.

391
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,667
I was like, "Hey, lady.

392
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,879
I went outside about as much as Powder
from the movie <i>Powder.</i>

393
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,465
My children are not gonna be
playing out on grass.

394
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,468
They will be up in their rooms
playing violent video games

395
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,262
and catfishing pedophiles.
These are my children.

396
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,097
And that's my wife!"

397
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,974
[audience cheering]

398
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:35,103
I didn't mean to make it sound like
we don't want children.

399
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:37,939
We don't, but I didn't mean to
make it sound like that.

400
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,859
See, I just don't think
babies like me very much.

401
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,945
Sometimes babies will point at me,

402
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,072
and I don't care for that shit at all.

403
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,867
Like, I'll be on an elevator,

404
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,162
and a baby will be there
in its big, like, stroller activity tray,

405
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:57,375
just, like, working on one Cheerio
with Bobby Fischer-like intensity.

406
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,634
And it'll look up at me and go...

407
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:08,970
I like to lean in and go,

408
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,973
"Stop snitchin', motherfucker."
And then walk off.

409
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,727
'Cause you're never too young to learn
our national no-snitching policy.

410
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,232
My friends have babies
and I don't do so well with them.

411
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,359
I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl.

412
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,863
I know there are better ways
to start that story, but...

413
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,326
My friend, Jeremy, has this
two-year-old girl, and I really like her.

414
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,745
She's a sweet kid.
I really like his daughter a lot.

415
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,540
But I was over at his family's house
for the Fourth of July,

416
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,916
and he had his daughter on his knee.

417
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,335
And it was a very lovely day.
His whole extended family was there.

418
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,504
And he was bouncing
his two-year-old up and down,

419
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,840
and he pointed at me
and he said to his two-year-old,

420
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,300
"Do you know who that is?
That's your Uncle John."

421
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:50,762
And I was like, "Oh, my God.
That's so sweet. I'm her Uncle John."

422
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,764
And then the baby pointed at me and said,

423
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,266
"Uncle John has a penis."

424
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,018
[audience laughing]

425
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,857
I thank you for laughing,
because no one did that day!

426
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:08,071
Fell deadly silent,
is what they all did.

427
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,658
Hey, do you know
what you're supposed to say

428
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:16,622
when a baby points at you
and knowingly says, "He has a penis"?

429
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,333
No, I'm asking, 'cause I don't know
what to say in that situation.

430
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:24,963
Here's what I went with that day.
I said, "Oh, come on!" [laughs]

431
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,925
I don't know.
I thought that'd be good.

432
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,637
But then it just made it worse,

433
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,431
'cause it sounded like the baby and I
had an arrangement not to talk about it,

434
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,433
and she had violated my trust.

435
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,520
Like, the baby had been like,
"Do you have a penis?"

436
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,313
And I was like, "Yes, I do,
but you're a baby, so discretion is key."

437
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,775
And then the next day she goes,
"He has a penis," and I go,

438
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,361
"Oh, come on!
Someone can't keep a secret!"

439
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:53,033
Luckily, Jeremy's wife saved the day.
The baby's mom saved the day.

440
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,118
She came in and she picked up the baby,
and she was like,

441
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:56,286
"It's okay.

442
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:00,081
She's just going through that phase
where she says penis and vagina a lot."

443
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,208
Aren't we all?

444
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,293
[audience laughing]

445
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,628
And, by the way,
it would've been

446
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,589
a totally different situation
if the baby had said vagina.

447
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,675
Like, if a grown woman
had walked in the room,

448
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,885
and the baby had been like,
"She has a vagina,"

449
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,805
the woman could be like,
"Yes, I do, and it's magnificent."

450
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:19,726
And we would all be like,
"Hooray! You are brave!"

451
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,814
No one wants to applaud
the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo.

452
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,861
It's fun to be married.

453
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,947
I've never been supervised before.

454
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,909
I'm supervised.
She studies what I do.

455
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,953
Like an anthropologist.

456
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,582
She'll be like,
"Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV

457
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,542
even though he already owns
that movie on DVD.

458
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,423
Pointing this out to him
confuses and upsets him."

459
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:51,967
[audience laughing]

460
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,972
I had no supervision when I was a kid.

461
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,306
We were free to do what we wanted.

462
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:01,142
But also, with that,
no one cared about kids.

463
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,854
I grew up before children were special.

464
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,940
I did. Very early '80s,
right before children became special.

465
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,193
Like, I remember when
milk carton kids became a thing.

466
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:13,614
When they were like, "Hey, we should
start looking for some of these guys.

467
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,949
I don't think they're just
blowing off steam."

468
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,203
No one cared about my opinion
when I was a little kid.

469
00:26:20,286 --> 00:26:22,455
No one cared what I thought.

470
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:25,751
Sometimes, people would say,
"What do you think you're doing?"

471
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,964
But that just meant "Stop."

472
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,425
They didn't actually wanna know
my thought process.

473
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,677
They didn't want me to be like,

474
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:40,515
"Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket
into this carton of eggs,

475
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:44,645
so that when I lit off the bottle rocket,
the eggs would explode everywhere."

476
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,523
"Oh, well, that's very interesting.
And what brought you to this experiment?"

477
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,358
"Oh, well,
thank you for asking. Well...

478
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,695
you know how I'm filled with rage?

479
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,366
I'm so horny and angry all the time...

480
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:00,326
and I have no outlet for it.

481
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,037
So...

482
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,955
eggs."

483
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,836
Your opinion doesn't matter
in elementary school either.

484
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,255
It matters in college.
College is just your opinion.

485
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:13,715
Just you raising your hand and being like,

486
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,508
"I think Emily Dickinson's a lesbian."

487
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:17,969
And they're like, "Partial credit."
And that's a whole thing.

488
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,470
[audience laughing and applauding]

489
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,308
But in elementary school,
it doesn't matter what you think,

490
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,519
it just matters what you know.
You have to have answers to questions.

491
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:27,854
And if you say,
"I don't know,"

492
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:29,314
you get an X on your test,

493
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,984
and you get it wrong and that's not fair,
'cause your brain has never been smaller.

494
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,986
Also, that's not how life works.

495
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,698
I'm in my 30s now.
If you came to me now and you were like,

496
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:42,118
"Hey, John, name three things
that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished."

497
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,913
I'd go, "I don't know.
Get out of my apartment," you know?

498
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,583
But when you're a little kid,
you can't say, "I don't know."

499
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,751
You should be able to.

500
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,337
That should be
an acceptable answer on a test.

501
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,756
You should be able to write in,
"I don't know.

502
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,550
I know you told me.

503
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,304
But I have had a very long day.

504
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,891
I am very small.

505
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,103
And I have no money.

506
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,735
So you can imagine
the kind of stress that I am under."

507
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:20,365
Or if it's one of those
true or false questions,

508
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,200
you should be able to add
a third option which is,

509
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,910
"Who's to say?"

510
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,500
Kids are much more supervised now,
but also, they have a lot of rights.

511
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,003
Like, that's the biggest
civil rights increase

512
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,587
I've seen in my lifetime.

513
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,589
The rights of children
have gone through the roof.

514
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:38,884
I had no rights when I was a little kid.

515
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,095
I remember, one time,
I walked into a supermarket by myself,

516
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,679
and I walked in through the double doors,

517
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,349
and the woman behind the register
just looked at me and she went,

518
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:48,184
"No!"

519
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,772
And I went, "All right."
And I turned around and left.

520
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,481
That's how broken I was.

521
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,402
And there weren't special things for kids
the way there are now.

522
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,905
Like, we would just go see movies.
Any movie.

523
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,989
Like <i>Back to the Future.</i>

524
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,450
That was a movie everyone could see.
Kids could kinda see it.

525
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,786
Great movie, right?

526
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,413
I rewatched it recently.

527
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,248
It's a very weird movie.

528
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:15,128
Marty McFly is a 17-year-old
high school student

529
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:19,049
whose best friend
is a disgraced nuclear physicist.

530
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
And, I shit you not,

531
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,931
they never explain
how they became friends.

532
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,098
They never explain it.

533
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,850
Not even in a lazy way, like,

534
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,476
"Hey, remember when we met
in the science building?"

535
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,353
They don't even do that.

536
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,397
And we were all fine with it.

537
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,399
We were just like,
"What, who's his best friend?

538
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:39,485
A disgraced nuclear physicist?
All right, proceed."

539
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,407
What a strange movie to sell
to be a family movie.

540
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,034
Two guys had to go in and do that.

541
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,163
They had to be like,
"Okay... we got an idea...

542
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,166
for the next big family-action-comedy.

543
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:57,921
All right, it's about a guy named Marty,
and he's very lazy.

544
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,298
He's always sleeping late."

545
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,593
"Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?"

546
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,886
"No.

547
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,765
But he does have this best friend

548
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:15,313
who's, you know,
a disgraced... nuclear physicist."

549
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,820
"I'm confused here. This best friend,
this is another student?"

550
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,363
"No, no, no.

551
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:27,367
No, this guy's either,
like, 40 or 80.

552
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,121
Even we don't know
how old this guy's supposed to be.

553
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,874
But one day,
the boy and the scientist,

554
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,210
they go back in time
and they build a time machine.

555
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,337
Whoa!"

556
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,297
"Okay. I think I see
where you're going here.

557
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,758
They build a time machine,
and they go back in time,

558
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,469
and they stop the Kennedy assassination."

559
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:47,762
"Ah!

560
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,724
Oh, wow,
that's a really good idea,

561
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:54,019
I mean, we didn't even think of that."

562
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,229
"All right, well, what do they do
with the time machine?"

563
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,731
"Well, now I'm embarrassed to say.

564
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,360
Ah, well, all right,
all right, all right.

565
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,821
We thought...
We thought it would be funny, you know,

566
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,117
if the boy, if he went back in time
and, you know,

567
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,036
he tried to fuck his mom."

568
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,453
[audience laughing]

569
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:17,375
"I don't know.
We thought that'd be fun for people.

570
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,584
But, no, good point.

571
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,503
No, he doesn't get to,
he doesn't get to.

572
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:22,838
'Cause this family friend named Biff,

573
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:26,301
he comes in and he tries to rape the mom
in front of the son.

574
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,971
The dad's gotta
beat the rapist off of her.

575
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,308
And also, we're gonna imply
that a white man wrote 'Johnny B. Goode.'

576
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,060
So, we're gonna take that away from 'em."

577
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,852
[audience laughing]

578
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,610
"Well, this is the best movie idea
I have ever heard in my life.

579
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,113
We're gonna make three of them.

580
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:51,409
Now, you say they go to the past.
How about we call it <i>Back to the Past?"</i>

581
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,119
"No, no, no.

582
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,246
<i>Back to the Future."</i>

583
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,790
"Right, but they go to the past."

584
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,751
"Yeah."

585
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:07,968
Kids have it very good now.

586
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,053
My friend's a teacher.
She told me that, uh...

587
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,974
the parents will take the kids' side
over the teacher now.

588
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,142
That's insane.
That never happened.

589
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,728
My parents trusted every grown-up...

590
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,981
more than they trusted me.

591
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,274
I don't mean coaches and teachers.

592
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,736
Any human adult's word...
was better than mine.

593
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,863
Any hobo or drifter

594
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,325
could have taken me by the ear
up to my front door and been like,

595
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,911
"Excuse me!
Your kid bit my dick."

596
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,288
And my mom would be like,

597
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,790
"John Edmund Mulaney,

598
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,876
did you bite this nice man's dick?"

599
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,172
And I would be the only one who's like,
"Hey, doesn't anyone wanna know why...

600
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,761
his dick was near my biters...
in the first place?

601
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,389
Isn't anyone curious...

602
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,599
as to how I had access?"

603
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,234
Don't get me wrong, my parents love us.
They just didn't like us.

604
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,943
We weren't friends.

605
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,405
People are now like,
"My mom's my best friend."

606
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,532
I was like,
"Oh, is she a super bad mom?" [laughs]

607
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,454
My parents didn't trust us,
and they shouldn't have trusted us.

608
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,166
We were little goblins.
We were terrible.

609
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,835
I remember, one time, we were
going to this resort for a vacation

610
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,296
when we were little kids.

611
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,091
Three weeks before we went to the resort,
my dad sat us down and he said,

612
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,594
"All right, we're going to a resort,

613
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:39,517
and I've just been informed that the man
who owns the resort only has one arm."

614
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,563
And we were like,
"Oh, yes!

615
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,231
Yay! Yes!"

616
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,526
"Now, I'm telling you
three weeks in advance,

617
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:54,074
so that you will not freak out
when you see that he only has one arm."

618
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,618
"Oh, we're gonna freak out so bad!"

619
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,412
"Yes, John, you have a question?"

620
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,871
"How did he lose his arm?"

621
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,333
"That's exactly what you won't ask."

622
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,127
And then I did ask.

623
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,837
I went into the kitchen one day,
and I was like,

624
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,339
"So, how'd you lose your arm?"

625
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,757
And he was like,
"Well, I was born with only one arm."

626
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,301
And I was like,
[clicks tongue] "Nah."

627
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,760
[audience laughing]

628
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,351
No, my parents loved us.

629
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,062
It's just, like, they were the cops,
you know?

630
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,605
And we were criminals.

631
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,565
So, we didn't get along.

632
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,442
We only got along in that way that, like,

633
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,027
cops will sometimes be
chummy with criminals.

634
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,698
Like, when my dad and I would talk,
it was like that scene in the movie <i>Heat,</i>

635
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:38,826
when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino
sit down in that diner.

636
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,870
We kind of had that rapport of, like,

637
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,664
"Hmm, we're not so different,
you and I.

638
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,918
You have your law practice, and me,
I have all these fucking markers."

639
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,004
[audience laughing]

640
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,592
"I guess we both have responsibilities
when you look at it that way."

641
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,262
My dad would respect it
if I could get away with breaking a rule.

642
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,429
We had a rule in our house,

643
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,265
you were not allowed
to watch TV on a school night.

644
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,226
So, every school night,
I would 100% be watching TV.

645
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,936
And I would hear my dad coming,
I would immediately turn the TV off

646
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,688
and grab any book, magazine,
periodical, anything.

647
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,982
And I'd open it and
pretend to be doing homework.

648
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:11,776
My dad would walk in the room
and he would go,

649
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,819
"What are you doing?
Are you watching TV?"

650
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:17,031
And I'd go,
"No, man. I'm not watching TV."

651
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,325
And the TV wouldn't even be dark yet.

652
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:23,246
It would still have, like,
a neon green halo around it.

653
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,332
It'd be sizzling
like a glass of Pepsi.

654
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,543
And I would look my dad
in the eyes and go,

655
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,254
"No, I'm just reading this <i>Yellow Pages."</i>

656
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,882
My dad loved us.

657
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:39,011
He just didn't care about
our general happiness or self-esteem.

658
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:41,013
I remember, one time,
we were really little kids.

659
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:42,765
I have two sisters and a brother,

660
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:45,310
and all four of us were
in our family car ride

661
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,437
for three hours going to Wisconsin.

662
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,605
My dad was driving,
going down the highway

663
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,443
in our white van
with wood around the side.

664
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,571
'Cause you remember when you wanted
your car to be made of wood?

665
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,532
You remember that era?

666
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,993
Where we were like,
"How much wood can we get on this car...

667
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,288
without it catching on fire?"

668
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:09,375
But then the big announcement.
"We here at Plymouth-Chrysler

669
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:14,297
can put a saucy stripe of wood
safely on the outside of your car,

670
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,841
for all those times you've looked
at your minivan and thought,

671
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,344
'Huh! It needs a belt.'"

672
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,970
[audience laughing]

673
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,391
So, we're going on the highway.
We've been on the road for three hours.

674
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,768
And in the distance,
we see a McDonald's.

675
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,729
We see the golden arches.

676
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,897
And we got so excited.

677
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:37,403
We started chanting, "McDonald's!
McDonald's! McDonald's! McDonald's!"

678
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:42,032
And my dad pulled into the drive-thru,
and we started cheering.

679
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:47,205
And then, he ordered
one black coffee for himself.

680
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,748
[audience laughing]

681
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,710
And kept driving.

682
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,050
And, you know, as mad as that
made me as a little kid, in retrospect,

683
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:05,265
that is the funniest thing
I have ever seen in my entire life.

684
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,475
How perfect is that?

685
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:12,647
He had a vanload of little kids,
and he got black coffee.

686
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,941
The one thing from McDonald's
no child could enjoy.

687
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:21,447
My dad is cold-blooded.

688
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,700
He once shushed a kid
during <i>Lion King</i> on Broadway.

689
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,370
That actually happened.

690
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,163
We were at <i>Lion King</i> on Broadway,

691
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,915
and there was a five-year-old
behind us going,

692
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,876
"Look, it's Pumbaa!
Look, it's Timon!"

693
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:37,547
And my dad turned around and said,
"Are you going to talk the entire time?"

694
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,507
[audience laughing]

695
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:42,260
He's my hero.

696
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,471
The weirdest thing when I was a kid

697
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,890
was how much they scared us
about smoking weed.

698
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,518
They scared us about it constantly.

699
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,144
And I've been on tour this year...

700
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:56,357
Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states
in some form or another.

701
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,484
-It's insane. Yeah, well...
-[audience cheers]

702
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,403
All right, don't "whoo" if you're white.

703
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,655
It's always been legal for us.
Come on, sir.

704
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,407
[audience applauding]

705
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,203
We don't go to jail for marijuana,
you silly billy.

706
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,416
When I was arrested with a one-hitter
at a Rusted Root concert,

707
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,335
I did not serve hard time.

708
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,003
I think I got an award.

709
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,383
Eighteen or 19 states.

710
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,635
And, by the way, I agree,
it's a very good thing.

711
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,721
But it's also a really weird thing,

712
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,765
because this is the first time
I've ever seen a law change

713
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,976
because the government is just like,

714
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,437
[sighs] "Fine." You know?

715
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,939
I've never seen it before.

716
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:38,399
Like, gay marriage and healthcare,

717
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,860
we have to battle it out
in the Supreme Court,

718
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,653
and be like,
"Gay people are humans."

719
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,989
And they're like,
"We'll think about it."

720
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,993
But with weed, it was just something
we wanted really badly,

721
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,371
and we kept asking them
for 40 years, like,

722
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,331
"Excuse me."

723
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:57,418
And then suddenly the government
became like cool parents,

724
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,503
and they're just like,

725
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,131
"Okay, here. Take a little.

726
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,552
We'd rather you do it in the house
than go somewhere else...

727
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,471
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

728
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,889
[audience cheering]

729
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,309
Those stupid parents. [laughs]

730
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,314
And that's a big deal because
they scared us about weed constantly.

731
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,983
It would be on our sitcoms.

732
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:24,111
We'd be watching <i>Saved by the Bell,</i>
we'd be having a great old time.

733
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:27,698
And then, suddenly,
a character we had not seen before

734
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,869
would show up with some weed and
the episode would stop cold in its tracks.

735
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,704
And they'd always hold the joint...

736
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,957
The bad guy would hold the joint
in a villainous way.

737
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,628
They'd always offer the joint in a way
that no one ever holds a joint.

738
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,297
Like it's a skull in a Shakespeare play.

739
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,342
And now it's legal,
and that is great news.

740
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,513
Unless you're a weed dealer,
and then it is terrible news.

741
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:54,767
And I don't just mean because
they're about to lose out to Amazon.com.

742
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,228
I more feel bad for weed dealers
'cause they're about to find out that

743
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,731
we only showed them
a certain amount of politeness

744
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,526
because they had an illegal product.

745
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:07,988
And we don't show that same politeness
to people who deliver legal products.

746
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,408
Like, when the Chinese food
delivery guy comes,

747
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,662
we don't let him hang out
after he's delivered the Chinese food.

748
00:40:17,372 --> 00:40:18,708
And we don't look the other way

749
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,586
when he says weird shit
to the girls we're hanging out with...

750
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,964
to try to preserve the relationship.

751
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,929
And we definitely don't give him
some of the Chinese food.

752
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,434
He's never like,
"Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?"

753
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,394
And we're like,
"Yeah, we're all friends."

754
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,068
What are you, on your phone?
Hey, V-neck. Hey!

755
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,782
-What's your name?
-[man] Sam.

756
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,117
Sam?

757
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,786
-Cool!
-[audience laughing]

758
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,541
What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam?

759
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,878
[Sam speaking indistinctly]

760
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,507
Typing numbers.
Ah... numbers, the letters of math.

761
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,054
I'm sorry to bother you.
I don't mean to single you out.

762
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,390
I hate when people get
pulled out of the audience.

763
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,852
Like, are you familiar
with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam?

764
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,272
They're a group of French assholes
that are slowly taking over America

765
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,859
by humiliating audience members
one by one.

766
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,779
We once went to see Cirque du Soleil
at Navy Pier when I was a kid,

767
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,572
and my brother came,
and he was 12 years old.

768
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,785
You remember being 12, when you're like,
"No one look at me or I'll kill myself."

769
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,162
And these French bastards

770
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,665
come into the crowd, being like,
<i>"Le</i> volunteer!"

771
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,542
[speaking gibberish]

772
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,419
And they pulled my brother up on stage,
and I was like,

773
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,129
"No!"

774
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:49,757
And they brought him up,
and they reached into his sweatshirt,

775
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,133
and they were like...
[speaking gibberish]

776
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:52,384
And they had planted a bra,

777
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:55,387
and they pulled out a bra
and they were like... [speaking gibberish]

778
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,973
And everyone at Navy Pier was like
"Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!"

779
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,142
And my brother was like, "That's great!"
[imitates gunshot]

780
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,065
I have had other jobs besides comedy.

781
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,317
I was an office temp for a while.

782
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,985
I really miss that.

783
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,403
I loved being a temp,

784
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:13,447
because I would just go
from office to office

785
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,991
and be terrible at a different job
for a week.

786
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,202
And then you just get to retire
like Lou Gehrig.

787
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,412
You're like, "Thank you.
No one will ever see me again."

788
00:42:20,495 --> 00:42:22,623
And they're like, "Goodbye!"

789
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:26,418
I worked at an office once
on 57th Street in New York City.

790
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,295
I was there for a couple weeks.

791
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:30,673
I was in a cubicle
next to this other cubicle.

792
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,133
This woman named Mischa
sat in the other cubicle.

793
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,552
I want to get the number right.

794
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,596
I think Mischa had...

795
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,057
about 900,000 photos of her daughter
up in her cubicle.

796
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,936
Almost like she was trying to solve
a conspiracy about her daughter,

797
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,021
<i>A Beautiful Mind</i>-style.

798
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,651
I think about Mischa two times a week...

799
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,239
because of a phone call
she had next to me one day.

800
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,033
It was one of my first days,
and I was sitting next to her.

801
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,535
And her phone rang,
and this was her call, and I'm quoting.

802
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,912
Her phone rang and she said,

803
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,331
"Hello? Hush!"
And then she hung up.

804
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:05,791
[audience laughing]

805
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,169
Think about that two times a week.

806
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,171
And I didn't know her
well enough by then to be like,

807
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,966
"Hey, what kind of a person are you?"
You know?

808
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,761
Who could she have been talking to?

809
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:21,098
"Hello? Hush!"
This was a place of business.

810
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,059
My only thought was that it was
the CEO of the company being like,

811
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,978
"Mischa, help.
I'm doing a crossword puzzle.

812
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,938
I need a four-letter word
for 'be quiet' right now."

813
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,607
-"Hush!"
-"You're promoted."

814
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,863
I temped at a little web company
on 25th Street in New York City.

815
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,657
It was a small web company

816
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,326
owned by this old man who was
old, old, old money New York.

817
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,038
His name was Henry J. Finch IV.

818
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,373
Like old, old, old money.

819
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:49,168
Like, his money was
in molasses or something.

820
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,502
He owned this web company.

821
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:52,963
I have no idea why
he owned this web company.

822
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,926
I think he won it in a rich man's game of
dice and small binoculars, or something.

823
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,846
Mr. Finch wore linen suits.

824
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,141
He had suspenders, he had a bow tie,
he had a hat,

825
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,185
he had a cane with an ivory handle.

826
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,020
I'm giving you more description
than you need,

827
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,313
'cause I need you to believe me.

828
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,816
This was a real person I knew
in the 21st century.

829
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,859
Mr. Finch was in his 70s.

830
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:17,697
He had an assistant named Mary.
She was in her 50s, she was Korean.

831
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,825
I don't know why he had an assistant.
He did not need one.

832
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:21,909
Unless he needed someone to be like,

833
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,744
"Remember, Mr. Finch,
at five o'clock,

834
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,205
you need to keep looking like
a hard-boiled egg."

835
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,873
[audience laughing]

836
00:44:29,624 --> 00:44:32,461
One day, Mr. Finch came into the office.

837
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,213
It had been raining.

838
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:38,676
Everything I'm about to say to you
was said in front of me on that afternoon.

839
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,804
Mr. Finch walked into the office,
and he was wearing a raincoat,

840
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,431
he was wearing a rain hat,
and he had his cane.

841
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,892
And he walked in and he said,
and I'm quoting,

842
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,061
"Ah!

843
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,564
One feels like a duck
splashing around in all this wet!

844
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:55,776
And when one feels like a duck,
one is happy!"

845
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,654
And then Mary yelled,
"Ooh, ducklings!"

846
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,532
To which Mr. Finch replied,

847
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,745
"Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack."
And then walked into his office.

848
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,209
I think about that every goddamn day.

849
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,003
I mean, imagine you're me.

850
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,840
You're a 22-year-old temp,
and you're so hungover,

851
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,217
and you just wanna die every day.

852
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,637
And then that happens in front of you,
and I don't know, gives you hope?

853
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,766
And I did that a little fast.

854
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,976
Let me break that conversation
down for you.

855
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,228
Mr. Finch walked in,

856
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,856
and he began a conversation
the way anyone would.

857
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,358
-"Ah!"
-[laughter]

858
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,825
"One feels like a duck
splashing around in all this wet!"

859
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:45,993
The rain.

860
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,997
"And when one feels like a duck,
one is happy!"

861
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,623
Now, that's debatable.

862
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,627
But rather than debate that point,

863
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,549
Mary brought up a new,
separate, but interesting point...

864
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,761
which was, "Ducklings!"

865
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:11,936
But Mr. Finch, ever the realist
about his own age and mortality...

866
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,772
said, "Ah, too old to be a duckling!"

867
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,276
As if to say,
"My duckling days are behind me.

868
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,778
Mary, don't you see?

869
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,405
I'm a duck now.

870
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,325
And to prove it...

871
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,747
Well, I'll say just about the most
famous catchphrase a duck has...

872
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,417
'Quack, quack.'"

873
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,176
And I knew right at that moment,
by the way,

874
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,887
that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch,
what he had said.

875
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:50,182
Crazy people are like that.
They have unlimited crazy currency.

876
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,809
Like, if I had gone into his office
a couple weeks later and been like,

877
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,228
"Hey, Finch, you remember
that time you were like,

878
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,105
'Too old to be a duckling.
Quack, quack'?"

879
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,898
He would just be like,
"Ah, perhaps I did quack!

880
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,816
But such is life
for an old knickerbocker like me."

881
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,651
Like, he'd say something else crazy.

882
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,364
That's the wonderful thing
about crazy people, you know?

883
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,449
Is that they just have
unlimited currency.

884
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:12,579
The things they say mean nothing to them,
but they mean everything to me.

885
00:47:12,662 --> 00:47:15,040
I was once walking into
Penn Station in New York.

886
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,542
I was walking down 31st Street
towards Eighth Avenue.

887
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,752
I'm walking down 31st,

888
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,046
there's this woman
standing at Eighth and 31st.

889
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,590
I have my little roller suitcase.
You can all imagine.

890
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:24,674
I'm walking towards her.

891
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,760
She's smoking a cigarette
that is not lit anymore.

892
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:30,472
She's watching me walk,
kind of scanning me up and down,

893
00:47:30,555 --> 00:47:32,349
as if she had Terminator vision...

894
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,184
where she could see
little bits of data, like,

895
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,519
[imitates beeping]
"Little honky ass,"

896
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,062
and could read information.

897
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,108
As I walked past her,
she said this to me.

898
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,610
I walked past her and she said,
and I'm quoting,

899
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:47,281
"Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs."

900
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,074
[audience laughing]

901
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,372
Very dirty, yes?

902
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:59,001
A very upsetting thing to hear, yes?

903
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,420
I'm sorry you all had to hear that,

904
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,755
but at least you all
got to hear it as a group.

905
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:06,633
I was alone out there that afternoon.

906
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:08,718
And she said this totally unprompted.

907
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,222
"Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs."

908
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,599
It wasn't like I had
paused in front of her and been like,

909
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,851
"What should I do with my life?"

910
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,773
So, I walk away from her
with this to-do list.

911
00:48:23,608 --> 00:48:26,320
And I like structure,
I like a to-do list.

912
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:31,616
It did dawn on me that that list of things
does get better as it goes along,

913
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,035
when you really think about it.

914
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,537
'Cause it starts in a pretty rough place.

915
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,625
It starts with just about the worst task
a to-do list can start with.

916
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,045
But by the end,
you have your own small business.

917
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:47,841
And isn't that the American dream
when all's said and done?

918
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,676
[audience cheering]

919
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:52,887
That if you eat enough ass
and suck enough dick,

920
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,265
one day you can sell drugs.

921
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,603
Imagine you did all that to sell drugs
and then they legalize drugs,

922
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,521
and you were like,
"But I... [sighs]"

923
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,732
[audience laughing and applauding]

924
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,154
This has been a real thrill
to perform here, by the way.

925
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:12,324
I just wanna say that in all sincerity.
Thanks for coming to this.

926
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,908
[audience cheering]

927
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,619
Really, really appreciate it.

928
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,000
I wanna tell you one more story
before I get out of here,

929
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,502
about the night I met a guy
named Bill Clinton.

930
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,296
Now, I don't--
Some of you know who that is?

931
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,882
[chuckling] For those of you that don't,

932
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:33,137
he was President of the United States
from 1993 until 2001,

933
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,180
and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly

934
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,225
who should be declared
Emperor of the United States of America.

935
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,979
Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is.

936
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:46,108
But I was doing a show at a college,
and I mentioned Bill Clinton,

937
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,319
and, like, they kind of
didn't know who he was.

938
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,197
Like, sorry,
they knew the name, right?

939
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:57,744
But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton,
who's a very different Bill Clinton.

940
00:49:57,827 --> 00:50:02,124
Have you seen his ass lately?
What the hell is he trying to pull?

941
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,210
He's all thin now,
and he wears these little tight suits,

942
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,337
and he's got these
grandpa reading glasses, like,

943
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,714
[imitating Clinton] "Hey,
I can't do nothing to nobody no more."

944
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,675
[audience laughing]

945
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,803
"Oh, me? I'm just an old, old man.
I don't have the appetites." You know?

946
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:20,059
And he's always flying around the world
with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS.

947
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:25,189
[laughs] That is not the Bill Clinton
that we all signed up for 20 years ago.

948
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,399
Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat

949
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,277
Buddy Garrity from
<i>Friday Night Lights</i>-looking guy,

950
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,821
who played the saxophone on <i>Arsenio,</i>

951
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:37,867
and his work in the STD community
was not in curing anything at that time.

952
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,288
That was the man we all elected president.

953
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,374
That was the Bill Clinton that I met.

954
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,836
I got to meet Bill Clinton
when he was Governor Clinton in 1992,

955
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,629
when he was first running for president.

956
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,005
And I got to meet Bill Clinton

957
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,218
because my parents had gone
to the same college as Bill Clinton.

958
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,011
They're a little younger,
but they went to the same college.

959
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,888
So, when he was
first running for president,

960
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,558
he would have all these
big, like, alumni fundraisers,

961
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,518
and everyone who went was invited to go.

962
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,770
Now, this was really cool
for a couple reasons.

963
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,022
One, I got to meet Bill Clinton.

964
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:13,403
But two, I got to watch my parents
watch someone they went to school with

965
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,530
become the president.

966
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,741
And that is super funny to see,

967
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,577
'cause think about some of the people
you went to school with.

968
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,414
Now imagine
they're becoming the president.

969
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,584
Imagine Sam was becoming the president.

970
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,840
It would stir up strong emotions.

971
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,011
And my parents had
very different opinions on Bill Clinton.

972
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,639
My mom loved Bill Clinton,

973
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:44,017
'cause Bill Clinton was always
a really charismatic, handsome guy.

974
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,853
I mean, think about how many women
he got in the 1990s

975
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:49,689
when he looked like Frank Caliendo
doing John Madden.

976
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,902
Now... imagine him as a college student.

977
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,779
And my mom tells me that
there was this sort of

978
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,365
chivalrous policy
on campus back then,

979
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,908
where, late at night,

980
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:03,412
if female students were leaving
the library unaccompanied,

981
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:08,292
male students were encouraged to wait
out in front and offer to walk them home.

982
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,001
That sounds good, right?
[chuckles]

983
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:16,383
So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton
would be out in front of the library

984
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,928
every single night...
just being like,

985
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,346
[imitating Clinton]
"Hey, can I walk ya home?

986
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,516
Hey, can I walk ya home?
Hey, can I walk ya home?

987
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,059
Hey, can I walk ya home?"

988
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:29,188
And one night,
my mom was leaving the library,

989
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,690
and Bill Clinton was like,
"Hey, can I walk ya home?"

990
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,983
And my mom was like,
"Hell, yes."

991
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,320
So-- This is absolutely true.

992
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,405
My mom, little Ellen Stanton,

993
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:42,158
walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton
to her dorm. And she was like,

994
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,203
"You know, I wanted to
invite him up for a beer."

995
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,371
And I was like,
"Thanks, I'm nine." But...

996
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:53,378
her roommate was upstairs,
so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton.

997
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:58,342
Now, my dad, on the other hand,
hated Bill Clinton,

998
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,970
because my parents were dating
during this time.

999
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,764
And also,
my dad's a much more morally-upright,

1000
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,182
conservative kind of guy.

1001
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,268
He always told me
that he hated it in college

1002
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,813
that Bill Clinton could, quote,
"Get away with anything."

1003
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:14,107
Can you imagine how he felt later?

1004
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,863
So, one day,
this invitation arrives

1005
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,324
for a fundraiser where
you could meet Bill Clinton.

1006
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,326
My mom opens it first and she goes,

1007
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:28,913
"Oh, we have to go.
We have to go see Bill."

1008
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,541
And without looking up at her,
my dad just says,

1009
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,543
"Why?

1010
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,170
It's not like he's gonna remember you."

1011
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,716
[audience murmuring]

1012
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,385
One black coffee.

1013
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,553
[audience laughing and applauding]

1014
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,305
Same motherfucker.

1015
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:50,852
So, my mom says,

1016
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:53,772
"Fine! I'll go and I'll take John."
And I was like, "Hell, yeah."

1017
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:58,109
And I slid in the room in
my First Communion suit, ready to go.

1018
00:53:58,192 --> 00:54:00,779
'Cause I loved Bill Clinton.
I was ten years old.

1019
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,532
If you were a kid
when Bill Clinton was first released,

1020
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,700
it was the most exciting thing ever.

1021
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,370
We'd never seen a cool politician before.

1022
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,788
And he would go on MTV,

1023
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,457
and he'd have cool answers
to kids' questions.

1024
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,376
They'd be like,
"Governor, what's your favorite food?"

1025
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,545
And he'd be like,
"I don't know, fries?"

1026
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,880
And we'd be like,
"Yay, we eat fries!"

1027
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:23,635
I learned to play
his campaign song on the piano.

1028
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,763
It was "Don't Stop" by Fleetwood Mac...

1029
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,558
from <i>Rumours,</i>

1030
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,645
an album written by and for
people cheating on each other.

1031
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,316
He let us know who he was right away.

1032
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,488
So, I went with my mom,
as her date...

1033
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:46,700
to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton.

1034
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,536
We walked into the ballroom.
It was a big hotel ballroom.

1035
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,747
It was the Palmer House Hilton,
big Hilton hotel ballroom.

1036
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,749
Walked into the ballroom,
it was packed with people.

1037
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,252
It's actually the ballroom from the end
of the movie <i>The Fugitive,</i> remember?

1038
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,629
So, that ballroom.

1039
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:04,133
So, my mom and I walk in,
it's packed with people, the--

1040
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:08,430
Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford,
as Dr. Richard Kimble,

1041
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,015
bursts in to confront
Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay.

1042
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,601
So, that ballroom.

1043
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,937
So, my mom and I walk in,
it's packed with people.

1044
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,230
Why does Kimble confront Nichols?

1045
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,649
Well, I know we all know this, but--
No, no. But, but, but...

1046
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,528
Kimble, he found out that Nichols,
along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz,

1047
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,572
who has mysteriously died,

1048
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,991
they had hired Frederick Sykes,
the one-armed man, to kill Kimble.

1049
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,951
Kimble's wife wasn't even the target.
I know we all know this.

1050
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:31,202
But they were gonna kill Kimble

1051
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:34,373
because he wasn't gonna approve
certain liver samples to pass RUD-90.

1052
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,917
So, Kimble finds out about all of this,
and, of course, he's furious.

1053
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,335
And he bursts into the ballroom
and he goes,

1054
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,004
[imitating Kimble]
"You switched the samples!"

1055
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,464
And Dr. Nichols is like,

1056
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,967
[in foreign accent] "Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble."

1057
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,344
What accent did that guy have,
by the way?

1058
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,847
He goes,
"You switched the samples!

1059
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,725
And you doctored your research!

1060
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,520
So that you could have Provasic!"

1061
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:02,401
Anyway, so it's that ballroom.
So, we walk into that ballroom.

1062
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,403
It was packed with people.

1063
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:12,619
It was packed with people.
A real <i>Who's Not</i> of Chicago celebrities.

1064
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,663
Walter Jacobson was there.

1065
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,208
Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor.

1066
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:22,546
He'd do fun things where he'd go
undercover as a homeless person.

1067
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,464
And he'd be like,
"Oh, what time is the soup?"

1068
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,257
And they'd be like,
"Man, you're Walter Jacobson."

1069
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,009
He was there.

1070
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,804
[laughs]

1071
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,472
Everybody.

1072
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,559
And on the far side of the ballroom,
under a spotlight,

1073
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,769
we saw a little bit of silver hair.

1074
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,896
And it was him...
Bill Clinton.

1075
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,524
The Comeback Kid.

1076
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,275
But he was surrounded by reporters,

1077
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:47,361
and photographers,
and Secret Service.

1078
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,613
So, what are you gonna do?

1079
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:52,784
Well, if you're my mom,
you ball up the back of my sport coat,

1080
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:56,079
and you push me forward
like a human shield.

1081
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,122
And then you start jogging while yelling,

1082
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:02,627
"This ten-year-old boy has to meet
the next president of the United States!"

1083
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,421
Kind of implying that I might be dying.

1084
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:09,884
My feet were not on the ground.
She was swinging me like a snowplow.

1085
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:14,055
I was just mowing down
fat Chicago Democrats.

1086
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:18,560
I pushed past all the reporters,
I pushed past all the photographers.

1087
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,020
We pushed past all the Secret Service.

1088
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,565
We land at Bill Clinton's feet.

1089
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,860
Bill Clinton turns,
looks at my mom and says,

1090
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,069
"Hey, Ellen,"

1091
00:57:28,152 --> 00:57:31,322
'cause he never forgets a bitch, ever.

1092
00:57:31,405 --> 00:57:34,117
[audience cheering]

1093
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:45,754
My mom melts.
She goes, "Hi, Bill."

1094
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,633
Then it is revealed that she has no plan.

1095
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:54,220
So... she pushes me towards Clinton
and she goes,

1096
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:57,932
"This is my son, John,
and he's also going to be president."

1097
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:01,102
And I was like,
"What the hell are you talking about?

1098
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:03,312
I'm not gonna be president."

1099
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,650
And I know now that I'm definitely
never gonna be president.

1100
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,820
Not unless everyone gets real cool
about a bunch of stuff really quickly.

1101
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,951
Based on my ten-year-old memory,

1102
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,328
Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall.

1103
00:58:20,454 --> 00:58:23,249
And he leaned down, because,
well, I was wearing this button

1104
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:24,626
that I bought outside the fundraiser.

1105
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:28,672
It was a cartoon button
of George H. W. Bush,

1106
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:33,802
and it had a quail flying over his head,
and it was shitting on his head.

1107
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,387
And it said, "Bird-brained."

1108
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,182
And I thought it was very funny.

1109
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,727
And Bill Clinton leaned down
so that only I could hear and he said,

1110
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:45,438
[imitating Clinton]
"Hey, man, I like your button."

1111
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,398
[audience laughing]

1112
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:50,777
And I said, "You can do
whatever you want forever."

1113
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,487
And he took my advice.

1114
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,489
And...

1115
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:58,159
it was the best night of my entire life.

1116
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,162
And I got home that night...

1117
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,373
I got home that night,
and my dad was still awake,

1118
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,586
like, reading angry under one lamp,
just like... [grunts]

1119
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,548
And I went up to him and I went, "Hey!

1120
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,257
I'm gonna be a Democrat."

1121
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,343
[audience laughing]

1122
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,221
"And I'm gonna vote for Bill Clinton."

1123
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,932
And without looking up at me,
my dad just said,

1124
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,936
"You have the moral backbone
of a chocolate éclair."

1125
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,026
You know,
how you talk to a child.

1126
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,989
So, here's the end of that story.

1127
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:40,326
That was 1992.
Let's flash forward five years to 1997.

1128
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:44,288
It is now 1997.
I am a sophomore in high school,

1129
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:47,626
Bill Clinton is in his second term
as president.

1130
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,254
And on the morning
that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks

1131
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,714
on the cover of <i>The New York Times.</i>

1132
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:53,840
It had been on the <i>Drudge Report,</i>

1133
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,134
and then it was on the cover
of <i>The New York Times.</i>

1134
00:59:56,217 --> 01:00:00,639
That morning, I wake up
to the newspaper hitting me in the face.

1135
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:05,769
I am a teenager asleep in bed,
and the newspaper hits me in the face

1136
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,979
and falls open on my stomach.

1137
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:12,191
And I open my eyes to see my dad
standing there dressed for work,

1138
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,442
and he says,

1139
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,529
"The other shoe just dropped."

1140
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,615
[audience laughing and applauding]

1141
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,827
And then my dad went in to work

1142
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,330
to find out that his law firm
had been hired

1143
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,291
to defend Bill Clinton.

1144
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,835
[audience cheering]

1145
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,214
Good night, Chicago.

1146
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,383
[audience cheering]

1147
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,597
[instrumental music playing]
