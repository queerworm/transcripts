00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,239
Welcome to Radio City Music Hall.

3
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,699
It's time. Any questions?

4
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,201
No.

5
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,412
Walk with me.

00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,600

[audience applauding and cheering]

00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,146
[audience cheering]

10
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,746
Good evening.

11
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,835
Hi, I'm John Mulaney, nice to meet you.

12
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,673
Jon Brion, ladies and gentlemen.

13
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,847
Thank you for coming to see me
at Radio City Music Hall.

14
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,433
I love to play venues where
if the guy that built the venue

15
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,893
could see me on the stage,

16
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,146
he would be a little bit bummed about it.

17
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:27,939
Look at this.

18
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,775
This is so much nicer
than what I'm about to do.

19
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,776
It's really...

20
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,736
It's really tragic.

21
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:38,575
What a historic and beautiful
and deeply haunted building this is.

22
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,327
I keep walking through cold spots
being like,

23
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,037
"I wonder who that used to be."

24
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,457
I've never seen a ghost, by the way.

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,835
I asked my mom if she'd ever seen a ghost.

26
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,381
That's where we're at conversation-wise
in our relationship as a mother and son,

27
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,593
because I'm 35 and I don't have
any children to talk about

28
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,095
and she doesn't understand my career.

29
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:03,808
So I was home for Christmas and we were
just eating Triscuits in silence

30
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,894
and I was staring at the floor
and I was like,

31
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,813
"Well, here goes nothing.
'You ever seen a ghost?'"

32
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,234
And my mom said, "Yes."

33
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,988
Which is the best answer.

34
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,991
She said, "I never told you this before

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,995
but our house, when you were growing up,
was haunted."

36
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,081
I said, "Say more right now!"

37
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,920
She said, "Outside you
and your brother's room,

38
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,715
I used to see the ghost of a little girl
in a Victorian nightgown

39
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:40,345
and then she would walk down the hallway
and then she would evaporate."

40
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,015
And then my dad said,
"Let's change the subject!"

41
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,061
And I think he was just doing
that dad-thing of, like,

42
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:53,149
"This is a weird topic and I want to talk
about a book I read about World War II."

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:58,238
But the way it came off was that
he definitely killed that little girl.

44
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,783
"Let's change the subject!

45
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,160
Why are we even talking about Penelope...

46
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,871
or whatever her name was?

47
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,748
I didn't kill her!

48
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,418
Whoever did kill her only did it
to protect her from this world."

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,756
None of us really know our fathers.
Anyway...

50
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,635
My dad is so weird.

51
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,136
I'd love to meet him someday.

52
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,849
You know, my friend was telling me
that his dad used to beat him with a belt

53
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,352
and that's just the setup
to my story, so...

54
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,063
Forget about that poor son of a bitch.
Anyway...

55
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,608
He was talking and I was waiting
for him to be done so I could talk.

56
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,027
So he's "talk, talk, talk."
It's my turn next!

57
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,279
And...

58
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,489
[audience laughing]

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,866
I said, "My dad never hit us."

60
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,287
My dad is a lawyer
and he was a debate team champion.

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,580
So he would pick us apart
psychologically.

62
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,502
One time I was at the dinner table
when I was like six, because I had to be.

63
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,880
My dad goes, "How was school today?"

64
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,717
I said, "It was good
but someone pushed Tyler off the seesaw."

65
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,801
"And where were you?"

66
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,261
"I was over on the bench."

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,762
"And what did you do?"

68
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,597
"Nothing. I was over on the bench."

69
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,391
"But you saw what happened?"

70
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,976
"Yeah, 'cause I was over on the bench."

71
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,687
"So you saw what happened
and you did nothing?"

72
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,689
"Yeah, 'cause I was sitting
over on the bench."

73
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,359
"Let me ask you this. In Nazi Germany..."

74
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,861
[audience laughing]

75
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,780
"...when people saw what the Nazis
were doing and did nothing,

76
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,365
were those good people?"

77
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,868
"No, those are bad people.
You gotta stop the Nazis."

78
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:31,164
"But you saw what they were doing to Tyler
and you did nothing!"

79
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,458
"Because I was over on the bench."

80
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,586
And then my dad said,
"Just explain to me this.

81
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,796
How are you better than a Nazi?"

82
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:43,676
And then my mom said,
"I made a salad with Craisins!"

83
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,887
And the conversation ended.

84
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,933
My dad's a very weird, informal guy.

85
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,936
A lot of people ask me
if he gave me a sex talk.

86
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,146
Yes.

87
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,272
I think.

88
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:02,153
I was like 12 years old and my dad
walked up to me and he said, "Hello...

89
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,155
[chuckles]

90
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,659
Hello, I'm Chip Mulaney. I'm your father."

91
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,872
And then he said the following,

92
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,583
"You know,  Leonard Bernstein...

93
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,213
was one of the great composers
and conductors of the 20th century,

94
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,715
but sometimes he would be gay.

95
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,469
And according to a biography
I read of him,

96
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:31,391
when he was holding back the gay part,
he did some of his best work."

97
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,521
[audience laughing]

98
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,693
Now we don't have time
to unpack all of that.

99
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,864
And I don't know if he was
discouraging me from being gay

100
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,409
or encouraging me
to be a classical composer.

101
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,913
But that is how he thought to phrase it
to a 12-year-old boy.

102
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,498
How would that ever work?

103
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,752
Like years later, I'd be in college
about to go down on some rocking twink

104
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,671
and I'd be like, "Wait a second...

105
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,299
What would Leonard Bernstein do?"

106
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,600
I've never talked to my dad about that,
but I figured I would tell all of you.

107
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,060
[audience laughing]

108
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,311
This is so great.

109
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,565
Thank you for coming. You're here.
That's great. You all showed up.

110
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,650
-[audience cheering]
-I appreciate it.

111
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,363
And then we showed up so you got to see
the things that you paid to see.

112
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,406
That's great.

113
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,242
You don't always get to see
the things that you paid to see.

114
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,703
Ever been to the goddamn zoo?

115
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,331
Those guys are never
where they're supposed to be.

116
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:41,002
Every time I go to the zoo I'm like,
"Hey, where's the jaguar?"

117
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,255
And the zoo guy is like,
"He must be in the inside part."

118
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,090
The inside part?

119
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,967
Tell him we're here.

120
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,052
[audience laughing]

121
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,849
I love doing stand-up for crowds
because this right here,

122
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,060
this reminds me of assembly
in grade school.

123
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,731
And assembly was the only part of school
I ever liked.

124
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,734
Once you leave school,
you don't get to have assembly.

125
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:09,614
This is the closest we get
 in adult life to assembly.

126
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,451
'Cause look at you all,
you're just sitting there in chairs,

127
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,747
looking at a guy
with absolutely no expertise,

128
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,917
who's going to talk for a while.

129
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,794
Although this is different than assembly

130
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,005
because you bought tickets,
you knew this was coming.

131
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,175
Assembly you never knew was coming
when you were a kid.

132
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,344
You just showed up at 8:00 a.m.

133
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,348
and they were like,
 "Put down your stuff. Go to the gym."

134
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,685
You're like, "God, I guess they're finally
going to kill us all. All right.

135
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,689
This is younger than I thought I would be
but we are pretty big assholes."

136
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,985
You get to the gym and the whole school
is sitting on the floor.

137
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,571
You're like, "What are we,
 about to graduate from Tuesday?"

138
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,741
My principal would always come out
to kick things off.

139
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:58,454
She'd be like, "Children, rather
than continue to teach you how to read,

140
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,332
we have cleared the entire day

141
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,710
for this random guy."

142
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,755
[imitating New York accent]
"I used to smoke crack!

143
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,342
As you seven and eight-year-olds
probably know,

144
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,679
freebasing is the greatest orgasm
known to man.

145
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,764
But I'm here to tell you there's hope.

146
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,766
I've been sober now two weeks.

147
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,227
Well, weekdays, not weekends.

148
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,355
Weekends, that's Nunzio's time."

149
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,401
I was once in assembly listening to a guy
talk about smoking crack.

150
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,405
My social studies teacher yelled at me,
"Sit up straight! Show some respect."

151
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,782
I was like, "He's smoking cocaine."

152
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,787
"Sit up straight"?
He's standing on a 45-degree angle.

153
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,374
Or, as junkies call it, first position.

154
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,792
[audience laughing]

155
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,877
I always got yelled at at assembly.

156
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,632
That's right. There was always assembly
and then, like, that second assembly

157
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,344
to yell at you for how you behaved
at the first assembly.

158
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,890
They'd be like, "Get in here! Sit down.

159
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,727
I want to talk about
what happened yesterday."

160
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,272
You're like eight years old,
"What's yesterday?"

161
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,987
"We invite a woman here
with homemade puppets

162
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,283
to teach you about bullying through skits

163
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,662
and you laugh at this woman?

164
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,041
We noticed you had all been bullying
each other

165
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,793
and making fun of everything constantly.

166
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,795
So we invite a woman

167
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,174
with straight gray hair, in a denim dress,

168
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:38,304
with a wrist-cast and homemade puppets
that all have the same voice

169
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,515
to teach you about bullying through skits,

170
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,769
and you, ha-ha-ha, laugh it up.

171
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,397
What was so funny about that woman?

172
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,899
I want to know.

173
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:55,279
What was so funny about
when she couldn't fit the box of puppets

174
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,531
back into the trunk of her Dodge Neon?

175
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,494
What was so hilarious
that you all ran to the windows?

176
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:07,458
Well, you all missed a valuable lesson
on the danger of cliques."

177
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,834
"What's a clique?"

178
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,046
"It's when a group of people
hang out together."

179
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,048
"Oh, you mean like having friends?"

180
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:18,594
"No, because these people make fun
of other people."

181
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,721
"Oh, you mean like having friends?"

182
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,139
[audience laughing]

183
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:28,896
The greatest assembly of them all,
once a year, Stranger Danger.

184
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,441
Yeah, the hottest ticket in town.

185
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,403
The Bruno Mars of assemblies.

186
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,491
You are gathered together as a school

187
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,120
and you are told never to talk
to an adult that you don't know

188
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,082
and you are told this
by an adult that you don't know.

189
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,962
We had the same Stranger Danger speaker
every year when I was a kid,

190
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,506
his name was Detective JJ Bittenbinder.

191
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,384
Go ahead and laugh.
His name is ridiculous.

192
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,302
That was his name.

193
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,555
It was JJ Bittenbinder.

194
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,557
He was from the Chicago Police Department.

195
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,393
He was a child homicide expert and...

196
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,353
-[audience is silent]
-Oh, gee.

197
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,021
[audience laughing]

198
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,776
Very sorry, Radio City,
 did that make you uncomfortable?

199
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,656
Well, guess what?
You're adults and he's not even here.

200
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,909
So try being seven years old

201
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,162
and you're sitting
five feet away from him.

202
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,872
He's still got blood on his shoes.

203
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,917
And he's looking at you
in the eye to tell you

204
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,713
for the first time
in your very young life

205
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,842
that some adults find you
incredibly attractive.

206
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,927
[audience laughing]

207
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,767
And they may just have to kill you
over it.

208
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,771
Okay, <i>c'est la vie,</i>
go be kids, go have fun.

209
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,982
Bittenbinder came every year.

210
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,444
By the way, Detective JJ Bittenbinder
wore three-piece suits.

211
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,488
He also wore a pocket watch.

212
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,990
Two years in a row, he wore a cowboy hat.

213
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,701
He also had a huge handlebar mustache.

214
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,372
None of that matters, but it's important
to me that you know that.

215
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,084
He did not look like his job description.

216
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,547
He looked like he should be the conductor
on a locomotive powered by confetti.

217
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,259
But, instead,
he made his living in murder.

218
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:29,391
He was the weirdest goddamn person
I ever saw in my entire life.

219
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,394
He was a man most acquainted with misery.

220
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,273
He could look at a child
and guess the price of their coffin.

221
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,359
[audience laughing]

222
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,070
That line never gets a laugh.

223
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,031
But once you write it,
it stays in the act forever.

224
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,495
So Bittenbinder came every year
with a program to teach us

225
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,665
about the violent world waiting for us
outside the school gym,

226
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,084
and that program was called Street Smarts!

227
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,088
"Time for Street Smarts
with Detective JJ Bittenbinder.

228
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,465
Shut up! You're all gonna die.
Street Smarts!"

229
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,676
That was the general tone.

230
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,428
He would give us tips to deal with crime.

231
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,722
I will share some of the tips
with you this evening.

232
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,475
"Okay, tip number one. Street Smarts!

233
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,646
Let's say a guy pulls a knife on you
to mug you."

234
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,567
You remember the scourge of muggings
when you were in second and third grade.

235
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,110
You know how a mugger thinks.

236
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,153
"Man, I need cash for drugs right now.

237
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,448
Hey, maybe that eight-year-old
with the goddamn <i>Aladdin </i>wallet

238
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,910
that only has blank photo laminate pages
in it will be able to help."

239
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,417
"Let's say a guy pulls a knife on you
to mug you. What do you do?

240
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,210
You go fumbling for your wallet.

241
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,045
And you go fumbling for your wallet.

242
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,299
Well, in that split-second,
that's when he's going to stab you.

243
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,342
So here's what you do.

244
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,178
You kids get yourselves a money clip.

245
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,348
Okay, you can get these
at any haberdashery.

246
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:58,272
You put a $50 bill in the money clip
then when a guy flashes a blade, you go,

247
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,441
'You want my money, go get it!'

248
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,318
Then you run the other direction."

249
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,070
And our teachers were like,
"Write that down."

250
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,822
[audience laughing]

251
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,118
We're like, "Buy a money clip.
Engraved, question mark?"

252
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,412
You go home to your parents.

253
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,875
"Hey, Dad. Can I have a silver money clip
with a $50 bill in it, please?

254
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,001
Don't worry.

255
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,003
I'm only going to chuck it into the gutter

256
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,297
and run away at the first sign of trouble.

257
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,759
The man with the mustache
told me to do it."

258
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,429
"Tip number two. Street Smarts!

259
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,893
Let's say a kidnapper throws you
 in the back of a trunk..."

260
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,354
This was at nine in the morning.

261
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,772
[audience laughing]

262
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,611
"Let's say a kidnapper throws you
in the back of a trunk.

263
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,321
Don't panic.

264
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,822
[chuckles]

265
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,826
Once you get your bearings...

266
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,665
find the carpet
that covers the taillight,

267
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,918
peel back the carpet, make a fist,

268
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,171
punch the taillight
out the back of the car,

269
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,508
thus creating a hole
in the back of the automobile,

270
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:13,973
then stick your little hand out
and wave to oncoming motorists

271
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,726
to let them know
that something hinky is going on."

272
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,688
Can you imagine driving behind that?

273
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,109
[imitating a thud]

274
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,447
I think they're turning left.

275
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,741
[audience laughing]

276
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,578
"Tip number three. Street Smarts!

277
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,582
You kids have no upper body strength."

278
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,918
And we were like, "We know but, hey."

279
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,589
"If some guy tries to grab you,
you can't fight him with fists.

280
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,049
So here's what you do.

281
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,095
You kids fall down on your back
and you kick upward at him.

282
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,514
That'll throw him off his rhythm."

283
00:16:55,931 --> 00:17:00,227
That was a big thing with Bittenbinder,
throwing pedophiles off their rhythm.

284
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:05,190
"He's not gonna know how to fight back
with two little sneakers coming at him."

285
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,276
[audience laughing]

286
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,987
"If the Lindbergh baby
had steel-toe boots,

287
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,365
he'd still be alive today. Street Smarts!"

288
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:18,078
Yeah, he was not a "spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down" kind of guy.

289
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:22,875
He was more like, "Brush your teeth.
Now, boom, orange juice. That's life."

290
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,007
Bittenbinder, he didn't want us
to not get kidnapped.

291
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,469
He wanted us to almost get kidnapped

292
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:39,183
and then fight the guy off using weird,
psych-out, back-room Chicago violence.

293
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,977
Like here's what he wanted
to see on the news.

294
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,521
"We're here with seven-year-old
John Mulaney

295
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,233
who fended off a kidnapper earlier today.
How did you do it, John?"

296
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,611
[imitating heavy Chicago accent]
"Well, thank ya for askin'.

297
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,905
I used the Bittenbinder method.

298
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,741
When I saw the perp approachin',

299
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,578
I chewed up a tab of Alka-Seltzer
I carry with me at all times.

300
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,664
This created
a foaming-at-the-mouth appearance

301
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,792
that made it look like I had rabies.

302
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,461
Now I've thrown him off his rhythm.

303
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,341
Then I reach into his jacket pocket
where I had planted a gram of coke

304
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,219
and I went, 'Whoa! What the fuck is this?'

305
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:20,599
And he goes, 'That's not mine.
I never seen that before.'

306
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,643
I go, 'Boo-hoo, it's in your jacket.

307
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,021
You're doing two to ten and your kids
are going into Social Services.'

308
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,981
Now he's cryin'!

309
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,195
Then I grab a telephone book
and I beat him on the torso with it.

310
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:38,951
'Cause as any Chicago cop will tell ya,
a phone book doesn't leave bruises."

311
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,996
"Well, that was
seven-year-old John Mulaney,

312
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,708
currently being sued
for police brutality."

313
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,168
[audience laughing]

314
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,589
Bittenbinder told me things
that haunt me to this day.

315
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,883
He came one year for assembly.

316
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,761
He goes, "Okay, when you get kidnapped..."
Not if, when.

317
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,638
[audience laughing]

318
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,600
"Okay, so when you get kidnapped,
the place where the guy grabs ya,

319
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,562
in the biz we call that
the primary location.

320
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,024
Okay. Your odds of coming back alive
from the primary location, about 60%.

321
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,486
But if you are taken
to a secondary location,

322
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,115
your odds of coming back alive
are slim to none."

323
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:25,914
I am 35 years old and I am still terrified
of secondary locations.

324
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,879
If I'm at a place,
I never want to go to another place.

325
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,798
I'll be at a wedding reception
and someone'll be like,

326
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,341
"You coming to the hotel bar after?

327
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,677
We're all gonna get drinks
and keep the party going."

328
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,098
I'm like, "Nah, sister. You're not
getting me to no secondary location.

329
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,975
You want it? Go get it!"

330
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,566
Street Smarts! Stay alert out there.

331
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,905
I thought I was going to be murdered
my entire childhood.

332
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,201
In high school people were like,
"What are your top three colleges?"

333
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,495
I was like, "Top three colleges?
I thought I would be dead in a trunk

334
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,706
with my hand hanging out
of the taillight by now."

335
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,919
I went to college. For the whole time.

336
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,296
Holy shit, right?

337
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,467
I just got a letter from my college,
which was fun 'cause mail, you know?

338
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,348
So I open up the letter and they said,
"Hey, John, it's college. You remember?"

339
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,309
I say, "Yes, of course."

340
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,772
And they said... How did they phrase it?
They said, "Give us some money!"

341
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,190
[audience laughing]

342
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,524
"As a gift!

343
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,652
We want a gift!

344
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,613
But only if it's money."

345
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,450
I found this peculiar.

346
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,121
You see, what had happened, New York,
was that when I was a student,

347
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,082
I had paid them tuition money.

348
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,544
Every semester, two semesters a year,
for four years.

349
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:59,383
I don't remember exactly what it was,
but rounding up, back in 1999 dollars,

350
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,552
it was about $15,000 a semester,

351
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,555
two semesters a year, for four years.

352
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,809
So it was about $30,000 a year
for four years.

353
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,646
So it was about $120,000, okay?

354
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:18,193
So roughly speaking,
I gave my college about $120,000.

355
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:24,283
Okay, so you might say
that I already gave them $120,000

356
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:29,538
and now you have the audacity
to ask me for more money.

357
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,873
What kind of a cokehead relative...

358
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,333
[audience cheering]

359
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:38,171
What kind of a cokehead relative
is my college?

360
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,257
You spent it already?

361
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,594
I gave you more money
than the Civil War cost

362
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,597
and you fucking spent it already?

363
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,269
Where's my money? I felt like
Jimmy Stewart in <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>

364
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,062
when he's screaming at his uncle Billy.

365
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,274
[as Jimmy Stewart] "Where's the money?
Where's that money, you fat motherfucker?

366
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,571
Where's my money? Stay down on the ground,
you motherfucker!"

367
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,197
That's not the dialogue.

368
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,616
But do you remember that scene
from <i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>

369
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,994
Great movie, Frank Capra, 1946.

370
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,789
A hundred and twenty thousand dollars!

371
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,791
I have friends I went to college with

372
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,045
and they're like, "You should donate
and be a good alumnus."

373
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,506
And they wear shirts that say "school"
and it's like, look...

374
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,384
if you're an adult still giving money
to your college,

375
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,929
college is a $120,000 hooker

376
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,515
and you are an idiot
who fell in love with her.

377
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,935
She's not going to do
anything else for you.

378
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,729
It's done.

379
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,150
In their letter they were like,

380
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,903
"Hey, it's been a while
since you've given us money."

381
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,615
I was like, "Hey, it's been a while
since you've housed and taught me.

382
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,993
I thought our transaction was over.

383
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,122
I gave you $120,000

384
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:59,878
and you gave me a weird cinder block room
with a <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> poster on it

385
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:05,008
and the first real heartbreak of my life,
and probably HPV,

386
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,135
and then we called it a day."

387
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,096
Probably.

388
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,680
[audience laughing]

389
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,724
Also, what did I get for my money?

390
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,101
What is college?

391
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,061
[babbles]

392
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,522
[audience laughing]

393
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,857
Stop going until we figure it out.

394
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,860
Because I went to college,
I have no idea what it was.

395
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:28,156
I went to college, I was 18 years old,
I looked like I was 11.

396
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,203
I lived like a goddamn Ninja Turtle.

397
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:43,088
I didn't drink water the entire time.

398
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,676
I lived on cigarettes
and alcohol and Adderall.

399
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,512
College was like a four-year game show

400
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,349
called<i> Do My Friends Hate Me</i>
<i>or Do I Just Need to Go to Sleep?</i>

401
00:23:54,683 --> 00:24:01,314
But instead of winning money,
you lose $120,000.

402
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:08,113
By the way, I agreed to give them
$120,000 when I was 17 years old.

403
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,490
With no attorney present.

404
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,784
That's illegal.

405
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:18,707
They tricked me. They tricked me like
 Brendan Dassey on <i>Making a Murderer.</i>

406
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,209
They tricked me like poor Brendan.

407
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,880
They pulled me out of high school.
I was in sweatpants, all confused.

408
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,757
Two guys in clip-on ties are like,

409
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:32,095
"Come on, son, do the right thing.
Sign here and be an English major."

410
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,306
And I was like, "Okay."

411
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,728
Yes, you heard me, an English major.

412
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:44,316
-I paid $120,000.
-[audience cheering]

413
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,650
How dare you clap?

414
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,361
How dare you clap for
the worst financial decision

415
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,738
I ever made in my life?

416
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:55,702
I paid $120,000 for someone
to tell me to go read Jane Austen

417
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,454
and then I didn't.

418
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,414
[audience laughing]

419
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:04,836
That's the worst use of 120 grand
I can possibly fathom.

420
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,798
Other than if you, like, bought
a duffel bag of fake cocaine.

421
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,259
No, I take it back.

422
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,969
That's a better use of the money,

423
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,515
'cause I know you'd be disappointed
when you open up the duffel bag

424
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,350
and you realize it's not real cocaine,

425
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,977
it's like powdered baby aspirin
or whatever they do.

426
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,688
But at least you have baby aspirin.

427
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,692
And maybe you have a baby
and one day your baby goes,

428
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,528
"Oh, my head," and you go,

429
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,739
"Hey, I've got something for you!
Come here, little guy."

430
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,368
And you dump it out on a mirror.
You make it nice for the baby.

431
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:40,664
You make it nice. You cut it up into lines
with your laundry card or whatever

432
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:44,417
and you make it nice,
and your baby takes his sippy-cup straw

433
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,295
and he holds it
in his little ravioli-sized baby fist

434
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,880
and he leans over--
[snorts]

435
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,799
and he snorts up the baby aspirin,

436
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:54,844
and he gets rid of his baby headache,
plus you<i> </i>get a duffel bag!

437
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,054
[audience laughing]

438
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:01,893
That is way better than walking across
a stage at graduation, hungover,

439
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:07,941
in a gown, to accept a certificate
for reading books that I didn't read.

440
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,609
[audience laughing]

441
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,405
Strolling across a stage,
the sun in my eyes,

442
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,242
my family watching
as I sweat vodka and ecstasy,

443
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:23,665
to receive a four-year degree
in a language that I already spoke.

444
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:28,712
[audience cheering]

445
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,550
I don't mean to sound down on donating.

446
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,759
[chuckles]

447
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,137
It's good to give to charities, you know.

448
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,431
My wife and I just gave
a bunch of stuff to Goodwill.

449
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,225
We were moving apartments,
we had a bunch of clothes and furniture,

450
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,685
so we made a whole day out of it.

451
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,230
We made these big piles of clothes,
we put the piles into these big boxes,

452
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,399
then we put the boxes
into the back of my car,

453
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,484
and then they stayed there
for four months.

454
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,905
And then one day my wife said, "Hey,
you took that stuff to Goodwill, right?"

455
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,700
And I said, "Of course I did!
On an unrelated note,

456
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,369
I'm going to walk out the front door
right now."

457
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,539
So then I had to speed to Goodwill
really fast.

458
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,791
It was charitable,
but it was also fast and violent,

459
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,710
because I was throwing boxes at people.

460
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,838
The boxes were so heavy
I couldn't even say what was in them.

461
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:15,550
I was like, "This one's shirts.
I got a bunch of shirts! Take 'em away!"

462
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,762
The guy tried to give me a big receipt.

463
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,015
He's like, "Take this receipt
for the clothing for your taxes."

464
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,100
How do I write that on my taxes?

465
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,729
"Dear IRS, please deduct
from my federal income tax

466
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:32,484
one XXL Billabong T-shirt from youth.
It was too big.

467
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:37,572
My mom said it could be a sleep shirt.
Please deduct this from my 2017 income."

468
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,617
That sleep shirt bullshit.

469
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,788
"Well, if it's too big
you can just wear it as a sleep shirt."

470
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,998
No, I get that, Mom,

471
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,503
but why don't we just tell our relatives
that I'm a four-year-old boy

472
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,924
and I don't wear a man's XXL T-shirt?

473
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,219
"Because we don't say that
when someone gives us a gift

474
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,137
because that would not be polite."

475
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,472
Oh, I get it.

476
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,476
So rather than violate
these meaningless politeness rules,

477
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:12,607
I'll just go to bed in a smock
like goddamn Ebenezer Scrooge.

478
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,611
Why don't you give me a candle
for looking in the mirror

479
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,613
and a floppy hat

480
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:24,869
and I'll tremble off to bed
in my long Victorian nightgown?

481
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,415
Was there ever even a ghost, Mother,

482
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:34,129
or was the dead Victorian girl you saw
just me all along?

483
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,383
[audience cheering]

484
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,638
So that's why you can't give to charity.

485
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,765
I'm kidding.

486
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,560
I like to throw an "I'm kidding"
 at the ends of jokes now,

487
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,854
in case the jokes
are ever played in court.

488
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,608
You ever heard a joke played in court?
Never goes well.

489
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,280
They're like, "'And that's why
you shouldn't give... to charity.'

490
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,909
Is that something you find funny,
Mr. Mulaney?"

491
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,371
Um... at the time.

492
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,123
[chuckles]

493
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,209
I found out recently
that jokes don't do well in court.

494
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,589
So, some friends of mine
were sued in college for property damage.

495
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:22,302
And they were guilty. And the lawsuit
dragged on for years and years

496
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,221
and eventually I got a call
when I was 28 years old.

497
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,890
It was my friend from college,
he said,

498
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,642
"Hey, that lawsuit with my neighbor
is still dragging on

499
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,688
and my neighbor just subpoenaed
all my emails from college

500
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,107
that mention him or the lawsuit."

501
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,860
And I said, "That's crazy.
But why are you calling me?"

502
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,738
And he said,
"Because you should be concerned."

503
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,947
[audience laughing]

504
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,493
He said, "I have an email here
from junior year where I wrote,

505
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,037
'Hey, guys, I'm going
 to miss practice tonight

506
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,582
because I have to meet with my neighbor
about that lawsuit thing.'

507
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:57,670
And you replied, 'Hey, do you want me
to kill that guy for you?

508
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:06,262
Because it sounds like he sucks
and I will totally kill that guy for you.

509
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,933
Okay. See you at improv practice.'"

510
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,559
[audience laughing]

511
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,561
Of all the sentences in that email

512
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,523
I would be ashamed to have read out loud
in a court of law,

513
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,568
I think the top one is
"See you at improv practice."

514
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,073
Strange, the passage of time.

515
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,619
I'm not that old. I'm 35, that is not old.

516
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:33,873
But I am in a new phase
right before old called "gross."

517
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,583
[audience laughing]

518
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,419
I never knew about this,
but I am now gross.

519
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,881
I am damp all the time.

520
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,050
I am damp now

521
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,219
and I will be damp later.

522
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,303
[chuckles]

523
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,472
Like the back of a dolphin, my back.

524
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,267
I am slick.

525
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:57,480
The butt part of my pants
is a little damp a lot

526
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,442
and I don't think it's anything serious...
but isn't it, though?

527
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,443
And...

528
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,154
I'll be sitting at a restaurant
and I'll get up and I'll be like,

529
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,991
"What did I sit in?"
And it was me.

530
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,244
I'm gross now.

531
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,663
I've been talking through burps.

532
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,666
I never used to do this.

533
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,044
When I was a kid and I wanted to burp,
I'd be like, "Silence!"

534
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,589
Blagh!

535
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,176
Now I'm trying to push 'em down
and muscle through 'em.

536
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,763
I'll be at dinner,
just doing the bread and the seltzer,

537
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,515
filling up like a hot air balloon,

538
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,309
and then I'm like...

539
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,811
[belches]
"Did you say you were going to Italy?

540
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,064
Because we have a travel--
She has a travel agent if--

541
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,482
[exhales]

542
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,235
I'm going to the kitchen,
does anyone need anything?

543
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,778
From the... [belches]

544
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,779
Anyone need anything?"

545
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,740
Just take a pause, John!

546
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,576
I'm gross.

547
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,328
I have hair on my shoulders now.

548
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,163
I don't even have a joke for that.

549
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,998
That's how much I hate that shit.

550
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,750
[audience laughing]

551
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,461
I was sitting up in bed a few weeks ago
like...

552
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,504
[groans]
You know, life.

553
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:08,426
And my wife was rubbing my shoulders,
which was very nice of her,

554
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,970
but then she started
singing to herself.

555
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,557
"Monkey, monkey, monkey man."

556
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,643
[audience laughing]

557
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,063
"Monkey, monkey, monkey man."

558
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,690
Not at me.

559
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,610
Not to be mean.

560
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,113
This was a song
 from deep in her subconscious.

561
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,159
I don't even think she was aware
she was singing it.

562
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,704
But it was certainly not the first time
she had sung it.

563
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,583
I don't know what my body is for

564
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,753
other than just taking my head
from room to room.

565
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,838
[audience laughing]

566
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,590
And it's not getting any better.

567
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:51,427
I'm 35, but I'm still like, "Hey,
when am I going to get big and strong?"

568
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,263
This is it.

569
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,182
It's just going to be this.

570
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,186
I'm like an iPhone, it's going to be
worse versions of this every year,

571
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:04,107
plus I get super hot in the middle
of the afternoon for no reason.

572
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,654
As I get older,
it's tough to not get grumpy.

573
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,613
It's tempting.

574
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,490
I get grumpy about some things.

575
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,701
Like, I can't listen to any new songs

576
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,705
because every new song is about
how tonight is the night

577
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,457
and how we only have tonight.

578
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,753
That is such 19-year-old horseshit.

579
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,381
I want to write songs
for people in their 30s

580
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,300
called "Tonight's No Good,
How About Wednesday?

581
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,805
Oh, You're in Dallas on Wednesday? Okay.

582
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,349
Well, Let's Just Not See Each Other
for Eight Months

583
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,352
And It Doesn't Matter at All."

584
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,232
[audience cheering]

585
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,987
I'm trying to stay nice though,
because when I was a kid,

586
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,741
I was raised that you should be nice
to everyone in every situation

587
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,367
because you never know their story.

588
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,828
But now, at the end of my life,

589
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,040
I don't know,

590
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,001
because a lot of people
don't seem that nice

591
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,003
and they seem to be doing fine
in the world.

592
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,089
Or maybe they have different definitions
of what it means to be nice.

593
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,884
That's something you figure out
as you get older and meet new people.

594
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,011
Not everyone thinks
the same things are nice.

595
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,263
You learn that especially
when you get jobs.

596
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:21,434
I had a very weird job in my mid-20s
for about four and a half years.

597
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,729
I was a writer right across the street
over at <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

598
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,315
-It was very exciting. Yeah.
-[audience cheering]

599
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,816
It was great. I loved it.

600
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,903
If you haven't seen the show,
you gotta check it out.

601
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,698
They have a host and a musical guest.
Oh, my God, you're going to love it.

602
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,533
Real quick tangent.

603
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:41,537
Okay, my favorite host ever
introducing a musical guest was this.

604
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,958
The host was Sir Patrick Stewart,
the great Sir Patrick Stewart,

605
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,961
and this is how he introduced
the musical guest.

606
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,590
"Ladies and gentlemen,
Salt-N-Pepa!"

607
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,175
[audience laughing]

608
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,594
Like he was surprised by Pepa.

609
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,055
Like minutes before they'd been,

610
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,641
"Sir Patrick, we can't find
Pepa anywhere."

611
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,352
And he's like,
"If we must go on with Salt alone,

612
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,522
we will go on with Salt alone!"

613
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,901
And they were like, "Three, two, one,"
and Pepa burst through the door

614
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,779
and he's like, "Ladies and gentlemen,
Salt and... what's this?

615
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,241
Pepa!"

616
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,413
Famous people are weird as shit.

617
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,041
They're all weird.

618
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,876
Your suspicions are correct.

619
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,712
And they would all come in
to <i>Saturday Night Live</i>

620
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,298
and they'd have to meet with me
because I was a little rat writer

621
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,134
and they'd have to talk
about the sketches.

622
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,928
They'd sit on my office couch
that had like bed bugs and stuff.

623
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,263
It was great.

624
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,348
Like, they were famous,
but it was my couch.

625
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,475
It'd be like if you went into
your childhood bedroom

626
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,018
and Joe DiMaggio was sitting there.

627
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,897
Yeah, he's Joe DiMaggio, he's a legend,
he had sex with Marilyn Monroe,

628
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,066
but only <i>you </i>know where the bathroom is.

629
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,818
[audience laughing]

630
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,779
Everyone always wants to know
if famous people are nice.

631
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,905
Like Mick Jagger.

632
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,407
He came in to host the show.

633
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,701
My friends were all like, "Is he nice?"

634
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,077
No!

635
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,496
Or maybe he is...

636
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,123
for his version of life.

637
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,375
Because he has a very different life.

638
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,960
He's Mick Jagger.

639
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,045
That's his name.

640
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:19,427
He's played to stadiums of 20,000 people
cheering for him like he's a god

641
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,012
for 50 years.

642
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,764
That must change you as a person.

643
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,767
If you do that for 50 years,
you're never again going to be like,

644
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,437
"Um, does anyone have
a laptop charger I could borrow?"

645
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,858
None of that bullshit way
we all have to talk to get through life.

646
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,068
[in plaintive voice]
"Hi. Knock, knock. Sorry."

647
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,820
That's how I walk into rooms.

648
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,532
I am 35 years old, I am six feet tall.

649
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,160
I lower myself, I go,
"Hi. Knock, knock."

650
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,996
I say "knock, knock" out loud.

651
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,792
Mick Jagger didn't talk like that.
Mick Jagger talked like this.

652
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:57,298
He'd go, "Yes! No! Yes!"

653
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,928
I pitched him a joke and he went,
"Not funny!"

654
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,013
[audience laughing]

655
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,809
I mean, people say that on the internet,
but never to your face

656
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:14,523
does a British billionaire
in leather pants go, "Not funny!"

657
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,195
I spent two hours alone with Mick Jagger
that week.

658
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:22,615
We were writing song lyrics, it was for
a fake song in a comedy sketch.

659
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,159
And he was sitting there,
and we came to one point and he goes,

660
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,538
"All right, 'Let's all go to the picnic,
let's all have a drink.'

661
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,416
Let's see, what rhymes with drink?"

662
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:33,918
And I said...

663
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,378
"Think?"

664
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,380
And Mick Jagger said,

665
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,382
"No!"

666
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,467
[audience laughing]

667
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,846
And then I said,

668
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,807
"Sink?"

669
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,559
And Mick Jagger said...

670
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,520
"Yeah!"

671
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:57,233
And I was like, "Motherfucker,
is this how you write songs?

672
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,654
Just one word at a time
with verbal abuse?"

673
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,824
"All right, 'I can't get no...'"

674
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,951
-Happiness?
-"No!"

675
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,537
-Satisfaction?
-"Yeah!

676
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,331
All right! Next sentence!

677
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,044
Space bar. Indent. Space bar."

678
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,840
Mick Jagger would go like this,
"Diet Coke!"

679
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,675
And one would appear in his hand.

680
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,927
Now that's not nice, right?

681
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,305
The way I was raised,
you're supposed to say,

682
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,933
"May I please have a Diet Coke, please?"
And then maybe you will get one.

683
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,228
And I bet all of you were taught
to say please and thank you.

684
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,606
But if all of us could go, "Diet Coke!"
and one would appear in our hand,

685
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,109
we'd do it all day long.

686
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,237
Even if you don't like Diet Coke,
you'd just summon 'em

687
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,614
so you could chuck 'em at oncoming cars.

688
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,076
Famous people are often rude

689
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,537
because they're used to getting things
really quickly.

690
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,331
I bet a lot of us are pretty polite.

691
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,834
But as soon as we get things quickly,
we start to get ruder and ruder.

692
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,504
Look at technology, it's faster than ever
and we're ruder than ever.

693
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,675
People walk around on the phone now,
"Hello? You still there? Lost him."

694
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,012
And that's it.
No follow-through with that guy.

695
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,099
Fifty years ago, if you were on
the telephone with your friend

696
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,812
and suddenly the line just went dead,
that meant your friend was murdered.

697
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,816
The phone used to be a big deal.

698
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,777
It was a long, polite process.

699
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,447
Back in the 1940s,
the phone was like a wood box...

700
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,157
with a thing on it. I don't know.

701
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,287
It had its own room. You'd go,
"That's the phone's room!"

702
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,416
And it was expensive.
You'd wait all week to make your call.

703
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,626
"It's almost Tuesday!"

704
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,338
And then you'd take the cup on the string
or whatever...

705
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,384
There weren't even numbers.
You'd just go, "Hello? Anyone?

706
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,552
[yells]
Anyone in the world?"

707
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,975
Then you'd go,
"Operator, ring me Neptune 5-117."

708
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,312
And the operator was a real person
that you had to be nice to.

709
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,564
She'd be like, "One moment, please.

710
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,485
I'm putting wires
into a board filled with holes

711
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,823
to move the voices around,
'cause it is the '40s."

712
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,826
And it took like 90 minutes.

713
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,413
Now people just drive around
screaming at their phones like...

714
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,707
-Call home!
-"Calling the mobile for Tom."

715
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,543
Not fucking Tom!

716
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,254
[imitating Mick Jagger]
Not funny!

717
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,673
[audience laughing]

718
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,719
Everything was slower back in the old days
'cause they didn't have enough to do,

719
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,139
so they had to slow things down
to fill the time.

720
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,349
I don't know if you read history,

721
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,687
but back then people would wake up and go,
"God, it's the old times."

722
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,064
[audience laughing]

723
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,108
"Shit, I gotta wear all those layers.

724
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,903
There's no Zyrtec or nothing.
Okay, we gotta...

725
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:53,492
We gotta think of some
weird slow activities to fill the day."

726
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,910
And they did.

727
00:40:55,786 --> 00:41:02,751
Have you ever seen old film from the past
of people just waving at a ship?

728
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,547
[audience laughing]

729
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,718
What if I called you now to do that?

730
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,179
Hey, what are you doing
Monday at 10:00 a.m.?

731
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,432
All right, there's a Norwegian Cruise Line
leaving for Martinique.

732
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:20,811
Here's my plan, you and me get
very dressed up, including hats,

733
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:25,191
and then we wave handkerchiefs at it
until it disappears over the horizon.

734
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,027
No, I don't know anyone on the ship.

735
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,279
[audience laughing]

736
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,908
Everything is too fast now
and totally unreasonable.

737
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,703
The world is run by computers,
the world is run by robots

738
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,832
and we spend most of our day telling them
that we're not a robot

739
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,960
just to log on and look at our own stuff.

740
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,796
All day long.

741
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,216
May I see my stuff, please?

742
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,635
[grumbles]

743
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,679
"I smell a robot.

744
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,391
Prove, prove, prove.

745
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,062
Prove to me you're not a robot.

746
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,024
Look at these curvy letters.

747
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,111
Much curvier than most letters,
wouldn't you say?

748
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,906
No robot could ever read these.

749
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,492
You look, mortal, if ye be.

750
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,663
You look and then you type
what you think you see.

751
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,000
Is it an "E" or is it a "3"?

752
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,003
That's up to ye.

753
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,799
The passwords of past
you've correctly guessed,

754
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,510
but now it's time for the robot test!

755
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,974
I've devised a question
no robot could ever answer.

756
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,978
Which of these pictures does not have
a stop sign in it?"

757
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,437
Fucking what?

758
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,232
[audience cheering]

759
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,446
You spend most of your day telling a robot
that you're not a robot.

760
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,073
Think about that for two minutes

761
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,534
and tell me you don't want
to walk into the ocean.

762
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,122
I just like old-fashioned things.

763
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,208
I was in Connecticut recently,
doing white people stuff.

764
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,585
[audience cheering]

765
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,794
Yeah.

766
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,546
One day...

767
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,675
Well, it doesn't matter why,
but I was sitting in a gazebo, and...

768
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,135
[audience laughing]

769
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,470
there was a plaque on the gazebo

770
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:23,934
and it said, "This gazebo was built
by the town in 1863."

771
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,479
That is in the middle of the Civil War.

772
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,984
And the whole town built a gazebo.

773
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,903
What was that town meeting like?

774
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,364
"All right, everyone,
first order of business,

775
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,242
we have all the telegrams from Gettysburg
with the war dead.

776
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,160
Let's see here.

777
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,954
Okay, everyone's husband
and brother and... everyone died.

778
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,373
Okay. Josiah, you had something?"

779
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,625
"Yes, I do.

780
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,170
How'd you like to be indoors
and out of doors all at once?

781
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,090
Ever walk into the park with
your betrothed and it starts to rain,

782
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,634
but you still want to hold hands?

783
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,928
Well, may I introduce you to,
and my condolences again to everyone,

784
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,639
the gazebo!"

785
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,973
[audience laughing]

786
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:06,185
Building a gazebo during the Civil War,

787
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,021
that'd be like doing stand-up comedy now.

788
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,233
[audience laughing and applauding]

789
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,277
Yes.

790
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,076
Thank you for clapping
at my political gazebo material.

791
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,536
I'm very brave.

792
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,457
I've never really cared about politics.

793
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,834
Never talked about 'em much.

794
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:39,885
But then, last November,
the strangest thing happened.

795
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,053
[audience laughing]

796
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,140
Now, I don't know
if you've been following the news,

797
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,602
but I've been keeping my ears open

798
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:53,691
and it seems like everyone everywhere
is super-mad about everything

799
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,025
all the time.

800
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,278
I try to stay a little optimistic,

801
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,281
even though I will admit,
things are getting pretty sticky.

802
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,159
Here's how I try to look at it,

803
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,536
and this is just me,

804
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,955
this guy being the president,

805
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,792
it's like there's a horse
loose in a hospital.

806
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,296
It's like there's a horse
loose in a hospital.

807
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,174
I think eventually
everything's going to be okay,

808
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,428
but I have no idea
what's going  to happen next.

809
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,223
And neither do any of you,
and neither do your parents,

810
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,768
because there's a horse
loose in the hospital.

811
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,729
It's never happened before,

812
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,231
no one knows what the horse
is going to do next,

813
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,066
least of all the horse.

814
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,736
He's never been in a hospital before,

815
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,739
he's as confused as you are.

816
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,491
There's no experts.

817
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,534
[audience cheering]

818
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,036
They try to find experts on the news.

819
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,790
They're like, "We're joined now by a man
that once saw a bird in the airport."

820
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,001
Get out of here with that shit!

821
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,504
We've all seen a bird in the airport.

822
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,757
This is a horse

823
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,092
loose in a hospital.

824
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,513
When a horse is loose in a hospital,
you got to stay updated.

825
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,725
So all day long you walk around,
"What'd the horse do?"

826
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,771
The updates, they're not always bad.

827
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,564
Sometimes they're just odd.

828
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,401
It'll be like,
"The horse used the elevator?"

829
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,070
[audience laughing]

830
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,159
I didn't know he knew how to do that.

831
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,911
[audience laughing]

832
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,665
The creepiest days are when
you don't hear from the horse at all.

833
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,667
[audience laughing]

834
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,799
You're down in the operating room
like, "Hey, has anyone..."

835
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,803
[audience laughing]

836
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,012
"Has anyone heard--"

837
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,181
[imitates clopping hooves]

838
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,351
Those are those quiet days
when people are like,

839
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,062
"It looks like the horse
has finally calmed down."

840
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,397
And then ten seconds later
the horse is like,

841
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,274
"I'm gonna run towards the baby incubators

842
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,776
and smash 'em with my hooves.

843
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,903
I've got nice hooves and a long tail,
I'm a horse!"

844
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,365
That's what I thought you'd say,
you dumb fucking horse.

845
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,658
And then...

846
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,785
[audience cheering]

847
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,036
Then...

848
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,332
Then you go to brunch with people
and they're like,

849
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,585
"There shouldn't be a horse
in the hospital."

850
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,547
And it's like, "We're well past that."

851
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,341
Then other people are like,

852
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,385
"If there's gonna be a horse
 in the hospital,

853
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,886
I'm going to say the N-word on TV."

854
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,473
And those don't match up at all.

855
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,270
And then, for a second, it seemed like
maybe we could survive the horse,

856
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,732
and then, 5,000 miles away,
a hippo was like,

857
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,818
"I have a nuclear bomb

858
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,530
and I'm going to blow up the hospital!"

859
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,533
And before we could say anything,
 the horse was like,

860
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:54,538
"If you even fucking look at the hospital,
I will stomp you to death with my hooves.

861
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,040
I dare you to do it.
I want you to do it.

862
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:01,587
I want you to do it so I can stomp you
with my hooves, I'm so fucking crazy."

863
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,756
"You think you're fucking crazy,
I'm a fucking hippopotamus.

864
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:09,261
I live in a fucking lake of mud.
I'm fucking crazy."

865
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:14,266
And all of us are like, "Okay."

866
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,686
Like poor Andy Cohen
at those goddamn reunions.

867
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,939
"Okay."

868
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,192
And then, for a second, we were like,

869
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,362
"Maybe the horse-catcher
will catch the horse."

870
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,824
And then the horse is like,
"I have fired the horse-catcher."

871
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,827
[audience laughing]

872
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,705
He can do that?

873
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,251
That shouldn't be allowed
no matter who the horse is.

874
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,546
I don't remember that in <i>Hamilton.</i>

875
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,257
[audience laughing]

876
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,637
Sometimes, if you make fun of the horse,
people will get upset.

877
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,848
These are the people
 that opened the door for the horse.

878
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,851
I don't judge anyone.

879
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,519
But sometimes I ask people.

880
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,440
I go, "Hey, how come you opened the door
for the horse?"

881
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,319
And they go,
"Well, the hospital was inefficient!"

882
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,616
[audience laughing]

883
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,203
Or sometimes they go,

884
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,455
"If you're so mad at the horse,
how come you weren't mad

885
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,666
when the last guy did <i>this</i>
three and a half years ago?

886
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,167
You're beating up on the horse

887
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,878
when the last guy essentially did
the same thing five years ago."

888
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,422
First off, get out of here
with your facts.

889
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,133
You're like the kid at the sleepover
 who, after midnight, is like,

890
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,343
"It's tomorrow now!"

891
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,012
Get the fuck out of here
with your technicalities.

892
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,890
Just 'cause you're accurate
does not mean you're interesting.

893
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,309
That was fun when we watched
<i>Beetlejuice </i>tonight.

894
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,353
"Don't you mean last night?
It's after midnight."

895
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,731
Why don't you get your sleeping bag
and get out of my house!

896
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:49,319
Take your EpiPen, take your goddamn EpiPen
and get out of my house!

897
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,078
But when people say, "How come
you were never mad at the last guy?"

898
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,872
I say,
"Because I wasn't paying attention."

899
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,042
I used to pay less attention

900
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,711
before it was a horse.

901
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,006
Also, I thought the last guy
was pretty smart,

902
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,300
and he seemed good at his job,
and I'm lazy by nature.

903
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,593
[audience cheering]

904
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,387
I'm lazy by nature too.

905
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,224
So I don't check up on people
when they seem okay at their job.

906
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:23,186
You may think that's an ignorant answer
but it's not, it's a great answer.

907
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,814
If you left your baby
with your mother tonight,

908
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,775
you're not going to race home
and check the nanny cam.

909
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,571
But if you leave your baby
with Gary Busey...

910
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,032
[audience laughing]

911
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,165
And now there's Nazis again.

912
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,751
[audience laughing]

913
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,379
When I was a kid
Nazis was just an analogy you would use

914
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,674
to decimate your child
during an argument at the dinner table.

915
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,885
[audience laughing]

916
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,763
Now there's new Nazis.

917
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,516
I don't care for these new Nazis
and you may quote me on that.

918
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:07,397
These new Nazis, "Jews are the worst,
Jews ruin everything,

919
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,524
and Jews try to take over your life."

920
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:13,779
It's like, "You know what, motherfucker?
My wife is Jewish.

921
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,740
I know all that,
how do you know all that?"

922
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,785
[audience laughing]

923
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,664
I'm allowed to make fun of my wife.

924
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,666
I asked her and she said yes.

925
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,710
[audience laughing]

926
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,088
I've been married
for about three and a half years now

927
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,048
-and I was going out on tour...
-[cheering]

928
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,466
Thank you very much.

929
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,552
And I love and respect my wife very much.

930
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,305
So I said to her, "We've been married
for three and a half years."

931
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,473
And she knew that.

932
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,311
I said, "Do you mind if I still make fun
of you on stage?

933
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,481
And my wife said,
"Yeah, you can make fun of me.

934
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,652
But just don't say that I'm a bitch
and that you don't like me."

935
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:59,574
I was like, "The bar is so much lower
than I ever imagined.

936
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,826
That's it?"

937
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,247
Also, I wouldn't say that.
What kind of show would that even be?

938
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,790
Hello.

939
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,000
My wife is a bitch!

940
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,295
And I don't like her!

941
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,549
That's like a support group
for men in crisis,

942
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:19,177
with keynote speakers
Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin.

943
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,304
[audience laughing]

944
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,683
Also, I would never say that,
not even as a joke,

945
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,769
that my wife is a bitch
and I don't like her. That is not true.

946
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,565
My wife is a bitch
and I like her so much.

947
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,482
[audience cheering]

948
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:37,237
She is a dynamite, five-foot, Jewish bitch
and she's the best.

949
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,365
She and I have totally different styles.

950
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,409
When my wife walks down the street,

951
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:46,663
she does not give a shit what anyone
thinks of her in any situation.

952
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,666
She's my hero.
When I walk down the street,

953
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,796
I need everybody, all day long,
 to like me so much.

954
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,882
It's exhausting.

955
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,593
My wife said that walking around with me

956
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:03,763
is like walking around with someone
who's running for mayor of nothing.

957
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,932
[audience laughing]

958
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,352
My wife and I went to Best Buy
to get a TV.

959
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,479
We didn't end up getting the TV.

960
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,774
I was afraid that the Best Buy guy
was going to be mad at me,

961
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,153
so I bought an HDMI cable.

962
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,030
[audience laughing]

963
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,616
I go to the register with Anna,
 my wife's name Anna,

964
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,160
she's standing next to me,
I hand the guy the HDMI cable.

965
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,872
He takes it, he scans it, he says,
"Do you have a Best Buy Rewards card?"

966
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,958
And I said, "No, I wish!"

967
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,085
[audience laughing]

968
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:41,593
And then my wife said,
"Jesus Christ!"

969
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:47,015
And fully walked away from me.
Walked all the way to the laser printers

970
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,893
and just stood there, <i>Blair Witch </i>style.

971
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,272
And I'm still up at the register like...

972
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,359
[audience laughing]

973
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:03,281
And the guy goes,
"Do you want a Best Buy Rewards card?"

974
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,910
And I said, "No."

975
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,248
Even though I had just said
it was my greatest wish in life.

976
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,876
I was hoping he'd believe me,
that it was secretly my great wish

977
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,713
but that I'm in an abusive marriage
with little Miss Jesus Christ over here

978
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,549
so I can't ask for the things I want
in public

979
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,261
but at home, at night,
we argue about it and I'm like,

980
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,180
"You'll see! One day
I'm going to leave you

981
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,475
and I'm going to get
that Best Buy Rewards card."

982
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,769
She's like, "Jesus Christ,

983
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:38,066
you're never going to get
that Best Buy Rewards card!"

984
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:43,154
My wife is Jewish, as I said,
I was raised Catholic.

985
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,740
We have differences
in our religious upbringings

986
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,409
and we realized this recently.

987
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,495
Not with our kids,
because we don't have any kids.

988
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,790
People always ask us, "Are you going
to have kids?" and we say no.

989
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,835
And then they go, "Never?
You're never going to have kids?"

990
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,712
Look, I don't know "never."

991
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,966
Fourteen years ago, I smoked cocaine
the night before my college graduation.

992
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:07,053
Now I'm afraid to get a flu shot.
People change.

993
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,888
[audience laughing]

994
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,018
But we don't have any kids now
and it's great.

995
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,853
We have a dog though.

996
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,064
We have a four-year-old French bulldog.
Her name is Petunia.

997
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,733
[audience cheering]

998
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,529
The idea of people applauding

999
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,407
for that little monster.

1000
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,995
Just... I mean, I would never tell her
that you applauded.

1001
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,122
It would go right to her ego,

1002
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:39,044
that little monster
who just rubs her vulva on the carpet

1003
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,338
while staring at me in the eye.

1004
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,715
[imitates dog snarling]

1005
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,179
I know her vulva itches
and she needs to rub it,

1006
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,264
but the thumping of the back paws...

1007
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,017
It's upsetting.

1008
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,313
I'm just kidding.
I love Petunia very much.

1009
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,899
She's one of my most favorite people
I've ever met in my life.

1010
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:04,527
Petunia likes to be very social
but she can't walk very far

1011
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,447
because she has a flat face,
so she can't breathe by design.

1012
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,159
But she wants to go out and meet people
but we can't walk her for that long.

1013
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,119
Anyway, this is a long-winded way
of saying

1014
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,330
that we bought a stroller for our dog.

1015
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,539
[audience laughing]

1016
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,417
My wife and I walk around New York City

1017
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,546
pushing Petunia the French bulldog
in a stroller,

1018
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,175
and it's a big stroller
and it has a big black hood.

1019
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,470
And people lean in to see the baby.

1020
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,430
[audience laughing]

1021
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:37,894
And instead they see a gargoyle
breathing like Chris Christie.

1022
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:41,398
[imitates dog snarling]

1023
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,235
Her paws are sweating.

1024
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,155
We're like, "He's sick."

1025
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,365
[chuckles]

1026
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,953
But religion came up with Petunia
recently.

1027
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,081
My wife and I were talking
about cute things

1028
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,874
that Petunia could be involved in.

1029
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,962
And I said, "What if we got
like a Biblical painting done

1030
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,630
with Petunia in it?"

1031
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,049
And my wife is like,
"That would be so cute.

1032
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,051
We should do like <i>The Last Supper."</i>

1033
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,429
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, that would be so cute.

1034
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,974
We should do all different French
Bulldogs as the different Apostles."

1035
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:20,145
And my wife was like, "We should have
Petunia in the middle where Jesus is,

1036
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,354
in front of the turkey."

1037
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,481
And I was like,
"Wait, what did you just say?"

1038
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,317
[audience laughing]

1039
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,408
"Did you say the turkey?"

1040
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,788
And my wife said, "Yeah, why?"

1041
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,249
And I said...

1042
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,170
I said, "Would you just answer me
one question?

1043
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,964
Do you think

1044
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,094
that in da Vinci's <i>The Last Supper</i>

1045
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,055
that Jesus

1046
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,725
of Nazareth

1047
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,146
is sitting in front of a turkey?"

1048
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,315
[audience laughing]

1049
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:10,236
And my wife said, "Yes, I do,"
and I said, "Thank you for your honesty.

1050
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,282
Would you just--
Just one more follow-up question.

1051
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:20,955
So then what do you think
they're celebrating?"

1052
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,458
[audience laughing]

1053
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,586
"What do you think...

1054
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,173
those guys are celebrating?"

1055
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,343
She said, "Okay, I don't get this shit
because I wasn't raised Catholic

1056
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,429
and I'm fucking glad I wasn't
because it's a fucked-up organization."

1057
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,265
I said, "No. We all know that."

1058
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,351
[audience laughing]

1059
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,646
"But what do you think

1060
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,399
those guys are celebrating?"

1061
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,277
And my wife looked at the floor.

1062
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,406
And then she looked at me and said,
"Thanksgiving."

1063
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,991
[audience laughing]

1064
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:02,080
My family went to church
every Sunday when I was a kid.

1065
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,958
My wife cannot believe this.
She's like, "You went every Sunday?"

1066
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,210
-"Yes."
-"What if you were out of town?"

1067
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,920
I was like, "They have them out of town."

1068
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,549
I don't know if you grew up
going to church and now you don't,

1069
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,883
but it can be a weird existence.

1070
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,010
Because I like to make fun of it
all day long,

1071
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,804
but then if someone like Bill Maher says,

1072
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,348
"Who would believe in a man
up in the sky?"

1073
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,934
I'm like, "My mommy, so shut the fuck up!"

1074
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,019
[audience cheering]

1075
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,438
"Stop calling my mommy dumb."

1076
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:33,027
If you grew up going to church
and you have adult friends that didn't,

1077
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,531
they have a lot of questions.
"Wait, so they forced you to go?"

1078
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,367
Yeah, I was five,
I was forced to go everywhere.

1079
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,912
No kid is just going to church.

1080
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,750
Riding by on his Huffy, like,
"Whoa! What's this place?

1081
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,170
A weird Byzantine temple
with green carpeting

1082
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,965
where everyone has bad breath
and I wear clothes that I hate

1083
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,883
on one of the mornings
of my two days off?

1084
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:56,801
Let's do this."

1085
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,219
[audience laughing]

1086
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,346
But people get very suspicious.

1087
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,682
They're like,
"What did they say in there?

1088
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,185
What do they do?
What did they tell you?"

1089
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,980
I don't know, it was an hour.

1090
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,775
That should be the slogan
for the Catholic church.

1091
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,653
"It's an hour!"

1092
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:20,408
It's a few stories,
normally about a guy with a crazy name

1093
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,243
whose wife has a normal name.

1094
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:26,205
"In that town lives Zepheriuses
and his wife Rachel."

1095
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,874
How come she gets to be Rachel?

1096
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,711
"On their way to Galilee,
Jesus met Enos and Barak

1097
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,588
and their wives, Kylie and Lauren."

1098
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,799
And you're like, "What?
That's the same joke twice."

1099
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,761
[audience laughing]

1100
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,471
Then there's the homily.

1101
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:45,850
If you're not Catholic, the homily
is when the priest does a book report

1102
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,771
that is also stand-up comedy.

1103
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,147
[audience laughing]

1104
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:56,194
It normally begins with a charming
anecdote that is fake and never happened.

1105
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,658
"A woman was at a shopping mall
with her young son."

1106
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,242
What was the woman's name?

1107
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:07,080
Hey, Father, what was the name
of the shopping mall?

1108
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,583
Your story doesn't have a lot of details.

1109
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:17,006
You only had a week to work on it
and you've had the book for 2,000 years.

1110
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,758
[audience laughing]

1111
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,595
And then there's some songs
normally sung by an usher.

1112
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,889
One of these ushers
that opens the door for you

1113
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,600
and gives you the pamphlet
and they all look like Marco Rubio.

1114
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,102
[audience laughing]

1115
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:32,480
That guy will get up
and sing into the microphone.

1116
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,440
He's not a singer...

1117
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,110
'cause he's not good at it.

1118
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:41,322
But he tries. He sings the Psalms.

1119
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,657
Remember the Psalms?

1120
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:48,663
They're not songs 'cause
 they don't rhyme and they're not good.

1121
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,876
They're perfectly named,
they're not quite songs, they're Psalms.

1122
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,170
It's a word you're meant to mishear.

1123
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,132
"I'm gonna sing a Psalm today."

1124
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,842
What's that? You're gonna sing a song?

1125
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,552
"Yeah. It's a Psalm."

1126
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,806
And then these guys get up
in front of everyone and they're like...

1127
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:11,519
<i>♪ The bread of God is bread ♪</i>

1128
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:17,066
<i>♪ He will bring us bread ♪</i>

1129
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,070
<i>♪ No one but the one from Jericho ♪</i>

1130
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:27,869
<i>♪ Can bring bread to bread ♪</i>

1131
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,204
And then the guy goes like this.

1132
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,458
[audience laughing]

1133
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,918
And that means
we're supposed to sing our lines,

1134
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,213
except we don't know our lines for shit.

1135
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,383
Where's that pamphlet?
Where's that pamphlet they gave us?

1136
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,261
Move the jackets.

1137
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:46,554
Ah-ha-ha!

1138
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:51,517
<i>♪ The bread of bread is bread ♪</i>

1139
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:55,855
<i>♪ Bread is God is bread ♪</i>

1140
01:02:55,938 --> 01:03:00,693
It's just dads singing so loud,

1141
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,988
thinking that'll somehow get their kids
to sing.

1142
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:08,951
<i>♪ Bread is God is bread ♪</i>

1143
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,413
<i>♪ Is God is bread ♪</i>

1144
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,540
<i>♪ Is God is bread... ♪</i>

1145
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,083
"Sing, goddamn it!"

1146
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:22,298
My dad once grabbed me by the shirt
and lifted me up during church

1147
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:25,092
and said, "God can't hear you."
