00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,838
(<i> birds twittering</i> )

2
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,822
(<i> watery voice</i> ):
Ouch.

3
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,239
Wake up.

4
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,825
Who's there?

5
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,743
Naomi.

6
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,871
Come back later.

7
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,288
You know
what I think?

8
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,875
I think you're scared
of the tree monster.

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:56,015
I'm not scared of any tree
monster, Miss Wildman,

10
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:00,060
but, as you know,
I need my beauty sleep.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,688
I'm sorry I woke you,
but we have a mission.

12
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,565
You and your missions.

13
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,484
Lucky for you,
your old pal Flotter

14
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,487
has everything ready.
Follow me.

15
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,616
I've laid a trap.

16
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,036
When he climbs this tree,
he'll trip the alarm.

17
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,662
(<i> bells jangling</i> )

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,749
Tree monsters are terrified
of high-pitched noises.

19
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,000
I never heard that.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,877
Ah!
It's a well-known fact.

21
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,880
The bell will scare him
high into those branches

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,340
where counterweights
will bend the treetop

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,301
till it springs back,
catapulting him pondward

24
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,469
and splash.

25
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,764
He'll sink like a log.

26
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,891
But, Flotter...
logs float.

27
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,019
Details, details.

28
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,645
That is a terrible plan.

29
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,773
It's him!

30
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,525
The name's Trevis,
and you are...?

31
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,737
Flotter. Flotter T. Water III.

32
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,948
Well, of course you are, drippy.

33
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,365
You.

34
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,953
Naomi Wildman, but my
friends call me Naomi.

35
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,705
I don't recognize your element.

36
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,582
You're not earth or water

37
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,917
or plasma.

38
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,167
I'm human.

39
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,335
Where do you live?

40
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,129
In space.

41
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,881
Nobody lives in space.

42
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:11,924
She does...

43
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,968
on a starship
called<i> Voyager.</i>

44
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,636
I'm an explorer.

45
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,887
Really?

46
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,681
An explorer.

47
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,891
Timber.

48
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,267
What's that like?

49
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,312
Well, you know--
space battles with aliens,

50
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,605
strange anomalies.

51
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,817
May I visit your starship?

52
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,070
Well, I'll have
to ask my mom.

53
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,114
You know, for a monster,
you're very polite.

54
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,244
That's because
I'm<i> not</i> a monster.

55
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,496
(<i> bells jangling</i> )

56
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,956
You see that?

57
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,749
I'm not scared one bit.

58
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,128
My bark is worse than my bite.

59
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,797
Maybe we jumped to
conclusions about him.

60
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,966
Well, he may not
be a monster,

61
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,343
but he is stealing
my water with his roots.

62
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,594
Stealing!

63
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:02,307
Absurd! Why, I ought
to dry you out.

64
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,225
And I ought to chop
you down.

65
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,311
You want a piece of me?

66
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,023
Excuse me. It sounds like
you two need each other.

67
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,274
I mean, think about it.

68
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,276
Flotter, your water
helps his trees grow,

69
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,279
and, Trevis, your branches
shade his pond from the sun.

70
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,197
It's a well-known fact
that the sun

71
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,658
makes water
evaporate.

72
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,742
She's got a point.

73
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,703
The girl's a thinker.

74
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,956
Now, shake hands and make up.

75
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,421
Ugh... moist palms.

76
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,507
Sappy fingers.

77
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,384
<i>Neelix to Holodeck 2.</i>

78
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,593
Naomi here.

79
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,887
<i>It's bedtime.</i>

80
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,262
Can't I stay a little longer?

81
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,806
<i>You know the rules.</i>

82
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,392
Besides, someone special
wants to say good night.

83
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,977
Mom!

84
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,188
Computer, end program.

85
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,605
<i>And how's Flotter?</i>

86
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,899
Grouchy as ever, but we made

87
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,901
a new friend today
named Trevis.

88
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,527
I'll introduce him
to you tomorrow

89
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,904
as soon as you get home.

90
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,114
(<i> transmission static</i> )

91
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,532
<i>I'm afraid the away mission</i>

92
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,617
<i>may take a few more days,</i>
<i>sweetheart.</i>

93
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,535
Days?

94
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>Yes...</i>

95
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,289
<i>but I'm bringing you back some</i>
<i>beautiful sillinite crystals</i>

96
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,709
<i>and lots of holopictures</i>
<i>for your data album.</i>

97
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,753
<i>Now be a good girl</i>
<i>and get ready for bed</i>

98
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,295
<i>while I talk to Neelix.</i>

99
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,214
All right.

100
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,049
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

101
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,305
Samantha?

102
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,307
<i>We ran into an ion storm.</i>

103
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,143
How bad is it?

104
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,310
<i>We took a real beating.</i>

105
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,063
<i>We're trying to make repairs,</i>

106
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,773
<i>but there's</i>
<i>another storm on the way.</i>

107

(<i> static</i> )

108
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,983
<i>Better go.</i>

109
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,777
<i>Say good night for me?</i>

110
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,280
I've lost the com signal.

111
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,951
A level-7 ionic front is
closing aft at 33,000 kph.

112
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,452
I need more power
to the thrusters

113
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,995
if I'm going to outrun it.

114
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,496
I'll see what I can do.

115
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,498
The leading edge is approaching.

116
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,417
I've given all the power
I can spare, Tom.

117
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,501
It's not enough.

118
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,420
I can't keep ahead
of this thing.

119
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,838
PARIS:
Brace for impact!

120
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,124
TUVOK (<i> staticky</i> ):
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,335

00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,337
<i>We need assistance.</i>

123

<i>Warp drive is...</i>
<i>Impulse power is down.</i>

124
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,760
<i>...thrusters only.</i>

125
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,347
<i>...ion storms damaged</i>
<i>our primary systems.</i>

126
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,849
<i>Life support is failing.</i>

127
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,727
<i>We're searching</i>
<i>for an emergency landing site.</i>

128
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,604
<i>We require immediate....</i>

129
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,689
(<i> transmission fades to static)</i>

130
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,151
That was their
last transmission.

131
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,903
We haven't been able
to raise them since.

132
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,529
If they're looking
for a place to land,

133
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,115
they must be in
pretty bad shape.

134
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,699
Anything on
long-range sensors?

135
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,369
We lost their signature
when the second ion storm hit,

136
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,246
but we've triangulated
the coordinates

137
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,372
of the distress call.

138
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,915
They've entered
a planetary system

139
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,292
about .6 light-years
from here.

140
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,294
Problem is, there's
another ion storm--

141
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,753
a level-5--
blocking our path.

142
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,797
Level-5?

143
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,299
We've been through worse.

144
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,841
Let's just batten
down the hatches

145
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,385
and reinforce
the shields.

146
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,552
We're not going to let

147
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,221
a little bad weather
stand in our way.

148
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,389
What about Naomi?

149
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,349
I guess somebody's
going to have

150
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,393
to explain why her
mother's not back.

151
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,979
Maybe we shouldn't
tell her anything.

152
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,605
Why not?

153
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,608
She's a very
sensitive girl.

154
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,444
I-I don't want to alarm
her unnecessarily.

155
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,279
With any luck,
we'll have her mother back

156
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,529
before she starts to worry.

157
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,074
Well, you're closer to her
than anyone.

158
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,243
I'm inclined to let you
take the lead on this.

159
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,453
Thanks, Captain.

160
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,788
All right. Consider
it your mission

161
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,081
to keep her occupied.

162
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,459
Aye, Captain.
Dismissed.

163
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,548
I was thinking...
NEELIX: Oh?

164
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,593
It's time I carried
my weight around here.

165
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,055
Ah. They could use a hand
in the airponics bay.

166
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,309
I was thinking
more of the Bridge.

167
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,019
Captain's Assistant.

168
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,728
Would I get to
fly the ship?

169
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,731
Well, we'd have to take
it up with the Captain.

170
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,360
(<i> door opens</i> )

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,069
We need to check
the internal sensors.

172
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,864
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Neelix, don't move.

173
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,740
What's wrong?

174
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,659
The Borg lady.

175
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,121
She has a name, you know.

176
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:02,917
Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct
of Unimatrix Zero One.

177
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,836
Don't look.

178
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,254
She'll assimilate you.

179
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,382
Naomi, Seven is a nice person

180
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,218
and she's a valuable member
of this crew.

00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,178
I don't want to be
in her collective.

182
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,514
I don't think
there's much danger of that.

183
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,556
KIM:
Hey, Neelix.

184
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,974
Hey, Naomi.

185
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,351
Neelix,
can I talk with you?

186
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,601
Yeah. I'll be right back.

187
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,064
Sick Bay's running short
on emergency medkits.

188
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,482
We're going to need a few more

189
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,401
if we send another away team
after the shuttle.

190
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:31,196
I've got half a dozen
stockpiled in Cargo Bay 2.

191
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,448
How is she?

192
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,617
On the Naomi anxiety
scale of one to ten--

193
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,328
where one
is a touch of insomnia,

194
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,080
and ten
is a panic attack--

195
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,332
about five.

196
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,834
SEVEN:
Is this chair occupied?

197
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,213
Yes or no would suffice.

198
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,423
No.

199
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,299
I mean, yes.

200
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,592
Explain.

201
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,135
You can't sit here.

202
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,179
Somebody else is sitting here.

203
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,680
Very well.

204
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,854
So... I thought we'd pay
another visit to Sick Bay.

205
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,731
The Doctor says he has time
to give you a...

207
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,650

00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,743
Could we go to
the holodeck first?

I want to play
another Flotter story.

213
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,123
Well, the Doctor's
expecting you.

214
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,083
I don't like Sick Bay.

215
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,042
Why not?

216
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,462
It's full of creepy things--

218
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:30,922
and hyposprays.

219
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,549
Well, that's not true.

220
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,468
The Doctor talks too much.

221
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,761
Well, that's his way.

222
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,431
Can't you reprogram him
or something?

223
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,267
Oh, I-I don't think
he'd like that very much.

224
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,561
Come on.

225
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,152
Rumor has it there's
a planetoid around here.

Sorry, Tom.

227

There's definitely
a big rock nearby.

00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,662
How long till it hits us?

232
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,331
Less than
two minutes.

233
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,541
Great. That gives me 30 seconds
to land this thing.

234
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,084
Samantha, I don't
mean to rush you.

We can't land here.

Just keep us away from the

I've got a big meteor crater,
500 kilometers across, 3.7 deep.

I'll take it.

About three kilometers

At least our primary

Wish I felt the same.

Well, turn back the clock
a few billion years

to when cells
first evolved.

334
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,220

had no mitochondria.

sources they could find.

at home.

00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,651
They became friends?

The correct term
is "symbiosis."

forgetting something?

360
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,695
Oh.

361
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,029
Thank you, Doctor.

362
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,990
You're quite welcome,
Miss Wildman.

363
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,668
In the blink of an eye,
there was Trevis above us.

364
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,794
Then what happened?

365
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,754
He turned out
to be very nice.

366
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,923
His bark was worse
than his bite.

367
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,341
(<i> chuckles</i> )

368
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,760
Where did you learn
to make such silly puns?

369
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,011
You.

370
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,429
Oh.

371
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,807
Neelix, did you have
a favorite holodeck program

372
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,266
when you were
growing up?

373
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,686
Well, we didn't have
any holodecks on Rinax,

374
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,562
but it didn't matter
because we had

375
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,773
a great big forest
right behind my house.

376
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,732
Really?

377
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,359
Uh-huh.

378
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,779
And my sisters and I would
go exploring every day.

379
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,489
We'd make up
our own stories.

380
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,784
Imagination.
Exactly.

381
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,745
Deck 6, Section 9.

382
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,790
Where are your sisters now?

383
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,962
Oh... they're far
away from here.

384
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,214
I haven't seen them
in a very long time.

385
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,090
How long?

386
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,677
Many years.

387
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,680
But you haven't been on
<i>Voyager</i> for that long.

388
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,515
True, but before that,

389
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,310
my work as a trader
kept me away from home.

390
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,813
That's too bad.

391
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,402
Do your sisters
ever call you

392
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,238
like my mom does when
she's on an away mission?

393
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,239
No.

394
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,491
I bet you miss them.

395
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,410
I do, very much.

396
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,078
Here we are.

397
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,667
Computer, display
chapter headings,

398
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,753
<i>The Adventures</i> <i> of Flotter.</i>

399
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,423
Let's see.
"Flotter and the Tree Monster"?

400
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,133
Played that one yesterday.

401
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,762
Okay. "Trevis and the
Terribly Twisted Trunk."

402
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,890
I promised I'd save that one
for mom. It's her favorite.

403
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,061
"Flotter, Trevis
and the Ogre of Fire."

404
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,729
Yeah. That one.

405
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,023
Huh. That sounds
a little scary.

406
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,232
It's okay.

407
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,068
I won't be scared
if you're with me.

408
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,156
COMPUTER:
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>in the Forest of Forever,</i>

409
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,659
<i>Flotter and Trevis</i>
<i>encountered a strange element</i>

410
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,578
<i>they'd never seen before.</i>

411
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,080
(<i> sustained groaning</i> )

412
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,377
Trevis, you're on fire.

413
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,963
I told him not to touch it,

414
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,965
but this blockhead
never listens.

415
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:52,924
Stop complaining

416
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,050
and help him.

417
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,509
Me?

418
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,719
Water puts out fire.

419
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
Oh, thank you.

420
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,850
Hey, it worked.

421
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,226
Watch this.

422
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,406
Good thinking, Naomi.

423
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,992
Who's the furball?

424
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,618
The name's Neelix.

425
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,996
What caused the fire?

426
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,705
It came from up there.

427
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,873
In a flash.

428
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,750
Lightning.

429
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,293
But the sky is clear.

430
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,796
It doesn't look
like a thunderstorm.

431
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,923
What's your theory, Naomi?

432
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,550
There's only one
other explanation--

433
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,512
the Ogre of Fire.

434
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,263
The Ogre...

435
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,265
...of Fire?

436
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,018
Who's he?

437
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,937
(<i> loud male voice</i> ):
He is me!

438
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:52,232
And I'm going to burn
this forest to the ground!

439
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,325
Oh! Oh... Oh!

440
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,037
Flotter!

441
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,005
(<i> coughs</i> )

442
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,591
Maybe... we should
play another program.

443
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,011
No, we have to find Flotter.

444
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,804
Hello! Is anyone there?

445
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,222
TREVIS:
Over here.

446
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,559
Trevis, are you all right?

447
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,978
Uh-huh. A little hot
under the bark, maybe.

448
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,688
What about Flotter?

449
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,525
Is he dead?

450
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,195
Neelix?

451
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,320
Well, I...

452
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,655
I don't know.

453
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,157
He can't be dead.

454
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,241
Flotter!

455
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,450
I think it's your bedtime.

456
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,244
But I want to find Flotter.

457
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,996
Don't argue
with your godfather.

458
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,455
Come on, now.

459
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,878
KIM:
Take this to Lieutenant Torres.

460
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,880
You'll find the phaser drills
in Cargo Bay 3.

461
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,090
Aye, sir.

462
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,716
Are you sure you
have time for this?

463
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,926
I know you're busy.

464
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,594
No problem.
Glad to be of service.

465
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,142
Maybe a shade bluer.

466
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,770
And the head's a little
disproportionate,

467
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,438
don't you think?

468
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,482
We're not shooting
for an exact replica, Neelix.

469
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,901
Artistic license.

470
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,277
Sorry.

471
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,780
Guess I shouldn't barge
into your kitchen

472
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,698
and tell you
how to cook.

473
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,868
Flotter-- now there's a name
I haven't heard in a while.

474
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,955
I used to be nuts about those
holostories when I was a kid.

475
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,372
Did you see the one

476
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,750
where Flotter suspects Trevis
to be a rubber tree?

477
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,293
Not yet.

478
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,004
He keeps trying to trip him
to see is if he'll bounce.

479
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,798
Yeah, those two
were a lot of fun.

480
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,466
Actually,
the last scenario

481
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,468
that Naomi chose was
pretty frightening.

482
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,886
No fun at all.

483
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,221
Kids love to be scared.

484
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,889
Not Naomi.

485
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,768
Computer, transfer the design
parameters to the replicator.

486
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,522
How's she holding up?
Fine.

487
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,275
Right now, she's busy
with her homework.

488
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,860
Neelix, what's wrong?

489
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,280
Everything.
Everything's wrong!

490
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,616
Ion storms, crash landings,
alien attacks--

491
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,202
a starship's no place
for a child.

492
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,746
I don't know.

493
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,166
I'd say Naomi's pretty lucky
to be growing up on<i> Voyager.</i>

494
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,001
Lucky?
Think about it.

495
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,004
Think about all the things
she's experienced--

496
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,505
stars being born,
supernovas,

497
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,381
life-forms no one from

498
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,092
the Alpha Quadrant
has seen before.

499
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,928
When I was a kid, I
would have given anything

500
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,721
for a chance like this.

501
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,932
Well, here goes.

502
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,400
Hi, Neelix.

503
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,569
Did you miss me?

504
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:46,157
You know, I forgot
how ugly this guy was.

505
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,035
Thanks, Ensign.

506
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,963
(<i> imitating Flotter ):</i>
Naomi.

507
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,217
Guess who I found
in the replicator.

508
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,926
Thanks,

509
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,763
but that's not
really Flotter.

510
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,474
Well, Flotter's
not really Flotter.

511
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:16,229
He's just
a holodeck character.

512
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,147
What are you working on?

513
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,025
I'm researching
the evaporation of water.

514
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,902
Why?

515
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,362
Well, I've been thinking.

516
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:27,865
Water doesn't just
disappear when it's heated.

517
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,407
It turns into invisible gas.

518
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,536
So, if we could get the
forest to cool down enough,

519
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,455
Flotter might reliquefy.

520
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,083
Clever.

521
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,255
I miss Mom.

522
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,006
I know you do.

523
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,217
When's she coming back?

524
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,263
Soon.

525
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,639
Why hasn't she called?

526
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,059
She must be very busy

527
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,895
cataloguing all the geological
specimens she's collected.

528
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,398
Has anybody talked to her?

529
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,482
(<i> sighs</i> )

530
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:06,528
Well... not in a day
or two, but...

531
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,031
"Starfleet
Regulation 476-9:

532
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,784
"All away teams must
report to the Bridge

533
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,494
at least once
every 24 hours."

534
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,164
You really are going to make an
excellent Captain's Assistant.

535
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,792
What if something bad
happened to them?

536
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,753
I'm sure everything's fine.

537
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,005
Come on now, bed.

538
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,465
Promise to wake me up
if Mommy calls?

539
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,675
Promise.

540
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,928
Even if it's 0200 hours?

541
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,471
Even if it's 0200 hours.

542
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,142
Sweet dreams.

543
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,063
Neelix?

544
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:14,347
Computer, access
Personal Database Neelix.

545
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,849
File index 291.

546
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,852
Hello, Alixia.

547
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,856
I'm sorry it's been
so many weeks

548
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,523
since I've thought about you,

549
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,485
but we've been very busy
here on<i> Voyager.</i>

550
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,612
I miss you.

551
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:35,533
My goddaughter, Naomi,
she's in trouble.

552
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,661
We're in trouble.

553
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,249
She may lose her mother.

554
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:46,462
Alixia, you always knew
the right thing to do,

555
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,088
the right thing to say.

556
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,300
(<i> sighs</i> )

557
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,676
I wish you were here to help me.

558
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,607
Come on!

559
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,026
Hurry!

560
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,823
We're under attack!

561
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,620
Get up!

562
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,333
(<i> thunderous crashing</i> )

563
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,169
The metreon cascade!
Run!

564
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,593
(<i> gasping</i> )

565
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,952
SEVEN:
Computer, switch to
polythermal imaging

566
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,870
and enhance resolution.

567
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,831
Neelix, do you require
assistance?

568
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,585
No, no, I was
just passing by.

569
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,336
I thought I'd
pay you a visit,

570
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,879
see how things
were going.

571
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,839
How are things going?

572
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,217
I'm mapping the caverns
surrounding the crash site.

573
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,052
How far do they extend?

574
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,679
Approximately
37 kilometers.

575
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,558
What about the search--
anything new?

576
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,518
Every scan reveals
something new,

577
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,312
but as yet,
little of relevance.

578
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,357
Seven...

579
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,111
your family--
your human family--

580
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,363
do you ever
think about them?

581
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,656
Infrequently.

582
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,285
I was only six years old
when I was assimilated.

583
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,413
Not much older
than Naomi is now.

584
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,790
Do you miss your parents?

585
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,168
I barely remember them.

586
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,754
Maybe that's a blessing.

587
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,048
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Rescue team alpha</i>
<i>to Seven of Nine.</i>

588
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,216
Yes, Commander.

589
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,135
<i>We need that data.</i>

590
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,221
I will meet you
at the transporter site.

591
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,351
I adapted.

592
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,312
The child Naomi
will adapt as well.

593
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,272
Borg wisdom.

594
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,364
Lieutenant, get me
an update from beta team.

595
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,116
They haven't checked in
for over an hour.

596
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,284
Coffee, anyone?

597
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,910
Captain?

598
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,371
No, thanks. I've had enough.

599
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,039
One more cup and
I'll jump to warp.

600
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,081
Any news?

601
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,875
I'm afraid not.

602
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,419
No debris,
no life signs?

603
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,505
We've got three teams
beneath the surface

604
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,713
and so far, nothing.

605
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,758
Well, so much for
that happy ending.

606
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,387
We'll turn that planetoid
inside out if we have to,

607
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,430
but I think we have
to be prepared

608
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,848
for the worst.

609
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,100
Maybe it's time
you told Naomi.

610
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,102
No, not yet.

611
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,521
She's an astute girl.

612
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,856
She must be aware that
something's wrong by now.

613
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,774
She's been asking
a lot of tough questions.

614
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,818
"Why hasn't her mother
filed a status report?"

615
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,237
"What if she's in trouble?"

616
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,447
But I've got a big day
planned for her tomorrow.

617
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,574
Plenty of distractions.

618
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,825
She won't have time
to be worried.

619
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,911
Your mission was
to keep her occupied,

620
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:06,995
not to lie to her.

621
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,330
First thing
in the morning,

622
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,666
I want you to explain
the situation.

623
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,918
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

624
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,836
Why not?

625
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,464
Like I told you,
she's sensitive.

626
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,841
All the more reason
to answer her questions.

627
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,554
With all due respect,
Captain, I'm her godfather.

628
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,681
I know what's best for her.

629
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,518
Neelix...

630
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,482
(<i> door opens</i> )

631
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,403
(<i> door closes</i> )

632
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,280
I realize you
care about Naomi

633
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,616
and you are only
trying to protect her,

634
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,451
but you've got to
tell her the truth.

635
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,120
"Good morning, Naomi.

636
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,456
"Would you like some<i> papalla</i>
juice with your cereal?

637
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,499
"And, oh, by the way,
your mother is buried

638
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,667
under 30 kilotons of rock." 

639
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,793
Neelix...

640
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,420
When we know something
for sure...

641
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,216
when we find her mother,
alive or dead...

642
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,720
(<i> stammering</i> ):
I'll tell her then.

643
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,138
Not before.

644
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,974
If you can't
do it, I will.

645
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,726
You don't have the right!

646
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,687
You don't understand
what's at stake here!

647
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,772
When you were her age,

648
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,273
you were safe
and sound on Earth

649
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,609
with two healthy parents
to take care of you.

650
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:19,859
You never had to worry

651
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,945
about the possibility
of being alone!

652
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,573
You take it from me--
you wouldn't have liked it.

653
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,326
Oh, I know.

654
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,870
You must identify
with Naomi's situation.

655
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:38,504
When my family was killed,
I lost everything.

656
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,880
I still have nightmares.

657
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,925
It hasn't been easy.

658
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,345
I don't want Naomi
to go through what I did.

659
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,805
I understand,

660
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,640
and you're right,

661
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,769
but this situation
is different.

662
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,270
How so?

663
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,900
Naomi has you.

664
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,238
Neelix, she has to be told,

665
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,073
but I know
she'll be better off

666
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,828
having you here
to help her through it.

667
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:16,124
First thing
in the morning.

668
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,169
We've got a few hours
until then.

669
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,879
Why don't you come
back on the Bridge?

670
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,465
Give us a hand?

671
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,968
PARIS:
Ready, Tuvok?

672
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,804
Ready.

673
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,603
Cross your fingers.

674
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,440
(<i> sighing</i> )

675
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,734
The magnetic relays

676
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,402
have overloaded.

677
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,863
We better find another way
to polarize this hull

678
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,866
or their sensors
won't be able to pick us up.

679
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,576
We're never getting
out of here.

680
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,494
TUVOK:
Do not give up hope.

681
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,788
The probability
of our being rescued is low,

682
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,582
but not statistically
impossible.

683
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,500
Comforting.

684
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,753
Who's going to
look after Naomi?

685
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,213
You should not concern
yourself with that now.

686
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,298
How can you say that?

687
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,592
My youngest child

688
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,511
has been without
a father for four years,

689
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:12,055
yet I am certain
of her well-being,

690
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:16,351
that I conveyed my values
to her before leaving,

691
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,144
and I have confidence
in the integrity

692
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,813
of those around her.

693
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,483
You have been an exemplary
mother to Naomi

694
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:27,780
and she is in the hands
of people you trust.

695
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:33,786
She will survive and prosper,
no matter what becomes of us.

696
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,415
Thanks, Tuvok.

697
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,966
Mom!

698
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,471

699
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,321

<i>a closer reading.</i>

718
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,231
JANEWAY:
Do it. I want alpha and beta
teams to search for survivors.

719
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,358
Tell Sick Bay to stand
by for heavy casualties.

720
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,528
Naomi?

721
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,240
Naomi...

722
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,209
Naomi?

723
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,090
Computer, locate Naomi Wildman.

724
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,551
<i>Naomi Wildman is</i>
<i>in her quarters.</i>

725
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,738
Clever.

726
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,993
Computer, resume program

727
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,912
"Flotter, Trevis
and the Ogre of Fire."

728
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:24,039
<i>Program activated.</i>

729
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,627
Commander, I'm reading
duranium alloys.

730
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,045
I believe it is
the shuttle.

731
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,756
Approximately 80 meters
beneath this rubble.

732
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:33,840
Life signs?

733
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,592
None.

734
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,677
Commander, without
life signs to lock on to,

735
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,345
we cannot beam
the crew out.

736
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,098
Maybe we can transport
the entire ship

737
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,223
to the shuttle bay.

738
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,517
Through 50 kilotons
of bemonite?

739
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,146
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

740
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,439
<i>Janeway here.</i>

741
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,941
We think we've
found the shuttle,

742
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,442
but we need
to dig it out.

743
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,070
<i>Have all teams rendezvous</i>
<i>at my coordinates.</i>

744
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,321
Acknowledged.

745
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,783
Phaser drills
here and here.

746
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:03,495
But, hey, B'Elanna,
look on the bright side.

747
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,081
No more day-old pizza
laying around.

748
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,710
And you'll never have
to watch another chapter

749
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,088
of<i> Captain Proton</i> again.

750
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:17,009
<i>Warning. Life support</i>
<i>has fallen to critical levels.</i>

751
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,718
Don't mind the computer.

752
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,387
She's just jealous
that I'm spending

753
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,182
my last few minutes
talking to you.

754
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,938
So long.

755
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,523
(<i> beeping</i> )

756
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,486
Sam...

757
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,448
it's your turn.

758
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:45,162
I... haven't thought
what to say yet.

759
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:48,957
Tuvok, why don't
you go next?

760
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:52,335
I prefer to make my farewells
in written form.

761
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,643
Computer, begin recording.

762
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,147

763
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,067

764
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,693
Hi, honey.

765
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,779
I know you're feeling sad
right now,

766
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:24,201
but I want you to listen
to me very carefully, okay?

767
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,582
First of all, I love you.

768
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,627
Second, I want
you to know

769
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,090
that I'm proud of you,

770
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,426
how smart you are, how funny,

771
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,636
how kind you are
to other people.

772
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,889
And I know that you are going
to grow up

773
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,016
to do extraordinary things.

774
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:56,649
Last-- and I know
this is a hard one--

775
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,860
try not to be scared.

776
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,073
<i>Warning. Oxygen depletion</i>

777
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:04,616
Listen to Neelix.

778
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,702
He'll be taking care
of you now.

779
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,624
Bye, honey.

780
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,803
Naomi?

781
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,888
Go away!

782
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,306
Where is she?

783
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,143
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

784
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,310
You lied.

785
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,479
I thought
you vaporized.

786
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,607
Naomi reliquefied me.

787
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,608
Now leave.

788
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,359
Computer,

789
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,778

792
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,162
I wonder if this liar
can swim?

793
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,122
We could always
hang him from one

794
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:54,040
of my branches.

795
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,167
Naomi.

796
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,670
Please let me talk to you.

797
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,131
It's okay.

798
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,465
You be nice.

799
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,051
No more lying.

800
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,234
Hey, there.

801
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,569
Is my mother dead?

802
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,115
We don't know.

803
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,326
What happened?

804
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,453
The away team was trying
to avoid an ion storm.

805
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,539
They had to land
on a planet.

806
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,041
I saw that crater.

807
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,501
Something
was burning.

808
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,339
Plasma fires,
pieces of debris...

809
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,382
but not the hull.

810
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,888
Until we know for
sure what's happened,

811
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,557
no one's giving up
on the rescue attempt.

812
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,726
You really think
they might find her?

813
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,647
Yes.

814
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,857
How do I know

815
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,859
you're telling me
the truth this time?

816
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,449
I...

817
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,452
I never told you
this before...

818
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:17,082
but when I was
much younger,

819
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,666
I lost my mom

820
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,585
in a terrible war...

821
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,921
my father
and my sisters, too.

822
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:29,928
It was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

823
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,930
Always wondering...

824
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,598
How did they die?

825
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,725
Were they worried about me?

826
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,895
Could they
still be alive?

827
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:42,941
I thought if I could just
keep you from wondering...

828
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,193
you wouldn't have to feel
what I did.

829
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,529
You were pretending
that nothing was wrong...

830
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,489
that nothing bad happened.

831
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,325
Do you ever pretend

832
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,911
that nothing bad happened
to your family?

833
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,039
Sometimes.

834
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,582
Does it help?

835
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,834
Not really.

836
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,588
Don't be sad, Neelix.

839
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,972
Ion storm? What's that?

840
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,140
The Ogre of Fire.

841
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,349
He's attacking us again.

842
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,476
We'd better get back
to your quarters.

00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,654
<i>Go ahead.</i>

848
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,489
We've got another
ion storm approaching.

849
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,865
When it hits
the planetoid,

850
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,826
your entire cavern
is going to destabilize.

851
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,369
Just a few more meters

852
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,704
and we'll be close enough
to beam out the shuttle.

853
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,081
How long before
the storm hits?

854
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,624
<i>Six minutes.</i>

855
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,836
Make the most of it,
because it's all you've got.

856
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,970
The storm is moving in.

857
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,930

Keep a transporter lock
on the away team.

859
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,767

till the last second.

860
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,520

00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,357

I never thought it would
come down to this--

00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,658
suffocating beneath
kilotons of rock

866
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,827
on some nameless
planetoid.

867
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,622
Did you envision
a more heroic death?

868
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,459
I didn't envision
dying at all.

869
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,295
In accepting
the inevitable,

870
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,754
one finds peace.

871
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,426
If that's another
Vulcan saying, Tuvok,

872
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,887
I'll stick with
"live long and prosper."

00:43:58,595 --> 00:43:59,971
I'm an Ensign now.

897
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,347
I missed you.

898
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,099
Likewise.

899
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,017
Well, now that everyone's
reacquainted,

900
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,978
I bet you're all eager
for a new adventure.

901
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,605
Now that you
mention it,

902
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,982
there is a castle that I've
been meaning to explore.

903
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,108
Castle?

904
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,026
I hear a giant beetle
lives there.

905
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,570
Come on, Neelix.

906
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,946
You go ahead.
See you later.

907
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,660
JANEWAY:
Here's to
happy endings.

908
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,787
Captain!

909
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,123
Just checking on my future
Captain's Assistant.

910
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:30,793
Well, right now, she's off
to conquer a giant beetle.

911
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,297
Oh, sounds like a
dangerous mission.

912
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,298
She can handle it.

913
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,716
She's a courageous girl.

914
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,302
Oh...

915
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,220
Did I ever tell you
about the time

916
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,763
I flooded this
entire forest?

917
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,140
I was six years old.

918
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,809
Flotter claimed we were
in for a dry spell,

919
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,478
so I came up with
the obvious solution.

920
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,938
Why not just divert
the river?

921
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,359
This entire forest was a swamp
by the time we were done.

922
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,860
At which point, Stinger...

923
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,944
NEELIX:
Stinger?

924
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,363
JANEWAY:
The biggest mosquito...

925
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,115
(<i> birds twittering</i> )
