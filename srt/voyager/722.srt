1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,554
Beautiful, isn't it?

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,850
A sensor analysis would have
provided the necessary information.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,435
Just admiring the view.

4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,854
The conference begins
in less than an hour.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,981
There's always time
for warp field dynamics,

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,943
but you don't see natural beauty
like this every day.

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,279
What was that?

8
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,949
Some kind of energy barrier
directly below us.

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,618
It spans thousands
of square kilometers.

10
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,119
Why didn't our sensors detect it?

11
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,287
I'm not certain.

12
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,540
It has an unusual tetryon signature.

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,834
Species 312 used a similar technology.

14
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,716
There's a power surge
coming from the barrier.

15
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,843
Shields at full.

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,264
They're creating
some kind of feedback.

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,266
We've lost impulse engines.

18
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,017
Go to warp.

19
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,353
The warp core is off-line.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,731
Warp engines don't just shut down
when you scrape an energy barrier.

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,483
It's affecting all our systems.

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,569
[Computer]<i> Warning.</i>
<i>Structural failure in 30 seconds.</i>

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,028
We'll have to beam to the surface.

24
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,322
We can't transport through the barrier.

25
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,158
Transfer auxiliary power
to the weapons array.

26
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,451
What are you trying to do?

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,787
If I can realign our phasers
to the correct frequency,

28
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,247
I may be able to open a rift.

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,165
Big enough to get
a shuttle through, I hope.

30
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,836
[Computer] <i>Warning. Structural failure</i>
<i>in ten seconds...</i>

31
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,629
<i>nine... eight...</i>

32
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,340
-Phasers reconfigured.
<i>-...five...</i>

33
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,010
The barrier's closed again.

34
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,396
-[groans]
-I should examine you.

35
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,148
I don't think it's serious.

36
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,622
You have a hairline fracture.

37
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,292
We've got bigger problems.
I'll be fine.

38
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,043
[tricorder beeping insistently]

39
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,089
I'm detecting shuttle debris scattered
over several square kilometers.

40
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,342
-Some of it might still be functional.
-If we can find the right components,

41
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,387
we may be able to construct a beacon,
send a distress signal.

42
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,726
-Through the barrier?
-[sighs] Maybe.

43
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,898
If we hurry, we might
still make that conference.

44
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,694
Well, if we have
to be stranded somewhere,

45
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,071
you couldn't ask for a nicer place.

46
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,656
We wouldn't be stranded at all

47
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,826
if you hadn't insisted
on admiring the view.

48
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>Guest Vessel 74656,</i>

49
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,177
<i>this is Ledos Port Control.</i>
<i>Shut down your engines.</i>

50
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,596
This is Lieutenant Tom Paris.
Is there a problem?

51
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,391
<i>You were observed committing</i>
<i>Piloting Violation 256.</i>

52
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,311
[sighs] I'm sorry, I'm not familiar
with your regulations.

53
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,395
It won't happen again.

54
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,773
<i>You will be informed of the penalty.</i>

55
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,775
What kind of "penalty"?

56
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,276
<i>That's not my decision.</i>

57
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,239
<i>Your docking permit says you're assigned</i>
<i>to the</i> Starship Voyager.

58
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,449
That's right.

59
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,244
<i>Your commanding officer will be</i>
<i>notified of your infraction.</i>

60
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,372
Piloting lessons?

61
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,874
Well, apparently, the standard penalty
for your infraction

62
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,127
is a three-day course in flight safety
followed by a test.

63
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,047
Well, did you explain to them
that we wouldn't be here that long?

64
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,132
Well, actually, while you were
completing your mission,

65
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,094
Seven was invited
to a four-day conference.

66
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,428
Here on Ledos?

67
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,346
I decided to give
the entire crew shore leave.

68
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,392
It'll give you plenty of time
to brush up on your piloting skills.

69
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,644
I don't need lessons.

70
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,105
Apparently, the authorities disagree.

71
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,982
-[scoffs] But, Captain...
-You may not have known

72
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,734
the Ledosians' rules,
but you know ours.

73
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,071
Comply with local law, understood?

74
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,199
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,496
[tricorder beeping]

76
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,217
The relays are fused.
It's useless.

77
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,428
[tricorder beeping]

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,016
Looks like we're not
the only ones here.

79
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,102
Indigenous wildlife, perhaps.

80
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,105
I'm reading residual life signs.

81
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,773
They're humanoid.

82
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,066
Ledosian?

83
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,738
No, but they share
the same genetic traits.

84
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,990
Whoever they are,
they may be able to help us.

85
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,867
Unless they're hostile.

86
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,661
Why don't we give them
the benefit of the doubt?

87
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,873
The life signs
lead in that direction.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,959
I suggest you rest your leg
while I investigate.

89
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,503
It's better if we stick together.

90
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,381
At least until we know
whether they're hostile.

91
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,443
I'm guessing they're pre-warp.

92
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,029
Obviously, they can't help us.

93
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,033
No... I don't suppose they can.

94
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,868
But they're fascinating,
aren't they?

95
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,454
I never expected
to run into people like these

96
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,915
on such a technologically
advanced planet.

97
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,709
This isn't an anthropological
mission, Commander.

98
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,630
You're right.

99
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,382
We should keep searching for debris...

100
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,258
[groans]

101
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,766
You're developing an infection.

102
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,268
You should rest.

103
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,938
I'll have to stay here
and try to keep out of sight.

104
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,358
I'll contact you
if I find anything useful.

105
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,780
I guess I don't have to tell you
to avoid interacting with these people.

106
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,909
Seven of Nine to Chakotay.

107
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,913
<i>Seven of Nine to Chakotay.</i>

108
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,256
<i>Commander, respond.</i>
<i>I found something.</i>

109
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,135
<i>-Seven of Nine to Chakotay.</i>
-Don't...!

110
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,850
[sighs]

111
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,565
Step away from him.

112
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,570
[Chakotay] It's all right, Seven.

113
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,658
They're friendly.
They're treating my wound.

114
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,256
You said we were supposed
to avoid interaction.

115
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,216
They found me.
There was nothing I could do.

116
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,801
You should have tried
to contact me.

117
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,554
I didn't want to expose them
to our technology.

118
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,890
You hid your combadge?

119
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,310
Actually, your call scared them.
They broke it.

120
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,647
I suggest we leave
before they break anything else.

121
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,691
Look, they're friendly...

122
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,151
and I am hurt.

123
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,571
-What are you suggesting?
-We may as well stay the night.

124
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,115
-Commander...
-It's good shelter.

125
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,035
And my leg feels better
since they put this dressing on.

126
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,413
I'm going to get some rest.

127
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,957
I suggest you do the same.

128
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,462
Chell says we shouldn't
miss the flame gardens.

129
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,713
I hear the arboretum
is beautiful, too.

130
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,798
We can do both.

131
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,926
Tom!
You joining us?

132
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:58,927
Oh, that's right.

133
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,845
-You have to go to pilot school.
-[chuckling]

134
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,680
I hear the course takes days.

135
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,391
Yeah, for most people,
but I did a little research.

136
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,894
If the instructor agrees,
you can skip the lessons

137
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,270
and go right to the test.

138
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,730
So, I will be seeing you
in a couple of hours.

139
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,651
You have to admire his optimism.

140
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,694
Just a moment, sir.

141
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,205
I am Mr. Kleg,
the flying instructor.

142
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,998
Are you Lieutenant Paris?

143
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,749
He is.

144
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,710
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

145
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,420
May I show you to the Delta Flyer?

146
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,838
Why?

147
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,301
So you can explain what I did wrong
and then administer the test.

148
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:44,305
It sounds to me like you need
lessons in patience, as well.

149
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,141
Oh, Tom is very patient, sir.

150
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,102
Never impulsive.

151
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,604
Take all the time you need.

152
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,481
He'll enjoy the extra attention.

153
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,441
Well, I'm pleased to hear it.

154
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,278
We'll start with a review
of safety procedures.

155
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,906
Do you have a visual display system
I can access?

156
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,782
I think I can find one.

157
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,951
Have fun.

158
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,162
Energize.

159
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,751
So, how long will this "review" take?

160
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,046
Oh, typically about four hours,

161
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,423
but there's no rush.

162
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,509
[chuckles]
Of course not.

163
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,398
River.

164
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,451
River.

165
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,170
Mountain.

166
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,676
[Chakotay] Mountain.

167
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,934
Where... are we?

168
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,408
This?

169
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,378
You want to trade.

170
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,757
Well, I suppose it won't hurt.

171
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,684
I'll take that as a "thank you."

172
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,611
Did you make
a favorable exchange?

173
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,905
I didn't want to
insult their customs.

174
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,073
Any luck?

175
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,866
I may have found a way
of communicating.

176
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,576
[Chakotay] Me, too.

177
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,286
I've learned how to say "thank you."

178
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,540
I was referring to communication
with<i> Voyager.</i>

179
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,251
It may be possible to construct a beacon
by connecting these components

180
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,503
-to the shuttle's deflector.
-Did you find it?

181
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,713
I detected it
six kilometers from here.

182
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,048
I believe it's intact.

183
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,467
I'm not sure I'm up
to that long a trip.

184
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,219
I'll go.

185
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,097
I've started mapping the area.

186
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,057
Here's the river we passed.

187
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,227
This is where we beamed down
and we're here now.

188
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,896
Then the deflector
should be approximately here.

189
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,233
[Chakotay] Six kilometers is a long way.

190
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,193
Maybe one of them
could guide you.

191
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,363
I'm still trying to limit our contact
with these people.

192
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,824
[Chakotay] The sooner we get
to the deflector,

193
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,702
the sooner we can get out of here.
They know the terrain.

194
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,412
Maybe they can
get you there faster.

195
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,457
And watch me construct
a tetryon-based signaling device?

196
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,669
All right, but be careful.

197
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,092
Seven.

198
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,386
This is how they say "good-bye."

199
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,862
[case thumps]

200
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,873
[grunts]

201
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,119
Thank you.

202
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,714
Hello.

203
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,703
[thunder crashing]

204
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,188

[rustling]

206
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,318
Identify yourself.

207
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,538
An exothermic reaction.

208
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,066
I'm not hungry.

209
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,873
[Kleg] Inadequate system integration.

210
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,420
Visibility impaired
by lateral sensor array.

211
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,590
Insufficient console accessibility...

212
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,093
You know, I couldn't agree more.

213
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,930
Those are just some of the defects
that led to my so-called "pilot error."

214
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,640
Polarity thrusters?

215
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,853
Oh! They've been known to cause
accidental acceleration.

216
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,438
Exactly my point.

217
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,607
Why should I be held responsible
for the ship's design flaws?

218
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,569
According to the maintenance records,

219
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,447
you were this vessel's
chief designer.

220
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,824
I make it a point
of professional pride

221
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,118
to research every case
I'm assigned to.

222
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,662
Are you familiar with that term,
Lieutenant?

223
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,622
Professional pride?

224
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,915
Yes, sir.

225
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,171
In fact, that is why
I am so eager to get underway.

226
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,381
I want to prove to you
that I am a good pilot.

227
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,092
There are protocols,
Mr. Paris.

228
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,679
System by system diagnostics,
preflight simulations.

229
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,140
You must have other students
who need your attention.

230
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,351
-It wouldn't be fair to...
-Don't worry, Lieutenant.

231
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:14,482
I'm planning to spend as much time
with you as you need.

232
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,401
[birds twittering]

233
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,528
[footsteps]

234
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,251
Good morning.

235
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,867
I'm trying to go here.

236
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,382
Can you show me?

237
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,831
Yes.

238
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,586
I thought it was this way.

239
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,275
Yes, it's quite
an impressive view,

240
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,193
but now we really have...

241
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,476
My friend...

242
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,188
She hasn't come back.

243
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,732
I need to find her.

244
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,163
She looks like this.

245
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,625
Where?

246
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,429
Where did you get this?

247
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,496
My friend.

248
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,458
Where?

249
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,519
Don't touch that!

250
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,356
Please.

251
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,753
Problem?

252
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,756
Commander Chakotay failed to report in
at the scheduled time.

253
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,674
We tried hailing,
but there was no response.

254
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,926
We contacted
the conference coordinator.

255
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,012
He said Seven and Chakotay
never showed up.

256
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,263
Anything on sensors?

257
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,309
We located a hull signature
over the southern subcontinent,

258
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,019
but it's only a wing.

259
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,521
Nothing else?
No life signs?

260
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,065
No, ma'am.

261
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,276
That's awfully low
for something to be in orbit.

262
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,652
It's not in orbit.

263
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,197
It's resting on
an energy barrier.

264
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,199
We think the shuttle
may have collided with it.

265
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,658
Why didn't they see it?

266
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,952
Standard scans
didn't reveal its presence.

267
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,497
We were only able to detect it
with our Borg sensors.

268
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,956
If all you found was a wing,

269
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,250
maybe the rest of the shuttle
made it through the barrier.

270
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,169
Logic suggests that possibility.

271
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,547
Unfortunately, the barrier
is deflecting all our scans.

272
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,343
There's no way to know if the shuttle
or its occupants are on the other side.

273
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,846
Hail the Ledosian Ambassador.

274
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,808
<i>We'd have warned your Commander,</i>

275
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,935
<i>but his flight plan didn't go</i>
<i>anywhere near that area.</i>

276
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,479
He must have altered his route
for some reason.

277
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:48,732
<i>And collided with the barrier.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

278
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,776
We're not assuming they're dead.

279
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,237
We believe they may
have found a way through.

280
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,612
<i>That's very unlikely.</i>

281
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,614
They're resourceful people.

282
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,867
Can you tell us anything
about the barrier?

283
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,871
<i>It shields the territory</i>
<i>of an indigenous society-- the Ventu.</i>

284
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,666
Then the area's habitable.

285
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,086
If you lowered the barrier,
we could scan for our people's life signs.

286
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,839
<i>-I'm afraid we can't do that.</i>
-Why not?

287
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,592
<i>It was erected by aliens</i>
<i>hundreds of years ago.</i>

288
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,427
<i>They haven't been back.</i>

289
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,097
<i>The technology</i>
<i>is a mystery to us.</i>

290
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,683
Why did these aliens
build the barrier?

291
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,894
<i>-To protect the Ventu.</i>
-From whom?

292
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,437
<i>Us.</i>

293
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,983
<i>Our ancestors fought them,</i>
<i>polluted their habitat.</i>

294
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,194
<i>I'm afraid we weren't</i>
<i>very enlightened back then.</i>

295
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,239
Earth went through its
dark periods too, Ambassador.

296
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,992
Would you have any objections
if we tried to lower the barrier

297
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,827
just to scan for our people?

298
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,704
<i>I told you, it's not possible.</i>

299
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:47,124
Perhaps if you gave us information
about the barrier's power source.

300
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,794
<i>The generator is inside.</i>
<i>There's no way to access it.</i>

301
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,173
<i>Even if your people did survive,</i>

302
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,342
<i>I'm afraid there's no way to get them out.</i>

303
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,103
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54827.7.</i>

304
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,938
<i>Although the Ledosians</i>
<i>are skeptical,</i>

305
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,399
<i>they're allowing us</i>
<i>to try to locate our people.</i>

306
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,402
<i>Meanwhile, we've begun to analyze</i>
<i>the shuttle fragment.</i>

307
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,405
The burn pattern suggests
a tetryon flux.

308
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,741
We found a reference
to similar technology

309
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,576
in Seven's Borg database.

310
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,287
You think the Borg erected it?

311
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,748
No, but it may have been
constructed by people

312
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,918
they later assimilated--
Species 312.

313
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,462
If Seven were here,
she might be able to figure out

314
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,755
a way to get through it.

315
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,757
Maybe she already did.

316
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,967
Some of the damage
to the wing was caused

317
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,511
by feedback from
the shuttle's phasers.

318
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,096
Seven and Chakotay
might have used them

319
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,349
to penetrate the barrier
for some reason.

320
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,267
If I can determine
the appropriate frequency,

321
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,436
I may be able
to do the same thing.

322
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,687
But there is risk involved.

323
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,022
What sort of risk?

324
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,899
It looks like the feedback
from the barrier

325
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,192
is what destroyed the shuttle.

326
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,487
If we're not careful, the same thing
could happen to<i> Voyager.</i>

Seven.

333
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,822
-Is everything all right?
-I need your tricorder.

334
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,660
Nice to see you, too.

335
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,495
I lost mine.

336
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,957
There's a strong magnetic field here

337
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,502
that's preventing me from
generating a deflector beam.

338
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:00,299
But the field drops off approximately
4.8 kilometers in that direction.

339
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,636
-Can you transmit the signal from there?
-Not through the barrier,

340
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,138
but I may be able to neutralize it

341
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,307
by generating a dampening field
with our deflector.

342
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,853
Even if you're right,
this must weigh 500 kilos.

343
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,146
How would we move it?

344
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,483
Some of them could help us.

345
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,943
We shouldn't involve them.

346
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,362
Do I detect a change
in attitude, Commander?

347
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,617
Your concern was justified.

348
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,328
They've been gathering debris
from the shuttle,

349
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,289
using it to imitate us.
I don't want them helping.

350
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,708
What's the alternative?
Staying here?

351
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,002
Allowing them to find
all of the debris?

352
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,545
If we neutralize the barrier,

353
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,965
<i>Voyager</i> can transport us
and our technology off the surface.

354
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,177
Is there a possibility
that this dampening field

355
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,721
-could disrupt the barrier permanently?
-Unlikely.

356
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,807
Once the deflector is deactivated,
the barrier should reinitialize.

357
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,226
Let's hope you're right.

358
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:03,195
[Kleg] So, you can execute a turn
at less than 300 KPH.

359
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,614
-Well done, Lieutenant.
-Thanks.

360
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,450
You know, I don't want
to seem impatient again,

361
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,328
but is there any way
that you'd let me take that test now?

362
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,997
I thought I made myself clear
about that.

363
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,376
All my students
complete the entire course.

364
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,002
Well, I understand, sir,

365
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:23,048
but two of my friends are missing,
and I'd like to help find them.

366
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,092
Well, that's an admirable sentiment,

367
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,927
but if I give you special treatment,

368
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,888
it wouldn't be fair to the others
who have to take this course.

369
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,098
Besides...

370
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,891
why stop now?

371
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,937
You're getting very close
to becoming an adequate pilot.

372
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,237
[tricorder beeping]

373
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,657
[Seven] Here, Commander.

374
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,795
Not so close.

375
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,724
Phasers are starting to overload.

376
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,103
Can we divert any more power
to the shields?

377
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,813
The shields are amplifying
the feedback.

378
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,900
The barrier's interfering
with every system we activate.

379
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,944
Cease fire.

380
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,573
I'm open to suggestions.

381
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,869
We may be able
to reconfigure a photon torpedo

382
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,745
to detonate at the appropriate frequency.

383
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,372
What about feedback?

384
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:41,168
A torpedo shouldn't create any...
theoretically.

385
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,254
Do it.

386
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,889
They're too close.

387
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,727
Back...

388
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,729
behind the rise.

389
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,230
Stay back.

390
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,073
[whirring]

391
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,703
[volume increases]

392
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,082
[electrical crackling]

393
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,504
The energy barrier's coming down.

394
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,839
I thought you were still
reconfiguring the torpedo.

395
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,967
I am. It's being deactivated
from the inside.

396
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,594
Harry, scan for life signs.

397
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,429
Aye, Captain.

398
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,521
Take it off!

399
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,364
I'm only reading one combadge.
It's Seven's.

400
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,699
Open a channel.
Janeway to Seven.

401
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,284
<i>Are you and Chakotay all right?</i>

402
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,452
Yes, Captain.

403
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,287
<i>Stand by for transport.</i>

404
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,790
Lock on to Commander Chakotay.
I need more time.

405
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:02,958
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

406
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,168
Someone's been injured.
She requires medical attention.

407
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,670
<i>Do you need the Doctor?</i>

408
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,714
I believe I can treat her.
A medkit would be useful.

409
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,466
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

410
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,595
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

411
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,391
<i>Seven has remained on the surface</i>
<i>to tend to the injured Ventu girl</i>

412
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,602
<i>while Chakotay's</i>
<i>being treated in Sick Bay.</i>

413
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,565
The poultice healed
the fracture and the infection.

414
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,233
I'm impressed.

415
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,318
They're impressive people.

416
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,571
I just hope we haven't
traumatized them.

417
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,990
You did what you had to do
to get out of there.

418
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,742
Still, I think we should transport
all the shuttle debris back to<i> Voyager</i>

419
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,453
-as soon as possible.
-Agreed.

420
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,128
Would you like some breakfast?

421
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,466
I'm not hungry, either.

422
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,603
I admire your curiosity,

423
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,980
but you should be more careful.

424
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,526
It's time for me to leave.

425
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,908
Back to my home.

426
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,045
That's very kind,
but I have no use for it.

427
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,844
I suppose I should respect
your customs.

428
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,014
Thank you.

429
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,438
[Man] These botanical specimens

430
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,774
indicate a high level
of serum nitrates.

431
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,193
Catalog those foliates.

432
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,528
-Explain your presence here.
-Oh.

433
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,072
You must be from<i> Voyager.</i>

434
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,073
Who are you?

435
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,075
My name is Barus.
I'm the expedition leader.

436
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,410
What kind of expedition
are you leading?

437
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,580
We're conducting scans to evaluate
the potential of this habitat.

438
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,790
Potential for what?

439
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,709
Anthropological research,
resource development...

440
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,378
We've been waiting years for this.

441
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,797
What about the people
who live here?

442
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,050
-We'll help them, of course.
-How?

443
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,136
With medicine,
infrastructure, education...

444
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:24,224
Whoever lowered this barrier
did the Ventu a great favor.

445
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,610
That barrier has to go back up.

446
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:39,823
Isn't it possible the Ledosians
will improve the lives of the Ventu?

447
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,950
Improve them... how?

448
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,660
They're intelligent people.

449
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,913
Exposure to education and technology
may give them better opportunities.

450
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,541
Can you honestly say that you know
what's better for them?

451
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,670
No, I can't.

452
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,215
Then what do you think
we should do?

453
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,259
I'm uncertain.

454
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,053
It's not like you
to be on the fence.

455
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,516
When Commander Chakotay and I
first encountered the Ventu,

456
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,728
I found them primitive,
of little interest to me.

457
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,731
But as I spent more time with them,
I came to realize that they're

458
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,275
a resourceful,
self-reliant people.

459
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,737
Their isolation may limit
their potential,

460
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,032
but if that isolation ends,
so will a unique way of life.

461
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,243
<i>We appreciate your help</i>
<i>in opening this territory</i>

462
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,456
<i>to exploration, Captain.</i>
<i>It's an unprecedented opportunity.</i>

463
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,375
A short-lived opportunity,
I'm afraid.

464
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,085
<i>I don't understand.</i>

465
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,046
After I transport our deflector
back to<i> Voyager,</i>

466
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,215
the energy barrier
will go back up.

467
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,468
Naturally, you'll want
to get your people out,

468
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,762
so they won't be trapped inside,
as ours were.

469
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,598
<i>You have no right to limit</i>
<i>our access to our own territory.</i>

470
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,350
I'm not trying to do that,
but we have a strict policy

471
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,270
about leaving our technology
in the hands of other cultures.

472
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,105
It often has damaging consequences.

473
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,399
<i>I don't think you realize</i>
<i>how important it is.</i>

474
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,818
<i>It's not only the resources</i>
<i>that interest us.</i>

475
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,155
<i>The Ventu are</i>
<i>our evolutionary ancestors--</i>

476
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,782
<i>our living history.</i>

477
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,909
I understand
this is disappointing for you,

478
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,952
but I'm afraid I have no choice.

479
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,123
<i>In the spirit of cooperation,</i>
<i>I hope you'll reconsider.</i>

480
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,418
We're eager to resume course.

481
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,213
Would an hour be enough time
for you to evacuate your people?

482
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,090
<i>I'll make the arrangements.</i>

483
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,807
We've transported all the remaining debris
to the cargo bay.

484
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,392
I have a lock
on the deflector assembly.

485
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,936
What is it?

486
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,772
There's a Ledosian vessel
on an intercept course.

487
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,233
-It's charging weapons.
-Shields.

488
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,073
Direct hit to the transporters.
They're off-line.

489
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,324
Get a weapons lock
and hail them.

490
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,076
[Kim] They're hailing us.

491
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,370
-[Ambassador]<i> Captain Janeway.</i>
-What's going on?

492
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,206
<i>Our government has decided</i>
<i>not to let you restore the barrier.</i>

493
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,875
And that justifies
an unprovoked attack?

494
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,878
<i>We only targeted your transporters</i>
<i>to avoid harming your crew.</i>

495
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,547
<i>I hope you'll show</i>
<i>the same restraint.</i>

496
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,842
I don't find weapons fire
of any kind restrained.

497
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,971
<i>If you want to avoid further conflict,</i>
<i>I suggest you leave.</i>

498
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,807
Take us out of orbit.

499
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,767
What about the deflector?

500
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,644
Is Tom still in the Flyer?

501
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,646
-Yes, ma'am.
-Hail him.

502
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,277
Excellent, Mr. Paris.

503
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,945
Now, come about slowly.

504
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,780
<i>Janeway to Paris.</i>
<i>Respond.</i>

505
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,992
Captain, I would appreciate it
if you wouldn't interrupt my student

506
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,743
during his examination.

507
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,663
-I'm sorry, but something's come up.
-[Paris]<i> What is it, Captain?</i>

508
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,790
Tom, I'm sending you
some encrypted orders.

509
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,333
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,752
This is highly irregular.

511
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,470
You're going much too fast!

512
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,264
Yes, sir.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

513
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,766
If you have any desire
to pass this test,

514
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,727
you'll reduce your speed immediately.

515
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,897
I wish I could do that, sir.
I really do.

516
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,570
-What was that?
-Paris to<i> Voyager.</i>

517
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,988
<i>I'm under attack.</i>

518
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,573
Give him some help, Mr. Tuvok.

519
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,044
What have you done?

520
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,546
We had to get you out of there
before we closed the barrier.

521
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,049
You can't do that.

522
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,885
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

523
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,137
Paris to<i> Voyager.</i>
I've got them.

524
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,555
Find the deflector.

525
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,391
I'm getting a lock on it now.

526
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,687
My transporters are off-line.

527
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,397
You better get out of there, Tom.

528
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,691
Not yet.
I've got an idea.

529
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,571
I am sorry to inform you, Mr. Paris,
but you have failed this examination.

530
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,157
You will no longer be allowed
to operate a vessel

531
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,575
within Ledosian space.

532
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,578
Something tells me that's
not going to be a problem.

533
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,857
This is a beautiful blanket.

534
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,776
Take it if you like.

535
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,361
I don't need it.

536
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:32,448
If environmental systems ever go down,
you might get cold.

537
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,703
-I...
-You know...

538
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,080
-You first.
-Please, continue.

539
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:44,293
In all the excitement,
I never apologized.

540
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,670
For what?

541
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,922
Causing you to miss
that conference.

542
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,135
As a matter of fact, I...

543
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,387
wanted to thank you for that.

544
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,848
-I thought you were angry.
-I was.

545
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,852
But you were right-- warp mechanics
can be studied anytime.

546
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,895
The Ventu, on the other hand...

547
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,400
Something's still bothering you.

548
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,113
I'm concerned for their well-being.

549
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,198
They know how
to take care of themselves.

550
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,575
That's not what I mean.

551
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,619
Members of the Ledosian expedition
had the opportunity

552
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,164
to scan my deflector modifications.

553
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,500
In time, they may find a way
to duplicate our technology

554
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,127
and remove the barrier themselves.

555
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,713
I suppose it's possible.

556
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,467
If I had never made
those modifications...

557
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,260
We might still be stranded there.

558
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,557
I don't know about you,

559
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,560
but I'm glad to be back on<i> Voyager.</i>

560
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,230
As am I.
