1
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,554
Ooh! Uh, Captain,
do you have a minute?

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,097
Just about a minute.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,641
I'm on my way
to the shuttle bay.

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,100
I thought last night
went well, didn't you?

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,854
Extremely well.
Everyone had a lot of fun.

6
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,897
I was thinking of making it
a regular feature,

7
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,106
say, uh, once a month?

8
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,650
It's certainly worth a try.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,778
And, Captain, you were
especially good last night.

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,905
Thanks, Neelix.
It's been a while.

11
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,448
You'd never know.

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,452
Uh, Captain, um,
do you think, I mean,

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,330
uh, I-I-I-I was wondering...

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,832
What is it, Neelix?

15
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,209
Could you possibly keep
Mr. Tuvok busy

16
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,712
on the Bridge that evening?

17
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,214
I'm sure something
could be arranged.

18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,883
Our secret, Neelix.

19
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,592
Oh, we never had
this discussion.

20
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,427
(<i> chuckling</i> )

21
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,066
Harry's clarinet solo
was okay.

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,569
I could have done
without Tuvok's reading

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,653
of Vulcan poetry,

24
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,739
but the highlight
of the evening

25
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:15,075
was definitely Kathryn Janeway
portraying "The Dying Swan."

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,327
I learned that dance
when I was six years old.

27
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,330
I assure you, it was the hit
of the beginning ballet class.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,498
I don't doubt it.

29
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,875
If Neelix has
another talent night,

30
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,543
I hope you reprise it.

31
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,211
Oh, no. Not until certain
other people take their turn--

32
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,880
the ship's First
Officer, for instance.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,007
Me? Get up in front of people
and perform?

34
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,550
I don't think so.

35
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,177
Come on, Chakotay, there
must be some talent you have

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,554
that people would enjoy.

37
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,056
Maybe I could stand
with an apple on my head

38
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,057
and you could phaser it off.

39
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,600
(<i> chuckles</i> )

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,768
Sounds great.

41
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:41,685
If I miss, I get to be Captain.

42
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,853

44
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,773
Atmospheric turbulence--

45
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:46,857
we might be
in for a rough landing.

46
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,525
Funny, a minute ago,

47
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,527
there wasn't any indication
of rough weather.

48
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,821
I'm reading even more
severe storms near the surface.

49

(<i> beeping</i> )

50
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,657
Ion lightning.

51
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,367
Maybe we better try
the fifth planet instead.

52
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,703
Come back here
when things have cleared up.

53
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,372
I think we took
a lightning hit.

54
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,540
Attitude control is out.

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,166
I'm switching to manual.

56
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,170
The navigational system's down.

57
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,049

Full thrusters!

We have to reduce speed.

I'll try the emergency
antigrav thrusters.

Kathryn!

00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,382
Kathryn!

68
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,968
Kathryn!

69
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,020

Breathe, damn it.
Breathe.

Listen to me, Kathryn.

82
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,470
You've got to breathe.

83
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,514
Breathe! Breathe!

84
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,058
(<i> panting</i> ):
Come on.

85
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,893
Come on!

(<i> coughs</i> )

87
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,273
Yes.

88
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,567
(<i> coughing</i> )

89
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,152
Chakotay...

00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,655
Oh...

91
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,741
Don't ever do that to me again.

92
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,161
Thanks.

93
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,914
You went into shock.

94
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,584
You gave me quite a scare
there for a minute.

95
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,378
This should help
reduce your cranial swelling.

96
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,048
You should have a headache
for awhile.

97
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,424
I'll live with it.

98
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,344
We need to set up
a homing signal.

99
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,012
(<i> groaning</i> )

100
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,680
Hey, take it easy.

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,599
Oh... I'm all right.

102
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,560
Chakotay, we're going to
need the blankets...

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,811
(<i> coughing</i> )

104
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,272
...and the rations.

105
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,443
I can get them.
You set up the homing signal.

106
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,112
Here.

107
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,200
At least the storm
seems to be dying.

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,035
Hmm.

109
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,475
What were you looking at?

110
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,559
There are
phaser burns

111
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,019
on the hull.

112
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,146
I don't think it was
lightning strikes that hit us.

113
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,647
I think we were shot down.

114
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,773
By whom?

115
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,108
I don't know.

116
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,651
I'm going back to see
if I can get

117
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,902
an energy signature
from the burns.

118
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,487
Chakotay, the homing signal--

119
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,406
we might be telling someone
just where to find us.

120
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,074
Disconnect it while I scan

121
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,742
the shuttle.

122
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,038
Oh...

123
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,550
Can you tell anything?

124
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,635
The signatures
are Vidiian.

125
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,053
Vidiian?

126
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,680
I thought we'd moved
beyond their space.

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,515
If they shot us down,
you can be sure

128
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,309
they'll be coming for us.
We need to find a hiding place.

129

130

Life-forms.

00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,231
50 meters from here.

133
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,191
They're coming
this way.

134
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,525
Let's go.

135
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,027
There's another group
in this direction.

136
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,445
We're surrounded.

137
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,612
Let's take cover.

138
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,947
We'll have to fight.

139
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,919
Back off now.

140
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,296
We'll fire if we have to.

141
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,173
Back off!

142
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,466
(<i> grunting</i> )

143
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,134
Chakotay!

00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,224
(<i> gasping</i> )

146
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,194
Harry's clarinet solo
was okay.

147
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,196
I could have done
without Tuvok's reading

148
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,280
of Vulcan poetry,

149
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,990
but the highlight
of the evening

150
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,659
was definitely Kathryn Janeway
portraying "The Dying Swan."

151
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,287
I learned that dance
when I was six years old.

152
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,497
I assure you...

153
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,541
Wait a minute.
What's happening here?

154
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,253
You're right.
We have been here before.

155
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,090
Do you remember Vidiians?

156
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,759
Yes. They shot us down
and attacked us.

157
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,803
We may have wandered into some
kind of repeating time loop.

158
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,765
I'm going to scan
for temporal anomalies.

159
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,725
Whatever's going on,
let's change tactics this time.

160
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,352
Let's not try to land
on that planet.

161
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,106
Agreed. I don't see
any evidence of temporal flux

162
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,857
or any kind of anomaly,
for that matter.

163
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,068
Or of Vidiian ships.
So far, so good.

164
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,778
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

165
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,613
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>
Do you read us?

166
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,115
We're out of range.

167
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,451
I'd still like to figure
out what happened to us.

168
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,826
Send a subspace message

169
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,370
that we won't be
landing on the planet.

170
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,913
Tell them
that we'll be looking

171
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,457
for evidence
of temporal anomalies.

172
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,999
(<i> console beeping</i> )

173
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,460
I see a ship approaching
at high impulse.

174
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,919
It's on an
intercept course.

175
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,088
Is it Vidiian?
Yes.

176
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,465
I've got it.

177
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,174
It's a warship
loaded with weaponry.

178
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,135
It's closing fast.
Can we outrun it?

179
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,761
We can try.

180
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,935
They're 200,000 kilometers
away and gaining.

181
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,937
Setting evasive pattern
delta four.

182
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,522
They're powering weapons.

183
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,648
Shields up.

184
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,942
Stand by all
phaser arrays.

185
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,658
Shields down to 84 percent.

186
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,327
Returning fire.

187
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,665
Nice aim.
It didn't stop them.

188
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,874
(<i> groaning</i> )

189
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,960
We've lost shields.

190
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,337
Firing starboard array.

191
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,381
That one
hit the reactant injectors.

192
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,300
Shut them down.
They'll leak antimatter.

193
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,510
The magnetic fields are failing.

194
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,844
The gas-flow separators
are down.

195
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,013
Dump the core.

196
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,159
It's looking more and more
like we're in a time loop.

197
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,495
The question is,
how do we break it?

198
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,745
Let's retrace our steps--

199
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,581
get back to the part
of space we were in

200
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,915
before all this
started happening.

201
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,417
Agreed.

202
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,169
If we're experiencing
a temporal field,

203
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,046
a tachyon burst
might disperse it.

204
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,339
(<i> console beeping</i> )

205
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,633
Chakotay.

206
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,385
Let me guess--
it's a Vidiian ship.

207
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,594
Two Vidiian ships.

208
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,095
Still 20 million
kilometers away,

209
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,556
but headed right for us.

210
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,350
<i>Sacajawea</i> to<i> Voyager.</i> 
Do you read us?

211
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,602
TUVOK:
<i>You've just come into</i>
<i>com range, Commander.</i>

212
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,604
We're being pursued
by two Vidiian ships.

213
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,315
Set a course for our shuttle
and have weapons powered.

214
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,983
We also believe
we're experiencing

215
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,110
some kind of temporal
phenomenon, a time loop.

216
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,529
Make certain you scan
for anomalies.

217
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>
<i>We're on our way.</i>

218
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,157
If you're going to emit
that tachyon burst,

219
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,825
you'd better do it now.

220
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,285
In a couple of minutes, those
ships'll be right on top of us.

221
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,787
Here goes.

222
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,293
I can't tell if it's
affecting anything.

223
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,670
The Vidiians are almost
within range.

224
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,046
Ready weapons.

225
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,014
What happened?
They just vanished.

226
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,725
But I'm picking up a
residual temporal signature.

227
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:50,478
Then those ships must've been
part of the time loop.

228
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,647
And the tachyon burst
disrupted it.

229
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,274
And not a minute too soon.

230
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,567
I was getting awfully tired
of talking about talent night.

231
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,736
TUVOK:
<i>Voyager</i> to<i> Sacajawea.</i>

232
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,155
<i>We will rendezvous with you</i>
<i>in approximately four minutes.</i>

233
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,451
Believe me, Tuvok, we're
looking forward to it.

234
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,045
Good to have you back, Captain.

235
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,213
Good to be here.

236
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,715
I'd still like to get
to the bottom

237
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,341
of whatever was happening
to us in that shuttle.

238
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,843
Did<i> Voyager</i> detect any evidence
of a temporal field?

239
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,679
To my knowledge,
we did not.

240
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,014
Let's run a second level
temporal scan.

241
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,933
I'd feel better entering
this part of space

242
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,185
if I knew what caused
the phenomenon.

243
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,979
Phenomenon? I'm not sure
what you mean, Captain.

244
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,398
The time loop or whatever it was
we ran into out there.

245
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,524
TUVOK:
Time loop?

246
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,192
We told you.

247
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,361
Chakotay and I experienced
some kind of temporal loop.

248
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,489
It involved the Vidiians.

249
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,864
They'd attack and kill us

250
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,451
and then we'd be sitting
in the shuttle again.

251
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,578
Tell them.

252
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,163
We were on our way

253
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,790
to the second planet
of a binary system...

254
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,374
To collect some
nitrogenase compound,

255
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,209
but we encountered
a storm and we crashed.

256
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,919
And then we were attacked
by the Vidiians,

257
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,088
but we managed to escape
and get back here.

258
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,633
You and the Commander
were checked by the Doctor

259
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,050
who treated your injuries

260
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,303
and you proceeded
here to the Bridge.

261
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,887
But I don't
remember anything

262
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,557
about a repeating
time loop.

263
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,726
You don't remember
how we kept ending up

264
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,688
back in the shuttle
talking about talent night?

265
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,319
Then I'm the only one who
recalls things differently.

266
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,613
Something strange
is going on here.

267
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,825
I'll have the Doctor examine me.

268
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,620
In the meantime, I still want
those temporal scans.

269
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,499
You heard the Captain.
Let's get moving.

270
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,795
I ran a
micro-cellular scan

271
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,338
after you returned
to the ship.

272
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,090
I have just analyzed
the results.

273
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,258
What did you find?

274
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,054
You have contracted
a disease.

275
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,849
The Vidiian phage.

276
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,685
The phage.

277
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,102
What about Chakotay?

278
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,604
Is he infected, too?

279
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,482
No, Commander Chakotay shows
no signs of the disease.

280
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,941
How did I get it?

281
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,944
You said one of the
Vidiians grabbed you.

282
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,406
It may be that the virus
was transferred in that way.

283
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,533
But we've encountered Vidiians
like that before

284
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,744
and had physical contact
with them.

285
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,539
No one's ever gotten sick
that way.

286
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,957
I can't offer an explanation
at this point.

287
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,126
It may be that the phage virus
has mutated

288
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,420
to become more infectious.

289
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,213
I believe, however,
this explains

290
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,091
the hallucinations
you've described.

291
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,426
There is often

292
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,927
concomitant stress
to the thalamus

293
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,554
in the early stages
of the disease.

294
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,056
It is known to cause
a kind of dementia

295
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,141
that produces
hallucinations.

296
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,393
What's the prognosis?

297
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,645
I wish I could tell you,
Captain.

298
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,355
For the moment,
it would be best

299
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,524
if you remain in Sick Bay
under quarantine.

300
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,109
Of course.

301
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,027
The fact that the virus
has acted so quickly

302
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,571
raises the possibility

303
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,489
that others on
the crew may be infected.

304
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,491
But you studied the phage
in great detail.

305
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,452
Have you made any progress
in finding a cure?

306
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,412
I hadn't pursued the matter

307
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,748
since we seemed to have
moved beyond Vidiian space,

308
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,751
but I'll now
redouble my efforts.

309
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,546
In the meantime, I'd like
to give you a sedative.

310
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,758
Captain?

311
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:13,222
I'll be running a series
of deep-level tissue scans.

312
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,390
I understand.

313
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,225
There.

314
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,603
That should give you
a good night's sleep.

315
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,605
I'll erect
a bio-force field

316
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,483
and I promise you, Captain,
I won't deactivate myself

317
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,610
until I have some answers
for you.

318
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,194
Doctor?

319
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,240
I know I'm in good hands.

320
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,040
(<i> sighs</i> )

321
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,364
Doctor?

322
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,744
Ah. You're awake.

323
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,162
How long have
I been asleep?

324
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,998
Almost 40 hours.

325
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,541
Forty?

326
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,335
I'm afraid this strain
of the phage

327
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,586
is particularly virulent.

328
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,881
It's spreading rapidly.

329
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,217
Have you...?

330
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,261
Is there any hope
of a cure?

331
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,724
I regret to inform you
that I have been unsuccessful.

332
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,935
Then what's the next step?

333
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,437
I've given that a great deal
of thought.

334
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,315
The prospects
are unpleasant, Captain.

335
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,276
You face a lingering,
painful death

336
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,863
marked by increasing periods
of dementia

337
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,698
and eventual insanity.

338
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,866
I see.

339
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,242
I've come to the conclusion

340
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,326
that there's only one
humane course of action.

341
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,703
What's that?

342
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,246
Euthanasia.

343
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,623
What?

344
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,917
It would be wrong
to subject you

345
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,585
to such a prolonged
and painful death.

346
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,712
The crew would also
be adversely affected

347
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,380
if that were to happen.

348
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,549
Well, surely, there are other
options to explore, Doctor.

349
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,427
B'Elanna's DNA, for instance.

350
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,889
It's coded to produce
antibodies against the phage.

351
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,307
Klingon DNA might provide
a vaccine for the disease,

352
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,601
but not a cure.

353
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,062
I'm sorry, Captain.

354
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,397
The space within the force field
is filling with a neural toxin.

355
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,233
It is fast-acting
and merciful.

356
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,610
Turn it off.

357
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,861
That's an order, Doctor!

358
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,905
Please relax
and take deep breaths.

359
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,866
It will be over
more quickly that way.

360
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,701
(<i> gasps</i> )

361
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,703
Computer, delete Emergency
Medical Hologram.

362
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,331
A security code is required
for that command.

363
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,918
Security code:
Janeway-lambda-three.

364
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,252
(<i> gasping</i> )

365
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,130
That code is not recognized.

366
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,258
I'm the Captain.
Delete the EMH.

367
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,845
A security code
is required for that command.

368
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,055
Don't do this.

369
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,724
(<i> gasping</i> )

370
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,851
It isn't right.

371
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,368
Chakotay.

372
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,369
I know.

373
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,789
We're back.
That's it.

374
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,082
That must be the anomaly.

375
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,625
That's what's
behind all this.

376
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,752
It's exerting
a gravitomagnetic force.

377
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,505
We've got to get away from it.
Divert all power to the engines.

378
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,173
Changing course.

379
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,549
We're still being drawn
toward it.

380
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,343
Reverse engines.
Full power.

381
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,678
Structural integrity
is weakening.

382
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,387
Reinforce the hull.

383
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,973
Captain,
maybe we should go in.

384
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,766
No.
Listen to me.

385
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,351
Maybe we're doing this
all wrong.

386
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,103
Maybe the thing to do
is fly into it.

387
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,688
No, I don't believe that.
We've got to get away.

388
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,023
It's going to tear
the shuttle apart.

389
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,357
The hull is breaching.

390
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,568
(<i> panting</i> )

391
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,157
Don't you die
on me, Kathryn.

392
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,867
Chakotay, what's happening?

393
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:05,079
Start breathing!
Breathe, damn it. Breathe!

394
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,373
Don't do this to me,
Kathryn.

395
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,917
Come on, Kathryn--
breathe!

396
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,293
Can't you hear me?

397
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,130
Don't you die on me.
Come on, breathe.

398
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,634
Kathryn, listen to me.
You have to breathe.

399
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,303
Start breathing!
Come on!

400
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,555
Come on!

401
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,515
(<i> panting</i> )

402
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,355
No, Kathryn!

403
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,692
You can't die.

404
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,830
Chakotay, I'm here.

405
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,916
TUVOK:
<i>Voyager</i> to<i> Sacajawea.</i>

406
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,875
<i>Do you read us?</i>

407
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,251
Yes,<i> Voyager.</i>

408
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,293
How far are you?

409
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,503
I have an emergency here.

410
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,629
<i>We're in orbit, Commander.</i>

411
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,297
<i>We've located you,</i>

412
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,133
<i>but transporters</i>
<i>won't function in the storm.</i>

413
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,260
<i>A shuttle is on its way</i>
<i>to the surface now.</i>

414
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,179
The Captain's dead.

415
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,472
We have to get her back
to Sick Bay.

416
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,391
The Doctor may still
be able to revive her.

417
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,227
<i>The away team</i>
<i>should be with you in minutes.</i>

418
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,519
Acknowledged.

419
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,021
I know you can't see me
or hear me.

420
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,647
I don't know what's going on.

421
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,149
But I<i> am</i> here, Chakotay.

422
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,442
I'm not dead.

423
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,487
Kathryn,
we're going to get you back.

424
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,281
Ten milligrams cordrazine.

425
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,076
We'll use it in conjunction
with the cortical stimulator.

426
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,036
Now.

427
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,955
No pulse,
no blood pressure.

428
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,915
Minimum electrical activity
in the mid-brain.

429
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,083
No measurable

430
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,918
response
in the cerebral cortex.

431
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,335
Again.

432
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,257
Doctor, we're getting
a thready pulse.

433
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,550
Quickly. 75 milligrams
inaprovaline.

434
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,676
I'll begin

435
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,221
direct synaptic
stimulation.

436
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,728
(<i> console beeping</i> )

437
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,521
Pulse is weakening.

438
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,898
We're losing her again.

439
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,108
Cortical stimulator.

440
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,734
Now.

441
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,529
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )
No vital signs,

442
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,823
no brain activity.

443
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,241
Again!

444
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:07,910
No change.

445
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,036
Again.
Doctor...

446
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,830
Don't question me.
Again.

447
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,299
Make a note in the log.

448
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,509
Death occurred at 0320 hours.

449
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,972
Cause-- massive
cerebrovascular collapse.

450
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,148
(<i> sighs</i> )

451
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,649
Computer...

452
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,443
confirm Janeway
voice pattern.

453
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,446
Kes,

454
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,656
you're a telepath.

455
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,116
You've been able
to sense things

456
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,617
others can't.

457
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,661
Kes, can you sense me?

458
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,580
DOCTOR:
Kes...

459
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,415
please go to
the science lab

460
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,460
and prepare the
autopsy protocols.

461
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,179
I'm here, Kes.

462
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,931
I'm staying with you
until you realize it.

463
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,105
Captain?

464
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,985
Did you feel that, Kes?

465
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,153
It was me.

466
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,654
Kes to Commander Chakotay.

467
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,447
I need to talk
to you right away.

468
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,201
Maybe it was nothing,

469
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,869
but I had the
strongest feeling

470
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:32,953
that the Captain
was there

471
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,496
in the corridor with me.

472
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,207
It is possible

473
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,042
that in your distress
over the Captain's death,

474
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,668
you imagined that you
were aware of her.

475
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,962
It was more than that,
I'm sure of it.

476
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,630
In the past, Kes
has shown an ability

477
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,840
to detect an unseen presence.

478
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,550
I think we have to take
her seriously.

479
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,302
The Captain's
consciousness

480
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,388
might have phase-shifted
out of our reality.

481
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,724
She could be in some kind of
alternate dimension in subspace.

482
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,393
NEELIX:
We have to find
her somehow.

483
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,894
TORRES:
Harry and I can run

484
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,145
a full subspace sweep.

485
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,605
See if we can come up
with anything.

486
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,190
Get on it.
It's your top priority.

487
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,733
Neelix, help the crew
with this.

488
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,403
Keep their morale up
until we can get some answers.

489
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,154
Yes, sir.
Right away.

490
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,656
TUVOK:
Commander,
I suggest I work with Kes.

491
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,659
I may help her increase
the range of her perceptions.

492
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,622
Good idea.
Tom, we'll take duty stations.

493
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,252
That's more like it.

494
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,506
I've reconfigured
the lateral sensor array

495
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,008
to scan subspace.

496
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,094
Don't forget
to run a magneton sweep.

497
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,012
The forward array
is ready to scan

498
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,222
for temporal phase shifting--

499
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,599
chroniton particles
or field flux.

500
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,978
I'm going to activate
the magneton scanner.

501
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,314
It might pick up
an anomalous presence.

502
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,485
Now what?

503
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,170
Daddy?

504
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,134
Who are you?

505
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,635
Are you responsible for
what's going on here?

506
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,429
You know who I am,
Kathryn.

507
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,307
My father died
over 15 years ago.

508
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,059
Yes. Drowned under
the polar ice cap

509
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,644
on Tau Ceti Prime.

510
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,396
It was devastating
to you.

511
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,773
You may be an hallucination
or some kind of projection

512
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,234
of my own imagination,
but you are not my father.

513
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,154
Kathryn, Kathryn.

514
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,115
I raised you to be
a doubter and a skeptic,

515
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,243
to look at the world
with a scientist's eye,

516
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,205
but in this instance,
that won't work.

517
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,208
Why not? If you know
what's going on here, tell me.

518
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,792
Isn't it clear?

519
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,211
You're dead.

520
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,838
You died
in that shuttle crash.

521
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,048
No, no, no.

522
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,174
That's not possible.

523
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,385
I understand
your confusion--

524
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,845
your refusal to accept
what's happened.

525
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,431
I went through the same thing
after my accident.

526
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,141
What do you mean?

527
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,061
I went back to you
and your mother and your sister

528
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,230
after I died
for a long time,

529
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,482
until I realized it was futile.

530
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,275
That's what happens

531
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,902
when death
is unexpected.

532
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,197
One's consciousness
isn't prepared to let go.

533
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,699
"Consciousness"? Is that what
you're calling me--

534
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,743
"Kathryn's consciousness"?

535
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,286
For want of a better word.

536
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,288
Some say "ghost" or "spirit."

537
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,416
We all heard the stories
and thought they were

538
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,625
the product
of vivid imaginations

539
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,669
or self-induced hysteria.

540
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,173
I'll admit, I was surprised
when I found they were true.

541
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,552
If you stayed with me
after you died,

542
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:37,555
you should be able
to tell me what happened then.

543
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,390
You were so grief stricken,

544
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,641
you fell into
a terrible depression.

545
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,811
You spent months in bed
sleeping away your days,

546
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,106
rather than confronting
your feelings.

547
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,566
I'm not sure what
would have happened

548
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,775
if your sister
hadn't forced you

549
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,527
into the real world again.

550
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,487
If you are an hallucination,
a part of me,

551
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,612
you'd know those things.

552
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,073
Kathryn,

553
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,410
remember-- several times
after I died, you woke up

554
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,827
thinking I was
in the room with you.

555
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,038
You told your sister
it felt absolutely real.

556
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,584
That's because it was real.

557
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,252
I was there
trying to convince you

558
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,753
to get on with your life.

559
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,922
Just for the sake
of argument,

560
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,924
let's say you're right.

561
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,217
What's next?

562
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,676
That's up to you.

563
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,220
Eventually, you will cross over.

564
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,637
The only question is

565
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,765
how long it will take you
to give up this world.

566
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,183
Cross over to where?

567
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,061
I don't know what to call it.

568
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:31,358
Another state of
consciousness...

569
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,903
unlike anything we ever
could have imagined in life.

570
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,031
It's not a frightening
place, Kathryn.

571
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:42,161
It's full of joy
and indescribable wonder.

572
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,703
Kes sensed I was here.

573
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,456
They're looking for me.

574
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:48,584
People have felt the presence
of ghosts throughout the ages,

575
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,128
but the technology
to find them

576
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,255
still hasn't been invented.

577
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,090
They won't give up easily.

578
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,426
But they will
give up eventually.

579
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,970
They'll accept
what's happened

580
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,223
and that's
what you have to do.

581
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,975
Kes did it once.
She can do it again.

582
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,352
I'm going to help her.

583
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,937
If that's what you feel
you need to do,

584
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,814
I understand.

585
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,616
Let us try one more time.

586
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,829
Open yourself
to the impressions around you,

587
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,583
the thoughts, the minds
that are on this ship.

588
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,919
All the minds
that are on this ship.

589
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,465
I hear them.

590
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,091
So many voices.

591
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,010
They are a turbulent storm,

592
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,762
and you are the one
who must rise above the tempest

593
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:46,225
to a place that is quiet.

594
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,185
It's difficult.

595
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,397
You must lift yourself from
the confusion of the storm.

596
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,358
Soar into the quiet space

597
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:59,071
among the stars
where everything is still.

598
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,782
Yes, I'm in that place now.

599
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,826
Is there a voice
that you can hear--

600
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:09,707
a single voice isolated
in the stillness?

601
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,709
Kes, I'm here.

602
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,044
Focus on me, on my voice.

603
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,880
TUVOK:
There are
only two beings

604
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,550
in the void--
you and Captain Janeway.

605
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,761
Nothing else exists
that can interfere.

606
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,346
Can you hear her voice,

607
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,056
however faintly?

608
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,016
I'm trying.

609
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,602
Is there anything,

610
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,104
any presence
in the void with you?

611
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,485
I don't think so.
I can't hear anything.

612
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,945
Kes, keep trying.

613
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,780
You have to find me.

614
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,240
Now, I am with you,

615
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,451
moving through the quiet space,

616
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,787
my thoughts
joined with yours,

617
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,164
extending the range
of the search.

618
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,460
Tuvok, surely you must know
I'm here.

619
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,755
We've shared so much.

620
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,259
I'm just not getting anything.

621
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,220
Nor am I.

622
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,389
I felt empty...

623
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,433
alone.

624
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,643
Maybe you're right.

625
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,227
What I sensed
wasn't the Captain.

626
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,438
It was me wanting to
believe she wasn't dead.

627
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:18,942
We've been trying
for three days without success,

628
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,195
nor have Lieutenant Torres
and Ensign Kim found

629
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,281
any indication
that the Captain is alive.

630
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,785
There is a point
at which we must accept

631
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:30,203
the inevitability of her death.

632
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,376
Thank you for helping.

633
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,879
I don't think I would have
accepted it if you hadn't

634
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,465
at least tried.

635
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,676
Good night.

636
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:49,807
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

637
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,814
Tactical Officer's Log,
supplemental.

638
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:00,609
My attempt to help Kes
detect the Captain's presence

639
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,319
has ended in failure.

640
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,031
I am forced to conclude
that we have, in fact,

641
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,325
lost Kathryn Janeway.

642
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,577
I would like the record to show

643
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,456
that I have lost
a good friend as well,

644
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:18,377
one whom I can
never replace.

645
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,295
Oh, Tuvok.

646
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,921
They all love you,
Kathryn.

647
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,050
It's going to be
hard for them.

648
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,218
This can't be happening.

649
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,386
I don't believe it.

650
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,262
Because you don't want to.

651
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,518
Tomorrow, it will
become easier.

652
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,189
My memorial service.

653
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:43,610
TORRES:
When I came to this ship,
I resented the fact

654
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,696
that Captain Janeway
was responsible

655
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:49,115
for our being stranded here
in the Delta Quadrant.

656
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,245
I didn't think that she made
the right decision

657
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:59,167
and I<i> certainly</i> didn't want
to serve under her command.

658
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,919
In the beginning,

659
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,506
I fought her.

660
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,760
Even when she made me
Chief Engineer, I...

661
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,803
I didn't trust her reasons.

662
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,557
I kept looking for
a hidden agenda.

663
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:17,811
I actually believed
that she'd set me up to fail.

664
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,022
Well, I couldn't
have been more wrong.

665
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:25,360
She saw...
she saw something in me

666
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,945
that I didn't see.

667
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,322
She saw a worthwhile person

668
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,535
where I saw a lost
and hostile misfit,

669
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,871
and because she
had faith in me,

670
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:39,040
I began to have
faith in myself

671
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,459
and when she died,

672
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,960
the first thing I thought

673
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,503
was that I couldn't
do this without her,

674
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,882
that I needed her too badly--

675
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,762
her strength and her compassion,

676
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,222
but then I realized

677
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:58,143
that the gift that she gave me--
and gave a lot of us here--

678
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,563
was the knowledge
that we are better

679
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,190
and stronger than we think.

680
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,987
I wish I had said
these things to her.

681
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,866
I wish I had
taken the time.

682
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,588
Would anyone else
like to say something?

683
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,006
KIM:
I would, sir.

684
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,390
I know Captain Janeway
wouldn't want us

685
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,225
to be sitting around moping.

686
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,354
She'd want us to be
cheering each other up,

687
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,897
remembering
the good times,

688
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,398
like the away mission

689
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,360
when we found all those
bushes of overripe fruit.

690
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,737
I must have eaten half a kilo.

691
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,949
My hands and mouth
were all purple

692
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,243
and the Captain...

693
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,377
The Captain came
and sat down next to me,

694
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:09,422
and her mouth
was all stained, too.

695
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,092
She put her arm
around my shoulder...

696
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,765
and she said...

697
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,438
she said...

698
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,651
"Ensign,

699
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,112
these are the times
we have to remember."

700
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,325
It...

701
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,998
it's... Sorry.

702
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,008
I know this hasn't been easy,

703
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,635
but I think we'll all
be better for it.

704
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,472
We will honor the Captain
one last time.

705
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,064
Release the pod.

706
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:12,318
(<i> whistle sounds</i> )

707
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,085
Ensign Kim was right
when he said

708
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:30,045
the Captain wouldn't
want us to be sad.

709
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,213
Neelix has prepared some food

710
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,092
and it would be nice
if we could all get together

711
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,803
and share the good times
we had with Captain Janeway.

712
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,939
It's over, Kathryn.

713
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,357
There's nothing
left for you here.

714
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,610
Come with me.

715
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,955
What do I do
to leave here?

716
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,039
Just decide.

717
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,749
The only thing
that keeps you

718
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,626
is your refusal to leave.

719
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,796
You may be right in everything
you've said to me,

720
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,173
but I'm not ready
to accept it.

721
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,383
I'm not ready to go.

722
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,346
My poor little bird.

723
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,890
You always made it
hard for yourself.

724
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,391
If there was
a rocky path

725
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,560
and a smooth
one, you chose

726
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,395
the rocky one every time.

727
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,480
If I stay,

728
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,399
maybe it'll be
easier for them.

729
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,234
Maybe I could be
comforting somehow.

730
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,155
You're saying all
the things I told myself

731
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,157
when I refused
to leave you.

732
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:43,409
I was hoping you wouldn't
have to go through that.

733
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:48,165
It's a horrible
existence, Kathryn.

734
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,417
As time wears on,
you begin to see

735
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:56,631
how potent, how destructive
loneliness is.

736
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,385
You'll see the people you love
going on with their lives,

737
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,180
doing all the things
you used to share with them,

738
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,223
but you won't be
a part of it anymore.

739
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,685
You'll be forever
shut out of their existence.

740
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,147
It becomes agonizing.

741
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,025
I don't want that
to happen to you.

742
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,028
Maybe that's
what it'll take

743
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,571
for me to make
this decision.

744
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,032
I just know that
now I'm not ready.

745
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,034
What can I do
to convince you?

746
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:27,620
Nothing. I can't--
I won't-- abandon them.

747
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,247
We're too much
a part of each other.

748
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,582
Can't you see that?

749
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,501
We've been through
so much together.

750
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,795
I have to know what's
going to happen to them--

751
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:40,008
to see Kes continue
to grow and learn...

752
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:43,053
to know if Tom and B'Elanna
will ever stop

753
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,554
sparring
with each other

754
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,389
and develop
a real friendship.

755
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,308
You can only be an
observer of their lives,

756
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,518
never a participant.

757
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,978
I don't care.

758
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,189
I'd rather be here in spirit
than not at all.

759
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,982
A Captain doesn't abandon ship.

760
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,068
Every hour you stay here,

761
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,903
makes it that much
more difficult to leave.

762
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,487
Why are you pushing me?

763
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,989
I've made up my mind.

764
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,657
I'm staying here.

765
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,159
The cortical stimulator
is working.

766
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,535
I'm getting
a weak pulse.

767
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,745
She's coming back.

768
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,788
I'll use cordrazine

769
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,164
along with
the stimulator.

770
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,498
What was that?

771
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,499
What happened?

772
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,918
What do you mean?

773
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,254
I saw Tuvok and Chakotay
and the Doctor.

774
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,838
Here?

775
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,048
No, it was different.

776
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,216
As though...

777
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,260
as though I were
looking up at them.

778
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,470
An hallucination,
like the others.

779
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,013
It didn't feel
like the others.

780
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,389
I didn't see myself.

781
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,433
I was looking up at them.

782
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,230
That's the real me, isn't it?

783
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,566
Lying on the ground
on that planet dying.

784
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,736
And this is
the hallucination.

785
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,155
<i>This</i> isn't real.

786
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,614
More denial.

787
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,616
You're only making it
harder on yourself.

788
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,161
You're trying very hard
to convince me to come with you.

789
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:51,746
Why is that? If what
you're saying is true,

790
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,207
why not let me come to
the decision on my own?

791
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:57,169
I'm trying to spare you
unnecessary pain.

792
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,213
My father
would never act like this.

793
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,133
He always believed
I had to learn my own lessons,

794
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,884
make my own mistakes.

795
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,762
He never tried
to shield me from life.

796
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:12,475
Why would he try
to shield me from death?

797
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,393
You're not my father.

798
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,856
I could be imagining you,
but I don't think so.

799
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,525
You have such a specific agenda.

800
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,820
You're determined
that I go with you somewhere.

801
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,613
Who are you?

802
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,034
I'm trying to help you.
Stop fighting me.

803
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,329
Are you an alien being
of some kind?

804
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,622
Is that it?

805
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,541
Her eyes are open.

806
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,044
Vital signs are responding.
Blood pressure is 60/30.

807
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,004
But the entity is still
inhabiting her cerebral cortex,

808
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,630
impeding your treatment.

809
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,090
Kathryn, hang on.
We're bringing you back.

810
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,009
Just fight a little longer.

811
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,426
Direct synaptic
stimulation

812
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,179
might drive out
the alien presence.

813
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,472
I was right.

814
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,267
I heard Tuvok and Chakotay
and the Doctor.

815
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,727
You're an alien.

816
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,021
You've created all
these hallucinations,

817
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,022
haven't you?

818
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,982
This is what
my species does.

819
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,901
At the moment
just before death,

820
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,737
one of us comes to help you
understand what's happening...

821
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,281
to make the crossing over
an occasion of joy.

822
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,783
And what is that?

823
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,118
Our matrix--

824
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,246
where your consciousness
will live.

825
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,538
I was being truthful

826
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,498
when I said it was
a place of wonder.

827
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,335
It can be
whatever you want it to be.

828
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,338
Then why didn't you tell me this
from the beginning?

829
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,006
Why pretend to be my father?

830
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,759
Usually people are comforted
to see their loved ones.

831
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,096
It makes the crossing over
a much less fearful occasion.

832
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,472
I've done this many times,

833
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,975
but I've never
encountered someone

834
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,894
so resistant.

835
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,396
Something's happening.

836
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,147
The alien presence is
getting stronger again.

837
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,400
Fight it, Kathryn, fight it
just a little longer.

838
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,985
I'll have to try
a thoron pulse.

839
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,445
My people are
telling me to fight.

840
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,030
They're trying
to save me.

841
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,282
They're trying
out of desperation.

842
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,741
It's hopeless.

843
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,076
You're the one
who sounds desperate.

844
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,535
I don't get the feeling

845
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,495
you're trying to make
me comfortable.

846
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,623
You're only interested in my
agreeing to come with you.

847
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,250
Because it's inevitable.

848
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,877
And you don't strike me
as any kind of good Samaritan.

849
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,503
You're more like a vulture,

850
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,714
preying on people at
the moment of their death

851
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,091
when they're
most vulnerable.

852
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,759
I've waited for you.
I've been patient.

853
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,970
But your patience
is wearing thin.

854
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,264
What's the real reason you
want me in that matrix?

855
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,641
Somehow I don't think
it has anything to do

856
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,143
with everlasting joy.

857
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,062
You must go with me.

858
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,856
If you could force me to go,
you'd have done it already.

859
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,984
You need me to agree,
don't you?

860
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,860
I have to go voluntarily.

861
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,154
Wouldn't that be better

862
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,655
than standing here
in this endless debate?

863
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,115
Let me tell you this.

864
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,492
We can stand here
for all eternity

865
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,121
and I will never
choose to go with you.

866
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,916
You're in a dangerous
profession, Captain.

867
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,335
You face death every day.

868
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,836
There'll be another time,

869
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,171
and I'll be waiting.

870
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,172
Eventually,

871
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,923
you'll come into my matrix

872
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:54,553
and you will nourish me
for a long, long time.

873
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,684
Go back to hell, coward.

874
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,398
Kathryn?

875
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,732
I'm no longer detecting
the alien presence.

876
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,193
Vital signs
are responding.

877
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,862
Blood pressure
110/65.

878
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,031
(<i> moans</i> )

879
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,995
Doctor...

880
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,538
what happened?

881
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,874
Perhaps you can
explain, Commander.

882
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,376
You and I were caught
in a magnetic storm

883
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,502
and crashed here.

884
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:26,919
You were badly injured.

885
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,838
The Doctor just arrived
on a shuttle with Tuvok

886
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:29,839
and began treating you.

887
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,632
As he was doing so,

888
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,093
we detected an alien presence
within your cerebral cortex.

889
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,888
It appeared to be preventing
our attempts to heal you.

890
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,556
Eventually
it was dislodged,

891
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,476
but there were a number of times
I thought we'd lost you.

892
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,354
But each time,
you seemed to fight back.

893
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,315
He kept telling me to let go,
but I wouldn't.

894
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,774
"He"?

895
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,068
My fa...

896
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,112
The alien.

897
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,323
He wanted to take me
into another place.

898
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:00,370
Another place?
Some kind of afterlife?

899
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:07,043
Maybe,
but I can tell you this--

900
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,003
from what I saw,

901
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:13,091
it's certainly not where
I'd like to spend eternity.

902
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,636
(<i> Janeway groans</i> )

903
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,065
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50518.6.</i>

904
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,151
<i>The Doctor</i>
<i>has examined me thoroughly</i>

905
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,195
<i>and pronounced me</i>
<i>physically fit,</i>

906
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,905
<i>but I'll admit that it will</i>
<i>take a little longer</i>

907
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,949
<i>to work through</i>
<i>the emotional impact</i>

908
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,784
<i>of my experience.</i>

909
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,160
(<i> door chimes</i> )

910
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,288
Come in.

911
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,457
I could have sworn I
heard the Doctor tell you

912
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:46,999
to take it easy
for a few days.

913
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,168
Taking it easy usually
makes me feel worse.

914
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,545
You shouldn't
push yourself.

915
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:51,754
You've been
through a lot.

916
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,506
Aw...

917
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,885
To tell you the truth,

918
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,555
I'd rather stay busy
than dwell on what happened.

919
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,308
I can understand that.

920
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,977
I can't help thinking about it--
that alien, his matrix.

921
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,480
He was like the spider

922
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,815
who has to lure a fly
into his web.

923
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,733
Do you think it's possible

924
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,777
that each of the
near-death experiences

925
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,779
we've heard about
are the result

926
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,156
of an alien inhabitation?

927
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,617
That's a little hard
to believe.

928
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:23,244
I hope so.

929
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,413
I'd prefer to think
his species was unique

930
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,539
to the Delta Quadrant

931
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,458
and that I've seen
the last of him.

932
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,502
I'm sure that's the case.

933
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,545
After going head-to-head
with Kathryn Janeway,

934
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,839
he must have realized
he'd met his match.

935
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,258
Come on, Chakotay.

936
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,845
I cheated death.

937
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,097
That's worth a celebration,
don't you think?

938
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,017
A bottle of champagne...
moonlight sail on Lake George.

939
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,310
How does that sound?

940
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,021
Like something
worth living for.

941
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,150
