1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,419
(<i> knock at door</i> )

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,921
Just a minute.

3
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:06,298
I'll... I'll,
I'll be right there.

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,765
(<i> knocking</i> )

5
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,934
I'm coming. I'm coming.

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,149
Deanna!

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,442
Hello, Reg.

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,735
I'm so glad you could make it.

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,112
It's wonderful to see you.

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,407
Would it be all right
if I came inside?

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,201
Yeah. Of course.
Of course!

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,953
Come in,
come in.

13
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,372
Is-is there something
I can get you?

14
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:42,083
Some, um, some
coffee? Tea?

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,253
Oh, wait a minute.
Don't... don't tell me.

16
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,172
Chocolate ice cream.

17
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,424
You know me too well.

18
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,593
But just one scoop.
I'm watching my figure.

19
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,847
Why?! You...
you look lovely.

20
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,683
You always knew
how to flatter me.

21
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,562
Would you like me
to get it?

22
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,480
Get... get what?

23
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,358
The ice cream.
Right! Right!
The ice cream.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,028
No, no. No, no, no.
Come in, come in.

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,362
Sit down...

26
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,113
make yourself
comfortable.

27
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,829
It's a nice place.
Thanks.

28
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,122
One scoop of
chocolate ice cream.

29
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,666
Did you just move in?

30
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,252
No, no.
I've been here, uh...

31
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,712
almost two years.

32
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,715
I just haven't
had a chance to unpack.

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,886
Is everything
all right, Reg?

34
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,304
Of course.
Why, why wouldn't it be?

35
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,266
To be honest, you seem
a little on edge.

36
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,269
Do I? Oh, oh,
it's just that I'm...

37
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,604
I'm excited
to see you.

38
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,564
I'm excited
to see you, too.

39
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,524
I think Geordi's
a little disappointed

40
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,444
I didn't invite
him to come along.

41
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,947
Yes, I... well,
I-I was hoping to get...

42
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,531
get together with him, too,

43
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,117
uh, before the<i> Enterprise</i>
leaves orbit,

44
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,245
but I just wanted to spend
some time with you first.

45
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,830
That's all right,
isn't it?

46
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,123
Of course it is.

47
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,798
I hear you've been working
on the Pathfinder Project.

48
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,049
Well, I...

49
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,509
I<i> was,</i> uh...

50
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,344
I'm not anymore.

51
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,638
What happened?

52
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,390
Oh, uh...
nothing... really.

53
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,435
Just got to be
a lot of, uh...

54
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,895
pressure.

55
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,021
Well, hello!

56
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,773
Neelix!

57
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,650
Oh, he's not used
to company. Oh.

58
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,486
It's not polite
to eat our guest's food.

59
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,696
If you're hungry,
just say so.

60
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,658
Deanna, uh, Neelix.

61
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,493
Neelix?

62
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,536
That's an unusual name.

63
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,372
Maybe we should introduce him

64
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,125
to Data's cat, Spot.

65
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,709
(<i> chuckles</i> )

66
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,169
(<i> sighs</i> )

67
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:54,883
I have a feeling
you didn't ask me here
to reminisce.

68
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,718
Tell me what's wrong.

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,262
(<i> sighs</i> )

70
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,519
I've lost myself, Deanna.

71
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,022
Lost yourself?

72
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,566
In<i> Voyager.</i>

73
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,820
I've become obsessed

74
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,655
with<i> Voyager.</i>

75
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,725
Here you are
on shore leave,
and what do I do?

76
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,104
I lure you into
a counseling session.

77
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,523
Don't worry about that.
The important thing is

78
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,651
I'm here now,
and I want to help.

79
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,194
Thank you.

80
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,487
Now...

81
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,614
start at the beginning.

82
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,242
Has it ever occurred to you

83
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,244
that a tachyon beam

84
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,370
directed at a class-B
itinerant pulsar

85
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,040
could produce
enough gravimetric energy

86
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,168
to create an artificial
singularity?

87
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,752
I can't say it has.

88
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,629
It occurred to me,

89
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,883
but my supervisors thought
it was an abuse of MIDAS.

90
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,510
MIDAS?

91
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,886
The, uh, Mutara Interdimensional

92
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,554
Deep Space
Transponder Array.

93
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,723
Reg, you're losing me.

94
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,017
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,977
The beginning.

96
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,813
The beginning-- right.

97
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,485
Well, I suppose it all started
in the holodeck.

98
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,445
Doesn't it always?

99
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,823
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Go on.

100
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,574
Well...

101
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,327
I...

102
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,745
<i>I was running</i>
<i>a few simulations.</i>

103
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,499
Computer, boost the gain
on<i> Voyager's</i> transceiver
by 20 percent.

104
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,085
<i>Transceiver gain is at maximum.</i>

105
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,882
Apply a narrowband filter
to the signal processor.

106
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,466
<i>Filter engaged.</i>

107
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
MAN:
Voyager,<i> come in.</i>

108
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,306
<i>Come in,</i> Voyager.

109
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,765
Voyager,<i> come in.</i>

110
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,809
<i>This is Starfleet Command.</i>

111
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,394
Voyager,
<i>come in,</i> Voyager.

112
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,564
Good. Good, good.

113
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,941
Now, lower the filter band
by .3 kilohertz.

114
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,777
Reg, what
are you doing?

115
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,029
Oh.

116
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,698
Uh, um, Pete.

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,742
I-I-I was just, uh...

118
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,952
Yes, running
another simulation.
I can see that.

119
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,954
What about
the transmitter diagnostics?

120
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,748
Right. The diagnostics.

121
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,583
You have finished them,
haven't you?

122
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,459
Uh... almost.

123
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,795
Almost isn't good enough.

124
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,548
We've got Admiral Paris
first thing in the morning.

125
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,841
Admiral Paris?

126
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,301
Don't tell me
you forgot.

127
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,053
Oh, no, of-of...
of course not.

128
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,305
I-I-I just got
the days mixed up.

129
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,765
Reg!

130
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,892
Computer, end program.

131
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,937
Now that I think about it,
it's a good thing

132
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,106
that Admiral Paris
is coming tomorrow.

133
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,108
We can brief
the Admiral
on my theory.

134
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,984
What theory?
I've been going over

135
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,446
the interstellar
phenomena forecasts
from Deep Space 9.

136
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,531
They are predicting, uh,

137
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,951
a class-B
itinerant pulsar

138
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,995
will pass within
four billion kilometers

139
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,956
of the MIDAS Array
in three days.

140
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,540
You think the pulsar
might damage the Array?

141
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,376
No, no. The
shields will hold.

142
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,002
Actually, I was thinking, uh,

143
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,796
we could use the pulsar
to our own advantage.

144
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,589
How?
Suppose...

145
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,925
suppose we instructed
the Array to direct

146
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,552
a tachyon beam
at the pulsar.

147
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,181
Theoretically, we could
produce a gravimetric surge

148
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,893
powerful enough to create
an artificial wormhole.

149
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,272
We could establish
two-way communication

150
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,648
with<i> Voyager.</i>

151
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,150
Reg, you're dreaming again.

152
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,692
No, no, I-I really think
this could work.

153
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,361
Based on
my simulations, that...

154
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,529
Based on your last series
of simulations,

155
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,616
we wasted six months
trying to develop
that transwarp probe.

156
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,785
This... this is
different. This...

157
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,831
Reg... I really appreciate
your imagination.

158
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,541
It's what makes you such
a valuable part of this team,

159
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,461
but I'm not about to tell
the Admiral

160
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,463
that we've found a way
for him to chat with his son

161
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,967
because of some
cockeyed theory that
only exists up here.

162
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,053
Now, please,
finish those diagnostics.

163
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,513
Yes, sir.

164
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,646
And, Reg, remember--

165
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,358
while the Admiral's here,
<i>I do the talking.</i>

166
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,734
You do the talking.
Understood.

167
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,780
<i>Pete was only trying</i>
<i>to look out for me,</i>

168
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,616
<i>but I was sure</i>
<i>my plan would work.</i>

169
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,702
<i>I, I just couldn't</i>
<i>give it up.</i>

170
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,172
Burning the midnight oil.

171
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,217
I-I finished, uh,
the diagnostics, sir.

172
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,676
Yes. I know.

173
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,553
I looked them over.

174
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,013
Good job.

175
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,521
Well, why don't you
call it a day?

176
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,524
I just, uh, have
a few more things

177
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,150
to take care of.

178
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,569
Well, see you
tomorrow, then.

179
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,991
Oh. Reg, why don't, um...

180
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,161
why don't you
drop by tonight
when you're through here?

181
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,579
"Drop by"?

182
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,788
Come to the house.

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,207
Have some coffee.

184
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,292
Angie's sister
is in from Boston.

185
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,960
I, uh...

186
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,587
I think she might like you.

187
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:52,759
I-I don't, I don't think I...
can, uh...

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,012
I'm spending the evening
with, um...

189
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,638
Neelix.

190
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,682
Correct me if I'm wrong, Reg,

191
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,684
but Neelix is your cat.

192
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,229
(<i> sighs</i> )

193
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,274
Well, if you change your mind.

194
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,025
Thanks.

195
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,152
I'll... I'll try.

196
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,782
<i>But I couldn't leave,</i>
<i>not until I'd</i>
<i>strengthened my case</i>

197
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,742
<i>for accessing</i>
<i>the MIDAS Array.</i>

198
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,411
<i>The meeting</i>
<i>with Admiral Paris</i>

199
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,995
<i>was only 14 hours away,</i>

200
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,039
<i>and I hadn't come up</i>
<i>with anything.</i>

201
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>Poring over the data</i>
<i>wasn't helping.</i>

202
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:31,089
<i>I decided that</i>
<i>what I needed was, um...</i>

203
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,133
<i>a little inspiration.</i>

204
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,801
Computer...

205
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,512
activate hologrid
Mess Hall scenario

206
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,222
Barclay 11-Gamma.

207
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,643
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

208
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,813
Hey, Reg.

209
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,273
Warning. The
shark is circling.

210
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,567
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Let the games begin.

211
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,027
What'll it be, Reg?
The usual.

212
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,071
Computer,
one milk, warm.

213
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,573
Oh, thanks, Harry.

214
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,783
Just trying to get
on your good side,

215
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,701
so you'll go easy
on me tonight.

216
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,329
Ah, you know
what I always say--

217
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,414
if you can't stand
the heat...

218
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,500
Get out of the warp core.

219
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,503
Sit down, Lieutenant,
and give us mortals
a chance to get even.

220
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,878
That's an order.

221
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,922
If you insist, Commander,

222
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,467
but I think it's only fair to
warn you I have no intention

223
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,344
of letting my winning streak
come to an end.

224
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,930
Now, where's,
um, Tuvok?

225
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,725
He said it's illogical
to continue losing to
a clearly superior player.

226
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,353
Oh, that's too bad.

227
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,687
I<i> love</i> to watch
that Vulcan squirm.

228
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,815
Now, you all
know the rules.

229
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,109
Deuces, one-eyed jacks
and suicide kings are wild.

230
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,363
Five of a kind beats
a straight flush every time.

231
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,072
The man is
ruthless.
He's a killer.

232
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,698
Now, come on, guys.

233
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,369
You know it hurts me
to see you lose.

234
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,747
After all,
you are my best friends.

235
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,752
<i>I'd hoped that</i>
<i>the poker game would</i>
<i>help calm my nerves,</i>

236
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,005
<i>so that I could get</i>
<i>a decent night's sleep</i>

237
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,884
<i>before the briefing,</i>
<i>but when I got home</i>
<i>that night,</i>

238
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,719
<i>I couldn't keep my mind</i>
<i>off of</i> Voyager.

239
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,348
<i>I needed to get back</i>
<i>to the holodeck.</i>

240
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,561
(<i> Barclay groaning</i> )

241
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,396
That feels so good.

242
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,898
Therapeutic massage
can be an effective treatment

243
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,774
for insomnia, Lieutenant.

244
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,985
But we need to get to the cause
of your sleeplessness

245
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,779
if we're going to find
a more permanent solution.

246
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,616
It's just that every time
I-I close my eyes,

247
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,077
my mind starts to race.

248
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,828
Can you be more specific?

249
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,914
Well, I worry about the project.

250
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,625
Have I explored the problem
from every angle,

251
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,253
or is there something else
I should be trying?

252
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,962
Am I doing enough?

253
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,839
Hmm.

254
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,342
Acute work-related anxiety.

255
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,095
Perhaps I should speak
to the Captain about
reducing your schedule.

256
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,557
Oh, something tells me
she's not going to be able
to help.

257
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,936
You are an invaluable
member of this
crew, Mr. Barclay.

258
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,730
Thank you, Doctor.

259
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,648
It's nice to be appreciated.

260
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,982
Hmm.

261
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,235
Oh!

262
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,780
Turning in, Reg?
Yes, sir.

263
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,617
Hey, Reg.

264
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,911
<i>For some reason, I never</i>
<i>slept in my apartment</i>

265
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,749
<i>as comfortably as I did</i>
<i>in my holographic quarters.</i>

266
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,793
<i>I suppose I felt more</i>
<i>at home on</i> Voyager.

267
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,379
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

268
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,065
Good morning, everyone.

269
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,109
Morning, Reg.
You're awfully chipper.

270
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,069
Ah... slept like a baby.

271
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,613
KIM:
Then maybe you've got
the energy to whip up

272
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,323
one of your famous
cheese omelets.

273
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,366
Oh, yeah.
I'm starved.
I'm sorry, guys.

274
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,951
I have a very important
briefing at 0900.

275
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,579
Just have time
for coffee.

276
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,623
Uh, don't forget
about tonight.

277
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,583
Uh... remind me.

278
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,502
You were supposed
to teach me how to
play velocity.

279
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,086
No. No way.

280
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,963
Reg and I have
a hoverball game scheduled.

281
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,174
Don't fight.
Plenty of me to go around.

282
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,427
Reg... I'm sorry
to bother you again,

283
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,845
but I'm still having trouble
with the warp core
recalibration.

284
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,808
It's no problem. I'll
stop by Engineering later
and talk you through it.

285
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,184
Thank you.

286
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,394
I really
appreciate it.

287
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:17,315
Velocity, hoverball,
warp core recalibrations?

288
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,484
Reg, I don't know
how you do it.

289
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,529
Let you in on a little secret.

290
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,656
There's two of me.

291
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:31,120
HARKINS:
The Delta Quadrant,
Sector 41751, Grid 9.

292
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,165
<i>Voyager's</i> Doctor
reported this
as the ship's position

293
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,543
when his program was
briefly transferred

294
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,252
to Starfleet two years ago.

295
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,421
Assuming they're still
on course for Earth,

296
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:44,050
we've been able to extrapolate
a range of likely trajectories.

297
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,803
Estimating an average
warp speed of 6.2

298
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:50,724
and accounting for various
astronomical obstacles...

299
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,521
we can reasonably assume
that<i> Voyager</i>

300
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,106
is now in one of
these three sectors.

301
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,983
Can we contact them?

302
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,069
As you know, we've been
working with the Vulcans

303
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,363
on the deployment
of the MIDAS Array.

304
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,283
Though we're still
in the testing phase,

305
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,494
we think it won't be
long before we can
use this technology

306
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:15,122
to send signals at
hyper-subspace speeds.

307
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,584
A message that would
normally take years

308
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,711
to reach its destination
could be received

309
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,629
by<i> Voyager</i> in
a matter of days.

310
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,673
Impressive.

311
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,717
Will they be able to respond?

312
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,552
No, sir,

313
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,930
but at least they'll know
we're still looking for them.

314
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,557
We'll send data

315
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,225
on the hyper-subspace
technology

316
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,143
and hope they can
eventually use it

317
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,645
to return the call.

318
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,480
Excuse me, Admiral Paris.

319
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,691
Lieutenant Barclay...
I-I'm sorry, Commander.

320
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,819
It's just that there may<i> be</i>
a way to establish, uh,

321
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,238
two-way communication
with<i> Voyager.</i>

322
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,198
Now is not the time.

323
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,033
It's all right,
Mr. Harkins.

324
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,369
Let the man speak.

325
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,954
I'm all ears, son.

326
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,164
Well, um...

327
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,960
Well, you see, there's a, uh,

328
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,505
a class-B
itinerant, uh, pulsar

329
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:09,385
uh, and... well-well,
as you probably know, s-sir,

330
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,764
uh, neutrino emissions, uh...

331
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,557
oh.

332
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:18,227
What I mean to say is

333
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,524
that<i> with</i> the Array,
we could open an artificial

334
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:28,655
uh, uh... a... sing...

335
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,907
a sing, uh, sing-singularity.

336
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,283
A wormhole?

337
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,243
Yes! Yes, sir.

338
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:39,415
We could use it as a conduit
to-to talk to<i> Voyager.</i>

339
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,918
I can't give you high marks
for clarity, Lieutenant,

340
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,170
but you've certainly got
my attention.

341
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,631
Is there any merit
to what he's saying?

342
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,926
Mr. Barclay has a tendency
to get ahead of himself, sir.

343
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,763
Unfortunately,
what he's suggesting
is beyond our abilities.

344
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,307
But you haven't even...
Mr. Barclay!

345
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,560
I know that I haven't
explained myself, uh, very well,

346
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:03,940
but with all due respect, sir,
what do we have
to lose by trying?

347
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:09,069
I think we're forgetting
that there are 150<i> people</i>

348
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,739
stranded in
the Delta Quadrant.

349
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,243
I have a son
on that ship, Lieutenant.

350
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,789
I haven't forgotten that fact
for a single moment.

351
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,582
I'm sorry, sir.

352
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,501
I-I didn't, uh...
I didn't mean to...

353
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,712
Take the rest of
the day off, Reg.

354
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,340
But...
That was<i> not</i> a suggestion.

355
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,270
TROI:
<i>How did you deal with</i>
<i>your feelings afterwards?</i>

356
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,772
What do you mean?

357
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,316
Well... did you talk
to Commander Harkins

358
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,610
after the meeting...
apologize?

359
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,488
Well... no.

360
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,325
I wanted to, uh,
fine tune my plan,

361
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,913
so, I-I just went
right back to work.

362
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,497
Be more specific.

363
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,833
What exactly
did you do?

364
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,418
Well, I...

365
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,503
needed someone to, uh...

366
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,088
bounce ideas off of,

367
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,131
someone to help focus
my thoughts.

368
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:15,428
Sounds reasonable.
I suppose you... consulted

369
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,138
with some of your
Pathfinder colleagues.

370
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,182
Well...

371
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,602
not exactly.

372
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,854
You went back to the holodeck,
didn't you?

373
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,898
They're the only people
that I can talk to.

374
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,399
They're not people.

375
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,192
I know...

376
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,029
but they...
they help me with my work.

377
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,698
Poker, massages...

378
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,826
sleeping in
holographic
quarters?

379
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,954
Sounds more like escape
than work.

380
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,456
I can't concentrate
if I'm not relaxed.

381
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,541
Can't you relax
with your friends?

382
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,251
"Friends"?

383
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,672
Commander Harkins
invited you to his home.

384
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,133
You went
to the holodeck instead.

385
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,510
It's not what you're thinking,
Deanna.

386
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,513
This isn't a relapse
of my holo-addiction.

387
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,934
Okay.

388
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,646
Tell me how the holograms
helped you with your work.

389
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,690
Well, I talked to them
about my ideas.

390
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,068
I worked out
technical problems.

391
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,528
I need<i> specifics</i>
here, people.

392
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,447
Take us through it again,
Mr. Barclay,

393
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,740
one step at a time.

394
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,076
Maybe it'll
spark an idea.

395
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,453
We've got our itinerant pulsar.

396
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,873
We've got our interdimensional
transponder array.

397
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,792
How do we get
our wormhole?

398
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,877
This one could keep
us up all night.

399
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,213
Oh. We know we can produce
gravimetric energy,

400
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,093
but... can we do it
at levels high enough

401
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,053
to create the singularity?

402
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,848
We're talking
about a massive
subspace reaction.

403
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,351
Maybe...
<i>that's</i> the problem.

404
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,103
Reg?

405
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,522
Maybe we need
to think smaller.

406
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,398
You're losing me.

407
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,610
How much bandwidth
do we really need?

408
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,821
The average wormhole is huge,

409
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,532
but if we compressed
the datastream...

410
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,493
We wouldn't need
a conduit anywhere
near as big.

411
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,328
What's your idea?

412
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,500
A micro-wormhole.

413
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,460
Impressive.

414
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,796
You've outdone yourself
this time, Reg.

415
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,298
I'll still need, um...
help with the details.

416
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,092
JANEWAY:
Put together a team.

417
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,594
Use whatever
resources you need.

418
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,263
(<i> sighs</i> )

419
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,934
A power ratio

420
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,188
of approximately
60 terawatts

421
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,689
should do the trick.

422
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,191
You think that's enough?
Should be,

423
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,609
but then, we have
to compensate

424
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,403
for gravimetric
interference.

425
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,738
And how do
we do that?

426
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,198
I was thinking--

427
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,449
what if we applied
a narrowband filter

428
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,326
to the transponder signal?

429
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,455
Barclay strikes again.

430
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,416
What's going on here?
Commander...

431
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,918
Who's your
friend, Reg?

432
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,711
Yes, aren't you going
to introduce me?

433
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,462
Computer,
delete characters.

434
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,967
I thought I told you
to go home.

435
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,930
I was, uh...
working.

436
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,932
You call this work?

437
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,437
You've created holograms
of the<i> Voyager</i> crew.

438
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,731
Oh, it-it... it-it's
not what you think.

439
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,650
It's an interactive,
uh, diagnostic program.

440
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,571
I designed it to help
me... solve problems.

441
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,241
How long have you been in here?

442
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,659
Since the briefing.

443
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,954
The briefing ended
ten hours ago.

444
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,043
I... I know
that I embarrassed you

445
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,502
in front of the Admiral

446
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,464
and I am... I'm sorry.

447
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,216
I wanted to
refine my idea,

448
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,135
so that I could
present you

449
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,303
with a specific plan,
and I've done that, Pete.

450
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,514
You were right
about the wormhole idea
being too expansive.

451
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,600
So, I've-I've scaled it back...

452
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,104
All the extra time
you've been putting in--

453
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,023
if I checked
the holo-logs,

454
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,359
would I find
you've been spending
those hours in here?

455
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:04,157
Well, not-not<i> all</i> that
time.

456
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,117
How much of it?

457
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,495
Maybe, uh...

458
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,289
20 or...

459
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,249
30 hours a week.

460
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,334
Don't you think
that's a little excessive?

461
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,463
Uh, not if it helps us
contact<i> Voyager.</i>

462
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,178
Before I brought you
onto my team...

463
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,221
I reviewed your file.

464
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,392
You've struggled
with holo-addiction before.

465
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,980
From where I stand,

466
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,356
it looks like
you've had a relapse.

467
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,485
I-I know it-it may<i> look</i>
that way, but...

468
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,736
I think you need counseling.

469
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,571
What I<i> need</i>

470
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,407
is for you to pay attention
to my ideas!

471
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:53,956
I should've been paying
more attention
to your<i> behavior.</i>

472
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,500
I thought I was
being a friend

473
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,878
by giving you
some leeway.

474
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,880
I didn't realize how...

475
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,050
involved you've become
with<i> Voyager.</i>

476
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,177
Well, is it really so wrong?

477
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,470
Do you have any idea
what it must be like for them

478
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,473
to be stranded 60,000
light-years from home?!

479
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:16,436
Do you have any idea...
how lonely that must be?

480
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,106
I'm sorry, Reg...

481
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:23,027
but until you get some help,
you're off the project.

482
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,196
You-you can't do that.

483
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,740
You've given me no choice.

484
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,243
This hologrid and the lab

485
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:33,079
are officially
off limits.

486
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,831
Now, go home.

487
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,875
I won't leave--

488
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,086
not until you've heard
what I have to say.

489
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,419
Reg!

490
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,301
Don't make me call Security.

491
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,734
(<i> buzzing</i> )
What is it, Nicole?

492
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,819
He's still here.

493
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,530
You told him I have
a meeting scheduled at 1500?

494
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,824
Yes, sir.
He won't go away.

495
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,576
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Send him in.

496
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,994
Yes, sir.

497
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,419
Admiral, uh,
th-thank, thank you,
uh, for seeing me.

498
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,545
You're frightening
my secretary, Mr. Barclay.

499
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,672
You have five minutes.

500
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,136
Five minutes, right?

501
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,469
Sit down.

502
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,809
Uh, first... first,
I-I-I want to apologize

503
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,811
for speaking out of turn
yesterday.

504
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,396
I-it's only because I...

505
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,815
I, I care so much
about<i> Voyager.</i>

506
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,566
Yes, Commander Harkins
has informed me

507
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,693
about your attachment
to the crew.

508
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,113
I understand
you've been spending time

509
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,450
with a holographic re-creation
of my son, among others.

510
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,535
Frankly, I find that
rather disturbing.

511
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,038
Well, I understand
h-how you could see it that way,

512
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,668
but, uh, that does not negate
the fact that I have a plan

513
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,795
for communicating
with<i> Voyager.</i>

514
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,589
Commander Harkins doesn't seem
to think your plan is viable.

515
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,177
I have refined the idea.
I've simplified it.

516
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,263
All I'm asking for
is a chance to try.

517
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:18,725
And if I'm right, it could mean
a chance to talk to Tom.

518
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,233
In my opinion, Commander Harkins
removed you from the project

519
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,694
with good cause,
and that's his prerogative.

520
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,114
I won't let my personal feelings

521
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,741
interfere
with Starfleet procedure.

522
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,623
I... I've broken protocol
and I<i> should</i> be punished,

523
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,377
but the crew of
the<i> Voyager</i> shouldn't be,

524
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,628
and neither...
neither should you.

525
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,091
I just need access to the lab
for one more day.

526
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,678
After that, if I...
uh, if I'm wrong,

527
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,972
I'll resign my commission.

528
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,102
I'll order a review
of your findings.

529
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,604
If it's concluded
your ideas are valid,

530
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,400
I'll instruct Commander Harkins
to pursue it.

531
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,984
But...
I'm the one who knows...

532
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,777
That's the best
I can do, Mr. Barclay.

533
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,821
Good day.

534
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,787
So the meeting
went well.

535
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,124
No, no, no. It<i> didn't,</i>
not at all.

536
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,919
The Admiral said
he'd review
your findings.

537
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,838
Don't you see?
He was just trying
to get rid of me,

538
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,425
just like Harkins.
Try to relax.

539
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,428
Now you understand
why I need your help.

540
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,346
Yes, I do.

541
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,306
You-you have to call the Admiral

542
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,517
in your official capacity
as a Starfleet Counselor

543
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,685
and tell him that
I am psychologically fit

544
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,271
to return to work.

545
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,150
I can't do that.

546
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,861
(<i> gasps</i> ):
Why not?!

547
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,865
Look at yourself.
You're experiencing
acute anxiety,

548
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,617
sleeplessness, paranoia.

549
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,329
You did what you could.

550
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,749
Now it's time to let Starfleet
worry about<i> Voyager.</i>

551
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,667
We need to take care of<i> you.</i>

552
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,629
There is nothing
wrong with<i> me!</i>

553
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,549
You said yourself,
you've become

554
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,468
obsessed
with<i> Voyager.</i>

555
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,136
What if I have?

556
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,555
If an obsession helps me
to do my job better,

557
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,015
i-it's a sacrifice
I am willing to make.

558
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:26,853
A little instability
in exchange for contact
with a stranded starship.

559
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,399
Isn't<i> Voyager</i>
more important than my
psychological condition?

560
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:34,487
<i>Voyager</i> is important,
but so are you.

561
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,654
That ship...

562
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,080
that crew...

563
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,461
they're all I have.

564
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,427
Tell me why that is.

565
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,182
Ever... ever since
I-I left the<i> Enterprise,</i>

566
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:07,436
things haven't...
haven't been the same.

567
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,523
It's as if...

568
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,654
I lost my family.

569
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:20,740
So you created a new family
on the holodeck.

570
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,953
Only they're not real.

571
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,541
I didn't know how else...

572
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,084
how else to cope.

573
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,923
Do you remember when you first
came aboard the<i> Enterprise?</i>

574
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,344
You had trouble
fitting in, didn't you?

575
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:45,807
But after a while, you
started to make friends.

576
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,102
You can learn to do
the same thing here on Earth.

577
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,690
Oh, I... I don't know how.

578
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,025
We'll work on it together.

579
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,776
(<i> stammering</i> )

580
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,738
You're, you're scheduled
to depart tomorrow.

581
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,491
I've decided
to ask Captain Picard

582
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,951
for a temporary
leave of absence...

583
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,164
to spend some time
with an old friend.

584
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,083
Oh, Deanna, you...
you-you, you don't,

585
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,501
you don't have to do that.

586
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,546
Try and stop me.

587
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,188
(<i> cat fussing</i> )

588
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,315
I'm sorry, Neelix.
I have to leave.

590
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,361

00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,792
<i>Warp core breach in 20 seconds.</i>

697
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:12,170
Captain to all hands.
Abandon ship.

698
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,594
<i>Warp core breach in ten seconds.</i>

699
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,889
One way or another,
this program's going to end.

700
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,018
<i>...seven, six...</i>

701
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,477
Good-bye, Captain.

702
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,687
<i>...four...</i>

703
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,563
Computer, end program.

704
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,273
<i>...two...</i>

705
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,002
I'm ready
for my lesson.

706
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,753
I've concluded that
teaching you to sing

707
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,922
is an inefficient
use of my time.

708
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,718
But I... I've...
I've been practicing.

709
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,137
In your case,
practice is irrelevant.

710
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,014
Your vocal chords
are incapable

711
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,974
of producing
basic diatonic tones,

712
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,518
not to mention your
rhythmic shortcomings.

713
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,605
I sound so good
in the sonic shower.

714
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,734
Perhaps you should
confine your efforts
to that location.

715
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,652
(<i> console beeping</i> )

716
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,492
Astrometrics to the Bridge.

717
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,369
Go ahead, Seven.

718
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,914
<i>I've detected what appears</i>
<i>to be a micro-wormhole</i>

719
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,584
<i>at coordinates 194.6 by 35.</i>

720
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,419
A micro-wormhole?

721
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,172
I believe a message is being
transmitted through it...

722
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,844
on a Starfleet
Emergency Channel.

723
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,437
Let's hear it, Harry.

724
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,773
BARCLAY (<i> staticky</i> ):
<i>Starfleet Command</i>
<i>to USS Voyager.</i>

725
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,358
(<i> static drowns out message</i> )

726
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,737
Try applying a narrowband filter
to the signal processor.

727
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,074
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

728
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:09,537
<i>This is</i>
<i>Lieutenant Reginald Barclay.</i>

729
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,790
That's it.

730
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,291
Whoever
this Barclay is,

731
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,918
he stopped
transmitting.

732
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,087
TUVOK:
The micro-wormhole is collapsing

733
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,089
at a rate of .2 percent
per second.

734
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,174
That doesn't
give us much time.

735
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,802
To do what?
To send a message
back through

736
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,387
and hope Mr. Barclay
is listening.

737
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,602
It should have worked.
I don't understand
why it didn't.

738
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,354
There you are.

739
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,023
I've reviewed
Mr. Barclay's plan.

740
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,858
I think it's
worth an attempt.

741
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,653
He's already tried, sir,
without your authorization.

742
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,613
It didn't work.

743
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,698
I'm sorry to hear that.

744
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,201
So am I, sir. I appreciate
your confidence in me,

745
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,453
but I... I don't deserve it.

746
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,747
What would you like me
to do with him, Admiral?

747
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,416
He broke into the lab,
accessed the MIDAS Array,

748
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,085
resisted arrest.

749
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,046
You've put me
in a difficult position, son.

750
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,840
I was hoping
that we'd be able to...

751
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,341
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

752
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,551
We're receiving
a transmission.

753
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:10,140
From where?
Coordinates 343.6 by 27.

754
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,058
The wormhole.

755
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,477
JANEWAY (<i> staticky</i> ):
<i>Starfleet Command, come in.</i>

756
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,188
<i>Voyager.</i>

757
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:19,858
Reg, give me a hand
clearing up the signal.

758
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,070
Lower the filter band
by .3 kilohertz.

759
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,239
<i>This is Captain Kathryn Janeway.</i>

760
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,200
<i>Do you read me?</i>

761
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,451
I think
she's talking to you.

762
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,995
Captain...

763
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:36,249
this is
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay

764
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,876
at Starfleet Command.

765
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,838
It's good to hear
your voice, Lieutenant.

766
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,757
We've been waiting a long time
for this moment.

767
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,551
The feeling is mutual.

768
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,095
Unfortunately, the
micro-wormhole is collapsing.

769
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,763
We have only
a few moments.

770
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,141
Understood.
We are transmitting

771
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,560
our ship's logs, crew reports,

772
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,520
and navigational records
to you now.

773
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,731
<i>Acknowledged,</i>
<i>and we're sending you</i>

774
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,984
<i>data on some new</i>
<i>hyper-subspace technology.</i>

775
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,819
We're hoping, eventually,
to use it

776
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,072
to keep in regular contact,
and we're including some

777
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,532
recommended modifications
for your com system.

778
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,035
We'll implement them
as soon as possible.

779
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,204
Uh, there's someone else here

780
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:17,415
who would also
like to say something.

781
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,002
This is Admiral Paris.

782
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,628
Hello, sir.

783
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,339
<i>How are your people holding up?</i>

784
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,174
Very well.

785
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,885
They're an
exemplary crew,

786
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,179
your son included.

787
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:35,683
Tell him... tell him I miss him,

788
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,977
and I'm proud of him.

789
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,647
He heard you, Admiral.

790
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,317
The wormhole is collapsing.
I want you all to know

791
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,485
we're doing everything we can
to bring you home.

792
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,487
JANEWAY:
We appreciate it, sir.

793
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,656
Keep a docking bay open for us.

794
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,075
<i>We hope to...</i>

795
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,785
(<i> transmission cuts off</i> )

796
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,579
That's it.
They're gone.

797
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,208
You did it, Reg.

798
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,794
I'm sorry I doubted you.

799
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,966
Why the long face, Mr. Barclay?

800
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:13,430
Because...
because it's over, sir.

801
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,433
No, Lieutenant.

802
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,937
I'd say that Project<i> Voyager</i>
is just beginning...

803
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,855
thanks to you.

804
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,786
Anyone know
this Barclay?

805
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,205
I took the liberty
of reviewing his
personnel file.

806
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,458
He's had a rather
colorful career,

807
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,542
not to mention an
unusual medical history.

808
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,544
He's recovered
from a variety
of maladies

809
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,840
including
transporter phobia
and holo-addiction.

810
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,676
Well, whatever his problems,
he certainly came
through for us.

811
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,594
Starfleet should
give him a promotion.

812
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,389
I've finished
analyzing the data
Mr. Barclay sent.

813
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,766
The hyper-subspace
technology is promising.

814
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,936
I believe we can look forward
to future communications
with Earth.

815
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,480
Well, that calls
for a toast.

816
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,523
Care to do the honors, Tom?

817
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,945
To... my dad.

818
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,948
It's nice to know
he's still there.

819
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,034
And to the newest
honorary member

820
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,576
of the<i> Voyager</i> crew,

821
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,121
Reginald Barclay,
whoever you are.

822
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,999
Hear, hear.
To Mr. Barclay.

823
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,959
TROI:
Congratulations.

824
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:28,213
Well, I'm not... not sure
I deserve congratulations.

825
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,257
Why not?
It's quite an
accomplishment.

826
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,218
I, I couldn't have done it
without your help.

827
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,261
What did Commander Harkins
have to say about it?

828
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,847
Well, I think...
I think he was pleased.

829
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,433
Why wouldn't he be?
You're quite a catch.

830
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:43,186
Well, not everyone
would want his sister-in-law

831
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,104
to date someone
with<i> my</i> history.

832
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,732
It's a new era.

833
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,609
So, tell me
all about the lucky lady.

834
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,028
I want details.

835
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,324
Well, her name is Hope.

836
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,450
You're kidding.

837
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,578
No, and-and-and...

838
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,163
she loves cats.
