Chellick. Lucky I caught you.

15
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,519
Mr. Gar, I wish I had time to talk.

16
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,147
Well, all you have to do is listen.
I have a new supply of cytogenics.

17
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,901
Your last supply was useless.
Expired lots, diluted samples...

18
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,237
Oh, I have something special this time.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,573
The latest in substandard
technology, no doubt.

20
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,158
Oh, this item is far from substandard.

21
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,829
And as a gesture of goodwill,
I'm offering it to you first.

22
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,789
We don't need another neural monitor.

23
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,375
Mm, this is much more
sophisticated than that.

24
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,129
I'm sure it has some ingenious use,
but I'm not interested.

25
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,468
Please state the nature...

26
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,721
of the medical emergency?

27
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,373
Where have you taken me?

28
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,250
It's a holographic construct,

29
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,294

five million medical protocols.

30
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,505
I demand to be returned
to <i>Voyager</i> at once.

31
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,965
What's <i>Voyager?</i>

32
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,092
The Federation starship
to which I'm assigned.

33
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,719
This man is a kidnapper.

34
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,471
[scoffs] I would never offer you
stolen property.

35
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,724
I traded warp-grade dilithium
for this program.

36
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:44,933
What's your price?

37
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,643
This negotiation is pointless.

38
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,188
I'm not about to perform medical services
for a pair of common thieves!

39
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,898

This patient's bleeding seriously.
He needs an immediate infusion.

What are you doing?
Get away from him.

57
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,073
With technology this primitive,
you may as well be using leeches.

58
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,785
-Who is this man?
-A doctor, of sorts.

59
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,745

It requires me to treat anyone who's ill.

62
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,462
This patient needs 20 milligrams
anesthezine. Get me a hypospray.

63
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,546
A what?

00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,299

Well, you play hockey,

-Hmm.

You know how he feels

Relax. I'll come up with something.

Hey, Doc.

73
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,752
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

74
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,212
[both sigh]

75
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,299
I know what you're thinking,
but there's a simple explanation.

76
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,134
Tell him, Tom.

77
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,637
Right. Well, um...

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,307
see, Doc, we were running
these invasion scenarios

79
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,518
when this species of proto-humanoid--

80
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,979
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

81
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,689
Are you okay, Doc?

82
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,025
Please take an analgesic
and return in 24 hours.

83
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,697
It's a replicated fake.

84
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,450
The program running in Sick Bay
is from one of Doc's old training files.

85
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,788
I want someone to tell me
how this snake oil salesman

86
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,292
managed to evade
every security protocol on the ship.

87
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:19,546
-I take full responsibility.
-I'm not interested in fault.

88
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,798
I just want to know how it happened.

89
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,467
Um, Gar spent the night in Sick Bay.

90
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,429
He claimed to have gotten
food poisoning at dinner.

91
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,599
He had plenty of time to learn
about the mobile emitter from the Doctor.

92
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,560
Who I'm sure was more than willing
to extol its virtues.

93
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:38,189
Medical logs show the training file was
activated just before Gar left <i>Voyager.</i>

94
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,442
Scan for his ion trail,

95
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,738
and let's review safeguards for accessing
low-security files, shall we, Mr. Tuvok?

96
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:51,036
Captain, don't blame Tuvok
for what happened. It was my fault.

97
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,245
How so?

98
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,414
Gar kept complaining
how bland his dinner was,

99
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,502
so I added a few exotic spices.

100
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,171
I'm not sure I see your point.

101
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,007
I was trying so hard
to create something he liked

102
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,676
that I didn't take his alien
physiology into account.

103
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,389
Everyone's assuming he faked his illness,
but I might have really made him sick.

104
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,060
It's not as if your cooking
turned him into a thief.

105
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,520
No, but if he hadn't gone to Sick Bay,

106
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,732
he may never have come up
with a plan to kidnap the Doctor,

107
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,068
much less have the opportunity to do it.

108
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,111
In my experience, Neelix,

109
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,364
men like Gar have no trouble
finding opportunities

110
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,240
to take advantage of other people.

111
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,994
Well, I just hope there's something
I can do to help find the Doctor.

112
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:37,374
Well, when and if that opportunity arises,
I'm sure you'll make the most of it.

113
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,181
[sighs] That was the most impressive
cortical bypass I've ever seen.

114
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,600
It's just a question
of possessing the basic skills.

115
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,228
Ah, if I had basic skills like yours,
they'd move me up to Level Blue.

116
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,896
Take this patient to Yellow.

117
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,274
You seem a little low on resources here.
If I could contact my medical staff,

118
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,610
I might be able to get you
some additional supplies.

119
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,738
Communication is usually restricted, but
the Allocator might give you clearance.

120
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,783
-Good. Where can I find him?
-Uh, the Allocator isn't a "him."

121
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,410
It's our main computer.

122
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,745
-Well...
-[coughing]

123
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,414
Perhaps it could establish
a communications link

124
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,873
with <i>Voyager's </i>main computer.

125
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,167
[sighs] You'll have to submit
a formal request to Chellick

126
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,379
and support it
with Form 83-W in triplicate.

127
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,339
-[coughing continues]
-Even then...

128
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,718
Why hasn't this patient been treated yet?

129
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,804
He's waiting for proton imaging.

130
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,223
There are a lot of other people
ahead of him.

131
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,934
It's nice to see someone knows
what's going on.

132
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,769
-What's your name?
-Tebbis.

133
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,272
Well, Tebbis,
this doesn't look too serious.

134
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,899
Uh, it's just a little
osteal extravasation.

135
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,235
Excellent diagnosis.

136
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,195
I hope to be a doctor someday.

137
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,405
Really?

138
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,741
Well, I hope your working conditions
are better than these.

139
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,744
It wouldn't be so bad
if they'd let us listen to music.

140
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,246
It would certainly improve my mood.

141
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,582
It's not just that,
but music has great healing power.

142
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,668
I couldn't agree with you more.

143
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,838
-[groans]
-Uh, exhale slowly.

144
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,006
[exhales]

145
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,135
-Can't you give him a neural blocker?
-He's already had his allocation.

[low rhythmic beeping]

147
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,685
The leg injury isn't all I'm picking up.
He's got some kind of systemic disease.

148
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,564
It's a chromo-viral infection.
We have 12 cases down here.

149
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,610
-He's in the final stage.
-Is there an established treatment?

150
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,570
Cytoglobin injections.

151
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,283
These scans don't show
any cytoglobin in his bloodstream.

152
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,744
-He hasn't been given any.
-Why not?

153
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,331
-He doesn't have a high enough T.C.
-"T.C."? What's that?

154
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,919
Ah, there you are. I'm happy to report
that I've acquired your program from Gar.

155
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,296
-Please come with me.
-I will not.

156
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,507
May I remind you
I'm being illegally detained?

157
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,635
Or hasn't the rule of law
reached this society yet?

158
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,638
We follow the Allocator's rules,

159
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,016
and it's determined that your services
are required on Level Blue.

160
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,313
Uh, please, Doctor, the Allocator knows
which patients need help the most.

162
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,659
Level Blue is your critical care area,
I presume.

163
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,744
Level Blue is the area
where it's most critical

164
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,412
that we provide excellent care.

165
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,039
[door opens]

166
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,972
These patients will be
your chief responsibility from now on.

167
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,766
Do whatever you can
to make them well.

168
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,318
Why are these patients
getting preferential treatment?

169
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,529
They have a higher T.C. than the others.

170
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,115
Indulge me. What's T.C.?

171
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,533
Treatment Coefficient.

172
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,910
The Allocator assigns one
to every patient.

173
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,289
It determines the level of care
they receive.

174
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,125
How is this coefficient derived?

175
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,963
Through a complex formula that involves
profession, skills, accomplishments.

176
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,215
How is any of that relevant
to medical treatment?

177
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,887
An agricultural engineer is obviously
more important than a waste processor.

178
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,347
-Important to whom?
-Society.

179
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,351
When your resources are limited,
you have to prioritize.

180
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,898
So, you base treatment on whether
patients have particular abilities?

181
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,276
It's much more complicated than that.

182
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,987
The Allocator assesses
the entire individual.

183
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,948
And reduces his life to a number.

184
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,160
It may seem impersonal, but it's what
the Dinaali have contracted us to do.

185
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,786
Chellick's people are known
throughout the sector

186
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,206
for their administrative skills.

187
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,083
Before they came here,
we were a dying race.

188
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,044
Eco-disasters, famine...

189
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:56,049
Dr. Dysek, Chief of Medicine.
The medical hologram I told you about.

190
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,469
Are you in charge of what passes
for care on Level Red?

191
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,180
Because those people are suffering.

192
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,434
Intriguing technology.
Can we use him to treat patients yet?

193
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,894
That's what he's here for.

194
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,273
In some societies, it's considered rude
to refer to someone in the third person

195
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,484
while he's standing in front of you.

196
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,444
I'm sure you'll make good use of him.

197
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,290
The warp trail ends here.
Gar should be directly ahead.

198
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,292
All stop.

199
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,961
Red Alert.

200
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,420
On screen.

201
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,841
It's emitting a false warp signature.

202
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,637
Looks like we've underestimated
Mr. Gar again.

203
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,972
Now what?

204
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,976
-There may be another way to find him.
-What do you have in mind?

205
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,438
He traded us high-grade iridium,
which has a very brief half-life.

206
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,232
His ship is slow.

207
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,027
Logic suggests he acquired the substance
within a radius of three light-years.

208
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,823
Cross-reference our sensor logs
and long-range scans.

209
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,744
Two planets,
no atmosphere or technology,

210
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,621
a T-class nebula...

211
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,456
Here's something.

212
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,751
An asteroid with approximately
200 humanoid life signs,

213
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,503
subterranean structures.

214
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,380
Sounds like a mining operation.

215
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,798
If that's where Mr. Gar
acquired the iridium,

216
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,426
they may be able to help us find him.

217
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,387
Tom, how fast can you get us there?

218
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,930
Less than two hours.

219
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,223
Do it.

220
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,356
-We're being hailed.
-Open a channel.

221
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,444
<i>I want my iridium back now.</i>

222
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,070
I beg your pardon?

223
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,865
<i>I've scanned your ship.</i>
<i>I know you've got it on board.</i>

224
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,285
Yes, we obtained it
from a man called Gar, a merchant--

225
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,704
<i>You mean thief.</i>

226
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,748
So, you have had
the pleasure of meeting him.

227
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,501
<i>He was here two days ago.</i>
<i>He sold us 3,000 induction units.</i>

228
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:59,380
<i>He was gone a day before we realized</i>
<i>he'd also stolen 20 kilos of ore.</i>

229
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,591
[scoffs]

230
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,761
We had a similar experience.
Maybe we can help each other.

231
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,554
<i>How?</i>

232
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,682
Do you have any idea
where we might find him?

233
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,893
<i>Will you return my iridium?</i>

234
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:16,481
By all means, but Gar only traded us
half of what he stole from you.

235
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,983
However, we might be able
to get the rest of it back.

236
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,111
<i>All I can tell you</i>
<i>is that the induction units came</i>

237
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,946
<i>from a planetoid called Velos.</i>

238
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,573
[sighs]

239
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,620
You may go.

240
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,747
Your surgical technique is impressive.

241
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,917
Well, you've obviously had
experience with cellular repair.

242
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,878
As a matter of fact, I've done
extensive research on the subject.

243
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:43,174
I'd be happy to share it with you, but
we'll have to contact <i>Voyager </i>to get it.

244
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:47,220
You'll have to discuss that with Chellick.
He authorizes all communications.

245
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,057
It's time for this patient's
next injection.

246
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,396
Requesting one cytoglobin injection
for patient B-3, priority Blue-7 gamma.

247
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,524
[Allocator]
<i>One cytoglobin injection authorized.</i>

248
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,906
Does this patient have
a chromo-viral infection?

249
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,533
No. Why?

250
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,993
I was told cytoglobin is the standard
treatment for that disease.

251
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,747
Cytoglobin also prevents arterial aging.

252
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,250
Will that be all?

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,210
You may go.

254
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,088
This patient's arteries
appear to be healthy.

255
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:27,593
At the moment, but daily injections
increase life expectancy up to 40%.

256
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,388
We prescribe them
for all Level Blue patients.

257
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,516
I just saw a boy
on Level Red who's dying.

258
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,309
This medicine could save his life.

259
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,229
This woman is a chief engineer
of an irrigation facility

260
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,523
which provides water
to half the subcontinent.

261
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,608
So, her life is more valuable?

262
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,403
Keeping her healthy
contributes to our survival.

263
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,488
Can you say the same
for the boy on Level Red?

264
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,450
Who knows what he'll accomplish
if he has the chance?

265
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,411
If he becomes more valuable
to society, his T.C. will rise,

266
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,996
and then he'll receive better treatment.

267
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,706
He may not be around long enough.

268
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,167
I'm sorry he's sick,

269
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,751
but our society is much better off

270
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,880
since we began following
the Allocator's protocols.

271
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,968
Some of you are.

272
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,102
-I never expected to see you again.
-Why do you say that?

273
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:22,565
-Level Blue is much more prestigious.
-Prestige is the least of my concerns.

274
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,318
-How is he?
-Not well.

275
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,573
[beeping]

276
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,994
-His condition's deteriorated so rapidly.
-His coenzyme allotment's been reduced.

277
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,538
[sighs] Are we here to help
these people or kill them?

278
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,708
His T.C. is just too low.

279
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,586
-Maybe we can raise it.
-That's not possible.

280
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,757
If it's purely a function of statistics,
we can simply input more data.

281
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,800
-We're not authorized to do--
-Voje.

282
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,511
When you look
at your patient lying there,

283
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:56,265
you have to ask yourself,
"What can I do? What must I do?"

284
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,978
We can amend his database
to include additional skills.

285
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,857
-Such as?
-His extensive knowledge of neutronics.

286
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,526
He doesn't know anything
about neutronics.

287
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,236
We can say he does.

288
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,279
What's the harm in trying?

289
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:20,164
Amend patient R-12's T.C.
to include an expertise in neutronics.

290
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,584
[Allocator]
<i>Unable to verify. Amendment denied.</i>

291
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,336
You see?

292
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,630
-[weakly] Hello.
-Lie still.

293
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,132
What are you doing?

294
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,260
Trying to get you
the proper medication.

295
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,932
You're wasting time you could
be spending with other patients.

296
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,309
You have as much right
to treatment as anyone.

297
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,729
It's not your fault.

298
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,900
There's nothing you can do.

299
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,289
-Nurse.
-Yes, Doctor?

300
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:05,001
Why hasn't this patient received
her additional cytoglobin injection?

301
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,085
Additional?

302
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,463
If you'd examine her chart,
you'd see that I've increased her dosage.

303
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,550
-Dr. Dysek didn't say anything--
-Dr. Dysek is at home with his family.

304
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,846
Would you like me to contact him so you
can explain why you're not doing your job?

305
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,431
No, Doctor.

306
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:25,813
Requesting one cytoglobin injection
for patient B-3, priority Blue-7 gamma.

307
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,941
[Allocator]
<i>One cytoglobin injection authorized.</i>

308
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,446
I'll do it myself.

309
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,116
Can I assist you?

310
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,703
You may go.

311
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,590

320
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,386
<i>He convinced me to let him take</i>
<i>the induction units on consignment.</i>

321
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:42,723
<i>That was more than ten days ago.</i>
<i>I haven't heard from him since.</i>

322
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,351
You appear to be
an experienced merchant, Mr. Kipp.

323
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,186
Why would you trust someone like Gar?

324
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,814
<i>He came highly recommended.</i>

325
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,940
By whom?

326
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,194
<i>A buyer I know. He said he's been</i>
<i>trading with Gar for years.</i>

327
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,571
Do you know where
we can find this buyer?

328
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,826
<i>Yes, Captain. I am the fool</i>
<i>who said that Gar could be trusted.</i>

329
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,412
Sounds like you've changed your mind.

330
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,790
[sighs] <i>I should have known</i>
<i>it was a mistake, but...</i>

331
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:12,503
<i>Well... you see, I have never</i>
<i>been able to say no to my wife.</i>

332
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,922
What does she have to do with it?

333
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,050
<i>Well, she's the one who asked me</i>
<i>to recommend Gar.</i>

334
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,969
Then she must know him well.

335
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,055
<i>They're... friends.</i>

336
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,141
May we speak with her?

337
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,060
<i>She's, uh...</i>

338
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,395
<i>She's not here.</i>

339
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,064
Do you know where we might find her?

340
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,401
[voice breaking]
<i>She left me.</i>

341
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,948
<i>You're a woman. You saw my husband</i>
<i>with your own eyes.</i>

342
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,410
<i>Overweight, depressed...</i>
<i>You would have left him, too,</i>

343
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,414
<i>especially if you had met</i>
<i>someone as exciting as Gar.</i>

344
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,667
Yes, he's very exciting.

345
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,045
<i>That's why you're looking for him,</i>
<i>isn't it? You want him for yourself.</i>

346
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,466
I assure you, I have no romantic
interest in him whatsoever.

347
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,926
<i>Why? Not good enough for you?</i>

348
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,096
No, it's not that. It's just that...

349
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,059
I already have a man.

350
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,775
We have a business opportunity
for Mr. Gar,

351
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,110
one that will expire
if we don't find him soon.

352
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,157
<i>He's on his way to the gambling</i>
<i>tournament on Selek IV.</i>

353
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,410
<i>When you see him,</i>
<i>tell him to hurry home.</i>

354
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,495
[transmission ends]

355
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,456
[sighs]

356
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,640
How are you feeling?

357
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,018
Better.

358
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,395
That's what happens
when you get the proper treatment.

359
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,735
But I'm not authorized
to receive cytoglobin.

360
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,195
You are now.

361
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,949
You'll need several more injections,
but you can expect a complete recovery.

362
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,202
Whatever you did, they'll find out.

363
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,537
They'll punish you.

364
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,747
You're assuming
I've done something illicit.

365
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,374
-Didn't you?
-Of course not.

366
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,209
I simply had a talk with Chellick,

367
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,378
explained to him
what a bright young man you are,

368
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,047
and he had the Allocator
recalculate your T.C.

369
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,008
I've never met a doctor like you.

370
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:27,763
Well... it's not hard to stand out when
the general level of competence is so low.

371
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,976
There are patients on this level
who deserve a higher T.C. than I do.

372
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,686
Could you talk to Chellick about them?

373
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,279
[sighs]
Thank you.

374
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,783
[coughing]

375
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,288
Ah, Voje.

376
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,914
-You're not busy, are you?
-Well, actually--

377
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,374
Good. I want you to help me
dispense these injections.

378
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,503
-Where did you get the cytoglobin?
-Level Blue. Where else?

379
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,588
You stole it?

380
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,173
I'd prefer to think of it
as "reallocation."

381
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,301
We're going to treat
every chromo-virus patient on this level.

382
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,720
Do you have any idea
what kind of trouble we could get into?

383
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,514
"We?" Then you will help me.

384
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:14,226
No! Absolutely not!
Modifying data files was bad enough.

385
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,230
Well, I certainly wouldn't want you
to do anything to compromise your ethics.

386
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,565
[Tebbis]
I'll help you.

387
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,986
-You should be in bed.
-Actually, now that he's improving,

388
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,863
a little activity will do him good.

389
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,033
You can go back to doing...
whatever you were doing.

390
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,419
The best place to inject him is here,
in the lateral artery.

391
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,885
Excellent work!

392
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,638
It's nice to see someone in this hospital
has a future as a healer.

393
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,349
[sighs] If we each take
a third of the patients,

394
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,101
maybe we can finish
before someone catches us.

395
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,988
Who do you think you are, prescribing
unnecessary medications for my patients?

396
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,406
It wasn't unnecessary.

397
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,661
If you believe that, you're incompetent,
or perhaps malfunctioning.

398
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:19,833
I was simply trying to increase
our allocation of resources.

399
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,211
-What are you talking about?
-I did some checking.

400
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:27,465
Last month, Level Blue's total
medication requests were down by 6%.

401
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,135
-Because our cure rate was higher.
-Exactly.

402
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,638
Because you performed
so efficiently last month,

403
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:37,601
the Allocator will determine
you're able to do with less next month.

404
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:42,648
If we don't order more medication now,
we may not get it when we need it.

405
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,692
Think about it, Doctor.

406
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:49,321
If you don't have the proper resources,
your cure rate could go down.

407
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,656
[whispering]
If that happens,

408
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,367
the Allocator may assign you
to a lower level.

409
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,702
Mm-hmm.

410
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:58,330
Are we having a problem
with our newest piece of technology?

411
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:00,791
Actually...

412
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,504
he seems to be learning
the system quite well.

413
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,184
Oh. Three of the patients we injected
are practically virus-free.

414
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,936
What did you expect?

415
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:26,483
Um, maybe we could "reallocate"
other medications, treat more patients.

416
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,653
Now, you're thinking like a doctor,
and to support your efforts,

417
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,573
I've arranged for resources
from Level Blue to be diverted here

418
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,532
on a regular basis.

419
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,993
How did you manage that?

420
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:40,164
Let's just say, Dr. Dysek and I have
developed a professional rapport.

421
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,623
Sometimes, I even surprise myself.

422
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,086
We may actually make
these people better.

423
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,798
That feeling you get
from healing someone...

424
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,925
infectious, isn't it?

425
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,056
Where did you get that?

426
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,476
One of the technicians was going
to recycle it because it wasn't working,

427
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,227
but I think I fixed it.

428
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,395
Hmm.

429
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,938
[beeping]

430
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,149
Seems to be in good condition.

431
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,233
And so do you.

432
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,027
You'll be well enough to leave soon.

433
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,405
Couldn't you say I'm still sick?

434
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,033
Don't you want to go home?

435
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,453
If I do, they'll send me to work
in the refinery with my father.

436
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,579
What about school?
Your medical training?

437
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,416
I would never be authorized for that.

438
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,293
He's right.

439
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,881
If I stay here, you can teach me,
and I can help you treat your patients.

440
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,095
I'm not planning on being here
that long myself.

441
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,182
Then I can help Dr. Voje.

442
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,688
We'll see what we can do.

443
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,780
I have picked up Gar's ship,
directly ahead.

444
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,614
Again?

445
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,158
[Tuvok]
I'm reading his bio-signs.

446
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,494
Any sign of the Doctor
or his emitter?

447
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,830
-Not yet.
-Should I hail Gar?

448
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:06,208
If we let him know we're here,
he may try to slip away.

449
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,793
We could drop out of warp
at close range

450
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,212
and grab him before he knows
what's happening.

451
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,547
I like it.

452
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,382
Tom, Tuvok.

453
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:21,849
He's hailing.

454
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,477
I guess we put him in the mood to talk.
On screen.

455
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,982
<i>I thought we were friends, Captain.</i>
<i>Why am I being treated this way?</i>

456
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,692
<i>I think I deserve better.</i>

457
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,319
-Where's our Doctor?
<i>-I have no idea.</i>

458
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,780
<i>I certainly hope</i>
<i>nothing's happened to him.</i>

459
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,783
Scans are complete.
Neither the mobile emitter

460
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,660
nor the Doctor's program
are aboard Gar's ship.

461
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,580
<i>Well, of course they're not.</i>

462
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,921
He's trying to destabilize
the tractor beam with a feedback pulse.

463
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,673
-Compensating.
-Don't bother, Harry.

464
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,970
Just beam him to the brig.

465
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,901
[whispering]
Tebbis, wake up.

466
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,694
Time to make our rounds.

467
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,618
Locate patient R-12.

468
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,913
[Allocator] <i>Patient R-12 has been</i>
<i>transferred to Level White.</i>

469
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,000
-Tebbis has been moved.
-I know.

470
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,753
What's Level White?
Some kind of patient recovery area?

471
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,963
It's the morgue.

472
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,354
I demand an explanation
for the death of that boy.

473
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,192
I'm responsible for thousands of patients.
You'll have to be more specific.

474
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,402
His name was Tebbis.

475
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,405
Patient R-12!

476
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,036
Acute chromo-viral disease.

477
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,829
He was recovering.

478
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,665
Apparently, he developed complications.

479
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,833
What kind of complications?

480
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,253
A secondary infection.
It spread rapidly.

481
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,838
-How was it treated?
-It wasn't.

482
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,299
The patient had exceeded
his medication allotment.

483
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,803
It seems someone had given him
unauthorized injections.

484
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,307
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

485
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,816
Don't you have any ethical standards?

486
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,777
You are hardly in a position
to speak to me of ethics.

487
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,281
Lying, stealing...
Any other crimes you wish to confess?

488
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,408
I was trying to save lives.

489
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,369
And I am trying to save a society!

490
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,622
Do you really think patient R-12
is going to help me do that?

491
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,165
His name was Tebbis.

492
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,043
He wasn't contributing.
He was a drain on resources.

493
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,920
You're not just rationing
health care here.

494
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,547
You're getting rid of the sick
and the weak!

495
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,091
If the boy had been fit,
he would have survived.

496
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,802
Why don't you just put a phaser
to their heads?

497
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,054
We're healers, not killers.

498
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,556
[sighs]

499
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,519
-I'm going to expose you.
-To whom? The people who employ me?

500
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:17,316
They brought me here to make
the hard choices they don't want to make.

501
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,652
From now on,
I'm restricting you to Level Blue.

502
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,362
You've done enough damage on Red.

503
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:26,867
You mean those patients that I treated?
Yes, that was inconsiderate of me.

504
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,537
It was. You managed to exceed their annual
medication allotment in a matter of days.

505
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,872
They're being sent home.

506
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,624
They'll die!

507
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,877
You should have considered
the consequences of your actions.

508
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,840
Please, don't make them suffer
for my mistakes.

509
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,427
-It won't happen again.
-I'm making certain of that.

510
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,013
From now on, your time
will be strictly regulated.

511
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,097
Meaning what?

512
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,225
I've interfaced your holo-matrix
with the Allocator.

513
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,520
Starting now, it will determine
where you go, when you go,

514
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,939
and what you do when you get there.

515
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,777
[Allocator] <i>The medical hologram will</i>
<i>now commence treatment on Level Blue.</i>

516
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,616
<i>You have six minutes to treat patient B-3.</i>

517
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,042
I don't know where he is.

518
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,170
Not now, perhaps,
but you know where you took him.

519
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,715
The last time I saw him,
he was in your Sick Bay.

520
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:29,721
If you refuse to cooperate, your knowledge
of his location can be extracted.

521
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,515
How?

522
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,600
A mind-meld.

523
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,478
What's that?

524
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,522
An invasive and disturbing procedure.

525
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,400
-[gulps]
-[Neelix] Dinnertime!

526
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,403
Mr. Neelix, I am in the middle
of an interrogation.

527
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,030
Commander, you know
better than anyone

528
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:51,743
that Starfleet has strict guidelines
about allowing prisoners to eat.

529
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,955
Very well. I'll wait.

530
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,085
There we are.

531
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,424
I'm glad to see you enjoying a meal.

532
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,760
When you got sick last time,
I thought my food was to blame,

533
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:13,140
until I realized it was just a ruse
for you to get close to the Doctor.

534
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:18,186
I used Talaxian wormroot as the base.

535
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,855
Mm-hmm.

536
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,441
I'm glad you like it.
Some people react badly.

537
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,193
[groans]

538
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,695
React how?

539
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,989
Oh, dear, I hope you're not getting sick.

540
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,743
If it's the wormroot,
it's going to get a lot worse.

541
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,538
What have you done to me?

542
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:42,461
The usual symptoms are abdominal spasms,
which increase in severity for 30 hours.

543
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,213
Forty at the most.

544
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,050
-Tuvok to Sick Bay.
-Don't worry, Mr. Tuvok, it's not fatal.

545
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:53,346
It's horribly unpleasant,
but, uh... there's an antidote.

546
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,640
Then give it to me!

547
00:32:55,724 --> 00:33:00,479
Unfortunately, our Doctor is the only one
authorized to administer it.

548
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,690
Maybe if you remembered
where he was...

549
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,108
[groans]

550
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,028
Mr. Neelix...

551
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,821
have you deliberately
poisoned this man?

552
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,365
Relax. He's just having gas pains.

553
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,576
Your actions are not only
against regulations--

554
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,455
Didn't I hear someone
threaten a mind-meld?

555
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,250
I was merely trying to encourage
the suspect to be more forthcoming.

556
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,710
-Yeah.
-[Gar groans]

557
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,505
I think he's getting
all the encouragement he needs.

558
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,345
-Excuse me, Doctor.
-What is it?

559
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,847
I need to prepare this patient
for discharge.

560
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,308
-I'm not finished with him yet.
-But Chellick's orders are to--

561
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,644
Are to discharge the patient
at the end of the shift!

562
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,437
The shift isn't over, is it?

563
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,482
-No, sir, but I need time in order--
-I'll tell you when he's ready.

564
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,653
[Allocator] <i>Dr. Voje, report to Level Blue</i>
<i>to assist Dr. Dysek in surgery.</i>

565
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,918
[quietly]
Voje!

566
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,757
I didn't realize
that any of this even existed.

567
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,884
-I need to talk to you.
-I don't have time.

568
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,220
I just got a message from the Allocator
that Dysek needs me.

569
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,306
I'm the one who sent for you.
I used his access codes.

570
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,224
Oh.

571
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,269
I need you to smuggle
my mobile emitter off Level Blue.

572
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,522
[Allocator] <i>Time has expired</i>
<i>for treatment of patient B-1.</i>

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,695

00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,949
[Allocator] <i>The medical hologram</i>
<i>has one minute to treat patient B-3.</i>

576
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,284
You have to help me.

577
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,537
Twelve patients on Level Red are
being sent home because of you.

578
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,165
That's why we have to hurry.
We may still be able to save them.

579
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,750
You've already endangered my patients,

580
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,961
and now you're asking me
to risk my career?

581
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,337
Why should I help you?

582
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,215
Because I have a plan
to heal those patients.

583
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,218
That's what doctors do. We heal.

584
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,762
So, choose. What kind of doctor
are you going to be?

585
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,515
[Allocator] <i>The medical hologram</i>
<i>has 30 seconds to deactivation.</i>

586
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,683
You hear that?

587
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,937
How can I get you off this level?

588
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,567
Deactivate my mobile emitter
and put it inside this selenide medkit.

589
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,861
-It'll shield the signature.
-And then what?

590
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,821
Take it to Level Red
and reactivate me.

591
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,032
[sighs] What are you going to do
once you get to Level Red?

592
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,868
[Allocator] <i>The medical hologram</i>
<i>has ten seconds to deactivation.</i>

593
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,412
There's no time to explain.
You'll have to trust me.

594
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,353
I suspect young Dr. Voje
helped you escape.

595
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,104
He had nothing to do with it.

596
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,274
No matter. You're becoming
far too troublesome.

597
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,652
I'm going to have
to deactivate your program.

598
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,988
-Voje!
-[groans]

599
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,283
What's wrong with him?

600
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,536
-What are you doing?
-A little experiment in empathy.

601
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,872
You told me you were just developing
new treatment protocols.

602
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,707
A single protocol, actually.

603
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,210
You're only making things
worse for yourself.

604
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,379
As a matter of fact,
I'm making things worse for you.

605
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,173
I'm going to make you a patient
in your own hospital.

606
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:22,013
-What was in that injector?
-A neural blocker...

607
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,891
combined with the same virus
that afflicted Tebbis.

608
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,727
-I trusted you.
-And Tebbis trusted me.

609
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,398
You remember Tebbis, don't you?
Patient R-12?

610
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,651
-Maybe this will jog your memory.
-[electronic beeping]

611
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,278
-What are you doing?
-[Allocator] <i>Patient R-12.</i>

612
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,907
<i>Species: Dinaal. Identity: Tebbis.</i>

613
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,992
This is ridiculous! I'm not Tebbis!

614
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,994
But the Allocator thinks you are.

615
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,579
-How did you--?
-Simple.

616
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,416
The Allocator identifies patients
by reading blood factors.

617
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:53,169
I altered Chellick's by injecting him
with antigens from Tebbis.

618
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:57,215
Now, why don't we see
if we can get your condition treated?

619
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,051
Requesting one cytoglobin injection
for patient R-12.

620
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,846
-[electronic beeping]
-[Allocator] <i>Treatment denied.</i>

621
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,390
I order you to medicate me now.

622
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,726
Ordinarily, I would...

623
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,646
but if the Allocator says no...

624
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,691
-Is this some sort of revenge?
-Not revenge.

625
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,526
Leverage.

626
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,029
I want enough cytoglobin to cure
every infected patient on this level.

627
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,699
We don't have an adequate supply.

628
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,409
There's plenty on Level Blue.

629
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,662
Where it's being used
to prevent arterial aging.

630
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,291
Those patients will survive without it,
but a dozen people on this level won't.

631
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,376
I will not let them die.

632
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,470
-Entering orbit.
-Scan for the Doctor's signature.

633
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,102
[sighs]
He's dying.

634
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,520
As soon as we get the cytoglobin,

635
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,564
we'll be able to treat
all of the Level Red patients,

636
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,732
including him.

637
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,528
You said it yourself. Doctors heal.
We don't make patients sick!

638
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,739
I don't know any other way
to help these people.

639
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,491
[Chellick]
Dr. Voje...

640
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,370
I need the medicine now.

641
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:14,417
Sir, I only have a Level Red clearance.
You know I'm not authorized.

642
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,587
Then find someone who is.

643
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,892
I've got him. He's aboard a vessel
above the northern continent.

644
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,103
-Can you get a lock?
-It's not going to be easy.

645
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,482
His program seems to be interfaced
with the main computer.

646
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,566
Hail the ship.

647
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,653
They're responding, audio only.

648

[Allocator] <i>This is </i>Hospital Ship 42.

650
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,038
I would like to speak with someone

Dysek. Finally.

657
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,566
I'm sorry. I had to tell him.

658
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,528
What are you waiting for?
Give me the cytoglobin.

659
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,698
-I don't think I can.
-What are you saying?

660
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,409
Cytoglobin isn't authorized
for Level Red patients.

661
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,911
-Dysek!
-I don't want to break the rules.

662
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,872
I made the rules!

663
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,708
Then you should be pleased
I hold them in such high regard.

664
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,961
I'm sorry, Captain. I can't transport him
without damaging his matrix.

665
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,963
Then you'll have to go
down there and get him.

Aye, Captain.

00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,549
Chakotay.

668
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,141
Don't tell me you're allied
with this defective hologram.

669
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:59,230
No, but he has given me insight into
some of the intricacies of our system.

670
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,775
For example, did you know

671
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,654
if I don't request enough resources
for Level Blue this month,

672
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,032
I won't get what I need next month?

673
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,909
What are you talking about?

674
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:15,830
You know, Doctor, one way to increase
your allocation of resources on Level Blue

675
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,499
would be to increase
the number of patients.

676
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:23,338
I know at least a dozen people who
should be treated for... arterial aging.

677
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,382
Saving their lives would
be just a side effect.

678
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,385
Hmm. Perhaps we should have them
transferred to Level Blue.

679
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,180
If you're looking
for a second opinion, I concur.

680
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,224
Well... Chellick, what do you think?

681
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,601
It's absurd!

682
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,938
We'd have to transfer you
to Level Blue as well.

683
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,856
You'd get your cytoglobin.

684
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:48,905
Doctor.

685
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,367
-It's nice to see some friendly faces.
-We're going to get you out of here.

686
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,827
Who do we talk to about accessing
their main computer?

687
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,706
I'll be with you in a moment.
I'm with a... patient.

688
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,043
Do we have an agreement?

689
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:05,672
Yes.

690
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,182
You've managed to stay well
while I was away.

691
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,934
I'm giving you a clean bill of health.

692
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,144
You were only away four days.

693
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,647
A lot can happen in four days.

694
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,608
Injuries, infections... malfunctions.

695
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,653
As you said, I'm fine. Thank you.

696
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,781
I was wondering
if you'd mind doing me a favor.

697
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,325
I'd like you to give me a checkup.

698
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,705
Have you been experiencing problems?

699
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:44,127
No, but as you said,
I've been off the ship for a while,

700
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,671
interfaced with an alien computer...

701
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:52,176
Your program appears to be operating
within normal parameters.

702
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,720
Really?

703
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,139
What about over the past several days?

704
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,518
There's no indication
of diminished capacity.

705
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,440
No problems with my ethical subroutines?

706
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,443
None.

707
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,194
I see.

708
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,739
You seem disappointed.

709
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,913
While I was aboard that ship...

710
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,498
I poisoned a man.

711
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,751
-Deliberately?
-Yes.

712
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,254
I was trying to force him to let me
treat patients who were dying.

713
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,343
You were prepared to sacrifice
an individual to benefit a collective.

714
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,515
No offense, Seven,
but I don't exactly aspire to Borg ideals.

715
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,064
You were hoping your behavior
was the result of a malfunction.

716
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,986
I'm sorry, Doctor,

717
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,655
but I must give you
a clean bill of health.
