1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,004
MALE:
<i>What do you see, Mr. Paris?</i>

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,089
PARIS:
<i>Shoes...</i>

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,800
<i>muddy shoes.</i>

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,635
(<i> whining</i> )

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,553
The dog.

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,306
<i>Good. That's exactly</i>
<i>what you should see.</i>

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,236
But that isn't possible.

8
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,280
I'm sure it's disorienting
to see yourself

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,782
through another man's eyes.

10
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,158
No, I...

11
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,162
Tolen!

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,122
TOLEN:
Now I understand.

13
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,875
I'd better be
on my way.

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,125
You don't have
to go, Tom.

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,418
He's got no right.

16
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,754
No right?
This is my home!

17
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,047
You come into my home
and steal my wife,

18
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,341
and I have no right?!

19
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,968
That's not the way
it happened.

20
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,761
This isn't the way it happened!

21
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,221
The trial's over, Mr. Paris.

22
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,348
There's no point
to further denials.

23
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,017
I know about you, Paris.

24
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,560
I know you were in prison.

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,395
That has nothing
to do with...

26
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,689
We'll see what your Captain
has to say about this.

27
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,024
When I'm finished
with you,

28
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,442
you'll never wear
that uniform again!

29
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,694
PARIS:
I can't let you do that.

30
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,154
WIFE:
No, Tom! Don't! Stop!

31
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,656
No. I didn't...

32
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,117
(<i> Tolen yelling</i> )
WIFE: Tom, no!

33
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,413
(<i> gagging and gasping</i> )

34
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,667
(<i> Tolen groaning</i> )

35
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,257
<i>Let the record show</i>

36
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,467
<i>that the sentence of the court</i>
<i>has been carried out.</i>

37
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,845
<i>For the rest</i>
<i>of his natural life,</i>

38
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,057
<i>once every 14 hours,</i>
<i>Thomas Eugene Paris</i>

39
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,602
<i>will relive the last moments</i>
<i>of his victim's life.</i>

40
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:45,064
<i>May the fates have</i>
<i>mercy on you, sir.</i>

41
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,940
If the hydroxyproline level
is elevated this high,

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,275
you'd probably call
for a pancreatic scan.

43
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,403
That's exactly
what I'd call for.

44
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,155
All right, then.

45
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,365
Let's run through the
osteographic series again.

46
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,243
Just enter the responses
you're sure about.

47
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,876
So have you given any
more thought to a name?

48
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,502
I asked the Captain
for one.

49
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,713
Why don't you
choose one yourself?

50
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,506
Choose one myself?

51
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,008
Me?

52
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,719
Well, that just isn't...

53
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,222
Holograms are
programmed, Kes.

54
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,182
They don't choose
anything for themselves.

55
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,474
Why not?

56
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,560
Because we're not capable
of choosing.

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,065
Well, you choose
what medical treatment

58
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,274
to give someone.

59
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,317
I'm programmed

60
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,279
with over five million
possible treatments,

61
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,199
with contingency programs
and adaptive programs,

62
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,410
but it's all programs
upon programs upon programs.

63
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,955
There's no independent
decision-making.

64
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,330
I don't see
the difference.

65
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,999
The difference is...
I base decisions

66
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,044
on information stored
inside my brain.

67
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,254
How is that so different

68
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,006
from the way you access
your programs?

69
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,175
Well, if you put it
that way...

70
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:04,138
Do your programs have
any names in them?

71
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,472
Certainly.

72
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,849
I have the names
of Starfleet doctors,

73
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,727
their patients...

74
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,979
medical personnel

75
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,273
in historical
and literary contexts...

76
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,357
So pick a name.

77
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,443
Just... pick one?

78
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,861
Pick a name you like--

79
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,281
perhaps from someone
who inspires you.

80
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,999
Doctor... Dr. Galen.

81
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,418
Dr. Salk. Doctor...

82
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,921
Those are good.
...Spock.

83
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,841
Can you see yourself
with any of those names?

84
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,928
Not exactly.

85
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,680
Take your time.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,184
After all, you
will be that name

87
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,643
for the rest of your life.

88
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,689
Hmm. I never even considered
that I had a life.

89
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,274
<i>Janeway to Sick Bay.</i>

90
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,693
<i>Activate emergency</i>
<i>medical holographic program.</i>

91
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,944
I'm already on, Captain.

92
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,196
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

93
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,446
We've got an incoming shuttle

94
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,739
with an injured crewman
on board.

95
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,991
<i>Any details?</i>

96
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,119
It's either Ensign Kim

97
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,954
or Lieutenant Paris.

98
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,706
We haven't been able
to raise them.

99
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,374
Sensors indicate damage
to various subsystems.

100
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,919
You're sure there's only
one life sign aboard?

101
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,839
That is confirmed,
Captain.

102
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,301
Transport him to Sick Bay.

103
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,593
I'll be down there.

104
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,928
Mr. Tuvok?

105
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,518
They made me leave
without him.

106
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,936
He's severely
dehydrated.

107
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,105
No sleep.

108
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,398
Neodextraline
solution?

109
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,901
Prepare an I.V.

110
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,906
Can you tell us what happened
to Paris, Mr. Kim?

111
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,033
They made me leave
without him.

112
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:52,996
They said he'd committed
a... a murder.

113
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,000
Do you have any idea
who the victim was?

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,295
An engineering physicist
we were working with.

115
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,756
His name was Tolen Ren.

116
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,716
<i>The Banean Minister of Science</i>

117
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,802
<i>introduced us to him</i>
<i>just after we'd arrived.</i>

118
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:12,682
So from the other
side of the galaxy.

119
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,810
70,000 light-years,
give or take a few.

120
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,563
That's a long trip home
with a damaged collimator.

121
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,400
If anybody on this world can
help you, Professor Ren can.

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,984
He's developed
four generations

123
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,903
of navigational arrays
for our ships.

124
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,907
We have to stay one step ahead
of our neighbors, the Numiri.

125
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,909
Did you bring your ship's
specifications with you?

126
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,578
It's all here.
TOLEN: Splendid.

127
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,957
Why don't we begin to look it
over at my home this evening?

128
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,294
My wife would be delighted
to have company for supper.

129
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,503
KIM:
<i>There was no reason to say no,</i>

130
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,839
<i>but if we hadn't</i>
<i>gone with him that night,</i>

131
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,841
<i>none of this would've happened.</i>

132
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,676
(<i> barks</i> )

133
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,138
Oh, come on now, Neeka,
stop that racket.

134
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,847
They're friends!

135
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,476
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
That's better. That's better.

136
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,019
What a good doggie.

137
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,938
What a good doggie.

138
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,523
Oh, dearest?
Are you dressed?

139
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,818
We have guests.
I should have called.

140
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,779
I just don't think
of the common courtesies.

141
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,656
She's really wonderful

142
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,826
about, uh, tolerating
my dreadful manners.

143
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,161
So you've done it to me again.

144
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,954
Yes, dear.
I apologize.

145
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,789
Lidell, this is
Ensign Harry Kim

146
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,416
and Lieutenant
Tom Paris.

147
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,542
They're from the other
side of the galaxy.

148
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,919
Hello.

149
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,548
Nice to
meet you.

150
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,842
You might have called.

151
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,260
You're absolutely right.

152
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,970
Do you have enough
to feed us all

153
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,221
or shall we go out?

154
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,473
No, it's fine.

155
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,641
I have some leftover
rolk from yesterday.

156
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,268
I'll just throw it
in the stew.

157
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,728
Wonderful! Gentlemen,
make yourselves at home.

158
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,105
I'm going to put on
my slippers.

159
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,940
Lidell will take
good care of you.

160
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,734
Would you like a drink?

161
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,987
Sure.

162
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,538
Help yourself.

163
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,130
What are you
looking at?

164
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,383
Not the same thing
that you're looking at,

165
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,675
that's for sure.

166
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,303
(<i> Neeka barks</i> )

167
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,973
What are you looking at?

168
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,102
(<i> Neeka continues barking</i> )

169
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,524
If it's spoiled,

170
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,025
Neeka wouldn't eat it.

171
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,865
Nothing too fancy
or exotic around here.

172
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,616
We're very simple folks.

173
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,660
You're very kind to include us
at your supper table.

174
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,413
We enjoy
an occasional guest.

175
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,331
I think Lidell
would prefer us

176
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,791
to entertain more often
than we do, yes?

177
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,170
She's, uh, far more social
than I am.

178
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,590
I'm afraid she gets a little
bored here sometimes.

179
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,717
I'm so consumed with my work.

180
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,220
And here we are bringing
more of it home

181
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,765
to take your husband's attention
away for the evening.

182
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,350
Whether you were
here or not

183
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,601
makes no difference.

184
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,686
Tolen would work anyway.

185
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,021
I'm afraid she's right.

186
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,399
We are at war, after all.

187
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,985
By the way, how did you
get past the Numiri patrols?

188
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,947
Lieutenant Paris
is our best pilot.

189
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,701
Captain Janeway decided not
to take our ship into orbit.

190
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,662
She wanted to avoid getting
involved in your conflict.

191
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,916
So we came in on a shuttlecraft
that would avoid

192
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,793
immediate detection
by the Numiri.

193
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,753
I hid behind
the limb of the moon

194
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,797
before I made a break
for your defense perimeter.

195
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,673
By the time
their sensors picked us up,

196
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,884
they didn't
have a chance to catch us.

197
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,636
Well done!

198
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,930
Finished already?

199
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,684
The meat doesn't
taste right.

200
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,188
TOLEN:
Well...

201
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,484
we do have a lot of work
to get done.

202
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,444
Perhaps we should begin.

203
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,533
KIM:
<i>We went into the other room</i>
<i>and started to work</i>

204
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,411
<i>on the navigational beam</i>
<i>specifications.</i>

205
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,204
It was pretty dry stuff--

206
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,874
you know, rewriting
baseline code algorithms.

207
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,086
Tom got bored.

208
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,672
He left us alone
for a while.

209
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,343
I guess he was with Mrs. Ren.

210
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,597
I know they saw each other
again the next day.

211
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,558
That was the night
Professor Ren was murdered.

212
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,646
Did you talk to Lieutenant
Paris after he was detained?

213
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,024
No, they never let me see him.

214
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,278
They interrogated me
for almost two days straight.

215
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,030
They asked me a lot

216
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,573
of questions
about the Numiri.

217
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,242
At first, they must have
thought we were Numiri agents

218
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,869
or something.

219
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,246
Professor Ren was the inventor

220
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,457
of Banean
warship technology.

221
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,125
He's completely exhausted.

222
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,545
Can some of this wait until
he's had a chance to rest?

223
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,007
We'll find out about Paris,
Mr. Kim.

224
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,886
Janeway to Chakotay.<i> </i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>

225
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,138
Set a course for the Banean
homeworld, Commander.

226
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,931
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

227
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,240
(<i> door chimes</i> )

228
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,575
Come in.

229
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,537
You sent for me, Captain?

230
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,205
(<i> sighs</i> )

231
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,296
Lieutenant Paris has gotten
himself into trouble.

232
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,257
I'm taking this ship
into orbit

233
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,217
while we try
to sort things out.

234
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:44,138
Be prepared to be intercepted
by Numiri patrols.

235
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,974
They always try to
intimidate travelers

236
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,893
to the Banean planet.

237
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,646
The stakes are too high to send
a shuttlecraft this time.

238
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,022
I want to show our flag

239
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,857
to make it clear
we mean business.

240
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,150
I understand.

241
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,153
Based on your experience,

242
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,740
what can we expect
the Numiri to do

243
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,617
to "intimidate" us?

244
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,995
To be honest, whenever
I saw the Numiri coming,

245
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,957
I always left before
the intimidation began.

246
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,876
(<i> laughing</i> )

247
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,170
Before...

248
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,131
(<i> clears throat</i> )

249
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,427
Uh, however, uh, I know
from, uh, knowledgeable sources

250
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,887
that they have
directed-energy weapons

251
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:29,100
comparable to your own--
Uh, our own, that is--

252
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,728
Plus regenerative shields
that may even give them

253
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,230
a certain advantage over us
in a fire fight.

254
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,108
Tell me about them,
as a people.

255
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,360
Are they aggressive,
technical,

256
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,903
intellectual, emotional?

257
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,156
Anything that might help me
deal with them.

258
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,532
The Numiri
and the Banea

259
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,993
are quite different
from one another,

260
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,621
even though they once coexisted
on the same planet.

261
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,791
That's why I recommended
the Banea to you

262
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,083
in the first place.

263
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,711
The Numiri have a remarkably
covert society.

264
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,254
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Captain to the Bridge.</i>

265
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,714
On my way.

266
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,927
We're scanning a Numiri
vessel approaching.

267
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,013
They're at combat
readiness, Captain.

268
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,807
Shields up.

269
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,600
On screen.

270
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,394
Mr. Neelix?

271
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,439
A standard patrol vessel.

272
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,816
Curious.

273
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,234
Why?

274
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,362
I would have expected them
to send out

275
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,114
more than one tiny patrol
to meet a ship like this.

276
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,867
Let's hope it's
a positive sign.

277
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,202
Hail them.

278
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,038
They're responding.

279
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,956
JANEWAY:
Open a channel.

280
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,877
I am Captain
Kathryn Janeway

281
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,171
of the Federation Starship
<i>Voyager.</i>

282
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,382
<i>What is your business</i>
<i>in this system?</i>

283
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,259
One of my crewmen is being held
on the Banean planet.

284
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,345
We're on our way to investigate.

285
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,013
<i>Consider this official notice</i>

286
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,474
<i>that you are entering</i>
<i>a war zone.</i>

287
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,434
<i>You do so at your own risk.</i>

288
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,395
Understood.

289
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,106
<i>Any attempt to provide</i>
<i>aid or supplies to the Banea</i>

290
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,527
<i>will be considered an act</i>
<i>of war against the Numiri.</i>

291
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,028
You have my word that we intend

292
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,739
to remain neutral
in your conflict.

293
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,658
Our only interest
is in our own crewman.

294
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,869
<i>Proceed.</i>

295
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,913
<i>Your activities</i>
<i>will be monitored.</i>

296
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,751
Very, very curious.

297
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:22,839
In Numiri terms, that greeting
was downright friendly.

298
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,469
Have all security stations
remain at full alert.

299
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,598
Continue long-range scans for
Numiri patrols around the clock.

300
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,849
TUVOK:
Aye, Captain.

301
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,101
Take us into orbit.

302
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,864
Captain, it's unfortunate

303
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,783
we must meet
under these circumstances.

304
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,284
My Chief
of Security--

305
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,577
Lieutenant Tuvok.

306
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,994
Please.

307
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,415
Exactly what are these
circumstances, Minister?

308
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,250
All we know is that
a member of our crew

309
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,543
has been accused
of murder.

310
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,712
Oh, I'm afraid he's been

311
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,380
more than just accused.

312
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,133
He's been convicted and punished
according to our law.

313
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,888
What form of punishment?

314
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,890
The perpetrator of a murder

315
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,017
is forced to relive the crime
through his victim's eyes.

316
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,853
How is this achieved?

317
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,647
I can have
our Chief Medical Officer

318
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,649
describe the procedure
in detail, if you wish.

319
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,066
We have the capability

320
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,820
of isolating memory engrams
in the brain.

321
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,947
We take them
from the final moments of life.

322
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,741
After they're used in the trial,
they're transplanted

323
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,200
into the perpetrator's brain.

324
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:40,207
These memories... are used
in the trial as evidence?

325
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,545
An artificial life-form
serves as host to the engrams

326
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,005
and testifies to their content.

327
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,925
In this case,
the victim's last memories

328
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,553
clearly show Mr. Paris
caught in...

329
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,389
an embarrassing episode
with Mrs. Ren.

330
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,141
An argument ensues.

331
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,896
Paris is then seen by the
victim's own eyes killing him.

332
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,441
The evidence of his guilt
is incontrovertible.

333
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,706
Captain.

334
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,123
Are you all right, Tom?

335
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,209
I've been better.

336
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,003
May we speak
to him alone?

337
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,295
Of course.

338
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,801
(<i> sighs</i> )

339
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,594
That rehab colony
back in New Zealand

340
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,054
doesn't seem so bad
right now.

341
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,598
Lieutenant, did you murder
Professor Ren?

342
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,892
No.

343
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,476
But the victim's
own eyes identified...

344
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,978
You don't have
to tell me

345
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,063
what the victim's own
eyes saw, Captain.

346
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,651
I don't understand it
either,

347
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,111
but I did not kill him.

348
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,656
Were you having improper
relations with his wife?

349
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,577
Their marriage was over.

350
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,621
She told Ren they were finished
the same day he was killed.

351
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,790
That does not answer
my question.

352
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,086
Nothing happened between us.

353
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,131
Almost nothing.

354
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,638
Tom...

355
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:22,142
it's very important
you tell us everything.

356
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,105
Harry said you spent
some time with Mrs. Ren

357
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,315
while he and the Professor
were working.

358
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,819
I was bored.

359
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,739
You know how it is when
two science guys get together.

360
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,951
<i>I came out of the other room,</i>

361
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,494
<i>looked over</i>
<i>and saw her in the atrium.</i>

362
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,080
(<i> chuckles</i> )

363
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,665
<i>Her eyes were</i>
<i>a million kilometers away--</i>

364
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,335
<i>Staring at stars I'd just</i>
<i>flown by the day before.</i>

365
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,048
Smoking is a bad habit.

366
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,008
My species gave it up
centuries ago

367
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,719
when we finally got it into
our heads it was killing us.

368
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,014
You must be a very
superior species.

369
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,350
That's... not what I meant.

370
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,436
Maybe I kill myself slowly

371
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,940
because I don't have the courage
to do it quickly.

372
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,236
Now, why would you go and
say a thing like that?

373
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,780
Don't.
What?

374
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,573
Don't get involved, Lieutenant.

375
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,825
I was just
trying to...

376
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,493
You'll be sorry.

377
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,830
Look, I was just bored to tears
in the other room,

378
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,790
and I thought
you might like to talk.

379
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,804
Why don't you go ahead
and ask me?

380
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,306
Ask you what?

381
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,143
What you've been wanting
to ask me all night...

382
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,228
what they all want to ask me.

383
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:53,317
Why I'd marry a man
old enough to be my father.

384
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,780
I'd be lying if I said
I hadn't been wondering.

385
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,157
He was good to me.

386
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:03,243
A lot of other men weren't.

387
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,830
That sounds like
a good enough reason to me.

388
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,916
He's a good man.

389
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,419
I would never do anything
to hurt him.

390
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,339
I guess...

391
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,010
that makes you
a good woman.

392
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,184
"Good" can get very...

393
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,977
boring.

394
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,022
No, Tom! Don't.

395
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,648
No. I...

396
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,192
Stop! No!

397
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,485
What's going on?
No!

398
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,820
No!

399
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,198
Apparently, he's entering
another cycle.

400
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,201
(<i> yelling</i> )

401
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,465
Is this normal?

402
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:02,511
We had some problems
integrating the Banean engrams

403
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,430
into his alien neurology.

404
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,891
This is the first time
he's lost consciousness

405
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,059
since the implant.

406
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,978
I'd like to take him
back with us

407
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,479
to our medical
facility.

408
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,024
I'm sorry, but I
can't authorize that.

409
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,818
Perhaps we should consider
her request, Minister.

410
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,821
We don't want to risk
general synaptic failure.

411
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,282
Their doctors might be
better suited to stabilize

412
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,825
his condition.

413
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,287
All right, but you're not
to leave orbit with him.

414
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,249
Minister, we don't intend
to leave orbit

415
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,459
until we prove his innocence.

416
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,091
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>
Three to beam up.

417
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,941
DOCTOR:
It's medicine clearly
beyond anything

418
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,734
we've ever encountered before.

419
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,486
What bothers me the most

420
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,363
is the neural pathway damage
it seems to be causing.

421
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,032
It appears to be progressive.

422
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,408
Then this punishment

423
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,577
could actually be causing
serious brain damage.

424
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,663
How long it might be
before he's seriously affected,

425
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,414
I really have no idea.

426
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,833
I would appreciate
receiving a copy

427
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,960
of your neurological
analysis, Doctor.

428
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,586
It's extremely technical.

429
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,089
To the layman, it would be
virtually indecipherable.

430
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,759
Nevertheless, I will want
to examine it in detail.

431
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,596
This might be the basis
for an appeal of the sentence,

432
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,889
don't you think?

433
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,474
Perhaps.

434
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,811
However, before the neural
implants were developed,

435
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,438
the Banean punishment for murder
was lethal injection.

436
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,356
It is possible
they would view that

437
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,693
as the only alternative sentence
in this case.

438
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,403
Will he regain
consciousness?

439
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,363
I believe so,

440
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,700
but each time
the cycle repeats,

441
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm afraid his brain will
take another damaging blow.

442
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,165
When he wakes up,

443
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,292
I will require
an autonomic response analysis

444
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,044
while I question him
again, Doctor.

445
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,087
Do you really think
Tom would lie to us?

446
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,672
As an investigator,

447
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,591
I do not have the freedom
to ignore any possibility.

448
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,553
Mr. Paris
maintains his innocence,

449
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,973
yet the victim has identified
him from the grave,

450
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,350
and the victim's wife

451
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,019
has testified against him
at the trial.

452
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,855
Someone is obviously lying.

453
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,774
An ARA will tell us
if it is Mr. Paris.

454
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,151
I'll have it ready for you.

455
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,154
In the meantime,
Captain,

456
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,323
I request permission
to return to the surface.

457
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,283
What do you have in mind,
Tuvok?

458
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,244
I would like to examine
the murder scene

459
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,536
and speak with Mrs. Ren.

460
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,629
Mrs. Ren?
Yes?

461
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,423
I'm Lieutenant Tuvok
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

462
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,509
Would you mind if I asked
you a few questions?

463
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,720
Are you a friend
of Tom's?

464
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,931
I am the Starfleet
Chief of Security

465
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,724
investigating
his alleged participation

466
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,433
in your husband's murder.
(<i> dog growls</i> )

467
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,019
Stop it, Neeka.

468
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,688
She just doesn't like strangers.

469
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,274
Based on your testimony,

470
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,943
I assume this is
where the murder occurred.

471
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,112
Yes, right there.

472
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,864
I had to have a professional
cleaning crew

473
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,617
come in to remove
the bloodstain.

474
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,868
You chose to remain
in the house

475
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,204
after an act
of such violence occurred?

476
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,624
This has been my home for
over ten years, Mr. Tuvok.

477
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,794
Do you really find that
so hard to believe?

478
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,629
I am a Vulcan, Mrs. Ren.

479
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,090
By nature, we are
a dispassionate people.

480
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,760
It is rare to encounter someone
as dispassionate as we are.

481
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,221
Dispassionate?

482
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,433
Is that how I seem to you?

483
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:40,104
I think you'd get an argument
from Tom Paris.

484
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,566
Can I get you a drink?

485
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,986
Thank you, no.

486
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,446
Mind if I have one?

487
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,864
Please.

488
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,532
You testified at the trial

489
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,077
that you and your husband
had an argument the afternoon

490
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,370
before he was killed.

491
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,749
I never said there was
an argument, Lieutenant.

492
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,754
Have you ever had
to end a marriage?

493
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,089
No.

494
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,093
Are you married?

495
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,805
My wife and I have been married
for 67 years.

496
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,767
I'm sure she's a fine,
dispassionate woman.

497
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,478
(<i> chuckles</i> )

498
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,439
I hope you never have
to find out for yourself,

499
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:27,485
but I can tell you,
ending a marriage...

500
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,695
it's a quiet thing.

501
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,655
The arguments are long over

502
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,409
and there's really nothing much
left to say at all.

503
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,787
May I ask why you decided
at this time

504
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,040
to end your marriage
to Professor Ren?

505
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,541
Because I was attracted
to another man.

506
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,338
I didn't want to deceive
my husband.

507
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:50,383
That other man
was Lieutenant Paris?

508
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,551
Lieutenant Paris would have been

509
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,553
departing this planet
in a few days,

510
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:59,517
and yet, you left your husband
of ten years for him.

511
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,936
Meeting Tom
gave me the push I needed.

512
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:07,565
I already knew in my heart
that it was time to start over.

513
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,151
Exactly when did you
see Mr. Paris

514
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,694
on the day of the murder?

515
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,447
I went to see him
at the Engineering Institute

516
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,199
after I talked with my husband.

517
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:20,079
Once I was free, I knew
he wanted to be with me.

518
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,414
How did you know?

519
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,958
A woman knows, Lieutenant.

520
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,461
<i>He left his friend Harry</i>

521
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,255
<i>to finish</i>
<i>the technical research</i>

522
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,797
<i>and walked me home.</i>

523
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,590
<i>We were caught in a cloudburst</i>
<i>on the way.</i>

524
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,886
Oh, I'm completely
soaked.

525
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,556
There must be a centimeter
of water in my boots.

526
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,015
Here, let me help you.

527
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,877
We shouldn't.

528
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,463
It's okay.

529
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,005
He knows it's over.

530
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,091
But you're still
a married woman.

531
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:18,053
I haven't been married
for years, Tom.

532
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,348
To him, I'm a friend,
a companion.

533
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,018
He hasn't treated me
like a woman since...

534
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,354
It must have been
the day of the eclipse

535
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,231
four years ago.

536
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,524
Eclipse?

537
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,776
He was very excited
by the eclipse.

538
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,570
Don't ask me why.

539
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,864
Our timing's
just a little off.

540
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,784
You'll be gone
in a few days.

541
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,621
This is the only
time we've got.

542
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,340
Let me make you something
to warm you up.

543
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,050
I love to drink
<i>Marob</i> root tea

544
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,676
on rainy afternoons.

545
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,932
<i>I made some tea.</i>

546
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,018
We talked for a while.

547
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:10,856
Then we went out to the atrium
to watch the storm...

548
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,441
and the rest you know.

549
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,693
Did you leave the room
at any time during the fight

550
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,737
between your husband
and Lieutenant Paris?

551
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,327
I saw Tom murder
my husband, Mr. Tuvok.

552
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:26,539
I tried to stop him.
I couldn't.

553
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,873
CHAKOTAY:
Voyager<i> to Tuvok.</i>

554
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,833
This is Lieutenant Tuvok.

555
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,627
<i>Mr. Paris has regained</i>
<i>consciousness.</i>

556
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,961
<i>I thought you'd want to know.</i>

557
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,464
Thank you.
I'll be returning shortly.

558
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,882
Tuvok out.

559
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,134
Thank you for your
help, Mrs. Ren.

560
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,098
Lieutenant.

561
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,726
When you see Tom...

562
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,604
would you tell him that I...

563
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,064
forgive him?

564
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,952
Everything she told you
is true.

565
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,539
Except I don't remember
going into the atrium

566
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,123
or anything else after that.

567
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,585
The last thing
you remember is?

568
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,421
Sitting with her,
drinking tea...

569
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,632
talking about the sensual
effects of eclipses...

570
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,514
After that I must have
fallen asleep.

571
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,600
When I woke up, I was in a cell.

572
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,062
He's telling you
the truth.

573
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,524
Was there any evidence
of a sedative in his system

574
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,816
when he returned here?

575
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,527
The Banean medical
authorities checked him.

576
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,237
They didn't find any
drugs in his blood.

577
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,281
Most narcotics would have
been gone from his system

578
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,616
by the time he got to me.

579
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,952
<i>Chakotay to Tuvok.</i>

580
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,746
<i>You're needed on the Bridge.</i>

581
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,914
<i>We're under attack</i>
<i>by Numiri patrols.</i>

582
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,583
On my way, Commander.

583
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,300
Evasive pattern Beta 140.

584
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,884
Dual attack mode.

585
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,053
Evasive pattern confirmed.

586
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,139
They're attempting to lock
a tractor beam on us.

587
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,182
That is a standard tactic
for the Numiri

588
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,976
when they intend
to board your vessel.

589
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,311
Well, at least now
you know

590
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,938
I was telling the truth
about them, Captain.

591
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,568
Although I take no pleasure
in being right, mind you.

592
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,986
But why now?

593
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,155
Why an unprovoked attack?
What are they after?

594
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,408
The Numiri have never needed
an excuse to attack anyone.

595
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,203
Shields at 90 percent
and holding.

596
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:35,000
Commander, prepare to initiate
attack maneuver Kappa 010.

597
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,752
Captain, if you
don't mind...

598
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,878
there's a Maquis trick
we sometimes use

599
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,298
to get out of
situations like this.

600
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,759
Be my guest.

601
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,969
B'Elanna, remember
Teluridian IV?

602
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,763
The two Starfleet runabouts?

603
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,097
I'm with you.

604
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,683
Blowing out
the dorsal phase emitters.

605
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,933
Torres to Engineering.

606
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,226
Go ahead.

607
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,521
Vent a couple
of LN-2 exhaust conduits

608
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,980
along the dorsal emitters.

609
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,607
Make it look like
we're in serious trouble.

610
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,693
Understood.

611
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,361
Cut all engines.

612
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,903
Engines off-line.

613
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,906
Tuvok, lock phasers on
their navigational deflectors.

614
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,784
Acknowledged.

615
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,619
Numiri ships are closing.

616
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,204
4,000 kilometers.

617
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,915
Not to belittle Maquis tactics,
Commander, but this is

618
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,292
a very old trick.

619
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,837
It worked against those
Starfleet runabouts.

620
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,963
You're lucky I wasn't
commanding one of them.

621
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,549
2,000 kilometers.

622
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,842
CHAKOTAY:
Besides,

623
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,259
out here in the
Delta Quadrant,

624
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,927
every old trick
is new again.

625
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,013
1,500 kilometers.

626
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,973
They're sending out
tractor beams again.

627
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,642
That's our cue.

628
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,478
Fire phasers.

629
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,564
Engage impulse engines.

630
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,409
Both Numiri vessels
are disabled, Captain.

631
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,623
That's one trick you won't

632
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,625
be able to use again
when we get back.

633
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,293
I have more.

634
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,879
Cancel Red Alert.

635
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,213
Take us into high orbit.

636
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,923
NEELIX:
Captain.

637
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,509
More Numiri will be coming.

638
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,927
I promise you.

639
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:13,056
Mr. Tuvok, any progress
with your investigation?

640
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,851
TUVOK:
Based on the ARA,
I am convinced

641
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,686
Lieutenant Paris
believes what he is saying.

642
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:21,690
However, I can offer no tangible
evidence on his behalf.

643
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,942
Considering the urgency
of the situation,

644
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,570
I believe
the only logical alternative

645
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,322
at this time
is to witness the crime myself.

646
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,032
Yourself?

647
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,244
I propose a mind-meld
with Lieutenant Paris.

648
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,495
A-a what?

649
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,747
What, what did he say?

650
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,540
A mind what?

651
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,796
Let me tell you something,
Lieutenant.

652
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,046
Believe it or not,

653
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,466
I know more about
mind-melds than you do.

654
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,134
I know what every
Vulcan doctor has said

655
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,511
in every study of mind-melds,
and I still cannot tell you

656
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,054
what will happen
if you do this.

657
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,932
If these cycles cause damage
to a human brain,

658
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,182
there's no telling

659
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,643
what the risk might be
to a Vulcan.

660
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,853
I've examined your neurological
reports, Doctor,

661
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,021
and I believe the risk
is acceptable.

662
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,607
Tuvok...
Captain...

663
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,317
the answers I seek
can only be found

664
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,985
in the eyes of the murdered man.

665
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,113
It may be our only chance to
prove Lieutenant Paris innocent.

666
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,949
Tom?

667
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,116
Tolen!

668
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,494
TOLEN:
Now I understand.

669
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,078
I'd better be
on my way.

670
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,002
You don't have to go, Tom.

671
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,252
He's got no right.

672
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,087
TOLEN:
No right?
This is my home!

673
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,716
You come into my home
and steal my wife,

674
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,009
and I have no right?

675
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,135
That's not the way
it happened.

676
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,642
We'll see what your Captain
has to say about this.

677
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,101
When I'm finished with you,

678
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,145
you'll never wear
that uniform again.

679
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,605
PARIS:
I can't let you do that.

680
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,482
No, Tom, don't. Stop! No!

681
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,569
(<i> Tolen yells</i> )

682
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,156
(<i> Tolen groaning</i> )

683
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,122
The cycle's ended.

684
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,382
No neural damage
that I can detect.

685
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,928
Captain, I must consult
with Ensign Kim immediately.

686
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,721
With Kim? Why?

687
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,432
I assume he has access
to Professor Ren's research.

688
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,060
I believe it will explain
not only why Lieutenant Paris

689
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,896
has been accused of a murder
he did not commit,

690
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,314
but also why the Numiri
chose to attack us.

691
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,698
His condition has
continued to deteriorate.

692
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,533
He'll have serious
brain damage

693
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,452
if the implants
are not removed.

694
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,455
<i>We are not a barbaric</i>
<i>people, Captain.</i>

695
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,041
<i>This was meant as punishment</i>
<i>not torture.</i>

696
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,710
<i>I see no alternative but to</i>
<i>remove the implants, do you?</i>

697
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,254
<i>There is no legal</i>
<i>precedent, of course,</i>

698
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,715
<i>but we can petition</i>
<i>the courts immediately.</i>

699
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,342
<i>I cannot assure you'll find</i>

700
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,762
<i>an alternative sentence</i>
<i>more to your liking.</i>

701
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:42,057
We're still committed to proving
his innocence, Minister.

702
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:46,103
<i>When do you intend</i>
<i>to return him to our custody?</i>

703
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:47,896
Due to the nature
of his condition,

704
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,982
we're concerned
that our transporting device

705
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,484
might cause
further medical complications.

706
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,903
So we're sending him back
by shuttlecraft.

707
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,363
They'll leave this ship
in one hour.

708
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,575
<i>I'll make the necessary</i>
<i>preparations.</i>

709
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,508
This is all
your fault, you know?

710
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,884
My fault?

711
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,637
Yeah, I consider you
the conscience I never had.

712
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,723
You're supposed to keep me
on the straight and narrow.

713
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,558
I tried to warn you.

714
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,727
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Funny, so did she.

715
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,022
If it had been me,
I would have stayed

716
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,065
as far away
from her as possible.

717
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:35,443
Someday it will
be you, Harry.

718
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,570
You'll meet her,

719
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,866
and you'll know it's wrong from
the first moment you see her.

720
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,869
And you'll know there's nothing
you can do about it.

721
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,245
(<i> console beeps</i> )
Here they come.

722
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:50,625
Numiri patrol approaching,
bearing 067 mark 24.

723
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,877
Red Alert.

724
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,378
On screen.

725
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,631
Range, 100,000 kilometers
and closing.

726
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,591
They're changing course,
Captain.

727
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,552
CHAKOTAY:
They're going straight
for the shuttle

728
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,761
just as you said

729
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,138
they would, Lieutenant.

730
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,431
(<i> beeping</i> )
Shuttle to<i> Voyager.</i>

731
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,266
They've locked a
tractor beam on us.

732
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,685
Offer no resistance, Harry.

733
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:09,853
Acknowledged.

734
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,312
PARIS:
Hey, Tuvok.

735
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,272
I know it's
a little late to ask,

736
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,818
but you're sure you've got the
logic of this thing worked out?

737
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,072
If I am incorrect,
we will know it shortly.

738
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,657
Well, that makes me feel
a whole lot better.

739
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,992
(<i> loud clunk</i> )

740
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,994
We're being boarded.

741
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,045
NUMIRI:
He's the one.

742
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,932
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Federation

743
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,600
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

744
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,020
You have illegally seized
one of our shuttlecraft.

745
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,647
I warned you that you were
entering a war zone

746
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,149
at your own risk.

747
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,483
Yes.

748
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,111
We appreciated that warning

749
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,279
and took
appropriate precautions.

750
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,156
If you read the sensor readouts

751
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,450
in front of you,
you will see that the shuttle

752
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,079
is carrying 40 tons
of thalmerite explosives--

753
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,081
enough to destroy your ship.

754
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:15,752
I'm prepared to detonate
those explosives in 30 seconds

755
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,797
if you do not release
our vessel.

756
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,216
End transmission.

757
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,265
The shuttle's being released.

758
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,183
The Numiri ship is withdrawing.

759
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,393
Tractor the shuttle
and take us into low orbit.

760
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,813
Cancel Red Alert.

761
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,066
Mr. Paris, how soon
before your next cycle?

762
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,818
Seven hours.

763
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,069
That should be enough time

764
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,320
to clear this up.

765
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,199
Mr. Tuvok,
this is your show now.

766
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,742
With your permission,

767
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,494
I would like to invite
all interested parties

768
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,913
to meet at the scene of
the murder in two hours.

769
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,540
I'll invite the Minister myself.

770
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,381
Lieutenant Paris was not
the man Professor Ren saw

771
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,675
before he was murdered.

772
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,260
Not the man...

773
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,720
But it was clearly
established at the trial.

774
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,014
It is true.

775
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,431
Paris' image was seen

776
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,100
in the memories
examined during the trial.

777
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,476
However,

778
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,520
that is because someone
altered the engrams

779
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,147
from Professor Ren's brain.

780
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:20,025
But that simply isn't possible
for this procedure.

781
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,861
I would suggest, sir,
that there is no such thing

782
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,697
as a technology that is
entirely safe from tampering.

783
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,365
You're forgetting one thing.

784
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,993
I was here and I saw him do it.

785
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,494
On the contrary,

786
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,746
I have not forgotten
your statement, Mrs. Ren.

787
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:37,042
However, I now know
it is clearly false.

788
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,335
PARIS:
Just what was
in that tea

789
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,795
you gave me, Lidell?

790
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,632
Is this just idle speculation,
or do you have some evidence?

791
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,136
Mr. Paris, would you please
stand next to Mrs. Ren?

792
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,387
What for?

793
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,139
If you wouldn't mind.

794
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,646
The man Professor Ren
observed with his wife

795
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,691
was virtually equal
in height to her.

796
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,569
Clearly, Lieutenant Paris
is several centimeters taller.

797
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,655
How do you know
what my husband saw?

798
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,074
Vulcans have the ability

799
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,868
to meld telepathically
with another's mind.

800
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,828
I observed
your husband's memories

801
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,330
as Lieutenant Paris
went through his cycle.

802
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,624
I watched as the killer
stabbed Professor Ren

803
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,378
right here,
through the intercostal space

804
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,880
between the eighth
and ninth right ribs--

805
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,674
the exact location
of the Banean heart.

806
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,761
The killer clearly knew
Banean anatomy.

807
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,264
Lieutenant Paris did not.

808
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:35,892
Are we supposed to take
your word for all of this?

809
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,852
There is additional evidence.

810
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,939
For example,
we can now say for certain

811
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,067
that Professor Ren
was murdered by a Numiri agent.

812
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,194
What?
Lieutenant,

813
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,613
did you notice the stream
of symbols and numbers

814
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,282
that were superimposed
on the images?

815
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,741
Symbols?

816
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,119
Well, yeah,
I guess I did.

817
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,536
I didn't know
what they meant.

818
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,330
I thought they were
part of the procedure.

819
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,124
In researching
this procedure,

820
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,667
I found no other reference
to this phenomenon.

821
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,961
I have now confirmed

822
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,546
that these symbols and numbers
were equations

823
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,924
taken from Professor Ren's
weapons research.

824
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,219
Someone intended them to be
delivered to the Numiri.

825
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,179
You're saying somebody
used his brain

826
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,598
to send secret data
to our enemy?

827
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,350
He was a logical courier.

828
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,685
The Numiri agents knew he could
leave the planet's surface

829
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,354
without raising suspicion.

830
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:25,024
The Numiri made two attempts
to gain access to Mr. Paris.

831
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,526
They attacked just after
he returned to<i> Voyager,</i>

832
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,446
and then again
when he was in the shuttle.

833
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,115
Someone on the surface
had to be informing the Numiri

834
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,866
of Lieutenant Paris' movements.

835
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,785
Do you know who did this?

836
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:39,331
You knew when Mr. Paris
would be in transit, Minister.

837
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:41,291
But the doctor is the one

838
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,835
who encouraged you
to release him to our custody.

839
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,170
He is also

840
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,963
the one
who performed

841
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,714
the implant procedure.

842
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,884
I know of no one else who had
the opportunity and knowledge

843
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,178
to carry out this plan.

844
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,683
I'm not going
to listen to any of this.

845
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,894
I really would like you
to listen, Doctor.

846
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,105
Would you please
stand again, Mrs. Ren.

847
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,194
So we're the
same height.

848
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,945
It proves nothing.

849
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,155
I never saw this woman

850
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,115
prior to the death
of her husband.

851
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,534
I was never even in
this house before today.

852
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,037
You forget the other witness
who was here

853
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,788
on the night of the murder,
Doctor.

854
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,167
Would you mind
asking her to come in?

855
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,472
(<i> whining squeakily</i> )

856
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,601
TUVOK:
It appears

857
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,438
that you are no stranger
to Neeka, Doctor.

858
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,903
He lied to me, Tom.

859
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,322
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

860
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,909
You know I could never
do anything to hurt you.

861
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,497
Yeah.

862
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,998
You could.

863
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,976
(<i> quiet laughter</i>
<i>and conversation</i> )

864
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,817
Tuvok.

865
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,152
Mr. Paris.

866
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:37,615
There are some who'd say
you risked my future

867
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,743
on the eyewitness
identification of a dog.

868
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,079
It seemed a necessary step

869
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,415
to ensure a
truthful resolution.

870
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:50,878
Well... I appreciate
you sticking up for me.

871
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,797
I owe you one.

872
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:56,092
I conducted
a criminal investigation.

873
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,177
If you had been guilty,
I assure you

874
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,888
I would have pursued the truth
just as vigilantly.

875
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,475
You have no debt to me,
Mr. Paris.

876
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,728
(<i> sighs</i> )

877
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,064
How come I always see you
down here

878
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,774
eating alone, Lieutenant?

879
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,861
I prefer to read
rather than engage in...

880
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,823
What do humans call it--
short talk?

881
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,325
Close enough.

882
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,454
You don't make
