1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,506
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,341
We're responding to your distress call.

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,593
[man over radio]
<i>A ruptured conduit is flooding my ship</i>

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,010
<i>with plasma radiation.</i>

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,596
<i>We request immediate transport.</i>

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,141
I'm detecting 11 life-signs; two are weak.

7
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:19,603
Transport the injured to Sick Bay
and the rest to Cargo Bay 1.

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,314
I want security teams at both locations.

9
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,321
[indistinct chattering]

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,447
Our weapons!

11
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,990
[Tuvok]
They'll be returned to you when you leave.

12
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,243
These are dangerous criminals.
They have to be secured.

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,787
We'll do our best to accommodate you.

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,248
I had eight men in custody.

15
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,415
Where are the other two?

16
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,875
[doctor]
We're not going to hurt you.

17
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,794
Stay away, or I'll kill her!

18
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,786
I'm sure we can resolve this
without resorting to violence.

19
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,788
What is it you want?

20
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,499
A ship, some food.

21
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,669
I might be able to arrange that,
but you'll have to release her first.

22
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,128
I'm not a fool.

23
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,588
[door opens]

24
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,717
You know I'll do it! Tell them.

25
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,678
You're not getting off this ship.

26
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,222
If you release her,
I promise you won't be harmed.

27
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,224
Not until I get a ship.

28
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,226
We don't negotiate with criminals.

29
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,477
Who are you?

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,313
Warden Yediq
of the Nygean Detention Force.

31
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,189
This man is my prisoner.

32
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,693
If that were true,
he wouldn't be holding my friend hostage.

33
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,985
[grunts]

34
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,863
Get back!

35
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,075
I'm a hologram. I can't be harmed.

36
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,785
[grunts]

37
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,997
I think you proved my point.

38
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,250
We're lucky you came along, captain.

39
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,628
Ten more minutes and none of us
would have survived the plasma leak.

40
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,547
Your vessel was equipped
with escape pods.

41
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,673
Why didn't you use them?

42
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,968
I couldn't risk letting
any of the prisoners get away.

43
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,220
As you've seen,
they're extremely dangerous.

44
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,056
-Where are you taking them?
-Back to our homeworld.

45
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,391
They're due to be executed.

46
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,313
What were their crimes?

47
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,815
All eight are murderers.

48
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,067
Three are multiple offenders.

49
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,029
We're just 13 light-years from our system.

50
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,406
I'd appreciate it
if you'd take us back there.

51
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,367
Actually, we were headed
in the opposite direction.

52
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,162
I could arrange for one of our ships
to rendezvous with<i> Voyager.</i>

53
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,372
It'll take several days.

54
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,750
My prisoners will have
to be strictly monitored.

55
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,044
Commander Tuvok
will help you make arrangements.

56
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,804
Some of the crew
may not be comfortable

57
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,140
helping to deliver
eight men to their deaths.

58
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,350
I can't say I like it, either,

59
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,645
but we have a prime directive to follow.

60
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,982
[doctor]
Thirty more seconds,

61
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,568
and I could have resolved
the situation peacefully.

62
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,154
Instead, you and Tuvok the Kid

63
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,907
had to take matters
into your own hands.

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,658
-You're damaged.
-[sighs]

65
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,494
Commander Tuvok's friendly fire
must have caused

66
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,204
a feedback surge in my emitters.

67
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,371
I'll help you repair it.

68
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,664
[door opens]

69
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,627
-How are you?
-Fine, captain.

70
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
[prisoner]
You!

71
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,214
This your ship?

72
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,758
Yes.

73
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,427
Then let me out.

74
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,971
I'm afraid I can't do that.

75
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,691
[sighs]

76
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,027
If you don't, I'll kill you all.

77
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,364
Janeway to Tuvok.

78
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,908
Are the prisoners'
accommodations ready?

79
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,243
[Tuvok]
<i>Affirmative, Captain.</i>

80
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,663
Then by all means, initiate transport.

81
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,380
[Yediq]
You're sure these will hold them?

82
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,131
[Tuvok]
The force fields are impenetrable,

83
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,634
as are the tritanium bulkheads.

84
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,219
In addition to your staff,

85
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,639
two <i>Voyager</i> security officers
will remain here at all times.

86
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,017
Two more will be posted
at the entrance to the cargo bay.

87
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,270
What about our weapons?

88
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,481
You'll be allowed to carry them
in this area only.

89
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,943
If you leave the cargo bay,
you'll be asked to surrender them.

90
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,321
-What's this?
-Dinner.

91
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,532
Since you can't bring
the prisoners to the Mess Hall,

92
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,577
-I brought the Mess Hall to them.
-What is it?

93
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,789
Talaxian Spice Stew
served over<i> leola</i> rice pilaf.

94
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,584
-It's an old family recipe.
-Take it back.

95
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,296
Too spicy?

96
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,965
These men don't deserve
such an elaborate meal.

97
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,550
Take it back.

98
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,679
Federation guidelines are quite clear
about the treatment of prisoners.

99
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,266
-He is correct.
-I can quote the protocols, if you like.

100
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,814
My men will assist you.

101
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,589
Thanks for standing up to Yediq.

102
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,008
Just doing my job.

103
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,636
Still, it was kind.

104
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,266
[beeping]

105
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,229
This would be easier
if you would remain stationary.

106
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,775
It doesn't feel right.

107
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,195
You may experience unusual sensations
while your matrix realigns.

108
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,866
I was referring to the arrangement
the captain's made with the Nygeans.

109
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,327
No matter how terrible
the crimes these men committed,

110
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,080
it seems wrong to hand them over
to be executed.

111
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,916
This is a Federation starship,
not the Barge of the Dead.

112
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,001
Would you have preferred
the captain release them?

113
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,670
Of course not. They're dangerous men.

114
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,879
Executing them ensures

115
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,673
they'll never pose a threat
to anyone again.

116
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,051
So would life sentences,
the operative word being life.

117
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,596
Confining them for life
requires significant resources.

118
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,515
The Nygeans may not think it worthwhile.

119
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,350
What about rehabilitation?

120
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,810
Given the chance, some of these men

121
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,937
might become productive members
of society one day.

122
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,648
Their victims won't have
the same opportunity.

123
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,484
And that justifies taking their lives?

124
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,403
An eye for an eye?

125
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,030
It's not justice, it's revenge.

126
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,949
Quite frankly, I'm surprised

127
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,285
you're not troubled
by such a barbaric system.

128
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,204
I'm simply being objective.

129
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,833
You often encourage me
to see both sides of an argument.

130
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,585
Well...

131
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,381
this is one occasion when
my programming won't allow me

132
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,091
to be objective.

133
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,052
Killing is wrong,
no matter who's doing it.

134
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,517
[bowl clatters]

135
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,478
[chuckles]

136
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,564
Still hungry?

137
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,316
I can hear your stomach from here.

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,612
This must be the first time in a month
you couldn't steal poor Egrid's meal.

139
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,451
Good, isn't it?

140
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,577
Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,120
[chuckles]

142
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,044
[bowl clatters]

143
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,547
Is there a problem?

144
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,972
Iko was just telling me,
he didn't get enough to eat.

145
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,309
I see.

146
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,773
Cause another disturbance

147
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,068
and I'll see to it you're not fed
the rest of this journey.

148
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,737
Do you understand?

149
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,075
Boche and Ledara.

150
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,744
What did you say?

151
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,497
[exhales]

152
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,127
Your children.

153
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,754
How did you know that?

154
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,882
Are you sure they're safe?

155
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,221
Some people don't understand
why we deal so harshly with men like you.

156
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,892
It's because you never learn.

157
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,361
[Iko grunting]

158
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,661
Stand down! Stand down!

159
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,831
He needs to be disciplined.

160
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,416
Lower your weapons and step away.

161
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,676
[grunts]

162
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,978
Our response was justified.

163
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,689
How do you justify
beating a defenseless man?

164
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,941
Violence is the only thing
he understands.

165
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,653
You seem to have a pretty good
grasp of it yourself.

166
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,282
Do not presume to tell me how
to handle my prisoners, captain.

167
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,117
You don't know Iko like I do.

168
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,870
He killed a young father for no reason.

169
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,706
Before that,
he committed dozens of violent crimes.

170
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,292
He's spent his entire life hurting people.

171
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,170
That doesn't excuse
what you did to him.

172
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,257
Until your transport vessel gets here,

173
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,594
you and your men won't be allowed
in the cargo bay.

174
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,888
-You're in charge of the prisoners.
-Aye, captain.

175
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,514
They're my responsibility.

176
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,057
Not as long as you're aboard my ship.

177
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,726
I won't risk any more violence.

178
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,437
The only risk will be to your crew.

179
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,857
Commander Tuvok isn't qualified
to guard prisoners this dangerous.

180
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,817
Tuvok has been
a Starfleet Security Officer

181
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,444
for a very long time.

182
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,030
Believe me, he's qualified.

183
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,532
I hope you're right.

184
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,010
-You remember Mr. Iko.
-Vividly.

185
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,847
The Nygeans decided
to make an example of him.

186
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:07,185
Did you call me here
to make a point about Nygean barbarity?

187
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,104
I called you here
because I need your help to save his life.

188
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,153
He sustained a severe blow to the head,

189
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,989
which has caused severe edema
in his parietal lobe.

190
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,908
It's blocking vital neurotransmitters.

191
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,160
I'd like to program
some of your nanoprobes

192
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,578
to bypass the edema.

193
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,500
I'll comply.

194
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,503
I sense a "but" coming.

195
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,423
It seems inefficient to save the life
of someone who's about to be executed.

196
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,133
If the Nygeans insist on killing him,

197
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,052
there isn't much I can do about it,

198
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,429
but I won't let them do it on Voyager.

199
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,853
I didn't expect to see you back so soon.

200
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,234
Ordinarily,
we're lucky to get one meal a day.

201
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,903
That's terrible.

202
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,780
Yediq likes to keep us hungry.

203
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,865
[loud banging]

204
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,867
[prisoner]
Less talk. We're hungry!

205
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,705
You're wondering why I'm here.

206
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:10,957
Excuse me?

207
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:15,003
You're wondering what I did
to end up with men like them.

208
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,423
You killed someone?

209
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,844
That's right.

210
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:29,976
Why?

211
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,810
Because I'm Benkaran.

212
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,273
What does that have to do with it?

213
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,281
It's common knowledge
that all Benkarans are criminals,

214
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,160
so when I was found
in the vicinity of a murder,

215
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,661
I was immediately arrested.

216
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,373
Are you saying you didn't do it?

217
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,127
I told you, I'm Benkaran.

218
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,465
What I say doesn't matter.

219
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,856
You suffered
severe neurological trauma,

220
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,360
but I believe
we've repaired the damage.

221
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,280
Thank you.

222
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,117
Don't thank me. Thank Seven of Nine.

223
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,912
She donated the nanoprobes
that saved your life.

224
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,875
-Oh, my head.
-The pain is normal.

225
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,710
I'll prepare an analgesic.

226
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,009
You're not afraid of me.

227
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,846
There's no reason to fear
someone in your condition.

228
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:54,185
You were never afraid of me,
not even when I tried to kill you.

229
00:14:55,853 --> 00:15:00,400
It's nice to look into someone's eyes
and not see fear.

230
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,035
[Paris]
Do you have to be a criminal to get

231
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,286
something to eat around here?

232
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,456
Sorry.
Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes.

233
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,793
You said that 15 minutes ago.

234
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,129
Did you know the Nygeans
govern a sector of space

235
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,382
occupied by several
different humanoid species?

236
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,509
If we say yes, will you feed us?

237
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,554
One of those species is the Benkarans.

238
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:34,142
They occupy just ten percent
of Nygean space,

239
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:39,397
but take up nearly 80 percent
of the space in Nygean prisons.

240
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,357
Maybe they commit more crimes.

241
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,320
Not according to Joleg,
one of the prisoners.

242
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,989
You think he was given
a harsher sentence

243
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,323
because of his species?

244
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,452
According to this,
Benkarans are ten times more likely

245
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,579
to be executed for their crimes
than Nygeans.

246
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,498
-Where'd you get that?
-I contacted the Nygean government.

247
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,751
Told them I was interested
in a cultural exchange.

248
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,753
Among other things,
they let me access data

249
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,422
on their criminal justice system.

250
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,800
It all supports what Joleg told me.

251
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,302
[sighs]

252
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,554
-Neelix...
-I know what you're thinking.

253
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,223
That you're the softest touch
in the Delta Quadrant.

254
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,810
These are the transcripts
from Joleg's trial.

255
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,646
He was convicted
on circumstantial evidence.

256
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,399
Let me guess. He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

257
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,609
Apparently.

258
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,195
Neelix, when I was
in the Federation penal colony,

259
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,739
everybody had a story.

260
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,825
I never put much stock in them.
Neither should you.

261
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,787
How many of those people
were sentenced to die?

262
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,173
I still don't understand.

263
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,674
Why weren't you hurt?

264
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,760
Because my matrix is photonic.

265
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,513
I'm made of light.

266
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,141
-You wanted to see me?
-I'll be with you in just a moment.

267
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,310
You don't feel pain?

268
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,523
Well, I suppose my pride
has been wounded on occasion.

269
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,902
I wish I was made of light.

270
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,988
Try to rest.

271
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,661
Mr. Iko responded so well
to the first dose of nanoprobes,

272
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,913
I thought a second might improve
his condition further.

273
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,998
It'll only take a moment to extract them.

274
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,923
You and Mr. Iko
seem to be getting along well.

275
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,508
It's the strangest thing.

276
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,427
When he first arrived,
he was crude, abusive.

277
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,305
Now he's a model patient,
grateful, considerate.

278
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,516
He's obviously an unstable individual.

279
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,977
Inconsistent behavior
is hardly surprising.

280
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,980
Still, if it weren't for
the security detail

281
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,023
I'd forget he was a criminal.

282
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,734
It's possible he's trying
to manipulate you.

283
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,986
[Iko]
Doctor!

284
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,946
[groaning]

285
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,536
-What's the matter?
-My stomach.

286
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,162
[groaning]

287
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,291
I'm not detecting anything.

288
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,668
I can't...

289
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,752
What's wrong?

290
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,170
[gasping]

291
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:12,091
I can't stop thinking about
the man I killed.

292
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,719
That's not surprising.
You're experiencing guilt.

293
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,598
Is that why I'm feeling sick?

294
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,349
Nausea could be a symptom of guilt.

295
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,643
I've never felt guilty before.

296
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,770
You've committed many crimes.

297
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,231
None of them made me feel like this.

298
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,233
[gasping]

299
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:34,238
-Why did you do this to me?
-We're not responsible for your guilt.

300
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,325
I didn't feel this way,

301
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:41,787
until you put those nanoprobes in me.

302
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,914
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

303
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,752
This is some kind of punishment.

304
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,092
-Take the nanoprobes out.
-You could die.

305
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,553
[gasping]

306
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,846
Please?

307
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,516
I don't want to feel this way anymore.

308
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,571
You don't honestly believe
we're responsible for his condition.

309
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,448
We applied the Borg technology.

310
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,409
It's possible there were
some unforeseen side effects.

311
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,036
Guilt, for example.

312
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,542
-Look at this.
-What?

313
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,836
It's my most recent scan.

314
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,715
The neurotransmitters have established
new pathways throughout his cortex.

315
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,342
Wasn't that your intention?

316
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,179
No, I was simply trying
to bypass the edema.

317
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,307
-Then how did this happen?
-I don't know.

318
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,143
It's possible this is normal
Nygean brain activity,

319
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,729
but I have no basis for comparison.

320
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,234
You should ask Mr. Yediq
to contact a Nygean medical official.

321
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,028
Maybe they could provide
some relevant information.

322
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,870
Seven of Nine.

323
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,082
Stay? Talk to me.

324
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,210
-I'm extremely busy.
-Please.

325
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,004
I'm scared.

326
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,387
What did you want to discuss?

327
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,601
I'm due in Astrometrics,
so if there's nothing--

328
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,937
Astrometrics. What's that?

329
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,149
A laboratory
where we observe stellar phenomena.

330
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:40,114
When I was a child,
I'd lie under the stars for hours.

331
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,160
I'd stare at them
until I could see the shapes.

332
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,870
Shapes?

333
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,082
Faces and animals made out of stars.

334
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,377
You're referring to constellations.

335
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,088
I named them.

336
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,133
There was Paedos the Warrior

337
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:03,012
and Gezid the Beast.

338
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,057
No matter how hard he tried,

339
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,561
Paedos could never catch Gezid.

340
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,064
Because the distance between them
always remained the same.

341
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,234
You've seen them?

342
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,779
Possibly.

343
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,698
I've catalogued approximately
six billion stars.

344
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,201
Then you must have seen Onella, too,

345
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,620
the Mother.

346
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,999
Describe her.

347
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,337
She was surrounded
by 16 smaller stars,

348
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,548
her daughters.

349
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,428
If I try, I think
I can remember all their names.

350
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,644
[Joleg]
Grid 11-6. Green.

351
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,937
What's going on over there?

352
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,188
[Joleg]
Kot-Kot.

353
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,564
[laughter]

354
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,733
[Neelix]
That's Kadis-Kot.

355
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,235
Congratulations.

356
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,569
[man]
Down here.

357
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,034
I've been doing some research
on the Nygean legal system.

358
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:11,747
You were right about the Benkarans
receiving harsher sentences.

359
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,124
I saw the statistics.

360
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,335
Statistics won't save me.

361
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,381
I noticed some people
convicted of murder,

362
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:25,010
even terrible, premeditated murders,
weren't executed.

363
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,806
Some weren't punished at all,
but you were sentenced to death.

364
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,809
-That's what the family wants.
-The family?

365
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,647
After you're convicted,
the family of the victim sentences you.

366
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,986
Well, shouldn't you be sentenced
by someone less partial, like a judge?

367
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,114
<i>Vekto valek k'vadim.</i>

368
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,658
It's Ancient Nygean.

369
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,367
It means, "Favor the victims."

370
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,373
What if I stole your game board?

371
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,296
What right would a judge have
to assign value to your loss?

372
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,839
To him, it's just a game board,

373
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,217
but to you it might be
a priceless family possession.

374
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,430
And what if I murdered your child?

375
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,269
I think I get your point.

376
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,271
<i>Vekto valek k'vadim.</i>

377
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,858
It's the basis
for the Nygean legal system.

378
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,402
What about the criminals
that didn't serve any sentence at all?

379
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:29,033
Some people prefer
restitution to revenge.

380
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,578
If a defendant is wealthy enough,

381
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,456
he can negotiate a settlement
with the victim's family.

382
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,876
Oh, that doesn't seem fair.

383
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,588
It's perfectly fair,
unless you're destitute.

384
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,968
Maybe I can talk to the captain

385
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,805
about finding a way
to compensate your victims.

386
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,431
I'm grateful

387
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,394
but it would imply I'm guilty.

388
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,105
I wouldn't want that.

389
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,652
There must be something I can do.

390
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,406
You can transmit a letter to my brother.

391
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,825
I'd like to let him know
what's happened to me.

392
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,662
I'll get a padd.

393
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,429
I thought you might find this interesting.

394
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,145
-What is it?
-It's an Astrometrics log.

395
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,232
It contains data
on various star formations.

396
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,195
It's just words and numbers.

397
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,615
I'd rather look at the stars.

398
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,996
I'll bring you a star chart
after my next shift.

399
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,630
What's the metal above your eye?

400
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,842
It's a cybernetic implant.

401
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,470
-Where did you get it?
-It was installed by the Borg.

402
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,472
Must have hurt.

403
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,350
I don't recall.

404
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,106
I hurt people.

405
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,318
I deserve to die.

406
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,697
Seven?

407
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,450
I found something.

408
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,047
This is a scan
depicting a healthy Nygean brain.

409
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,092
This node is analogous
to the human pineal gland.

410
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,511
In addition to controlling
behavioral impulses,

411
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,472
it regulates decision making.

412
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,767
You might say it's the physiological
equivalent of a conscience.

413
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,852
Normally, the node connects
to the rest of the brain

414
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,937
through a series of neural pathways.

415
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,274
Now, look at the scan of Iko's node

416
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,984
before we applied the nanoprobes.

417
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,195
It's detached.

418
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,738
Did that happen
when he was assaulted?

419
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,532
No. I believe it's congenital,
a birth defect.

420
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,785
Without the node,
Iko would have been prone to violence

421
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,287
and sociopathic behavior all his life.

422
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,832
When I used Seven's nanoprobes
to treat the injuries from the assault,

423
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,127
it seems they inadvertently
repaired the defect, as well.

424
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,088
You've activated his conscience.

425
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,216
Well, that would explain
why he's suddenly experiencing guilt.

426
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,550
There's more to it than that.

427
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:37,554
I believe he's become capable
of controlling his violent impulses.

428
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,517
Capable, maybe,
but how do you know he will?

429
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,228
Even the thought of violence
makes him ill now.

430
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,356
In my opinion,
he's no longer a threat to anyone.

431
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,650
By some definitions, captain,

432
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,319
he's not the same man
who committed the murder.

433
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,620
Are you suggesting we release him?

434
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,500
Of course not, but at the very least,
his case should be re-examined.

435
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,085
Because he's sorry.

436
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,337
There's new medical evidence
to be considered.

437
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,714
None of it changes the fact
that he killed a man.

438
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,008
He was suffering
from a neurological defect.

439
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,677
He couldn't control his behavior.

440
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,054
If Iko had been diagnosed and treated,

441
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,973
he never would have committed
that crime.

442
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,725
In a manner of speaking,
he's a victim of his own biology.

443
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,186
So Iko is the victim now?

444
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,271
[Janeway]
No one's denying

445
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,940
that he committed a terrible crime,

446
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,401
but as a result
of the doctor's treatments,

447
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,571
he's undergone
a fundamental change.

448
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,739
Killing him
won't accomplish anything.

449
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:41,034
-That's not your decision to make.
-Nor is it yours.

450
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,371
He's obviously deceiving you somehow.

451
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,873
Listen,
we could debate this all day,

452
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,750
but the fact is,
our personal opinions are irrelevant.

453
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,253
All that matters is Nygean law.

454
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,798
Does Iko have a legal means
of appeal at his disposal?

455
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,178
In accordance
with Nygean Penal Code,

456
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,306
a capital defendant
has a right to appeal his sentence

457
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,057
to the family of his victims.

458
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,644
Then I'd like you to help
Commander Tuvok draft an appeal

459
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,855
and submit it to the proper authorities.

460
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,446
Take back the appeal.

461
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,033
You'd rather die,
because you think it'll relieve your pain?

462
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,913
Death is what I deserve.

463
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:31,376
You say I've changed,
but I look at these hands every day,

464
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,837
and I see them squeezing
that man's throat,

465
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,341
and I hear the sounds he made.

466
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,638
I'm disgusting.

467
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,185
Do you think I'm disgusting?

468
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,522
You've been nothing but kind to me.

469
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,026
You asked me earlier if it hurt

470
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,487
when my occipital implant
was installed.

471
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,073
I told you I didn't remember,

472
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,494
but the truth is,

473
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,414
it was one of the most painful
experiences of my life.

474
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,584
Why did you lie?

475
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,383
It's difficult for me to talk about,

476
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,762
because I forced others
to undergo the same procedure.

477
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,264
Why?

478
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,808
I was compelled to do so
by the Borg collective.

479
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,228
I wasn't in control of my actions,

480
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,314
just as you weren't in control
when you took a life.

481
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,277
My nanoprobes have given you control.

482
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,947
You're a different person now.
You don't deserve to be executed.

483
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,500
[breathing heavily]

484
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,127
I want to go back to my cell.

485
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,878
You're free to remain here.

486
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,463
Am I still sick?

487
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,259
-No, but--
-Then I don't want special treatment.

488
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,774
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

489
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,154
You must be hungry.

490
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,961
-Here you go.
-Give it to him.

491
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,008
He's already had his dinner.

492
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,677
Please.

493
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,014
All right.

494
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,205
You wanted to see me.

495
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,125
We just received a response
from the Nygeans.

496
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,796
The family has refused
to consider the appeal.

497
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,925
-But the medical evidence--
-They won't look at it.

498
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,803
The family found the request insulting.

499
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,971
Your government could insist
that they review it.

500
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:34,351
We have laws that protect victims
from emotional distress.

501
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,562
In that case, we should grant Iko
asylum aboard Voyager.

502
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,608
You agreed to work
within the confines of our legal system.

503
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,235
Your system is flawed.

504
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,569
That's enough, Seven.

505
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,575
I assure you,
we'll abide by the family's decision.

506
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,497
Now, I need a moment alone with Seven,
if you don't mind?

507
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,628
[door opens and closes]

508
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,213
We did everything we could
to help him.

509
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,631
We have to do more.

510
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,675
You barely know this man.

511
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,593
Why are you so passionate
about helping him?

512
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,721
I want to give him the same opportunity
you gave me.

513
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,975
When you severed my link
to the collective,

514
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,144
you changed who I was.

515
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:20,105
You made it possible for me
to reclaim my humanity.

516
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,401
Because of my nanoprobes,
Iko has undergone a similar change.

517
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,196
He should be given the chance
to atone for his crimes.

518
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,825
Atonement? Is that what this is about?

519
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,118
Yes.

520
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,329
For him or for you?

521
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,124
I don't know what you mean.

522
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,210
I think part of you still feels
responsible

523
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,589
for the violent acts you committed
when you were a Borg.

524
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,883
-You're mistaken.
-Am I?

525
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,762
Maybe you believe
if Iko is found not guilty,

526
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,640
somehow you won't be guilty, either.

527
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,477
You said it yourself.

528
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,562
You've reclaimed your humanity.

529
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:04,024
It's time you stopped blaming yourself
for the crimes of the collective.

530
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,028
[weapon firing]

531
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,532
Report.

532
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,660
An alien vessel just dropped
out of warp and opened fire.

533
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,545
[indistinct shouting]

534
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,972
[shouting continues]

535
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,645
[Kim]
We've lost power on Decks 8 through 10.

536
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,355
The cargo bay.

537
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,986
[grunting]

538
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,405
[man 1]
Hurry, hurry!

539
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,115
[man 2]
Follow me. Let's go to the Bridge.

540
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,408
Keep them down!

541
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,618
[indistinct voices]

542
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,246
[grunting]

543
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,624
Hurry.

544
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,167
[grunts]

545
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,086
There's a corridor.

546
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,504
Stay together.

547
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,005
[phaser firing]

548
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,423
[blow landing]

549
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,061
Shields down to 60 percent.

550
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,813
Still no response to hails.

551
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,273
Evasive maneuvers.

552
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:27,357
Target their weapons.

553
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,528
[grunts]

554
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,539
[Tuvok over the radio]
<i>Tuvok to Bridge.</i>

555
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,250
<i>The attacking ship is attempting</i>
<i>to transport one of the prisoners.</i>

556
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,545
They're trying to lock on to all
five Benkaran life signs.

557
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,132
Target their transporter array.

558
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,681
Direct hit. They're retreating.

559
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,183
-Pursuit course?
-No, we have more immediate problems.

560
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,810
Bridge to Tuvok. What's your status?

561
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,314
We've neutralized two of the prisoners.

562
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,858
[console beeping]

563
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,943
Someone's trying to get
into the Shuttle Bay.

564
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,028
Lock them out.

565
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,865
Again.

566
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,116
[grunts]

567
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,784
Stand back!

568
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,333
Don't move.

569
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,212
[grunts]

570
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,093
You have five minutes
to get us a shuttle.

571
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,972
Tuvok to Bridge.

572
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,891
Lock on to Yediq's signature,
and beam him to--

573
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,059
[Janeway]
<i>Transporters are off-line.</i>

574
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,686
<i>We need at least ten minutes</i>
<i>to get them up and running.</i>

575
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,110
[grunts]

576
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,196
Seal it.

577
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,410
You're not getting off this ship.

578
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,080
Then I suppose
I should kill you right now.

579
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,626
[Iko]
Don't!

580
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,342
He's mine.

581
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,352
You saw how they beat me.

582
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,573
I knew it was a trick.

583
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,951
I knew you hadn't changed.

584
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,081
[chuckling]

585
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,003
[grunting]

586
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,938
[Janeway]
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

587
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,650
<i>Warden Yediq has used his influence</i>
<i>to convince the Nygean family</i>

588
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,570
<i>to hear Iko's appeal for leniency.</i>

589
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,701
I won't beg for my life.
It belongs to you.

590
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,122
I only want you to understand

591
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,458
what's happened to me.

592
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:36,421
I'm a different person now,
a better person.

593
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,215
This crew

594
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,553
has helped me to see that.

595
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:01,196
If my death helps you find peace,
I can accept it.

596
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,491
But if you let me live,

597
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:08,620
I will never hurt anyone again.

598
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,751
Whatever you decide,

599
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:20,799
please know how sorry I am

600
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,010
for what I took from you.

601
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,936
-Are we playing Kadis-Kot later?
-Sorry.

602
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,688
Afraid I'll beat you again?

603
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:36,773
[sighs]

604
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,692
I tried to help you,
and you took advantage of me.

605
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:43,780
-What do you mean?
-The note we sent your brother.

606
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,616
He traced the transmission to Voyager.

607
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,827
He's the one who attacked us.

608
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:54,207
Neelix, I swear I had no idea
he would do that.

609
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,459
You have to believe me.

610
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,089
I read Yediq's security report.
You threatened to kill him.

611
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,053
I can't eat this.

612
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,640
-Why not?
-I'm sick.

613
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:12,934
You look fine to me.

614
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:17,689
No, I must have the same condition
Iko had.

615
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,568
If your doctor cures me,

616
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,238
I can make an appeal for my life, too.

617
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,784
[sighs]

618
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,835
She's beautiful, isn't she?

619
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,170
Onella, the Mother?

620
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:50,471
And there's Paedos
still watching over her.

621
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:59,397
It was kind of Captain Janeway
to let you bring me here.

622
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,567
If your appeal is successful,
you'll be able to go wherever you want.

623
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,277
I hope you're right.

624
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,279
If I am, where will you go?

625
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,950
I don't know.

626
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,788
If you'd like, I could ask Captain Janeway
to consider letting you stay here.

627
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:21,377
I'm not a scientist.
I don't think I'd be much help to anyone.

628
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,297
There are other ways to be useful.

629
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,840
I'm sure we could think of something.

630
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,635
I'd like that.

631
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,310
[sighs]

632
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,686
I'm sorry.

633
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,564
The family has denied your appeal.

634
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,945
We're due to rendezvous
with a transport ship in a few hours.

635
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,115
I need to return you to your cell.

636
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,586
You were the first person

637
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,130
who wasn't afraid to look me in the eye.

638
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,301
That's how I'd like to remember you.

639
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,492
[door closes]

640
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,720
I just finished looking over
your warp core analysis.

641
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,888
-And?
-I'm impressed.

642
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,640
It usually takes a few days
to finish one of these.

643
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,559
B'Elanna tells me you did it in 22 hours.

644
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,312
I haven't felt the need to regenerate.

645
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,316
Everyone grieves in their own way.

646
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,907
If you want to talk,
you know where to find me.

647
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,953
It's unfair.

648
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,914
I think so, too, Seven...

649
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,293
but we have to try
not to judge their system.

650
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,878
That's not what I meant.

651
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,091
Iko was executed for taking a single life.

652
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,720
As a drone, I took thousands,

653
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,972
but I was never punished.

654
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,149
You lost 20 years of your life
to the Borg.

655
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,986
I'd say that's punishment enough.
