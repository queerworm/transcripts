00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,143
There are three cubes

108
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,519
approximately nine light-years

109
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,063

parallel to our own.

110
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,398
They do not
pose a threat.

111
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,690
What about that vessel?

112
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,653
It's a scout ship

113
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,613
eight light-years away,
traveling at Warp 2.

114
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,450
The ship is

No. An ion storm.

117
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,247
The sphere is presently
regenerating.

118
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,000
That explains why it's
traveling at low warp.

120
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,253

of this vessel,

122
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,551
down to the power
distribution nodes.

123
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,929
I think we've just struck gold.

124
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,600

Fort Knox, the largest

129
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,739

130
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,867
Over 50 metric tons

131
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,743
worth over nine
trillion U.S. dollars.

132
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,412
Keep going.

133
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,748
Well, uh, when the
new world economy

134
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,959
took shape in the
late 22nd century,

135
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,253
and money went the
way of the dinosaur,

136
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,006
Fort Knox was turned
into a museum.

137
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,967
And no one ever managed to break
into that facility, right?

138
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,594
Well, a couple
of Ferengi tried

139
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,263
about ten years ago,

140
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,557
but other than that,
it's considered impenetrable.

141
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,434
Are you planning a heist?

142
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,353
As a matter of fact.

143
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,855
Except we're not chasing gold.

144
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,606
We're going to steal
a transwarp coil.

145
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,900
Think it might

146
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,485
come in handy?

147
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,529
If I could equip our engines
with even one coil,

148
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,864
we could shave about 20 years
off this trip.

149
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,450
Do you believe the Borg
sphere is damaged enough

150
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,452
for us to penetrate
its defenses?

151
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,163
Long enough to take what we want
and get out in one piece,

152
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,915
but we'd have to plan
this operation

153
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,083
down to the millisecond.

154
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,751
There would be no margin
for error.

155
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,295
As I see it, we plan
an intercept course

156
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,381
that won't attract
their attention,

157
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,341
then create a diversion
to keep them occupied,

158
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,760
so we can send in an away team
to obtain the technology.

00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,891
run a few tactical

but we're always the
ones under attack.

00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,335

175
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,464

Any thoughts?

178
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,269
Your plan is ambitious.

179
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,897
There are many variables,

I was a drone.

422
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,903
The re-creation
was unsettling.

423
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,697
You were reluctant to look
at your parents' research,

424
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,574

you're a little reluctant

as well?

1072
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:43,296
They should be.

1073
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,633
They've left behind their
trivial, selfish lives,

1074
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:50,094
and they've been reborn
with a greater purpose.

1075
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:54,850
We've delivered them
from chaos...into order.

1076
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,601
Comforting words.

1077
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,896
Use them next time instead
of, "resistance is futile".

1078
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,690
You may elicit
a few volunteers.

1079
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,233
You cling to sarcasm

1080
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,277
because you are afraid
to see the truth.

1081
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:11,783
Species 10026 is already
adding to our perfection.

1082
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:14,745
You can feel their
distinctiveness coursing

1083
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:17,038
through us...

1084
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,123
enhancing us.

1085
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,084
Stop resisting.

1086
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,170
Take pleasure in this.

1087
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,090
I will not
take pleasure

1088
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,759
in the destruction
of a race.

1089
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:31,511
Human sentiment...

1090
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,430
compassion...

1091
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,473
guilt...empathy...

1092
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:38,142
they're irrelevant. 
Not to me.

1093
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,436
"Me"?

1094
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,896
There is no "me".

1095
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:43,314
There is only "us".

1096
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,858
One mind.

1097
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,277
My thoughts are my own.

1098
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,406
We've overlooked something,

1099
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,409
a ship...

1100
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,455
four life-forms.

1101
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,040
They're trying to escape.

1102
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,588
How do you suggest
we proceed?

1103
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:10,341
Destroy the vessel...
or assimilate it?

1104
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,637
Neither.

1105
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,639
There are only
four life-forms

1106
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:18,015
and the vessel
is heavily damaged.

1107
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:21,227
It would be an inefficient
use of our resources.

1108
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,562
We should ignore it.

1109
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,317
In this case, our
thoughts are not one.

1110
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,487
If those individuals
are allowed to survive,

1111
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,823
Species 10026
will survive,

1112
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,032
and continue
to resist us...

1113
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:38,453
but that's what you were
hoping for, wasn't it?

1114
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:44,751
You tried to mask
their life signs...

1115
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,795
but I detected them.

1116
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,552
Release the vessel.

1117
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:58,014
I'm sorry this lesson has
to be so painful for you,

1118
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,183
but you are a
difficult pupil.

1119
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:02,185
Abandon your
human frailties.

1120
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,437
They are the cause
of your pain.

1121
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,985
Let them go.

1122
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:11,402
Please.

1123
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,753
I thought compassion
was irrelevant.

01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,333
I'm setting a course.

1134
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,919
The particle

1135
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,169
Our hull would breach.

We can reinforce
structural integrity.

1137
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:13,464
We'll find somewhere
else to hide.

1138
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,550
There's no time.
It's been three hours,

1139
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,343
and the cube
hasn't found us yet.

1140
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,596
As long as we can keep
masking our warp trail...

1141
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,681
The entire collective

1142
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,099
They'll send more ships.

01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:27,020

the transporters failed?

01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:07,184
Are we going to be

Not if I can help it.

No.

1165
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:19,447
Then why are they chasing
our ship?

1166
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,240
They're curious about us...

1167
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,159
like we are about them,

1168
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,078
but don't worry.

1169
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,538

get too close.

1173
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:41,552
Will it hurt to be a drone?

1174
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,263

When we catch up
with the sphere,

1184
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,795
we might be able
to send her a brief message.

1185
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,589
What if she's already been
linked to the hive mind?

its own translink signature.

01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:05,123
Two point four minutes,

1441
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,793
but we'll drop out of transwarp
in less than one.

1442

You're violating a

I acquired a vast

that I understood humanity.

1504
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:17,858
