Go ahead.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,769
Uh, this is
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay

4
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,813
requesting permission to dock.

5
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,731
Granted.

6
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,983

7
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,567
MAN:
What? What is it?

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,778
It's me, sir, Reg Barclay.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,404
Come in.

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,241
Dr. Z.?

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,035
How are you?

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,122
Nice of you to finally drop by.

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,626
I've been extremely busy--
the, uh, P-Pathfinder Project.

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,962
You're still searching
for that ship?

15
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,797
What's it called...
<i>Pioneer?</i>

16
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,340
Uh,<i> Voyager.</i>

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,134
<i>Voyager. Any luck?</i>

18
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,762
Actually, uh, we're on
the verge of a breakthrough--

19
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,806
uh, a communications link.

20
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,393
Congratulations.
The first transgalactic
phone call.

21
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,359
Is there any word
from Starfleet Medical?

22
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,152
Oh, doctors.

23
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,739
I've been scanned and
probed a hundred times,

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,532
and they still can't
tell me what's wrong.

25
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,950
I'm sure it's only
a matter of time.

26
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,618
I'm dying, Reginald,

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,662
and there's nothing
anybody can do about it.

28
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,777

00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,945
JANEWAY:
Go ahead.

32
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,990
We're receiving a transmission
from Starfleet.

33
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,535
Route it here.

34
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,830
It's not a com-link, Captain--
it appears to be

35
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,542
a compressed data stream...
badly degraded.

36
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,044
On my way.

37
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:30,395
They say good things
come in small packages.

38
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,357
This is all the data
they could send us...

39
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,235
until next month.

40
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,445
Next month?

41
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,073
They're using
a cyclic pulsar

42
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,575
to amplify signals
from the MIDAS array,

43
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,411
<i>but</i> the cycle only peaks
every 32 days.

44
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:51,416
So once a month,
we'll be able to receive
a short burst of information,

45
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,920
and we'll have
about 17 hours to respond.

46
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,590
So far, we've gotten
tactical updates,
letters from home,

47
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,926
and news about
the Alpha Quadrant.

48
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,970
I don't suppose they
found us a shortcut home?

49
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,721
It doesn't look that way.

50
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,848
We don't have much time
to prepare a response,

51
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,433
and we'll have
to keep it short,

52
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,018
but I want to give
everyone an opportunity

53
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,603
to send something...

54
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,688
even if it's only
a brief note.

55
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,982
Inform the crew.

56
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,942
Yes, ma'am.
KIM: Aye, Captain.

57
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,736
Lieutenant Barclay,
the Pathfinder Project...

58
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,780
they didn't give up on us.

59
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,784
So when you write those letters,
you might want to thank them.

60
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,207
Mail call.

61
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,543
A letter? For me?

62
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,255
Oh, it's from
Lieutenant Barclay.

63
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,009
Bad news?

64
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,970
Lewis Zimmerman.
Apparently, he's seriously ill.

65
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,182
Zimmerman?
He's the father
of modern holography.

66
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,434
He invented the matrix
that made my program possible.

67
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,812
Oh. What's wrong
with him?

68
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,191
He's suffering from acute
subcellular degradation.

69
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,318
"The doctors here are having
trouble finding the cause,

70
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,652
"much less the treatment.

71
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,529
"I've included
his medical files.

72
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,531
"As you'll see,
the prognosis isn't good.

73
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,533
"They say he's only got
a few months.

74
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,910
"I'm sorry I don't have
better news to report,

75
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,205
but I thought
you'd want to know."

76
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,414
How well did
you know him?

77
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,168
I've never met the man.

78
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,961
If you'd like to
send a response,

79
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,547
the captain will need
it by 1900 hours.

80
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,062
Here's the information
you requested.

81
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,563
Thank you.

82
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,606
You're reviewing
his medical data.

83
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,776
I thought I could send
Starfleet a second opinion.

84
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,529
It's a long shot,
but maybe my experiences
in the Delta Quadrant

85
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,323
could provide some insights.

86
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,407
I was hoping these Borg
regeneration techniques

87
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,246
might help them
develop a treatment
for his condition.

88
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,081
You bear
a striking resemblance.

89
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,083
He used his own
physical parameters

90
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,085
as a model for my matrix.

91
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,003
Can't say I blame him.

92
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,839
A doctor needs to inspire
confidence in his patients.

93
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,509
Compassionate eyes
and a strong chin
can go a long way.

94
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,553
(<i> sighs</i> )

95
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,728
DOCTOR:
I believe I can
help him, Captain.

96
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,606
How?
You remember
the Vidiians?

97
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,400
The early stages
of the phage

98
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,735
are very similar to
Dr. Zimmerman's disease.

99
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,570
I believe I can
adapt a variety

100
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,114
of Borg regeneration
techniques

101
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,615
to arrest the
cell damage,

102
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,617
maybe even
reverse it.

103
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,205
Make sure to pass along
your findings.

104
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,416
Thank you, Doctor.

105
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,127
Actually... I was hoping

106
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,045
to administer
the treatment myself.

107
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,005
What are you suggesting?

108
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,883
I'd like you to send my program
back to the Alpha Quadrant.

109
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:50,804
None of the doctors
at Starfleet are familiar
with these techniques.

110
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,099
It would take them months
to fully understand them,
much less put them to use.

111
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,852
Even if we could send you,
you're needed here.

112
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,396
Mr. Paris
can take over Sick Bay.

113
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,982
He's more
than capable.

114
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,609
We've done this once before.
There weren't any problems.

115
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,154
Three years ago...

116
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,448
and we used
alien technology.

117
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,032
I've spoken
to Seven of Nine.

118
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,993
She believes we can
compress my program.

119
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,953
There's limited space
in the data stream.

120
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,080
If we send you, there won't be
room for anything else.

121
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,666
I realize
I'd be asking the crew

122
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,876
to make a sacrifice
on my behalf,

123
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,670
but they can wait
another month.

124
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,797
Dr. Zimmerman
might not have that time.

125
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,843
I'm sorry
he's not doing well.

126
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,553
Unusual man.
I met him once at a conference.

127
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,431
Managed to offend
just about everyone there,

128
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,683
but he was
certainly brilliant.

129
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,435
I'm sure Starfleet
is consulting

130
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,228
their best physicians,
Doctor.

131
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,190
They are, but
no one's been able
to develop a cure.

132
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,900
I have, but I can't treat
a patient

133
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,610
who's 30,000
light-years away.

134
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,321
I'm sorry.
Captain...

135
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,780
This is the first time

136
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,324
we're attempting
to send a response.

137
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,908
We don't know if it'll
even get through.

138
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,535
I'm willing
to take that risk.

139
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm not.

140
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,997
He programmed me--

141
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,581
every algorithm,
every subroutine.

142
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,083
If it weren't
for his years of work,

143
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,918
I wouldn't be standing here.

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,962
I owe him something...

145
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,006
and frankly, so does this crew.

146
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,468
In a way, he's responsible
for every life I've saved.

147
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,138
Lewis Zimmerman designed the
template for Starfleet's EMH.

148
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,308
You're one of thousands
based on that technology.

149
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,810
It's not as though
he's your father.

150
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,437
From your perspective.

151
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,441
From mine,
he's the closest thing I've got.

152
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:30,778
If I don't try to help him now,
I may never get the chance.

153
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,367
You'll have to find a way
to convince Tom

154
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,993
to take those duty shifts.

155
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,870
He's already agreed.

156
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,917
Tell him "Captain
Jane" said hello.

157
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,919
That's what he kept calling
me at the conference.

158
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,129
I think he did it just
to get on my nerves.

159
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,798
I've heard he can be...
difficult.

160
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,760
I certainly hope you get
a chance to find out.

161
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,929
Thank you, Captain.

00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,223
No.
Will you be reciting poetry?

177
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,475
Doubtful.

178
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,310
Hoverball? Holo-photography?

179
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,396
I may want to take a few
snapshots to document my trip.

180
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,855
Sexual activities?

181
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,858
I get the point.

182
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,945
How much has to
be left behind?

183
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,031
12 megaquads.
Hmm.

184
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,202
I suppose you could get rid
of my athletic abilities...

185
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,581
and my grand master
chess program.

186
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,083
That leaves
three megaquads.

187
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,751
Your painting skills?

188
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,129
Oh...

189
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,507
If you must.

190
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,092
Try to leave a few
of my enhancements intact.

191
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,597
I don't want to look like
every other EMH on the block.

192
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,309
I think Dr. Zimmerman
will be very interested
to see what I've learned.

193
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,144
He probably never imagined

194
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,022
what one of his own creations
could accomplish.

195
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:33,360
I could spark a whole new
field in holographic research.

196
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,828
Bon voyage.

197
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,704
See you in a month.

198
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,501
Don't get lost.

199
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,592
FEMALE:
If I've told you once,

200
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,845
I've told you a thousand times--
stay off the food.

201
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,472
ZIMMERMAN:
Haley?

202
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,891
Haley, what's the status
of my lunch?

203
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,934
It's coming, Doctor.

204
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,230
As if things weren't bad enough,
now I'm dying of starvation.

205
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,357
(<i> sighs</i> )
(<i> fly buzzing</i> )

206
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,692
(<i> door chimes</i> )

207
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,193
Come in.

208
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,611
Haley...

209
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,655
Mr. Barclay,
is something wrong?

210
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,865
No, no, it's just the
opposite. Is he in?

211
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,576
He's not taking
visitors today.

212
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,619
Tell him this
is important.

213
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,454
He's in a prickly mood.

214
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:30,584
Oh. I brought something with
me that might cheer him up.

215
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,793
Computer,
is the download complete?

216
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,921
Affirmative.

217
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,926
Lunch.

218
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,261
(<i> sniffing</i> )

219
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,137
That's not pork chops.

220
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,014
It's salad.
I didn't ask for salad.

221
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,933
It's healthy.
I'm dying.

222
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,727
A piece of meat won't
kill me any quicker.

223
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,395
Give the plants
to Leonard.

224
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,022
He's the one trying
to watch his weight.

225
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,442
Lieutenant Barclay
is here to see you.

226
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,943
I told you I wasn't...

227
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,236
He says it's urgent.

228
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,821
Can't it wait till I'm dead?

229
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,450
All right, send him in.

230
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,952
Three minutes--
he's got three minutes.

231
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,495
Be civil to him, Lewis.

232
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,122
He's worried about you.

233
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,789
We all are.

234
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,345
I found a friend
waiting for me at home.

235
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,347
You don't have any friends.

236
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,978
Well, I guess, uh, you could say
he's a friend of<i> yours.</i>

237
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,897
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

238
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,154
An EMH Mark-1?

239
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,239
I'm not in the mood
for nostalgia, Reginald.

240
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,284
But this is the Mark-1
from<i> Voyager.</i>

241
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,536
DOCTOR:
I was compressed
into a data stream

242
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,538
and transmitted
from the Delta Quadrant.

243
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,123
Congratulations.

244
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,709
I recommend a tour
of Jupiter's third moon.

245
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,295
I hear the lava flows are lovely
this time of year.

246
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,422
I'm not here
for a vacation.

247
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,716
I'm here
to treat your illness.

248
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,344
You brought a Mark-1

249
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,221
30,000 light-years
to treat me?

250
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,599
I was wrong about you,
Reginald--

251
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,184
you do have a sense of humor.

252
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,519
(<i> sighs</i> )

253
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,937
Care to let me
in on the joke?

254
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,815
You didn't tell him?

255
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,399
Tell me what?

256
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,109
Well, I-I...

257
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:24,238
You're obsolete, extinct,
yesterday's news.

258
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,449
My program was retired?

259
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,201
Retired? Not at all.

260
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,537
The EMH Mark-1
was reconfigured

261
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,165
to scrub plasma conduits
on waste-transfer barges!

262
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,584
I've been treated
by the Mark-3,

263
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,920
the Mark-4, not to mention
the finest<i> real</i> doctors
in Starfleet.

264
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,840
None of them could help me!

265
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,093
He has been running almost
continuously for six years.

266
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,722
(<i> sighs</i> )
He has seen
more things

267
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,766
than most doctors
could even imagine.

268
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,601
I also have an exceptionally
high tolerance

269
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,353
for difficult patients.

270
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,565
I didn't program you
for sarcasm.

271
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,025
You'll find
I'm full of surprises.

272
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,904
Show the good Doctor
to the plasma generator.

273
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,114
I understand there's
quite a buildup of residue.

274
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,785
If we had more time,
I'd enjoy trading barbs
with you,

275
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,329
but right now, there's
a more pressing concern--

276
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,456
your life.

277
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,334
I'm working on a treatment
based on a disease
I encountered

278
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:22,380
in the Delta Quadrant,
but I'll need to run
a complete analysis.

279
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,965
However, if it's impossible
for you to believe

280
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,010
that a lowly Mark-1 could have
anything useful to offer,

281
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,513
I'll be happy
to pack my bags

282
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,892
and go explore
those sulfur mines.

283
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:39,606
Go ahead...
scan away.

284
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,858
I'll be outside.

285
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,947
What were your
initial symptoms?

286
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,700
Radical hair loss.

287
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,038
Fatigue, nausea,
joint inflammation.

288
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,666
Have you traveled outside
the solar system recently?

289
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,209
What's that got to do
with anything?

290
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,044
Just answer the question.

291
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,213
(<i> sighs</i> )
I haven't left Jupiter Station

292
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,673
in over four years.

293
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,675
To your knowledge,

294
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,427
have you been exposed
to theta-radiation?

295
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,553
No.

296
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,222
Neutron flux?
Never.

297
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,725
Have you had intimate
relations with a Bolian?

298
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,061
These are questions first-year
medical students would ask.

299
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,688
I'm just being thorough.

300
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,399
(<i> low voice</i> ):
Just being thorough.

301
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,612
Did that creature just speak?

302
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,030
His name's Leonard.
He's a hologram.

303
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,034
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Computer, deactivate iguana.

304
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,578
How dare you!

305
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,789
I'm a doctor,
not a zoo keeper.

306
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,749
Has there ever been an epidemic
on this station?

307
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,334
No! Enough questions!

308
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,919
Finish your scans
and get out of here!

309
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,921
Doctor...
I said get out of here!

310
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,590
I traveled halfway
across the galaxy to treat you.

311
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,592
The least you could do
is show a little gratitude.

312
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,385
Thank you. Get out of here!

313
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,929
I may be the only physician

314
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,848
who can save your life--
you need me.

315
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,474
Like hell.

316
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,184
I brought your matrix
into this world,

317
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,811
and I can take it out!

318
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,688
I'm no longer
a prototype.

319
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,064
I have exceeded my
original programming.

320
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,150
I'm no longer
under your control.

321
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:10,070
Oh, really?
Computer, transfer EMH
to the living quarters.

322
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,741
How did it go?

323
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,506
Power up the MIDAS array--
I'm leaving!

324
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,342
What... what happened
this time?

325
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,093
I ran a mitochondrial scan.

326
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,388
There was something
odd about the results,

327
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,390
so I spent a full
hour analyzing them,

328
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,350
and what did I discover?

329
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,853
He's a Vulcan marsupial.

330
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,688
He reconfigured
my tricorder!

331
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,983
(<i> chuckles</i> )
You find that amusing?

332
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,318
A little...
well, not really.

333
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,862
Sounds like
you're making progress.

334
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,446
How so?

335
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,699
He only teases people he likes.

336
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,867
Then he must<i> love</i> me.

337
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,451
I take it that you, um,

338
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,579
still haven't been
able to diagnose him.

339
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,664
Oh, on the contrary.
The patient appears
to be suffering

340
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,792
from an acute case
of arrogance!

341
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,753
(<i> fly buzzing</i> )

342
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,212
Oh, that's Roy.

343
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,214
Don't tell me--
a hologram?

344
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,800
It was commissioned
by Starfleet
Intelligence, uh,

345
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,677
an experiment in
micro-surveillance.

346
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:19,223
Dr. Z. keeps it around
as a sort of... a pet.

347
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,434
Undercover insects?

348
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,310
Talking iguanas?

349
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,396
This isn't a research station.
(<i> fly buzzing</i> )

350
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,065
It's a three...

351
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,400
ring... circus.

352
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,069
You should charge admission.

353
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,362
Look... look,
you know

354
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,615
that we can't send you back
for another two weeks,

355
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,952
so please, just...
just... keep trying.

356
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,996
I can't treat a patient
who won't let me near him.

357
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,749
He's deranged.
What he needs is a counselor.

358
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,961
(<i> fly buzzing</i> )

359
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,253
(<i> fly stops buzzing</i> )

360
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,504
Finally...

361
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,339
I've accomplished
something.

362
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,056
I thought you
might be able

363
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,266
to provide some,
uh, insight.

364
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,602
It's not that simple, Reg.

365
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,272
Dr. Zimmerman sounds like
a very complex individual.

366
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,608
I'd need to speak
to him in person.

367
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,569
Then maybe I could get him to
agree to a counseling session.

368
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,363
The<i> Enterprise</i> is
in the middle of a mission.

369
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,741
We're nearly seven light-years
from you.

370
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,618
An important mission?

371
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,703
They're all important, Reg.

372
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,956
I could refer you

373
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,708
to Counselor Jenzo,
a colleague of mine on Earth.

374
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,252
I need the best, Deanna.

375
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,548
It<i> would</i> be
an interesting challenge.

376
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,384
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

377
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:41,973
Don't thank me yet.
I'll still need to clear this
with Captain Picard.

378
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:46,560
If he agrees, I might be able
to be there by early next week.

379
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,104
I'll see you then.

380
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,946
(<i> door chimes</i> )

381
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,614
Come in.

382
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,783
Good morning.

383
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:01,993
Mm-hmm.

384
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,494
Problem?

385
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,371
I haven't decided.

386
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:09,125
I've just listened to
a communiqué from Admiral Hayes.

387
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:12,252
Nice to have friends
in high places.

388
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,424
HAYES:
Hello, Captain.

389
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,136
I hope this message
finds you well.

390
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,138
From what I understand,
it has not been easy,

391
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,223
but I want you to know
that a lot of people here

392
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,142
are very proud
of what you've accomplished.

393
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,477
I also want to assure you
that we have not given up

394
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,563
finding a way to get you home.

395
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,233
We've redirected
two deep space vessels
toward your position.

396
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,152
If all goes well,
they could rendezvous

397
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,905
with you
in the next five to six years.

398
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,281
Computer...

399
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,660
advance to time index 121.4.

400
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,872
...as we get closer

401
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,832
and our conversations
become more frequent.

402
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,376
When you respond
to this message,

403
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,503
please let us know
of any casualties.

404
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,215
I'm sure you've had
more than your share.

405
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,716
I'm anxious to know

406
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,010
the status of your crew,
the Maquis,

407
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,722
first contacts that you've made,
interactions with the Borg.

408
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,141
But there'll be time
for everything.

409
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,602
Our thoughts are with you.

410
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,437
Talk to you soon.

411
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,194
What?

412
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,613
"Status of the Maquis."

413
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,156
Do you find that surprising?

414
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,283
I don't think of you or B'Elanna

415
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,910
or the others as Maquis.

416
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,828
I think of you
as part of my crew.

417
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,249
You may have forgotten,
but we haven't.

418
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,794
You heard the Admiral.
It'll be years

419
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,796
before we have to deal
with those issues.

420
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,714
Let's worry about it then.

421
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,591
Do you have lunch plans?

422
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,052
Is that an invitation?

423
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:46,139
I was hoping you'd help me
compose a response.

424
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,182
You're on.

425
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,736
Doctor, your lunch is ready.

426
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,989
(<i> Zimmerman groaning</i>
<i>over intercom</i> )

427
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,824
Are you all right?

428
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,575
Fine, Haley, fine.

429
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,661
Give me a few minutes.

430
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,415
(<i> sighs</i> )

431
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,626
Lower.

432
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,045
Ah... perfect.

433
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,673
I needed this.

434
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:25,303
You have no idea
what I've had to endure
these past few days.

435
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:31,100
Last night... I woke up,

436
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:36,856
and I found him hovering
over my bed with a hypospray.

437
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,945
A smattering of photons,
that's all he is.

438
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,488
What's that?

439
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,573
What is that?
A tricorder?

440
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,366
You were scanning me?

441
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,706
Computer...
realign<i> Voyager's</i> EMH.

442
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,960
You!
Remain calm.

443
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,713
Emotional outbursts will only
aggravate your condition.

444
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,423
I'll tell you
what's aggravating
my condition-- you!

445
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,051
If you'd let me
examine you...

446
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,802
I'll report you to the
Medical Ethics Board.

447
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,971
Doctor...
Save it for
your hearing!

448
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,099
If you weren't so stubborn,
you'd see I'm only
trying to help.

449
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,685
I don't want your help.
Why won't you leave me alone?!

450
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,146
Because, for reasons
beyond my comprehension,

451
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,981
I care about you.

452
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,859
You weren't programmed to care.

453
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,028
You were programmed
to hold a scalpel.

454
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,865
I told you I'm not
the same EMH you
created six years ago.

455
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,076
Of course--
you can sing and dance.

456
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,410
I should install you
in a Ferengi nightclub.

457
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,998
The<i> Voyager</i> crew
appreciates my attempts
to expand my program.

458
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,878
This isn't<i> Voyager.</i>
<i>It's my lab, and in my lab,</i>

459
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,214
you're still just a hologram!

460
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,882
A hologram<i> you</i> created.

461
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,927
A hologram
who owes<i> you</i> his existence.

462
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,637
Is that what's keeping you here?

463
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,724
Some twisted sense
of obligation?

464
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,935
Well, let me
assure you,

465
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,895
you don't owe me anything.

466
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,146
HALEY (<i> over com</i> ):
Doctor?

467
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,689
Yes, Haley, what is it?

468
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,649
You have a visitor.

469
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,197
Hello, I'm Deanna Troi.

470
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,117
Which one of you
is Dr. Zimmerman?

471
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,456
Deanna Troi.

472
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,542
Another one
of your tricks?

473
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,920
Excuse me?

474
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,423
Ow!
He thinks you're
a hologram.

475
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,883
I can assure you
I'm quite real.

476
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,636
Oh, well, the last
beautiful woman

477
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,554
to walk in here
turned out to be<i> him.</i>

478
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,181
I'll take that
as a compliment.

479
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,933
Hmm.

480
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,768
Did I come at a bad time?

481
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,395
Your timing
couldn't be better.

482
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,772
The patient is suffering
from acute anxiety,

483
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,358
normally associated
with terminal illness.

484
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,902
It's made him
agoraphobic, paranoid,

485
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,113
and extremely
antagonistic.

486
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,198
I see.

487
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,742
Mind if I sit down?

488
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,577
Please.

489
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:03,127
Reg tells me you won't let
the Doctor help you.

490
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,254
He's a Mark-1.
He's obsolete.

491
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,923
I'd be safer in the hands
of a Klingon field medic.

492
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,635
I understand he's developed
a promising treatment.

493
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,554
If you're a Borg drone.
He's threatening to use

494
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,475
some kind of ghoulish
assimilation technique.

495
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,185
It's not fit for a lab rat.

496
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,020
You won't even look
at my research.

497
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,605
From the moment I arrived,
you've berated me,

498
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,816
treated me like
an antique.

499
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,567
Well, let me
tell you something--

500
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,029
antique or not, I took
a huge risk coming here.

501
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,031
I had to plead
with my Captain...

502
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,949
leave my ship
without a surgeon.

503
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,828
Doctor, imagine that your
program was seriously damaged,

504
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,706
and the only person
who could repair you

505
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,167
was an engineer
from, say...

506
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,461
a hundred years ago.

507
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:48,172
Would you feel comfortable
with that?

508
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,632
If he were skilled,

509
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,592
intelligent, creative.

510
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,803
Honestly, Doctor?

511
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,555
A hundred years ago?

512
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,892
Well, I suppose it
would give me pause.

513
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,435
Ha!

514
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:07,565
Now, put yourself
in the Doctor's shoes.

515
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,819
Imagine you were asked
to treat someone
you cared about--

516
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,072
say, an EMH Mark-12.

517
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,657
There is no Mark-12.
But if there were,

518
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,868
and you wanted
to save his program,

519
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,329
he probably wouldn't
let you near him.

520
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:24,208
He wouldn't care
that you'd won the Daystrom
Prize for holography.

521
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,794
From his perspective,
you'd be out of date.

522
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:32,466
But what if you knew
you could save him?

523
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,343
(<i> sighs</i> )

524
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,679
Thank you, Counselor,

525
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,057
for extending
that olive branch.

526
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,977
I'm willing to see past
our differences, if he is.

527
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,813
(<i> sighs</i> )

528
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,441
All right.

529
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,695
He can start by purging
the plasma conduits on Deck 6.

530
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,408
Dr. Zimmerman...
I will not put my life
in the hands of a primitive.

531
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,453
You'd need a phaser drill
to get through that
thick skull of his!

532
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,162
Get out!
Gentlemen...

533
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,415
Oh, spare us
your psychobabble.

534
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,042
I came here thinking
that you were

535
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,169
opposite sides
of the same coin--

536
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,880
identical,
but different.

537
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,134
Now I see you're both
exactly the same.

538
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,718
You're both jerks.

539
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,431
LEONARD:
Jerks.

540
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,397
I'm starting to think
you called the wrong
Counselor, Reg.

541
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh, you'll figure something out.
You always do.

542
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,861
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Things are worse now
than when I arrived.

543
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,614
Lewis won't come
out of his lab,

544
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,907
and the EMH is hiding
in a holodeck.

545
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,618
He's feeling homesick.

546
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,953
I-I-I let him use
my<i> Voyager</i> simulation,

547
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,747
and it seems to be
cheering him up.

548
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,126
A hologram fighting
to save the life

549
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,919
of his creator...

550
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,172
who just so happens to be
the same man

551
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,674
his own personality
is based on.

552
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,552
I think I'd need
a whole team of therapists

553
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,263
just to get them
in the same room.

554
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,807
Mr. Barclay says this is
your favorite ice cream.

555
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,226
I hardly deserve it,

556
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,145
but thanks.

557
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,148
You're a hologram.
How do you know?

558
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,443
I'm an empath. I haven't sensed
any emotions from you.

559
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,196
When were you
first brought on line?

560
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,822
Nine years ago.

561
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,202
No offense,
but you're more antiquated

562
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,205
than the EMH Mark-1,

563
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,166
and yet Lewis seems
to listen to you.

564
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,127
Why do you suppose
that is?

565
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,339
Were you here when
the Mark-1 was created?

566
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,840
Yes.

567
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,467
Any idea why Lewis

568
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,093
made it in his own image?

569
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,555
Maybe you should ask him.

570
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,056
I did.

571
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,391
He evaded the question.

572
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,018
I was hoping
you might know.

573
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,938
He was extremely proud
of the Mark-1.

574
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,233
He used to dream
about hundreds of holograms

575
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,860
in every corner of the Quadrant
saving lives.

576
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,988
He put so much of himself
into its development.

577
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,615
I suppose
it only seemed natural

578
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,617
that it should look
like him, too.

579
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,621
But the Mark-1 failed to meet
Starfleet's expectations.

580
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,415
He was devastated.

581
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,667
He... he locked himself away

582
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,419
in this lab for two years,

583
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,254
trying to repair
the defects.

584
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:19,425
Finally, he just gave up,
uh, started from scratch...

585
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,842
a whole new matrix.

586
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,220
The Mark-2.
Followed by the Mark-3

587
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,389
and then the Mark-4.

588
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,726
He... he was obsessed
with perfecting it.

589
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,229
But none of the later models
resembled Lewis.

590
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,897
He made that mistake once.

591
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,774
He wasn't about
to do it again.

592
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,111
And now, after all this time,

593
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,905
a Mark-1 shows up.

594
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,703
It must be like staring
in a mirror

595
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,789
at a reflection
you don't want to remember.

596
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,421
Computer, resume recording.

597
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,800
Last will and testament,
Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

598
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,970
Let's see, where were we?

599
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,390
Subsection 8:

600
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,559
"The Trojan Horse project."

601
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:16,064
I hereby bequeath
my latest research

602
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:19,985
in holographic infiltration
technology

603
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:24,072
to the only engineer I trust
to complete the work--

604
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,408
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay.

605
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,870
Subsection 9:

606
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,832
"Holographic Art."

607
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,835
I hereby bequeath
my entire collection,

608
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,588
including
the 21st-century masterpiece

609
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,257
<i>Woman in Four Dimensions...</i>

610
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,805
to the person who has
appreciated it the most--

611
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:53,393
I... guess that would be
Reg Barclay, too.

612
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,439
Subsection 10:

613
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,443
"Haley."

614
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,074
I realize she's only a hologram,

615
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,995
but she's been a loyal assistant
for many years.

616
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,956
I'd like to request

617
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,627
that Starfleet keep
her program running

618
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,339
for as long as
this research facility exists.

619
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,849
She's been as real to me
as anyone I've ever known.

620
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,688
Not that I've known
many people.

621
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,860
I've created most of my friends.

622
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,780
(<i> gasps in pain</i> )

623
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,492
(<i> groaning</i> )

624
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,038
Pause recording.

625
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,958
(<i> shuddering</i> )

626
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:17,102
Don't worry, I'll find
a home for you, too.

627
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,666
So this is<i> Voyager.</i>

628
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,418
I like it.

629
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,378
It's a remarkable
facsimile,

630
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,923
but Mr. Barclay did get
a few of the details wrong.

631
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,133
For one thing,
Neelix doesn't purr.

632
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,094
I think that may have
something to do
with Reg's cat.

633
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,930
He named it
after your friend.

634
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,098
Neelix would
be honored.

635
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,643
If you're here for Dr.
Zimmerman's medical files,

636
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,770
I've nearly finished
updating them.

637
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:02,940
Maybe the next physician
will put them to better use.

638
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,691
Actually...

639
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,569
I stopped by
to ask you to dinner.

640
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,029
I'm a hologram, Counselor.
I don't eat.

641
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,699
I know that, but we'd
still enjoy your company.

642
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,367
We?

643
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,788
Lieutenant Barclay,
Haley, myself...

644
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,415
Dr. Zimmerman.
No, thanks.

645
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,001
Unless that man's
eating crow,
I'm not interested.

646
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,545
It's the perfect opportunity
for us to talk things out

647
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,547
in a more casual
environment.

648
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,924
Sorry.
Just one meal?

649
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,509
I said no.

650
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,761
Doctor?
Something's wrong.

651
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,847
Troi to Lieutenant Barclay.
Go ahead.

652
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,890
There's something wrong
with the EMH.

653
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,517
Can-can you be more specific?

654
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,059
She's a Counselor,
Lieutenant,

655
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,144
not an Engineer.

656
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,270
Stand by.

657
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,814
(<i> sighs</i> )

658
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,818
What's happening to me?

659
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,195
Your program
is destabilizing.

660
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,113
What? Why?

661
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,073
They sent you
30,000 light-years.

662
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,576
I...I should have expected
some problems.

663
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,120
It's not your fault,
Mr. Barclay.

664
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,332
We just need to find a way
to repair the damage.

665
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,543
You don't understand.

666
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,628
Your primary matrix
is degrading,

667
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,088
and there is nothing I can do.

668
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,599
Good riddance
to bad photons.

669
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,142
He's dying, Lewis.

670
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,561
He's not dying.

671
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,437
His files are
just degrading.

672
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,315
There are people on<i> Voyager</i>
<i>who count on him.</i>

673
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,568
I'll send them a Mark-4.
They're more reliable.

674
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,904
They don't want
a Mark-4.

675
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,739
They want their friend.

676
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,366
No EMH was ever designed
to be anyone's friend!

677
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,284
He's just a hologram.

678
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,370
Is that how
you feel about<i> me?</i>

679
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,497
Just a hologram?

680
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,590
I will not be ambushed
in my own lab.

681
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,427
Stardate 53292.

682
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,220
My program malfunctioned,

683
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,972
and you canceled
a lecture on Vulcan

684
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,016
and came all the way home
to repair me.

685
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,018
There's nothing worse

686
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,229
than addressing a room
full of pointy-eared blowhards.

687
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,565
I was looking for an excuse
to get away.

688
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,568
You came back
because you cared about me,

689
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,029
just like you care
about the Mark-1.

690
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,656
You just won't admit it.

691
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,325
He may not be perfect,
but he's still one
of your creations,

692
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,870
and right now,
he needs his creator.

693
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,082
Don't turn your back on him.

694
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,225
Computer,
activate<i> Voyager's</i> EMH.

695
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,561
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

696
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,105
You're the emergency.

697
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,774
Where's Lieutenant Barclay?

698
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,568
Trust me, you're in
far more capable hands.

699
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,487
<i>You're</i> going
to repair my program?

700
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,196
Who better?

701
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,699
Just yesterday,
you threatened to decompile me.

702
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,327
That was before your colleagues
made me feel guilty.

703
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:06,581
You're ill.
You're in no condition
to perform delicate procedures.

704
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:10,002
I'll survive, but you won't
if you don't relax
and let me finish.

705
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,964
What are you doing?
My scans identified

706
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:17,509
a recursive error
in your pattern buffer.
I'm trying to isolate it.

707
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,178
Is that a fractal algorithm?

708
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,805
Very good.

709
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,974
I'm using it
to realign your matrix.

710
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,810
Fractal algorithms are
notoriously unstable.

711
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,770
In the hands of a novice.

712
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,022
Whoops.

713
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,107
"Whoops"? What's "whoops"?

714
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,860
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Computer, deactivate EMH.

715
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,194
Ah...

716
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,030
(<i> sighs</i> )

717
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,958
I-I... I can't move.

718
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,838
I know. I had to
take your mobility
subroutines off-line.

719
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,756
How long have I
been deactivated?

720
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,424
17 hours.

721
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,218
(<i> groans</i> )

722
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,554
I'm resetting
your parameters.

723
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,141
You don't look well.
(<i> sighs</i> )

724
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:07,559
You need rest.

725
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,728
I'm fine,
and so are you.

726
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,022
Your program's been
stabilized.

727
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,066
I... I'm going to be okay?

728
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,235
No, you're going to be
better than okay.

729
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,570
Now what are
you doing?

730
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,031
Welcome to Sick Bay.

731
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,741
How may I help you today?

732
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,659
Well, what do you think?

733
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,703
I think you've altered
my greeting protocol.

734
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,080
That's just the beginning.

735
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,665
I've also added
new subroutines

736
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,335
for compassion, patience,
empathy, decorum.

737
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,171
I don't feel any different.

738
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,673
Because I haven't
installed them yet.

739
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,384
I thought you'd like
to be awake for the big moment.

740
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,556
Reginald was right
about you.

741
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,601
You<i> have</i> exceeded the
sum of your programming.

742
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,396
You've accomplished
far more than I would
have ever predicted.

743
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,314
But let's face facts.

744
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,984
You never overcame
the inherent flaws

745
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,445
in your personality
subroutines.

746
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,281
You're arrogant,
irritable--

747
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,784
"a jerk," as Counselor
Troi would say.

748
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,036
I believe she was
describing you, as well.

749
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,996
Don't change
the subject.

750
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,373
I may not be able
to turn you
into a Mark-4,

751
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,334
but I can make you
a bit more presentable.

752
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,336
What if I'm happy
with the way I am?

753
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,838
I'm doing you a favor.

754
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,339
I don't want any favors,

755
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,050
and I don't want
your new subroutines!

756
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:24,261
Why can't you accept me
as I am?!

757
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,221
Because you're defective!

758
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,893
"Emergency Medical Hotheads!"

759
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,105
"Extremely Marginal
House Calls."

760
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,523
That's what everyone used
to call the Mark-1's,

761
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,692
until they were bounced
out of the Medical Corps.

762
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,572
I tried to have them
decommissioned,

763
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,450
but Starfleet, in its
infinite wisdom,
overruled me

764
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:52,455
and reassigned
them all to work
waste-transfer barges.

765
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,210
That's where you'd be, too,

766
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,963
if you hadn't been lost
in the Delta Quadrant.

767
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:12,017
Do you know
how humiliating it is

768
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:16,521
to have 675 Mark-1's out there

769
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,649
scrubbing plasma conduits...

770
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,111
all with my face?

771
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,326
I'm sure
they're doing a fine job.

772
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,244
What are you doing?
I'm not finished with you.

773
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,371
I'm trying
to do my job.

774
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,499
And if you give me a chance,
you'll see that I'm
pretty good at it.

775
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,465
Frankly, I'd hoped
that if we ever met,

776
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,592
you'd be proud of me.

777
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,596
Well...

778
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,475
I guess it is comforting to know
that at least one of you

779
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,729
is still doing
what I designed you to do.

780
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,565
(<i> tricorder beeps</i> )

781
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,985
Your intercellular proteins
are at a dangerous level.

782
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,445
We should begin the procedure.

783
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,699
Please?

784
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,493
Give me a chance
to make you proud of me.

785
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:24,923
Maybe we could try it;
see how it goes.

786
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,926
See how it goes.

787
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,554
Just don't expect me
to put you in my will.

788
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,358
I-I'm going in.
Reg...

789
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,944
They have been in
there for 32 hours!

790
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,779
Be patient.

791
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,325
Well, you...

792
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,119
You're not
fritzing anymore.

793
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,494
No thanks to you.

794
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,747
Dr. Zimmerman ran
a diagnostic

795
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,374
on my subtronic relays,

796
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,293
and he made
a very interesting discovery.

797
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:06,298
Apparently, I was the victim
of foul play.

798
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,633
Well, what...
what do you mean?

799
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:13,346
He found an algorithm
designed to disrupt my matrix.

800
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,725
You wouldn't know
anything about that,
would you?

801
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:22,272
Well, traditional therapy
wasn't getting us anywhere.

802
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:25,984
Well, your little scheme worked.

803
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,693
Dr. Zimmerman
has agreed

804
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,695
to the cellular regeneration
procedure.

805
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,489
It requires
several more treatments,

806
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,575
but I'm optimistic
he'll make a full recovery.

807
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,591
Trying to steal
my secrets?

808
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,178
Another one
of my hobbies.

809
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,181
I thought I'd take
home a few memories.

810
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,932
You're supposed
to be in bed.

811
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,225
I've got work to do.

812
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,518
It can wait.

813
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,646
Go to bed.
Doctor's orders.

814
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,691
(<i> sighs</i> ):
I hope you won't be
coming back next month

815
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,943
to make sure
I'm taking my medicine.

816
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:12,655
Don't worry.
My Captain's not likely
to authorize another...

817
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,157
house call.

818
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,659
Good.

819
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,454
The next time
she sends a data stream,

820
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:23,749
you might want
to drop me a line,

821
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,877
let me know how you're doing.

822
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,338
If you insist.

823
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,382
(<i> door opens</i> )

824
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,430
Ready?

825
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,359
Would you mind?

826
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:50,985
Not at all.

827
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,911
Smile.
