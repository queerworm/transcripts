00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,571
I suggest
you ask the doctor

48

an anti-inflammatory.

No. No, that's where
I draw the line.

My mother knitted

I've slept with them

You'll have to make do

56

But those Starfleet blankets
give me a rash.

57

Then I suggest
you ask the doctor--

For some

192
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,207

194
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,377
When I first
came on board<i> Voyager,</i>

195

199
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,971
I was young, inexperienced,
and I acted like it.

200
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,141
Nervous about giving my opinion,
hesitant to make suggestions.

201
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,269
So I usually just
kept my mouth shut,

202
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,813
and I behaved that way
for so long,

203
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,524
it became a habit.

204
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,983
But,

205
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,195

( chuckles quietly )
It's been a wild ride.

211
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,208
I woke up the other morning,
and it suddenly hit me.

212
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,585
I've got a lot
of experience now,

213
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,003
so why should I
be afraid

214
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,673
to take the initiative
or voice my ideas?

215
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,551

216
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,469
Good for you, Harry.

217

219
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,224
The next time you try
to assert yourself,

220
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,517
leave me
out of it.

221

You don't have
any patients.

356
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,779
I may have one
in a moment,

357
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,113
if you and your
fellow squatters

358
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,489
don't go elsewhere.

359
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,074
You wanted to see me,
doctor?

360
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,868
Oh,
it's about time.

361
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,662
Mr. Neelix is attempting to turn
my Sickbay into a flophouse.

362
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,248
We are short on beds for now.
We've got to adapt.

363
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,166
Aha.

364
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,628
But...what if there's
a medical emergency?

365
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,797
Then Neelix and the others
will get out of the way.

366
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,256
Absolutely.

367
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,842
But...
this isn't just Sickbay.

368
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,385
It's my residence.

369
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,889
And we promise to be
the most perfect houseguests.

370
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,390
What more
can you ask for?

371
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,143
But...
I have a routine.

372
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,437
I'm a night owl.

373
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,064
What if one of them should snore
while I'm listening to Puccini?

374
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,191
Well, if you feel that
strongly about it, doc,

375
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,444
I suppose we'll have
to consider other options.

376
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,195
Thank you,
Commander.

377
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,490
For example, we could
shut down your program

378
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,699
until you're needed.

379
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,409
The Captain asked me
to look for ways

380
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,703
to conserve power,
and it would spare you

381
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,330
from having to listen
to them snore.

386
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,090
Make yourselves

387
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,301
Try scanning for
infrared signatures.

388
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,012
There's too much
interference.

389
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,431
CHAKOTAY: What's up?
Tom and Harry still aren't back.

390
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,642
You want me to take another
shuttle down and look for them?

391
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,352
And risk losing you,
too?

392
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,228
Either we
keep waiting

393
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,856
until we run out
or deuterium

394
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,607
and get trapped in orbit,
or--

395
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,985
Or?
We land the ship.

396
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,320
As you know, Captain,
the landing procedure

397
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,198
requires a significant output
of energy. With shield strength

398
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,033
as low as it is, we can't even
be certain the ship

399
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,118
will survive the descent.
What's the alternative?

400
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,204
We're up here,
the deuterium's down there,

401
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,664
and we're stuck
without it.

402
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,374
We've come this far.

Transfer any available power

I could give you

of damaged systems,
Captain,

437
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,549
but suffice it to say,
now that we're down,

438
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,093
we won't be
going up again soon.

439
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,929
Start organizing
repair crews.

440
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,266
Well, that was very good,
Commander.

441
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,019
Take an away team
and find Harry and Tom.

442

Chakotay!

443
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,283
You're going out to look
for them, aren't you?

444
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,618
That's right.
Take me with you.

445
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,953
I can't do that,

449
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,292
I wanna help you find them.
Look...

450
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,252
I know you're concerned
about Tom and Harry.

451
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,629
We all are.

452
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,464
I'll have them back
safe and sound in no time.

453
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,924
Don't patronize me.

454
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,843
We both know how dangerous
that environment is.

455
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,511
They could be
in serious trouble.

456
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,554
You're right. I don't know
what we're going to find.

457
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,474
That's why I need
cool heads.

You think I can't
control myself?

I think you're a little
too close to this.

You're damn right
I am.

was missing on this planet,

What?

Take Seven of Nine
with you.

You said you needed cool heads,
didn't you?

What about them?

Could we turn
them off?

You don't expect me
to work in the dark, do you?

Well, no,

00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,476
but I'll never be able
to fall asleep.

That's not my problem,

I guess we'll just have to find
some other way to pass the time.

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,904
My tricorder isn't picking up
any life signs.

532
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,572
How did you reach
that conclusion?

533
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,699
Footprints.

534
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,371
I guess you
never assimilated

535
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,789
any Indian scouts.

536
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,643
SEVEN:
High concentrations
of deuterium...

537
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,813
Coming from this fluid.

538
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,439
SEVEN:
I'll collect a sample.

539
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,452
Let's find
Tom and Harry first.

540
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,913
We'll collect
the deuterium later.

541
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,790
As you wish.

542
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,142
Maybe they found
some shelter inside.

543
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,405
( crashing )

544
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,864
Commander!

547
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,339
Good to see you guys.

548
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,094
Welcome to

(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

551
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,233
Our suits were corroding,
our lungs were burning,

552
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,485
we were suffocating!

553
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,819
( chuckles ):
You know what they say

554
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,863
about your life
passing before your eyes?

555
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,156
Well, it's true.

556
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,824
I was finally getting
past puberty

557
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,952
when suddenly,
I lost consciousness.

558
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,413
I don't know how long
I was out, but...

559
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,665
The next thing I knew,
I was awake,

560
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,833
and...

561
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,710
And I was
breathing normally,

562
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,420
and I looked
over at Harry.

563
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,672
He was breathing
normally too,

564
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,923
with his helmet off,

565
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,468
and-and we just looked
at each other,

566
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,345
heh, and we just
started laughing.

567
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,055
I know
it sounds crazy,

568
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,308
but it was
an exhilarating experience.

569
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,643
His vital signs
are normal.

570
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,855
Apparently,
he has adapted.

571
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,524
Just the same,
we'd better let

572
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:07,733
the doctor take
a look at you.

573
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,151
Chakotay
to<i> Voyager.</i>

574
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,486
I've already tried that.

575
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,905
The com signal
can't get out of the caves.

576
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,740
Then we'll call again
when we get back outside.

577
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,159
I'm telling you,
Chakotay,

578
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,953
( laughs )
it was an amazing experience.

579
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,123
It-it's like when you're a kid
who's afraid of the water,

580
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,667
and you suddenly realize
that you can swim.

581
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,835
Go ahead.

582
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,628
Take your helmets off.
Try it.

583
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,506
I'm glad you're
feeling all right,

584
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,758
but none of us should
be taking any risks

585
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,843
until we know exactly
what's going on.

586
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,845
Don't tell me that
a big, tough guy like you

587
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,722
is afraid of a little
poisoned atmosphere.

588
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,349
Where's Harry?

589
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,975
He's further inside
the cave.

590
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,602
We found a huge cache
of deuterium.

591
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,564
Let's find it, and get
you two back to the ship.

592
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,357
Whatever you say,
boss,

593
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,235
but I'm telling you, we could
breathe this air forever.

594
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,029
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

595
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,996
( beeping )

596
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,998
Lieutenant.
Yes.

597
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,584
We should have
transporters

598
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,252
back online
within the hour.

599
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,170
Well, that's great,
but right now,

600
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,381
I'm more concerned
with little things,

601
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,882
like, oh,
I don't know,

602
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,384
say,
life support?

603
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,470
Indeed. According
to my calculations,

604
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,388
environmental systems
will cease to function

605
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,014
in two hours.

606
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,601
You say that like you're
giving me the weather report.

607
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,185
Well, I agree
the situation is dire,

608
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,605
but losing our cool
will not help matters.

609
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,690
Losing our cool?

610
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,359
Where did you pick up
that expression?

611
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,902
Mr. Paris.

612
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,448
Well, there's hope
for you yet.

613
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,533
Now,
how about giving me a hand?

Commander.

618
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,510
Isn't it
incredible?

619
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,677
That's what I've been
trying to tell them.

620
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,555
Are you feeling okay,
Harry?

621
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,891
Never better. If we could get
some mobile transporters down

622
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,768
here, we could mine enough
deuterium to get us all

623
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,395
the way to the Alpha Quadrant
and back again.

624
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,023
Tom tells me you've already
picked up 20 kilos.

625
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,026
That should be enough to get
the main systems back online.

626
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,069
Let's get back to the ship,
have the doctor take

627
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,071
a look at you.
I'd rather stay here

628
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,865
and keep working,
if it's all the same to you.

629
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,074
It's not.

630
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,327
Heh, really, Commander,
I'm fine.

631
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,204
You should send some more
personnel out to help.

632
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,498
They won't even need
environmental suits.

633
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,249
I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

634

and sees we're fine,

from that distance,.
but it may take a few minutes.

standing by.

tell, you've been bioformed.

706
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,219
Bioformed?

707
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,555
Think of it as the opposite
of terraforming.

708
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,598
In the same way we adapt
the environment of a planet

709
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,352
to suit our needs,
this planet...

710
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,603
has adapted you.

711
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,146
How is that possible?

712
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,774
This fluid somehow
entered your bloodstream

713
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,609
and began altering
your physiology

714
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,152
at the cellular level.

715
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,655
I haven't had the time
to analyze the substance,

716
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,741
but I hope
to have some answers soon.

717
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,159
I'd like to run a few tests
of my own, if you don't mind.

718
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,411
Of course.

719
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,747
So, what's our prognosis,
doc?

720
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,332
Well...

721
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,334
you'll be fine.

722
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,838
As long as you keep breathing
the planet's gases.

723
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,674
You mean we have to stay
inside this force field?

724
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,760
I'm afraid
it's worse than that.

725
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,471
The atmosphere of this planet
can't be replicated safely.

726
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,139
Which means...

727
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,350
if we leave...

728
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,019
we'll have
nothing to breathe.

729
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,521
Exactly.

730
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,524
Either we find a way
to treat your condition...

731
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,486
...or you'll have to be
left behind.

732
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,072
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

733
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,790
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

734
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,753
Can the bioforming
process be reversed?

735
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,212
As it stands,

736
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,965
I don't know enough about
the phenomenon to undo it.

737
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,593
I'll send Chakotay and Seven
back to the surface.

738
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,011
They'll gather as much
information as they can.

739
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,431
B'Elanna and I will start
running tests on this.

740
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,475
Let me go with
the away team, Captain.

741
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,226
I know the terrain.
I can help.

742
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,937
Doctor?

743
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,355
Right now, they're better off
out there than they are in here.

744
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,149
But one of you will
have to remain,

745
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,525
so I can monitor
your condition.

746
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,444
No problem.

747
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,530
I volunteer Tom to stay here
and play guinea pig.

748
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,493
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

749
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,332
SEVEN:
Each square kilometer
of this planetoid

750
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,835
is less appealing
than the last.

751
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,254
I think
it's breathtaking.

752
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,923
SEVEN:
Breathtaking?

753
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,257
Yes.

754
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,050
SEVEN:
Perhaps your
recent experience

755
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,761
has impaired
your perceptions.

756
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,054
No,
I don't think so.

757
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,556
I wasn't really
seeing it before.

758
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,852
Seeing what?

759
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,436
The beauty.

760
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,147
Would you care
to point out an example?

761
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,484
Look over there.

762
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,736
What do you see?

763
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,322
I see monochromatic
geological formations,

764
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,324
dust, haze.

765
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,784
What do you see,
Harry?

766
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,620
To me,
those geological formations

767
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,289
are a dozen shades
of red and gold.

768
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,333
That dust...

769
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,752
it's glowing.

770
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,505
And the haze...
it seems to intensify

771
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,299
the colors.

772
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,760
I'm sorry.

773
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,096
I know it's weird, but I feel
connected to this place.

774
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,348
Connected how?

775
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,642
I'm picking up
humanoid life signs.

776
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,310
Location?

777
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,521
100 meters
this way.

778
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,696
JANEWAY:
Magnify, factor 10.

779
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,448
Deuterium,
hydrogen sulfate, dichromates.

780
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,576
Add a little
sodium chloride,

781
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,119
and it would probably taste
a lot like Neelix's soup.

782
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,831
We should be so lucky.
( chuckling )

783
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,290
Oh, what's this?

784
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,418
Magnify, factor 20.

Captain?

787
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,386
That's a protein molecule.

788
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,221
This fluid has
organic properties.

789
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,307
Let me see the sample that's
been treated with the reagents.

790
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,689
Captain...

791
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,028
Let's get you
to Sickbay.

792
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,238
Wait.
That might not be necessary.

Janeway to Bridge.
Report.

801
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,888
A large pool
of the metallic compound

802
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,473
is forming
beneath the ship.

803
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,891
We are sinking,
Captain.

804
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,601
On my way.
Get down to Engineering.

805
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,063
Get thrusters online.
We're getting off this planet.

806
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,149
CHAKOTAY:
I'm not sure how,
but they're still alive.

807

Go ahead.

TUVOK:
<i>The Captain has ordered</i>
<i>an emergency ascent.</i>

810
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,656
We must bring you back
to the ship.

CHAKOTAY:
<i>Understood.</i>
<i>I've got five to beam back.</i>

812
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,078
Five?
We found another Paris and Kim.

<i>I can't explain it.</i>

814
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,707
I think I can.
Prepare for transport.

815
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,500
Beam us directly
to Sickbay.

816
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,877
No.

817
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,170
I don't wanna go back.

818
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,546
Transporters are still
acting up.

819
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,006
We can't get
individual locks.

820
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,050
We're gonna have to grab you
in a wide beam,

821
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,634
and bring you in
as a group.

Maybe so,

825
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,517
but until we know
what's going on,

826
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,144
you've got to come back
with us to the ship.

I'm trying to get a lock
on the fifth.

832
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,534

or rather,
one of the Ensigns Kim.

Then there's no time. We've got
to get back into orbit.

We'll worry about Harry,
or whoever he is, once we're up.

If we don't lift off soon,
the hull will begin to corrode.

JANEWAY:<i> How long?</i> 
At least a half an hour.

TUVOK:
Even if thrusters
are repaired,

860
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,937
they won't be of much use
if we sink any deeper.

861
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,524
There must be some way
to disperse it.

862
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,194
Try a nadion burst
from the phaser emitters.

863
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,113
It may weaken the
electromagnetic properties

864
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,282
of the fluid.
Aye, Captain.

865
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:48,118
I'm on my way to Sickbay
to check on Harry and Tom.

866
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,619
You've got the Bridge.

867
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,088
How are they?

868
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,966
Lucky. The backup systems
in their environmental suits

869
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,843
kept their vital functions
going.

870
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,928
It'll take time,
but they'll recover.

871
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,180
And him?

872
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,764
Aside from his ability

873
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,184
to breathe the rarefied air
on this planet,

874
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,227
he's the exact duplicate
of Mr. Paris.

875
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,188
He even seems to share
his memories,

876
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,315
not to mention
his winning personality.

877
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,732
B'Elanna and I
discovered

878
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,985
that the fluid has
mimetic properties.

879
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,821
Somehow,
it reads the DNA

880
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,572
of whatever
it comes in contact with

881
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,533
and recreates it.

882
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,785
Fascinating.

883
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,833
Can you tell me
who you are?

884
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,169
Please,
just let me go back.

885
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,420
Not until I find out
why two of my crew

886
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,755
have been
duplicated.

887
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,757
Captain,
you have to believe me.

888
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,426
I don't know any more
than you do about this.

889
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,305
Until he showed up,
I thought I<i> was</i> Tom Paris.

890
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,058
A little changed by my
experience on the planet maybe,

891
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,560
but now I don't know who
or what I am.

892
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,313
All I know is that
I have to get off this ship

893
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,398
and go back down
to the surface.

894
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,067
( comlink beeps )
TUVOK:<i> We're ready to try</i>

895
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,694
<i>the nadion burst, Captain.</i> 
Do it.

896
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,987
( weapon fires, ship rumbles )

897
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,031
( groans )
What are you doing?

898
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,366
( comlink beeps)
TUVOK:<i> Captain,</i>

899
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,950
<i>we're receiving</i>
<i>an urgent hail.</i>

900
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,328
<i>It's from Ensign Kim,</i>
<i>the one on the surface.</i>

901
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,453
Put him through.

902
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,039
KIM:
<i>Captain, please!</i>

903
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,582
<i>Stop what you're doing!</i>

904
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,377
If you really do have
Harry Kim's memories,

905
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,212
you know that I'm going to do
whatever it takes

906
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,963
to get this ship
back in orbit.

907
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,257
You can't do that!

908
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,716
JANEWAY:
<i>Why not?</i>

909
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,635
I... I'm not sure
I understand it myself.

910
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:33,014
Well, then you're gonna have
to help me figure it out.

911
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,184
Mr. Tuvok, I'm on my way
to Transporter Room 1.

912
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:39,437
Erect a level-7 force field
around the platform.

913
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,981
Fill it with atmosphere
from the planet

914
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:45,735
and then beam Mr. Kim,
or rather his duplicate, aboard.

915
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,779
TUVOK:
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

916
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,283
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

917
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,327
Do you have
a lock on him?

918
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,454
WOMAN: Yes, ma'am.
Energize.

919
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,420
Release my vessel.

920
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,712
We can't do that.

921
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,131
We?

922
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,426
The planet and I,

923
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:10,927
we're connected
somehow.

924
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,220
I can't explain it,
Captain.

925
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,638
I only know
that you've got to stop.

926
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,056
And I'm willing
to stop,

927
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,475
but I'll say it again,
release the ship.

928
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,769
No. We need you.

929
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,105
Janeway to Tuvok.
Fire.

930
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,398
( weapon fires, ship rumbles )

931
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,900
( gasping )

932
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,612
What are you?

933
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,281
Stop. No.

934
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,408
I'll fire again.
You're killing us.

935
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,742
You're leaving me
no choice.

936
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,453
It's not fair.
It's wrong!

937
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:37,787
Janeway to Tuvok...

938
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,414
No!

939
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,166
No, no, no.

940
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,960
Please, no more.

941
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,586
Hold your fire, Tuvok.

942
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,672
TUVOK:
<i>Captain, we are continuing</i>
<i>to submerge.</i>

943
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,757
Hold your fire.
TUVOK:<i> Acknowledged.</i>

944
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,301
I want some answers.

945
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,762
I'm trying to understand.

946
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,681
This is hard for me as well.

947
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,225
You said you have
a connection to this planet.

948
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,144
You talk about it
like it's alive.

949
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,561
Alive?

950
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,442
Yes...

951
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,568
But not the planet.

952
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,530
The silver blood.

953
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,326
The compound that sampled
Harry's DNA...

954
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,495
and created you.

955
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,038
Yes.

956
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,915
But it's never been conscious,
never sentient

957
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,127
before now...
Before me and the other.

958
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,504
Tom Paris.

959
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,921
We're the first.

960
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,384
Don't you see? You came here.
You showed us.

961
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,677
When the compound
came in contact

962
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,096
with Tom and Harry,

963
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,558
it experienced awareness
for the first time.

964
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,520
Before,
it was only instinct...

965
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,606
Sound and light
and heat.

966
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,987
But those two...
showed us<i> thought.</i>

967
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,573
I'm beginning to understand.

968
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,704
This silver blood...

969
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:05,041
experienced sentience...

970
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,044
And now you want more.

971
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,672
You want to duplicate
the rest of this crew

972
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,550
and populate this planet.

973
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,469
You're trying so hard
to reach home, but...

974
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,054
<i>this</i> can be home.

975
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,432
Not for me,
and not for my people.

976
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,184
Do you understand
why we can't stay here?

977
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,104
I think so.

978
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,400
Well, then release us.

979
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,485
We'd rather die
than be alone.

980
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,449
We deserve life.

981
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,915
This silver blood
that created you...

982
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,837
It duplicated Harry
without killing him.

983
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,760
So you don't need
our bodies...

984
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,179
Only samples of DNA.

985
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,771
Release<i> Voyager...</i>

986
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,149
And I'll speak to my crew.

987
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,900
And if they're willing,

988
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,571
I'll let you duplicate
the rest of us.

989
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,323

TUVOK:<i> Bridge to Janeway.</i>

990
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,866
<i>We've stopped, Captain.</i>
<i>We're no longer submerging.</i>

991
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,577
JANEWAY:
Understood.

992
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,995
We're getting out
of here, Tuvok,

993
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,790
but first, assemble the crew
in Cargo Bay 1,

994
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,874
and have the doctor

995
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,835
<i>meet me there.</i> 
Captain...?

996
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,253
JANEWAY:
<i>I'll explain later.</i>

997
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,511
It's time to meet
your new family.
