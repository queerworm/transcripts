<i>Last time on </i>Star Trek: Voyager...

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:08,217
Two more of the mutations have
been discovered in Spatial Grid 649.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,220
Have their cortical nodes
removed and analyzed.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,055
I'm regenerating. This is only a dream.

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,932
You're not dreaming.
I brought you here.

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,517
This is Unimatrix Zero.

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,521
You used to come here,
before you escaped the collective.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:24,858
Unimatrix Zero is real...
and so are the people who go there.

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,360
They need our help.

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,112
If we can't terminate their link...

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,617
then we'll simply have
to pay them a visit.

[groaning]

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,372
The people there are vulnerable.

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,251
They don't have the ability to take action
in the real world.

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,127
We're going to give them that ability.

17
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,337
<i>Tend to your own crew.</i>

18
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,923
<i>Stay away from things</i>
<i>that don't concern you.</i>

19
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,424
I'm afraid I can't do that.

20
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,762
We were more than friends, weren't we?

21
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,933
This is our target.
You'll keep a transporter lock on me.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,351
Once I make it to the central plexus

23
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,353
and release the virus,
you can beam me back.

24
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,729
In how many pieces?

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,234
Captain...

26
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,237
I expected something
more cunning from you.

[narrator]
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

32
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,918
Lieutenant.

33
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,545
[mechanical rasp]
I'm all right.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,006
You've been given
a sub vocal processor.

35
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,382
I can live with it.

36
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,760
-The Captain?
-We were separated.

37
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,720
I don't know where they took her.

38
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,640
We must proceed to the central plexus.

39
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,131
Time?

40
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,216
Seventeen minutes.

41
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,510
We should have heard
something by now.

42
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,845
Doctor?

43
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,890
Their higher brain functions are stable.

[console beeping]

45
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,225
Cube's changing course.

46
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,436
New heading: 121 mark 6.

47
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,229
Matching course and speed.

48
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,069
The damage to their propulsion system
is regenerating.

49
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,406
They'll be capable of transwarp
in less than two hours.

50
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,867
I want you inside Unimatrix Zero.

51
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,076
When the virus is released,

52
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,370
your friends there
will be the first to know.

53
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,123
Problem?

54
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,042
No...

55
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,711
but I wouldn't call them my "friends."

56
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,671
Acquaintances, then.

57
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,009
If you're having issues with these people,
I suggest you set them aside.

58
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,679
Understood.

59
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,376
Tell your hunters to patrol
the northeastern perimeter.

60
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,921
-More drones were spotted there.
-Understood.

61
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,674
Where's that virus you promised?

62
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,260
-Captain Janeway's deploying it now.
-Good.

63
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,387
The Borg have increased
their attacks here.

64
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,931
They're identifying us one by one.

65
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,641
If you're looking for your mate,

66
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,101
he is not here.

67
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,228
He's not my mate.

68
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,690
-He must not be regenerating.
-That or he's dead.

69
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,608
He should have been here hours ago.

70
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,527
No one's seen him.

71
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,947
If he died in battle,

72
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,324
I'm sure it was honorable.

73
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,118
Here, help me.

74
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,291
[grunts]

75
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,838
It's obvious your heart is in conflict.

76

My heart is functioning perfectly.

Some advice from a warrior
in the bedchamber

79
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,559
as well as the battlefield.

80
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,812
At times like these,
you must treat your heart as the enemy,

81
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,939
so you won't be distracted in battle.

82
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,984
I'll keep that in mind.

83
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,402
[low whirring]

84
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,157

-I'm not sure.

85
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,325
Do you remember anything?

86
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,160
Your location? What ship you're on?

87
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,495
No, nothing.

88
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,057
The central plexus is through here.

89
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,147
Those must be the shield emitters
that Seven told us about.

90
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,996
We need to get through that hatch.

91
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,374
I'll attempt to deactivate him.

92
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,926
-Captain.
-What's left of her.

93
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,637
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

94
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,805
I can't access the plexus

95
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,099
without shutting down the power grid
for this section.

96
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,017
That's bound to draw attention.
Is there another way in?

97
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,602
The primary access port.

98
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,604
I think it's isolated
from the main power grid.

99
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,315
-Where is it?
-About 30 meters from here.

I can hear the collective.

104
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,828
The neural suppressant
must be wearing off.

105
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,288
I'll be all right.

106
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,216
I heard him...

107
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,260
the Vulcan...

108
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,887
but he's gone.

109
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,974
Why?

110
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,143
Why can't I hear the others?

-Release me.

Easier said than done.

118
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,220
I think I designed this trap
a little too well.

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,642
What are you doing out here?

120
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,519
Looking for you.

121
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,108
Korok was concerned.

122
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,610
That doesn't sound like Korok.

123
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,363
He said you were missing.

124
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,199
As you can see,
I've been busy setting traps.

125
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,869
Not the most sophisticated technology.

126
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,287
Seems to work.

127
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,207
Hold on.

128
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,137
I should return to the camp,
wait for word on the virus.

129
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,847
I'll go with you...

130

in case you run into any more trouble.

131
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,310
As you wish.

Recalling the details of my life

Captain, if I succumb to the collective,

141
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,110
I'll pose a security risk.

142
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,321
You must be prepared
to deactivate me.

143
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,532
Without the Doctor's help,
that could kill you.

144
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,951
Stay focused. Stay Tuvok.

145
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,494
That's an order.

146
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,708

The away team.

154
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,816
The plan was to give them two hours.
It's been two and a half.

155
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,442
Doctor's keeping an eye on them.

156
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,403
We'll give it a little more time.

157
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,615
Unfortunately, not everything
goes according to plan.

158
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,996
You know, it occurs to me that,
with you in command

159
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,708
and Tuvok off the ship,
that makes me acting first officer,

What's your point?

162
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,214
Well, it's my duty
to give you an opinion,

163
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,718
and, in my opinion, I think we should
pull them out now before it's too late.

00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,934
We wait.

167
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,729
How long?

168
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,272
A day? A week?

169
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,316
As long as it takes
to complete the mission.

170
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,153
-This mission isn't worth their lives.
-You've made your point.

00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,864
Apparently not.

A first officer
could get in a lot of trouble

174
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,750
for talking to his captain that way.

175

Well, I've learned from the best.

00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,409
[Tuvok and Borg Queen]
She was born in the city of...

183
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,868
...of T'Paal.

184
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,079
We share your memories.

185
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,206
You are part of us now.

186
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,583
Don't resist.

187
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,001
[alarm beeping]

188
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,878
There's a problem with Commander Tuvok.

189
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,673
His synaptic pathways are destabilizing.

190
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,428
If I decide to move in closer,

191
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,264
I assume my first officer would concur.

192
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,433
You assume correctly.

193
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,740
We have to get out of this chamber
and contact <i>Voyager.</i>

194
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,959
You're Commander Tuvok,
tactical officer of the Starship <i>Voyager.</i>

195
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,169
I'm your Captain.

196
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,837
Step aside. That's an order.

197
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,422
She's irrelevant.

198
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,636
Captain, you must deactivate me.

199
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,640
[groans]

200
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,686
My designation is Three of Twelve.

201
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,897
Where are you, Tuvok?

202
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,195
The central plexus.

203
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,498
-Range: 40,000 kilometers.
-Harry?

204
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,416
Too much shielding
around the central plexus.

205
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,793
-I can't get a lock.
-Stay on it.

206
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,212
Closer.

207
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,093
This way.

208
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,847
[grunting]

209
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,140
[groans]

210
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,203
Back so soon?

211
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,459
Target their shield generators.

212
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,086
Stand by phasers.

213
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,546
Commander?

214
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,716
Shields to full. Brace for impact.

215
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,469
Someone's accessing
our tactical controls.

216
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,845
Our shields are down.

217
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,138
Evasive maneuvers.

218
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,145
Sensors are off-line!
I've lost the away team!

219
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,315
Hull breaches... Decks 5, 6, 7!

220
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,362
-Reverse course.
-We can't just leave them.

221
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,740
The Borg have our access codes.
Get us out of here.

222
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,162
Thank you, Tuvok.

223
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,339
I'm losing voices.

224
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:16,220
Five in Spatial Grid 96.

225
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,558
Twelve in Grid 182.

226
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,893
Hundreds now...

227
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,605
thousands.

228
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,582
[Borg Queen]
I can't hear you.

229
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,501
Why can't I hear you?

230
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,343
You've disconnected
from the hive mind.

231
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,510
Explain.

232
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,431
Comply.

233
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,725
No!

234
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,979
I'm not alone.

235
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,523
You can't stop us all!

236
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:45,059
I altered the transmission
to restore your original appearance.

237
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,687
I know how vain humans can be.

238
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,854
Why am I here?

239
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,482
You've caused a great deal of suffering.

240
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,568
I wanted you to see it for yourself.

241
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,613
You are the cause
of his death, Captain.

242
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,533
You disconnected him
from the hive mind.

243
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,618
You didn't have to kill him.

244
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,454
He was confused, irrational.

245
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,790
I had no choice.

246
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,042
Many more will die,

247
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,003
unless you tell me
how to counteract the virus.

248
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,049
Sorry, we didn't think
to develop an antidote.

249
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,677
I'll assimilate <i>Voyager</i>, then.

250
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,888
Your Doctor created the pathogen.

251
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,348
He can find a cure.

252
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,435
My first officer has orders
to delete the Doctor's program

253
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,603
if you go anywhere near <i>Voyager.</i>

254
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,814
The resistance is already underway.

255
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,317
It won't be long before thousands
of drones begin to fight back.

256
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,902
They will fail.

257
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,446
Maybe...

258
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,865
probably...

259
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,201
but a lot of damage will be done
before they do.

260
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,164
Yes, a lot of damage.

261
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,043
Spatial Grid 94, Cube 630.

262
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,713
Complement: 64,000 drones,

263
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,674
but I can no longer hear three of them.

264
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,803
No doubt they've joined your resistance.

265
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:09,477
Are they trying to sabotage the vessel
and liberate others?

266
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:14,356
I don't know,
because I can no longer hear them.

267
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,152
Initiate self-destruct.

268
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,907
An effective solution, don't you agree?

269
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,245
Spatial Grid 091, Sphere 878.

270
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,082
Complement: 11,000 drones.

271
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,921
Only one is silent, but I have no choice.

272
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,840
I must silence all of them.

273
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,891
I know how this must upset you, Captain.

274
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,393
As a Starfleet officer,

275
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,523
you value all life, even drones.

276
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,485
How many more
are you willing to sacrifice?

277
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,445
Thousands?

278
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,532
Millions?

279
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,911
You can put an end to this.

280
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,124
I want you to go
on a diplomatic mission.

281
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,088
It's one of your primary functions,
isn't it? Negotiations?

282
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,882
Go on.

283
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,511
Tell them to rejoin the collective
and I'll stop the destruction.

284
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,013
They will never agree to that.

285
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,850
They're individuals now.

286
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,560
They have a choice.

287
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,189
What are you afraid of, Captain?

288
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,733
That they may cooperate?

289
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,903
You've been waiting for a chance
to damage the Borg.

290
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,989
Now, you've found one.

291
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,908
You're only using them.

292
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,078
If you really wanted to negotiate,

293
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,914
you'd visit Unimatrix Zero.

294
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,668
You found a way to send drones.
Surely, you could go yourself.

295
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,214
Or are you afraid that a taste
of individuality might make you realize

296
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,009
it is something worth fighting for?

297
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,933
Comply, or you will be responsible
for many more deaths.

298
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:19,481
You'll have to destroy
the entire collective to find them all.

299
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,208
Several drones have reported
that they retained their memories

300
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,669
of Unimatrix Zero
after their regeneration ended.

301
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,962
The virus has been deployed.

302
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,340
Good. We're going to need
all the help we can get.

303
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,258
The away team's still trapped
on that cube.

304
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,969
And as you may have noticed,
we're in no shape to mount a rescue.

305
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:53,140
Can you get back in? Find out
if they have anyone else aboard this cube?

306
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:57,019
If they do, tell them to hurry.
They're the only allies we've got.

307
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,773
I'd like to make a few adjustments
to your alcove before you return.

308
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,528
When this crisis ends,

309
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,781
I'll come up
with a more permanent solution,

310
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,951
so you can spend more time
in Unimatrix Zero.

311
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,536
You're in a unique position.

312
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,748
Not many of us get to lead a double life.

313
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:22,044
When this crisis ends, I intend
to sever my link to Unimatrix Zero.

314
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,879
May I ask why?

315
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,801
I'm having difficulties
with one of the people there.

316
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,344
Mr. Axum?

317
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,223
Whenever you mention his name,

318
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,767
your pupils dilate by nearly a millimeter,

319
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,311
blood flow increases
to your facial capillaries.

320
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,106
Both are consistent
with an emotional response.

321
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,903
Axum and I apparently had a relationship.

322
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,239
Oh. Romantic?

323
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,576
There go those pupils again.

324
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,331
Your diagnosis is accurate.

325
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,793
Well...

326
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,631
how ironic.

327
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,468
All this time,
we've been trying to develop

328
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:16,015
that aspect of your humanity,
and it's been there all along.

329
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,768
-Not anymore.
-My readings say otherwise.

330
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:27,317
You're very particular about who
you choose to spend time with, Seven.

331
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,696
No doubt that's why you and I
have become friends.

332
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,200
If you were involved with Axum once,

333
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,245
doesn't that suggest
he's a worthwhile individual?

334
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,460
He does possess commendable qualities.

335
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,422
Coming from you, that's high praise.

336
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,551
There's nothing wrong
with feeling ambivalent, Seven.

337
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,388
After all,
you're in the middle of a civil war,

338
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,475
but eventually,

339
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,479
you may want to give this romance
a second chance.

340
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,732
Who knows?

341
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,818
You may even get to meet him
in person someday.

342
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,286
I'll say this for your Mr. Axum.

343
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,579
He's a very lucky man.

344
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,678
The collective has found
a new way to attack us.

345
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,682
Eleven ships have self-destructed
in the last three hours.

346
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,559
We need to coordinate a battle plan,

347
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,145
a way to strike at the heart
of the collective.

348
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,856
Our target should be
the primary unicomplex.

349
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,110
If we can disrupt the queen's control
of the hive mind,

350
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,946
it'll give us a chance to organize,
build up a fighting force.

351
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,239
[crowd murmurs agreement]

352
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,242
There is one more objective...
the <i>Voyager</i> away team.

353
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,827
They fought like warriors.

354
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,121
Their sacrifice will not be forgotten.

355
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,582
-We can still rescue them.
-She's right.

356
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,001
They risked their lives for us.

357
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,795
Now, it's our turn.

358
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,382
-There's no time!
-It's a matter of honor, Korok.

359
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,386
I thought you of all people
would understand that.

360
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:23,142
I'll see if any of our people are
on a vessel near theirs.

361
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,522
[crowd chatter]

362
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,569
Thank you.

363
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,863
It's the least we can do.

364
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,326
What's wrong?

365
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,999
It turns out I'm on a scout ship
patrolling the border of fluidic space...

366
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,918
on the other side of the galaxy.

367
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,177
I...

368
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,222
was hoping we'd be able
to meet one day,

369
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,807
in the real world.

370
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,227
Me, too.

371
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,983
There are things I can do where I am.

372
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,738
I'll try to contact Species 8472,

373
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,532
see if I can persuade them
to join the fight.

374
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,952
Given their history with the Borg,
I'm sure they'll be eager.

375
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,837
I guess this rules out Vorothon Gorge.

376
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,923
"Gorge"?

377
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,385
It was at the top of our list
of things to see in the real world

378
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,971
if we were ever freed
from the collective.

379
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,307
Don't you remember?

380
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,228
We could add fluidic space to our list.

381
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,651
We still have Unimatrix Zero.

382
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,532
It was sufficient before.

383
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,161
And now?

384
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,443
-Where are you?
-Over here.

385
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,695
[chuckles]

386
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,572
[laughing]

387
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,588
Don't be frightened.

388
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,633
Stand up, let me look at you.

389
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,093
Comply.

390
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,348
You're one of the machine people.

391
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,309
You're trying to hurt us.

392
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,688
That's the last thing I want to do.

393
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,441
I'm here to help you...

394
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,777
all of you.

395
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,280
They said you wanted to assim...

396
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,448
assimi...

397
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,033
Assimilate you.

398
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:30,537
Yes, but that's nothing to be afraid of.

399
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,582
You like having friends, don't you?

400
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,586
Assimilation turns us all into friends.

401
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,965
In fact, it brings us so close together,
we can hear each other's thoughts.

402
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,967
Is that fun?

403
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,220
Yes.

404
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,473
It's fun.

405
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,981
I was just about your age
when I was assimilated.

406
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,359
I was worried then, too.

407
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,321
But, when I began to hear the others,

408
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,156
hear their thoughts,

409
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,950
I wasn't afraid anymore.

410
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,328
Don't you miss your parents?

411
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,039
They're here with me...

412
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,750
part of us.

413
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,962
I can hear them right now.

414
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,425
Would you like to be with your parents?

415
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,469
They miss you.

416
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,054
They want to see you.

417
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,514
Can I talk to them?

418
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,307
Soon.

419
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,813
But, first, I'd like to see more of this.

420
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,816
There's a place
where you can see the whole forest.

421
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,569
Show me.

422
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,330
It's pretty, isn't it?

423
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,760
[Borg Queen]
I took your advice, Captain.

424
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,430
I paid a visit to Unimatrix Zero.

425
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,307
It's far more primitive than I expected.

426
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,478
I don't understand how anyone
could prefer a crude environment

427
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,230
to Borg perfection.

428
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,483
Spend a little more time there.

429
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,235
You might find out.

430
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,987
I've seen enough.

431
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,530
It's an illusion.

432
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,991
Even so,
the people who go there are real,

433
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,118
and they won't give it up without a fight.

434
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,120
They'll fail.

435
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,541
I thought you'd like to see
our latest accomplishment.

436
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,586
Recognize it?

437
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,756
No.

438
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,758
I think you do.

439
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,888
It's your nanovirus,
with a few modifications.

440
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:57,601
We've reprogrammed it
to target your mutated drones.

441
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,855
Once it's released, it will erode
their autonomic functions.

442
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,399
They will die within minutes.

443
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,235
You have no way to deliver it.

444
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,323
Those drones have been separated
from the hive mind.

445
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,117
They aren't linked
to the central plexus anymore.

446
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,996
No, but there's another way
I can reach them.

447
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:23,251
I'm prepared to go back to Unimatrix Zero
and release it myself,

448
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,922
but I'm willing to reconsider.

449
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,425
-It all depends on you.
-Me?

450
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:34,387
If they rejoin the collective,
I'll spare their lives.

451
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,681
They listen to you.

452
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,226
Tell them it's time to come home.

453
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,563
You were responsible for many deaths.

454
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,274
Now, you can save thousands.

455
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,069
Decide.

456
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,824
Let's try this again.

457
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,326
Ensign?

458
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,247
The warp core is on line,
navigational array,

459
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,706
shields at 20 percent.

460
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,043
We've got sensors, short-range only.

461
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,795
It's a start.

462
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,713
Try to get a fix on the away team.

463
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,091
[systems powering down]

464
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,259
Now what?

465
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,302
Someone's tapping
into our holographic systems.

466
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,097
-Source?
-It's a Borg signal.

467
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,516
<i>-Doctor to the Bridge.</i>
-Go ahead.

468
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,644
<i>Someone's here to see you</i>
<i>and Seven, Commander.</i>

469
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,854
<i>You'd better come down here</i>
<i>right away.</i>

470
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,243
Kathryn?

471
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:44,249
<i>The Borg have established this link,</i>
<i>so I could propose a compromise.</i>

472
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,501
We're listening.

473
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,378
<i>They've developed a nanovirus</i>

474
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,590
that can kill every Borg
with the mutation.

475
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,343
They're prepared to release it
inside Unimatrix Zero,

476
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,887
unless all the drones there
return to the collective

477
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,223
<i>for reassimilation immediately.</i>

478
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,642
That's not compromise, that's surrender.

479
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,271
<i>I won't be responsible</i>
<i>for any more deaths.</i>

480
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,024
<i>At least they'll survive as drones.</i>

481
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,654
<i>Tell them Unimatrix Zero</i>
<i>can no longer exist.</i>

482
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,074
<i>That's an order.</i>

483
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,413
<i>Have I made myself clear, Commander?</i>

484
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,667
Yes, Captain.

485
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,965
We did our best.

486
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,593
It's not over yet, Doctor.

487
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,180
Can you disrupt the interlink frequency
for Unimatrix Zero?

488
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,683
Commander, the Captain
gave us a direct order.

489
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,061
Yes, she did,
but not the one you think.

490
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,981
-Seven?
-I believe I can, but why?

491
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,858
Didn't you hear?

492
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,444
Unimatrix Zero can no longer exist.

493
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,071
[rumbling]

494
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,533
Chakotay to the Bridge. Report.

495
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,787
A transwarp conduit
just opened off our port bow.

496
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,705
Lieutenant.

497
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,292
They're on an intercept course.

498
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,044
Evasive maneuvers.

499
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,253
Battle stations.

500
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,713
They're hailing us.

501
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,382
Open a channel.

502
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,759
<i>Starship </i>Voyager.

503
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,011
<i>I am General Korok.</i>

504
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,931
<i>This vessel is now</i>
<i>under my command.</i>

505
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,141
<i>We've come to join you in battle.</i>

506
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,027
Your crewmates are coming
to retrieve you.

507
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,615
You were wise to comply.

508
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,160
Chakotay to Seven of Nine.

509
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,370
We're almost in range.

510
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,871
Stand by.

511
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,542
I've isolated the frequency.

512
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,421
Get Korok.

513
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,802
Our emitters are fully charged.

514
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,096
[Chakotay] <i>You should be receiving</i>
<i>the interlink frequency.</i>

515
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,056
[Korok]
We have it.

516
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,725
Wait for my signal.

517
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,144
We have to end
our regeneration cycles.

518
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,937
We can't be here when it happens.

519
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,939
Will there be anything left?

520
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,692
I know we're being asked
to make a sacrifice,

521
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,486
but it's the only way.

522
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,032
-We're in range.
-Full power to the shields.

523
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,576
All weapons on line.

524
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,121
<i>Voyager</i> to Korok. It's time.

525
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,640
You must go.

526
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,693
Bridge, it's working.

527
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,488
Unimatrix Zero is shutting down.

528
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,156
Acknowledged.

529
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,785
<i>Voyager</i> to Korok. Now.

530
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,288
What are they doing?

531
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,708
You wanted to destroy Unimatrix Zero.

532
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,377
We're just lending you a hand.

533
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,130
Get me the virus.

534
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,633
You're too late.
There's no one left to infect.

535
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,343
Is this your compromise?

536
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,930
I don't compromise with Borg.

537
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,694
Match their shield modulations and fire!

538
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,406
-I'm picking up the away team!
-I'm isolating their bio-signatures.

539
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,866
Get a lock.

540
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,202
I still can't penetrate
their inner shields.

541
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,956
<i>Voyager</i> to Korok. Status?

542
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,543
Patience, Commander.

543
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,087
They're trying to remodulate
their secondary shield grid.

544
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,423
<i>I'm attempting to compensate.</i>

545
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,196
-You shouldn't be here.
-Neither should you.

546
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,617
[gasps]
I've wasted our time together.

547
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,535
No, you didn't.

548
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,746
You gave us a chance
to fall in love again.

549
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,873
We've lost our only way to be together.

550
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,541
No. I'll find you.

551
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,085
Axum...?

552
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,712
I'll find you.

553
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,467
[sighs]

554
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:30,970
[explosive rumbling]

555
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,556
[grunting]

556
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,108
Shields in Subgrid 42 are destabilizing.

557
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,485
Target that section.

558
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,084
Initiate self-destruct.

559
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,342
Their shields are down.

560
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,468
Energize.

561
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:29,445
<i>Chief Medical Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54014.4.</i>

562
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,825
<i>It's been 48 hours</i>
<i>since the away team returned to </i>Voyager.

563
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,576
<i>Thanks to the neural suppressant,</i>

564
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,955
<i>I've been able to extract</i>
<i>most of their Borg technology.</i>

565
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,708
<i>The Captain and B'Elanna</i>
<i>are on the mend,</i>

566
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,294
<i>but Tuvok will need</i>
<i>a little more time to recover.</i>

567
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,549
[door opens, closes]

568
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,760
General Korok has finished his repairs.

569
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,721
He's already been contacted

570
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,556
by another Borg vessel
in the region.

571
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,683
It's also under the control
of former drones.

572
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:00,935
[groans]

573
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,438
The Doctor removed my spinal clamps,

574
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,983
but it'll be a while
before I'm playing hoverball again.

575
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,153
If I ever imply it's been easy
on you these last few years,

576
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,529
remind me about today.

577
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,865
Noted.

578
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,618
Well, Unimatrix Zero may be gone,

579
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,997
but it looks like the resistance
is alive and kicking.

580
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,375
With any luck,
the collective may never be the same.

581
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:27,253
Korok said he would try
to maintain contact,

582
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,005
keep us informed.

583
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,341
Have you heard from your friend?

584
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,635
No...

585
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,555
but I don't expect to.

586
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,767
Axum's vessel is in a remote sector
of the Beta Quadrant.

587
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,691
If I ever imply

588
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,402
that he was nothing more than a friend,

589
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,614
remind me about today.
