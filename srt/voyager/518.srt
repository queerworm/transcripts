(<i> playing light jazz version</i>

2
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,860
Are you sure this rice
isn't supposed to be cooked?

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,402
Steamed, fried?

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,738
The idea is to shower
the couple with a symbol

5
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:33,408
of good fortune, not garnish
them like a roast chicken.

6
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,077
Smile.

7
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,208
Rice, anyone?

8
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,584
I'll take one.

00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,383
Red Alert.

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,801
Ready?

(<i> playing</i>

12

This is it, Tom.

13
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,814
Your bachelor
days are over.

14
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,232
Not a moment too soon.

15
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,234

16
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,153
Second, third, fourth...

17
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,038
I never thought
I'd see the day.

18
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,164
Given the
volatile nature

19
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,250
of their relationship,
one might have

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,168
predicted homicide
rather than matrimony.

21
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,922
When it comes to affairs
of the human heart,

22
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,089
it is wise to look
beyond logic.

23
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,845
We're gathered here today

24
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:39,058
not as Starfleet officers,
but as friends and family

25
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:43,562
to celebrate the marriage
of two of<i> Voyager's</i> finest.

26
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:48,609
B'Elanna has asked me to forego
the rigors of Klingon painstiks

27
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,236
in favor of a more
traditional ceremony.

28
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,321
They're saving the painstiks
for the honeymoon.

(<i> guests chuckling</i> )

00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,283
As Captain,

31
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,954
the honor of joining these
two people has fallen to me,

32
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,581
but before I declare them
husband and wife,

33
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,333
Tom and B'Elanna
have prepared their own vows.

34
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,676
I still don't know what
I've done to deserve you...

35
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:21,016
but whatever it is,
I'll try to keep doing it,

36
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,436
and I promise
to stand by you,

37
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,648
to honor you...

38
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,025

00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,319
Ensign.

40
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,361
Hmm?

41
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,571
(<i> whispers</i> ):
The ring.

42
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,697
Oh.

43
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,412
May this ring

44
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,373
be a symbol of
our eternal love.

45
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,167
You stood by me...

46
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,382
when most people would have
run for the nearest airlock.

47
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,260
You were willing
to see past

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,221
my shortcomings...

49
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,975
and to take
all the bumps and bruises

50
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,643
that came along with it.

51
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,731
You made me a better person...

52
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,067
even though I put up
one hell of a fight.

53
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,238
I look forward
to our journey together.

54
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,492
Commander.

55
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,584
May this ring
be the symbol

56
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,712
of our eternal love.

57
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,423
Not so fast.

00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,847
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres,

60
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,892
with the power vested in me
by Starfleet Command

61
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,227
and the United
Federation of Planets,

62
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,982
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

63
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,735
Now, Tom.

64
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,113
(<i> applause</i> )

65
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,909
Bravo.

66
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,422
Congratulations.

67
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,381
For what?

68
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,217

In this case, the shortest path
is a straight line.

76
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,691
We'll pass right through
the center of the Milky Way.

77
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,318
And be in Sector 001
within two years.

78
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,652
More or less.

79
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,904
You had Seven
double-check

80
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,364
the calculations?

81
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,865
Two years, 11 days, six hours,

82
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,159
provided we continue to operate
at peak efficiency.

83
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,535
Naturally.

84
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,996
Of course, if we operate
at peak efficiency,

85
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,332
we'll be missing some
interesting phenomena

86
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,792
along the way--

87
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,796
an anomalous gradient
to the curvature of space,

88
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,965
unusual bioharmonic readings
from a binary system

we'll reach about
six months from now.

90
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,219
And the scientist in you can't
resist stopping to take a look.

91
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,179
It would only add another
two or three months.

92
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,806
Do you think
the crew would mutiny?

93
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,099
On the contrary.

94
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,392

103
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,741
just you, B'Elanna
and the crickets.

104
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,951
Crickets?

105
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,702
Cytraxian crickets.

106
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:19,749
Their song is reputed to
be an auditory aphrodisiac.

107

Aha. Well,
between you and me--

108
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,921
B'Elanna and I
don't need aphrodisiacs.

There's always the beaches
of Ahmedeen-- windsurfing

111
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,720
on a sea of liquid argon.

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,765
I was hoping for someplace
a little more down-to-earth.

Well, it's
your honeymoon.

114
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,810
Just how down-to-earth
did you mean?

115
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,811
Earth.

116
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,729
I was thinking

117
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,815
Chicago in the roaring '20s--

118
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,901
speakeasies, flappers,
the Charleston.

119
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,029
If that's what you want.

120
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,322
Why? Is there a problem?

121
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,073
No, of course not,
it's just that we're

122
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,825
so close to Earth anyway,

123
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,411
I thought you might want to try
something a little more exotic.

124
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,497
Let me let you in
on a little secret, Neelix.

125
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,582
Earth has the best vacation
spots in the galaxy.

126
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,793
It's got the cultures,
the climates,

127
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,379
the history, the people.

128
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,382
It has everything
you ever want in a planet.

No. No. Just a native.

132
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,930
Oh, and make sure
the deuterium manifold's

133
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,183
are never opened wider
than 600 microns.

134
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,893
I am familiar
with the specifications.

135
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,769
Are you familiar
with how temperamental

136
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,188
the isolytic
converter can be?

137
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,523
Yes.

138
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,234
Most important,
the enhanced warp drive--

139
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,736
with the dilithium matrix
running hot all the time now,

140
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,987
you have to watch it
like a hawk.

141
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,864
There is no point
in providing me

142
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,491
with knowledge I
already possess.

143
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,702
I guess I am being
a little overcautious.

144
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,455
I've just, uh, never
been away from Engineering

145
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,665
for more
than a couple of days...

146
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,834
certainly never a week.

147
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,128
My engineering abilities
are more than sufficient.

Enjoy your honeymoon.

You may understand
the iso-dynamics of this engine,

150
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,595
but I don't think
you understand its personality.

151
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,097
Personality.

152
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,182
It is a propulsion device.

153
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,641
That's my point.

154
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,227
It's not just a device.

155
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,854
It-it has its own quirks,
its own... its own moods.

156

(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

157

are on leave.

So, who's the lucky guy?

164
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,084
You caught the bouquet.

165
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,378
That means you're next
in line for the altar.

166
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,046
Yes, the Doctor
informed me

167
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,257
of that archaic
human superstition.

168
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,593
How about Harry Kim?

169
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,804
I fail to see the benefit
of monogamous relationships.

170
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,514
So you want
to stay single?

171
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,433
If you mean remain open
to social situations

172
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,017
with a wide variety
of individuals,

173
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,311
then yes.

174
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm married--
I'm not going into stasis

175
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,897
for the rest of my life.

176
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,232
No, I plan to have...

177
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,067
I do not wish to be
dependent on anyone.

178
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,487
By marrying, one limits
one's romantic interactions

179
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,904
to a single individual--

180
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,616
a circumstance which
implies extreme monotony.

181
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,076
I'm glad we had
this little talk.

182
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,287
(<i> error beeping</i> )

183
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,331
Try the manual release.

184
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,505
I thought you said
it was a minor fluctuation.

185
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,633
This entire
Jefferies tube

186
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,468
is losing
molecular cohesion.

187
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,761
I guess
the honeymoon's off.

188
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,640
It's our warp field.

189
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,808
The enhanced drive
is emitting

190
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,519
some form
of subspace radiation

191
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,479
that's affecting
<i>Voyager's</i> infrastructure.

192
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,022
It's beginning
to break down

193
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,107
the molecular bonds
in all surrounding sections.

194
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,318
TORRES:
We're seeing early
stages of the effect

195
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,486
in the warp core--

196
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,070
reaction chamber,
injector ports--

197
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,947
they're all showing signs
of de-cohesion.

198
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,282
It doesn't make any sense.

199
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,034
We knew all about
the subspace radiation

200
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,452
and we ran dozens
of simulations

201
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,330
before we brought
the new drive on line.

202
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,791
Have you tried taking
the core off-line?

203
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,251
It's not stopping
the problem.

204
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,672
Try to isolate
the cause of this.

205
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,382
And stabilize the sections

206
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,008
that have already
been affected.

207
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,552
Dismissed.

208
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,150
Computer.

209
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,654
Begin Chief Engineer's Log,
supplemental.

210
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,409
I've spent the last four hours

211
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,287
analyzing
the warp field schematics,

212
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,374
but I'm still no closer to
finding out what's going wrong.

213
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:33,086
(<i> gasps</i> )

214
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,338
Computer, did it
just get colder in here?

215
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,840
COMPUTER:
<i>Negative.</i>

216
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,968
Raise the temperature
by five degrees.

217
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,362
Hungry?

218
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,863
Ah, can't join
you tonight--

219
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,073
dinner with B'Elanna.

220
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,241
Married one day

221
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,992
and you're already
domesticated.

222
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,536
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Jealous?

223
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,621
Night, Harry.

224
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,374
B'Elanna?

225
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,959
If we're going to live together,

226
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,878
we're going to have to
compromise on the temperature.

227
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,924
Computer, reset environmental
controls to standard.

228
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,883
B'Elanna?

229
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,345
(<i> shivering</i> )

230
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,312
Shh.

231
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,148
Bring her in, quickly.

232
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,274
(<i> gasping</i> )

233
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,442
It looks like
we've got

234
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,735
an epidemic
on our hands.

235
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,379
Acute cellular degradation?

236
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,214
Their chromosomes
are breaking down

237
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,966
at the molecular level.

238
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,760
Proximity
to the warp field.

239
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,261
I believe so.

240
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,221
B'Elanna and my
other three patients

241
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,682
all work in Engineering.

242
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,849
They've been subjected
to the heaviest exposure,

243
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,352
but preliminary
scans suggest

244
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,188
the rest of the crew has
been affected as well...

245
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,064
including the Captain.

246
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,401
It's only a matter of
time before you begin

247
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,695
showing the same symptoms.

248
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,406
We've shut down
the warp drive,

249
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,992
but the ship is
still deteriorating,

250
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,828
and so are we.

251
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,245
Why?

252
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,878
Every bulkhead and conduit
from Deck 1 to 15

253
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,672
show signs
of molecular de-cohesion.

254
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,048
Even food from
the replicator

255
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,341
shows signs of decay.

256
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,925
As soon as anything
comes into contact

257
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,927
with<i> Voyager's</i> atmosphere,
it's affected.

258
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,471
That's what we
thought at first,

259
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,889
but take a look at this.

260
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,932
These vegetables are
completely free of decay.

261
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,685
I thought you said
the replicators...

262
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,144
They weren't
replicated.

263
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,605
I harvested them on an
away mission last week.

264
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,274
The same goes for these
particle accelerators,

265
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,694
the trilithium ore samples,
the keg of Hazari ale.

266
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,987
All of them were brought aboard
over the last few months

267
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,865
and none of them
is disintegrating.

268
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,367
We haven't been able to narrow
the time frame precisely,

269
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,411
but it appears that anything

270
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,121
brought onboard over the past
30 to 40 weeks is immune.

271
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,956
Something happened
to the ship months ago

272
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,458
that's causing
this decay.

273
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,335
A logical conclusion.

274
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,338
Eight months,
17 days ago--

275
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,257
first contact
with the Kmada.

276
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,342
They tried to sabotage
our life-support systems

277
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,678
with low-frequency
theta radiation.

278
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,556
Any chance that could have
caused the phenomenon?

279
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,891
Unlikely.

280
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,267
Let's keep looking.

281
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,394
The next event
of note took place

282
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,813
nine months, two days
ago when the N'Kree

283
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,066
tried to conscript<i> Voyager</i>
into their battle fleet.

284
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,359
And failed.

285
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,861
Next?

286
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,762
Hey.

287
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,389
Hey.

288
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,351
How's my old lady?

289
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,773
Well enough...

290
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,609
to break your nose if
you call me that again.

291
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,944
(<i> chuckles</i> )

292
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,199
Here it is.

293
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,743
What?

294
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,333
Our honeymoon.

295
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,169
Tell me.

296
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:52,386
Six days and seven nights...

297
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,889
in the historic Graystone Hotel

298
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,434
in beautiful downtown
Chicago, circa 1928.

299
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,152
Uh, wait till you see it--

300
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,321
crystal chandeliers,

301
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,782
wall-to-wall
Italian marble.

302
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,828
We'll take a drive up Michigan
Avenue in a vintage Duesenberg,

303
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,581
hobnob with the stars
of the silver screen,

304
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,042
dance the Charleston
at a genuine speakeasy

305
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,669
called the Green Mill.

306
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,754
What do I wear?

307
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,468
That's already taken care of.

308
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,721
Our bags are packed
and waiting

309
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,764
for us at the hotel.

310
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,017
(<i> sighs</i> )

311
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,352
Champagne?

312
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,896
It's on ice...

313
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,273
in a silver bucket...

314
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,987
right next to our canopy bed.

315
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,826
B'Elanna?

316
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,244
(<i> bio-bed alarm bleeping</i> )

317
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,496
Doctor?

318
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,125
Cortical stimulator.

319
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,795
Initiate
an iso-synaptic pulse.

320
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,091
It's not working.

321
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,467
Again!

322
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,346
Increase the
electrolytic levels

323
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,015
to 75 millijoules.

324
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,772
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )

325
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,024
We've lost her.

326
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,322
Increasing electrolytic levels

327
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,449
to 90 millijoules.

328
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,576
There's nothing
more we can do.

329
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,913
Uh, maybe we can try
a direct neural resequencing.

330
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,289
Lieutenant...

331
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,124
We can't just let her die!

332
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,668
Return to your quarters.

333
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,753
No!

334
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,381
(<i> sighs</i> )

335
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,425
I don't want to leave her.

336
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,969
I understand,

337
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,179
but I need to
perform an analysis

338
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,891
before her cells have
completely degraded.

339
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,183
Please.

340
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,160
Nine months, 28 days.

341
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,079
We collected silicate
from a comet

342
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,664
in the Podaris sector.

343
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,707
According to Neelix's manifest,

344
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,293
those samples are stored
in the geology lab.

345
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,090
They're showing no signs
of molecular degradation.

346
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,967
Take us
further back.

347
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,260
Ten months, 11 days ago.

348
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,513
<i>Voyager</i> was forced to land

349
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,016
on a Class-Y planetoid
in the Vaskan sector.

350
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,600
The Demon-Class planet...

351
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,061
one of our more
interesting missions.

352
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,228
We set down

353
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,481
looking for deuterium
and ended up

354
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,274
helping a new form of life
to be born.

355
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,318
The planet possessed
a biomimetic compound.

356
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,029
The "silver blood."

357
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,823
It sampled our DNA
and created duplicates

358
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,324
of the entire crew.

359
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,702
I've often wondered
what happened to them.

360
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,744
Are they flourishing?

361
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,288
Have they continued to evolve?

362
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,082
Do they still resemble us?

363
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,174
Is she...?

364
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,926
I'm afraid so.

365
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,220
Scan for traces
of deuterium,

366
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,805
hydrogen sulfate
and dichromates.

367
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,223
Dichromates?

368
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,558
Just do it.

369
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,773
What's this about?

370
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,651
We have a
disturbing theory.

371
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,737
I'm detecting
all of those compounds.

372
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,489
I want you to inject her
with a dichromate catalyst.

373
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,991
Commander?

374
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,576
We've got to be sure.

375
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,304
I don't understand.

376
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,140
That wasn't B'Elanna.

377
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,559
It was a duplicate...

378
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,770
a biomimetic copy.

379
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,438
Copy?

380
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,108
We are all duplicates.

381
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,484
None of us are real.

382
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,039
Behold the
primordial soup.

383
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,582
That's what
created us.

384
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:32,708
Not just us.

385
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,876
The entire ship
is composed

386
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,211
of the same
material.

387
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,629
It's a biomimetic
compound

388
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,922
that duplicated
the crew's

389
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,715
molecular structure so precisely

390
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,175
that I would never
have detected it

391
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,343
if I hadn't known
what to look for.

392
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,139
I was born on Earth...
in Indiana.

393
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,848
I remember growing up there.

394
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,184
I remember graduating
from the Academy.

395
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,603
I have no memory
of being a copy.

396
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,773
Apparently, the original
Kathryn Janeway's memories

397
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,399
were duplicated as well.

398
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,278
Somehow,
after the real<i> Voyager</i> left,

399
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,530
we began to forget
we were duplicates.

400
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,992
Eventually,
we assumed their lives

401
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,409
and set a course for Earth.

402
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,163
And now the warp core

403
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,248
is breaking down
our cellular structure.

404
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,667
We didn't think
the radiation would hurt us,

405
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,294
because it isn't harmful
to humanoids.

406
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,004
DOCTOR:
Each and every
one of you

407
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,339
will disintegrate
just as B'Elanna did.

408
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,008
I'm not immune, either.

409
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,384
The holo-emitters, like
everything else, are copies.

410
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,594
It's only a matter of time

411
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,721
before my program begins
to degrade.

412
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,265
What can we do
to stop the process?

413
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,184
CHAKOTAY:
There is one option.

414
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,727
Go back.

415
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,022
To the Demon-Class planet?

416
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,482
We were created
to survive there.

417
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,193
He's correct.

418
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,568
It's reasonable to assume

419
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,696
that if we return
to our native environment,

420
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,114
the degradation will cease.

421
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,575
Even if we survived
the trip,

422
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,286
we'd be traveling
thousands

423
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,913
of light-years in
the wrong direction.

424
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,290
It may be
the only way.

425
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,669
Duplicate or not,

426
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,880
I'm still the same person
I was yesterday,

427
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,422
and so are all of you...

428
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,092
and that means we're going
to do everything possible

429
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,427
to complete our mission,
which is to reach Earth.

430
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,428
Is that clear?

431
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,139
Yes, ma'am.
I want you

432
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,891
to adjust
the environmental controls

433
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,226
to simulate a Class-Y planet.

434
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,019
That should slow the rate
of degradation.

435
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,355
It's only a matter of time
before the environmental

436
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,981
controls themselves
are affected.

437
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,607
I realize that.

438
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,776
That's why we're going
to try and find a safe harbor

439
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,029
till we can figure out a way
to stop the degradation.

440
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,322
Scan for the nearest

441
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,991
Class-Y planet
and set a course.

442
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,534
In the meantime...

443
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,246
I'll explain our situation
to the crew.

444
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,960
There's still a great
deal we don't know

445
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,795
about this phenomenon,

446
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,049
and I have every confidence
we'll find a way to reverse it.

447
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,176
So you're saying
all our experiences

448
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,845
before we were duplicated--
none of it's real?

449
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,767
I don't pretend to understand it
myself, Harry...

450
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,645
but the way I choose
to look at it is this--

451
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,607
if everything
about us was duplicated,

452
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,360
that includes
our memory engrams,

453
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,946
the emotional centers
of our brain.

454
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,823
So, if you feel something...

455
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,367
remember something...

456
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,161
believe something...

457
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,872
I'm not about to tell you
it's not real.

458
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,209
But there is another crew
out there, right?

459
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,794
The real<i> Voyager.</i>

460
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,755
I suppose there is,
but I don't want that thought

461
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,216
to distract any of you
from our mission.

462
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,968
What mission is that?

463
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,141
The same
as it's always been, Tom--

464
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,810
to reach the Alpha Quadrant
safe and sound,

465
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,228
but to do that,

466
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,106
we're going to have
to beat this problem...

467
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,360
and for now,
that means conserving energy,

468
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,656
running the ship in gray mode,
cutting crew shifts in half.

469
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,534
The less you exert yourselves,
the slower the cellular decay.

470
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,748
Duplicates or not...

471
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,708
you're still my crew.

472
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,543
Dismissed.

473
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,009
Tom...

474
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,470
There's no one
here by that name.

475
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,847
I just wanted to say...

476
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,890
I'm sorry about B'Elanna.

477
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,891
Sorry?

478
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,892
What for?

479
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,270
She was your wife.

480
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,773
She was a duplicate...

481
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,733
just like you are, Harry.

482
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,110
You heard the Captain.

483
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,903
If we're going to survive this,

484
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,571
we've got to believe
in ourselves.

485
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,698
(<i> scoffs</i> )

486
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,074
(<i> chuckling</i> )

487
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,743
You can drop
the good soldier routine.

488
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,622
You don't have to do everything
the Captain says anymore.

489
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,875
Hell, she's not
even the Captain.

490
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,626
She is to me.

491
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,630
Okay. Well, let's suppose
she does get us back to Earth.

492
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,673
What then?

493
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,717
You really think
your family

494
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,636
is going to welcome
you with open arms?

495
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,180
I don't know.

496
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,265
For all you know,
the real Harry Kim

497
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,434
is having Sunday dinner
with them right now.

498
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,728
And you come strolling
through the door,

499
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,230
they're going to see you

500
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,482
for exactly what you
are-- an impostor.

501
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,775
So what are we going to do, huh?

502
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,237
Wait around
till we all disintegrate?

503
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,542
(<i> door chimes</i> )

504
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,210
Come in.

505
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,340
Chicken paprikash--
my grandmother's recipe.

506
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,176
Well, maybe not
my grandmother,

507
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,053
but it's still
delicious.

508
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,138
It's our weekly
dinner together.

509
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,932
Don't tell me
you forgot.

510
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,352
We've lost three more people.

511
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,229
We've got to head back.

512
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,984
I've spent the past five years
trying to get this crew home.

513
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,736
I'm not about to quit now.

514
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,405
Listen to yourself.

515
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,698
You haven't even been alive
for five years.

516
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,992
Home is a Class-Y planet
in the Delta Quadrant.

517
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,911
We don't belong on Earth.

518
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,746
How do you know where we belong?

519
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,164
For all we know,

520
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,791
the real<i> Voyager's</i>
been destroyed

521
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,167
and we're all that's left.

522
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,961
For all we know,

523
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,797
we're supposed
to be living their lives.

524
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,007
That's a pretty big
assumption...

525
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,176
and it's putting this crew
in danger.

526
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,057
There's only one thing
I know how to be, Chakotay,

527
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,767
and that's Kathryn Janeway.

528
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,144
I'd like to think

529
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,979
I know Captain Janeway
pretty well myself,

530
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,148
and as much as she'd like
to get her crew home,

531
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,818
I don't think she'd be willing
to kill them in the process.

532
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,408
Maybe this dinner wasn't
such a good idea after all.

533
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,963
I've tried everything
I can think of--

534
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,881
bio-molecular enhancers,

535
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,510
gene splicing
with replicated DNA--

536
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,012
and I'm no closer
to finding a cure.

537
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,514
But I do have an idea.

538
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,515
I'm listening.

539
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,391
Find the original<i> Voyager.</i>

540
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,101
If the real Captain Janeway
were here,

541
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,936
we could sample her DNA

542
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,813
and imprint it
onto your mimetic pattern.

543
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,149
But, Doctor, we have no way
of knowing where they are.

544
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,485
They could be behind
us, ahead of us,

545
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,028
back on Earth...
destroyed.

546
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,365
Besides, even if we could
find the real Janeway,

547
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,991
how do we know she'd help?

548
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,700
She's you.

549
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,621
My emitter's
starting to degrade.

550
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,997
You better get
back to Sick Bay.

551
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,457
<i>Tuvok to the Captain.</i>

552
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,043
<i>Sensors have detected</i>
<i>a Class-Y planet.</i>

553
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,170
On my way.

554
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,006
KIM:
It may not be home,
but it checks out.

555
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,466
Thermionic radiation...

556
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,718
surface temperatures in
excess of 500 kelvins.

557
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,096
Just what
the Doctor ordered.

558
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,598
Safe harbor?

559
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,059
There's no guarantee
this is going to work.

560
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:53,482
Harry, vent all plasma
from the nacelles.

561
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,776
Transfer available power
to atmospheric thrusters

562
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,654
and stand by to commence
landing sequence.

563
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,406
Yes, ma'am.

564
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,032
Red Alert.

565
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,368
Landing struts
on line.

566
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,453
Inertial dampers
at maximum.

567
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,539
Take us down, Mr. Paris.

568
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,500
Captain, a vessel is approaching

569
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,918
from the planet's surface.

570
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,836
On screen.

571
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,963
KIM:
They're hailing.

572
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,549
Open a channel.

573
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,051
MALE:
<i>You're in direct violation</i>

574
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,011
<i>of the Ord'Mirit Mining Treaty.</i>

575
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,431
<i>Leave orbit</i>
<i>or you'll be destroyed.</i>

576
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,600
(<i> console beeping</i> )

577
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,184
They are firing weapons.

578
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,105
(<i> sighs</i> )

579
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,042
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

580
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,044
of the Federation Starship
<i>Voyager.</i>

581
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,506
We are not your enemy.

582
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,259
They seem to disagree.

583
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,260
We're not interested

584
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,803
in your mining operation.

585
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,388
Our ship is badly damaged.

586
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,141
We need to set down
on the surface to make repairs.

587
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,394
<i>We repeat:</i>
<i>Leave or be destroyed.</i>

588
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,022
Shields down to 52 percent.

589
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,816
With our systems
degrading,

590
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,402
we won't be able to
take this much longer.

591
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,780
Target their weapon systems.

592
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,197
Fire.

593
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,075
No effect.

594
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,579
Hull breaches
on Decks 11, 14 and 15.

595
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,081
The damaged sections
are turning into

596
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,124
biomimetic matter.

597
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,668
Containment fields are failing.

598
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,711
Evacuate those decks.

599
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,339
If we emit a polaron burst,
we can disable their shields

600
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,090
long enough to target
their warp core.

601
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,677
No. We're not going
to destroy them

602
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,345
over a misunderstanding.

603
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,221
Either that or retreat.

604
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,056
(<i> gasps</i> )

605
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,061
We're Starfleet officers.

606
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,730
We can't forget that.

607
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,774
Break orbit.

608
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,401
That planet may be our
last chance for survival.

609
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,862
We'll have to find
another option.

610
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,657
I'm not sure why we're
still taking orders from you.

611
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,992
Lieutenant, follow orders
or leave the Bridge.

612
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,500
The alien vessel's not pursuing.

613
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,878
Begin scanning
for other Class-Y planets.

614
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,675
Harry, transmit a distress call
on all subspace bands.

615
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,760
If the real<i> Voyager</i>
is out there,

616
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,387
I want to find them.

617
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,638
In the meantime,

618
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,641
which direction do
you want me to go?

619
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,437
Resume course for the Alpha
Quadrant, Mr. Paris.

620
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,744
I know what you're going to say
and I don't want to hear it.

621
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,453
Too bad.

622
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,539
I'm willing to take a
little insolence from Tom,

623
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,123
but I shouldn't
have to remind you

624
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,751
that I'm still
the Captain.

625
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,210
You're not.

626
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,213
You're a biomimetic life-form
created in her image.

627
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,383
Are you saying you're not
taking orders from me anymore?

628
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,427
I'm saying
you need to step back

629
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,555
and look at our situation
objectively.

630
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,265
You think I should
have given the order

631
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,683
to fire on that vessel.

632
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,811
No. I agreed with your
decision to stand down,

633
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,939
but how long can we adhere
to Starfleet principles

634
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,982
before we start making
compromises?

635
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,026
As long as it takes.

636
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,863
Our ship may be
deteriorating,

637
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,490
but our humanity is intact.

638
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,243
Belief alone won't hold
this ship together.

639
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,994
It's gotten us this far.

640
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,455
Not far enough.

641
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,748
(<i> sighs</i> )

642
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,499
Tom and I aren't
the only ones

643
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,251
who question
your decisions.

644
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,878
Now that the
truth is known,

645
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,671
a lot of people think
we should turn around

646
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,465
and head for
the Class-Y planet.

647
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,551
They're starting to remember
their existence before<i> Voyager.</i>

648
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,969
What?

649
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,640
What existence?

650
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,476
Pools of biomimetic fluid?

651
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,019
We didn't even experience
sentience

652
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,897
until<i> Voyager</i> came along.

653
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,356
What good is sentience

654
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,901
if we're not alive
to experience it?

655
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,320
Kathryn, we've got to go back.

656
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,406
I promised the crew
I'd get them home.

657
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,826
Home isn't Earth.

658
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,460
Janeway to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

659
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,005
He's not responding.

660
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,883
(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

661
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,344
His neural pathways
are destabilizing.

662
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:38,183
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )

663
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,827
We've lost Commander Chakotay.

664
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,913
Duplicate or not,

665
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,289
he was real to me...

666
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,629
and he was
a fine Starfleet officer.

667
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,088
And...

668
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,429
he was a friend...

669
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,265
who...

670
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,478
wasn't afraid to let me know
when I am wrong.

671
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,525
Mr. Kim,

672
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,402
bring the enhanced

673
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,320
warp drive on line.

674
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,701
Turn<i> Voyager</i> around.

675
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,997
We're going home.

676
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,916
Captain...

677
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,752
Set a course...

678
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,463
for the Demon planet.

679
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,064
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

680
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:11,276
<i>We've lost 63 crewmen, and our</i>
<i>systems are continuing to fail.</i>

681
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,112
<i>Though we're still five weeks</i>
<i>away from the Demon planet,</i>

682
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,281
<i>we haven't given up hope.</i>

683
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,075
The holographic projectors
in Sick Bay

684
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,452
went off-line at 0300.

685
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,412
We've lost the Doctor.

686
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,958
What's Tom's condition?

687
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,960
No change.

688
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,878
Well... hmm...

689
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,839
looks like we're in the market
for a new medical officer.

690
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,549
Feel up to it, Neelix?

691
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,638
I've only been trained
as a field medic.

692
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,139
It'll have to do.

693
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,977
What about my other duties?

694
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,729
Make Sick Bay your priority.

695
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,481
(<i> weak laugh</i> )

696
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,900
At this point...

697
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,526
morale is a luxury.

698
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,195
How's the core holding up?

699
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,572
The modified nanoprobes are

700
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,324
still reinforcing
the warp field.

701
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,494
It should remain functioning
until we reach the Demon planet.

702
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,704
However, there is less
than a 20 percent probability

703
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,040
that<i> Voyager</i> will remain intact
that long.

704
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,461
Well...

705
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,506
it won't be the first time
this crew has been...

706
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,383
up against...

707
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,385
Captain?

708
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,763
It's all right. I'm just...

709
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,976
a little tired.

710
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,186
Let Ensign Kim
take command for a while.

711
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,188
I'm still the Captain.

712
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,775
And I am
the Chief Medical Officer.

713
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,610
Don't force me

714
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,487
to relieve you of your duties.

715
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:42,367
Your concerns have
been noted... sir.

716
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,211
Now...

717
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,716
there is another matter.

718
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:01,386
I want to download
the ship's database...

719
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:05,057
and our personal logs
into a signal beacon.

720
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,811
In the event we don't survive,

721
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,897
there should be some record

722
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,982
of our accomplishments.

723
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,608
A time capsule.

724
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,655
This crew's existence
may have been brief...

725
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,450
but it's been distinguished.

726
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,706
None of you...

727
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,336
deserves to be forgotten.

728
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,177
I will use unaffected components
to construct a beacon.

729
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,178
(<i> rumbling</i> )

730
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,846
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

731
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,488
The deflector's off-line.

732
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,784
Interstellar dust is
contaminating the warp field.

733
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,202
Purge it.

734
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,661
SEVEN:
I can't.

735
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,747
The exhaust manifolds
have disintegrated.

736
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,540
(<i> ship's hull creaking</i> )

737
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,796
We've come too far
to be stopped by dust.

738
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,382
Reroute auxiliary power

739
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,509
to the deflector.

740
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,221
Warp field failure in eight...

741
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,346
seven...

742
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,347
six...

743
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,849
five...

744
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,059
four...

745
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,518
three...

746
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,645
Got it.

747
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,313
Reinitializing

748
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,857
the deflector.

749
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,401
The warp field has stabilized.

750
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,529
(<i> tired sigh</i> )

751
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,907
I may not be
morale officer anymore,

752
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,452
but I think this is
a cause for celebration.

753
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,163
What do you say, Captain?

754
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,501
Captain?

755
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:04,717
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )

756
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,139
She's gone.

757
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:29,075
KIM:
<i>Acting Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 52597.4.</i>

758
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,453
<i>Our situation's getting worse</i>
<i>every day.</i>

759
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,332
<i>More than 80 percent</i>
<i>of the ship is uninhabitable.</i>

760
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,042
<i>Most of the crew are gone.</i>

761
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,294
<i>It seems less and less likely</i>
<i>that the few of us left</i>

762
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,628
<i>will reach our destination.</i>

763
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,100
Computer, hull status.

764
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,354
<i>Hull integrity at 45 percent.</i>

765
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,815
What was that?

766
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,069
<i>Cargo Bay 2 has decompressed.</i>

767
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,905
Seal off that deck.

768
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:17,165
Computer, erect a level-10
force field around the Bridge.

769
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,624
Unable to comply.

770
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,085
Seven...

771
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,753
I need more power up here.

772
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,546
The bulkheads are coming apart.

773
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,714
I'm transferring

774
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,174
the last
of our power reserves.

775
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,722
COMPUTER:
Deck 1 force field
is in place.

776
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,474
That's better.

777
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,559
How's life support?

778
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,186
SEVEN:
Degrading.

779
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,605
We have approximately
ten hours of air remaining.

780
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,566
What about the time capsule?

781
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,235
<i>It's ready for launch.</i>

782
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,696
Do it.

783
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,288
The launch sequencer
has misfired.

784
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,539
Reset the initiator;
try it again.

785
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,750
It won't work.

786
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,002
The launch mechanism is
demolecularized.

787
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,879
Salvage the probe.

788
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,008
It's too late.

789
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,593
It's been destroyed.

790
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,722
Personal logs...

791
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,557
mission logs...

792
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,559
all our history...

793
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,645
gone.

794
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,230
(<i> console beeping</i> )

795
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,856
Now what?

796
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:26,859
I'm detecting a vessel...

797
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,861
22 light-years away.

798
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,245
I see it.

799
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:45,170
I'm trying to hail them.

800
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,839
The subspace transceiver's
malfunctioning.

801
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,968
If they move out of range,
they won't see us.

802
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,096
We still have
one active com circuit,

803
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,056
but we'll have to go
to impulse to use it.

804
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,724
Seven, drop out of warp.

805
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,060
The engine controls are fused.

806
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,145
Then unfuse them.

807
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,562
<i>Without an isolytic converter,</i>

808
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,564
I cannot comply.

809
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,817
Dump the core.

810
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,153
Ensign, dropping out of warp
at this velocity

811
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,237
could tear the ship apart.

812
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,114
We're already falling apart.

813
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,449
We're not going to make it

814
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,701
<i>to the Class-Y planet</i>
<i>in one piece,</i>

815
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,662
which means that ship is
our only hope.

816
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,540
Think about it.

817
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,961
What would Captain Janeway
have done?

818
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,510
Computer, prepare to eject
the warp core.

819
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:37,347
Authorization: Seven of Nine-
omega-phi-nine-three.

820
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,140
Warp ejection systems enabled.

821
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,395
Eject the core.

822
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,439
(<i> yells</i> )

823
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,320
We've lost attitude
control and shields.

824
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,322
Hull integrity at 19 percent.

825
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,117
Reroute life support!

826
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,911
Hell, reroute everything
we've got left

827
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,204
to the containment fields.

828
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,919
Hull breaches on Decks

829
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,379
9, 10 and 11.

830
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,092
Seven.

831
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,218
Seven!

832
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,014
Computer...

833
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,683
how long until we're within
hailing range of that ship?

834
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,395
(<i> distorted</i> ):
F-f-f-five minutes
and 30 seconds.

835
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,730
F-f-f-five minutes
and 30 seconds.

836
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,155
Range?

837
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,116
Five million kilometers.

838
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,452
Try hailing again.

839
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,746
No response.

840
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,415
Captain, I've
found the source

841
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:46,416
of the distress call.

842
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,625
It's coming from a vessel.

843
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,793
Can you identify it?

844
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,212
No. The readings are erratic.

845
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,047
Looks like they've taken
heavy damage.

846
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,924
400,000 kilometers.

847
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,968
Drop to impulse.
Are the rescue teams ready?

848
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,638
Bridge to Sick Bay.
Stand by for casualties.

849
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,889
In visual range.

850
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,391
On screen.

851
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,980
Where's the ship?

852
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,483
No sign of it.

853
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,734
That debris... that couldn't be
all that's left.

854
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,489
I'm detecting residual
deuterium, antineutrons,

855
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,449
traces of dichromates.

856
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:22,452
If it was a vessel,
it isn't anymore.

857
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:24,954
Scan for life signs,
escape pods.

858
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,665
None.

859
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,591
Make a note
in the ship's record--

860
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:40,470
we received a distress
call at 0900 hours.

861
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,764
Arrived at the vessel's
last known coordinates at 2120.

862
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,271
The ship was destroyed.

863
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,939
Cause unknown.

864
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,860
No survivors.

865
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,114
Mr. Paris, resume course.

866
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,491
Aye, sir.
