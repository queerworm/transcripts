1
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,046
JANEWAY:
It's not as difficult
as it looks.

2
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,423
The first rule is:

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,008
Don't be afraid
of the clay.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,593
SEVEN:
I fear nothing.

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,094
I mean you can't
concern yourself

6
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,680
with making a mistake,

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,222
or whether the image
you had in your mind

8
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,683
is what's taking form
in front of you.

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,392
You just have
to let your hands--

10
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,854
and the clay--
do the work.

11
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,772
Here.

12
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,693
( horse neighs in distance )

13
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,486
Go ahead.

14
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,947
I think the nose could be
a little stronger.

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,499
Well, that's
a start.

16
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,001
Keep going.

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,464
( church bell
ringing in distance )

18
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:56,139
This activity is
truly unproductive.

19
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,808
The end result has no use.

20
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,520
No necessary task
has been accomplished.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,231
Time has been expended,
nothing more.

22
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,067
That depends on how you
look at it, doesn't it?

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,529
I find sculpting
helps me unwind, relax.

24
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,489
The concept
of relaxation

25
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,992
is difficult for me
to understand.

26
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,785
As a Borg,
my time was spent

27
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,286
working
at a specific task.

28
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,372
When it was completed,
I was assigned another.

29
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,082
It was efficient.

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,584
Well, so is this.

31
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,961
It helps
my own efficiency

32
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,756
to forget about<i> Voyager</i> 
for awhile.

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,970
I'd be embarrassed
to show Maestro Leonardo

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,931
something like this, but...

35
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,850
I get a great deal
of pleasure

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,227
in working the clay...

37
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,646
in creating something.

38
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,857
But why here,
in this simulation,

39
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,442
among these
archaic objects

40
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,945
and this disorganized
environment?

41
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,906
Frankly, it's refreshing
to take myself

42
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:57,076
out of the 24th century
every now and then.

43
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,788
And a little disorganization...

44
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,540
can be very encouraging
to the imagination.

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,626
You might want
to try it sometime.

46
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:10,338
Are you suggesting that I create
one of these holodeck programs?

47
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,092
You might find it interesting.

48
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:16,637
It's a way of exploring
aspects of yourself

49
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:20,181
that probably didn't fit
into your life as a Borg--

50
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,475
imagination,

51
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,851
creativity,

52
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,519
fantasy.

53
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,272
I am uncertain why these things
are necessary.

54
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,900
Well, they aren't
necessary, Seven,

55
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,527
but they're an important part
of one's life,

56
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,030
because imagination
frees the mind,

57
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,992
it inspires
ideas and solutions,

58
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,620
and it can provide
a great deal of pleasure.

59
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,998
Human progress,

60
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,457
the human mind itself

61
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,334
couldn't exist
without them.

62
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,920
When I was a child,
I studied these drawings.

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,924
I even built some
of these models.

64
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,969
Da Vinci was always
a great inspiration to me.

65
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,720
He was a very busy man.

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,932
Oh, yes,
a prolific artist

67
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,518
and a scientist as well.

68
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,980
Far, far ahead of his time.

69
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,860
That design,
for example.

70
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,903
He conceived
of an airplane

71
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,573
centuries before
one was actually built.

72
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,575
Seven?

73
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,666
BORG COLLECTIVE:
<i>You will be assimilated.</i>

74
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,251
<i>Resistance is futile.</i>

75
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,630
<i>Your distinctiveness</i>
<i>will be added to our own.</i>

76
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,217
MAN:
Annika!

77
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>You will be assimilated.</i>

78
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,431
<i>You will be</i>
<i>assimilated.</i>

79
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,602
( raven shrieks )

80
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,523
Seven, what is it?

81
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,943
I don't know.

82
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:07,998
<i>( dramatic</i>
<i>theme music playing )</i>

83
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,602
It's happened three times now

84
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,190
in different locations,
at different times of the day.

85
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,735
I experience a series
of disjointed images in my mind.

86
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,612
Can you be
more specific?

87
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,948
Were these
hallucinations?

88
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,576
I don't know.
I've never hallucinated.

89
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,622
It's as if I were aboard
a Borg vessel, but...

90
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,625
but I was frightened.
I felt fear.

91
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,047
Each experience
is similar--

92
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,464
I'm pursued by the Borg.

93
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,675
They want
to assimilate me.

94
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,970
I'm-I'm running
from them, and then...

95
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,349
and then, each time,
I see a bird.

96
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,850
A bird?

97
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,312
Yes, a large, black bird,
flying toward me,

98
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,147
shrieking,

99
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,523
attacking me.

100
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,900
Hm.

101
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,277
Your hippocampus is
in a state of agitation.

102
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,987
What does that mean?

103
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,947
As your human
physiology

104
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,325
continues
to reassert itself,

105
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,285
psychological symptoms
are bound to manifest

106
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,661
in a variety of ways--

107
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,539
through dreams,
hallucinations,

108
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,499
hypnagogic
regression...

109
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,210
Hypnagogic
regression?

110
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,586
Flashbacks.

111
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,296
You could be experiencing
some sort of

112
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,797
post-traumatic
stress disorder.

113
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,423
That makes sense.

114
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,927
You were assimilated
by the Borg.

115
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,138
You've gone through
an intense, prolonged trauma.

116
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,765
I was not
traumatized.

117
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,683
I was raised
by the Borg.

118
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,894
I don't see them
as threatening.

119
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,146
Why would I
experience fear?

120
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,773
I don't know.

121
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,901
Will I keep having
these flashbacks?

122
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,279
I'll need to study
your neural scans further.

123
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,738
In the meantime,

124
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,823
your digestive system
is fully functional.

125
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,367
Now is as good a time as any

126
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,827
for you to begin taking
solid and liquid nutrients.

127
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,662
Oral consumption
is inefficient.

128
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,416
And unnecessary, if you're lucky
enough to be a hologram.

129
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,918
But your human
physiology requires it.

130
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,462
I'll draw up a list
of nutritional requirements.

131
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,464
Take it to Mr. Neelix
in the Mess Hall.

132
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,549
I hesitate to inflict
his cooking on you,

133
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,802
but it'll have to do.

134
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,722
I do not enjoy
this sensation.

135
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,015
Something
is happening to me

136
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,976
and I don't
know what it is.

137
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,978
It's as though
I'm being driven somehow.

138
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,314
<i>Chakotay to the Captain.</i> 
Go ahead.

139
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,358
<i>Our guests have arrived.</i>
<i>They're being escorted</i>
<i>to the briefing room.</i>

140
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,860
On my way.
Representatives
of the B'omar.

141
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,196
I've been trying to negotiate
passage through their space,

142
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,073
but so far, they've been
difficult to deal with.

143
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,908
I hope they've had
a change of heart.

144
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,119
I'll stay here and wait
for the Doctor's instructions.

145
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,745
( sighs )

146
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,665
We'll help you
through this, Seven.

147
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,667
You'll be all right.

148
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,721
JANEWAY: Have you had a chance
to consider our request?

149
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,556
Congratulations,
Captain.

150
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,101
Against our better judgment,
the B'omar Sovereignty

151
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,020
has agreed to grant
your vessel passage

152
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,438
through
our territory.

153
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,857
On behalf of my crew,
thank you.

154
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,109
That will cut three months
off our journey.

155
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,403
However,
there are a few stipulations--

156
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,155
guidelines
that you must adhere to.

157
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,949
You'll have
our complete cooperation.

158
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,993
We expect
nothing less.

159
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,411
While in our space,

160
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,497
your vessel will
not exceed warp 3

161
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,874
and your weapon systems
will remain off-line.

162
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,168
You will avoid
unnecessary scans

163
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,213
and you will not conduct
surveys of any kind.

164
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,589
You will make no attempt
to explore our space,

165
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,300
and you will avoid
all communications

166
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,759
with nonmilitary craft.

167
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,136
We've also
plotted the course

168
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,096
your vessel
is to follow.

169
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,649
( scoffs )

170
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,860
It'll take us weeks
to follow that course.

171
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,237
If not months.

172
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,696
We've designed
this course

173
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,240
so that your ship would avoid

174
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,826
our populated systems
and industrial areas.

175
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,330
Deviation is not recommended.

176
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,249
There are a total
of 17 checkpoints

177
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,584
where you will submit
your vessel for inspection.

178
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,212
JANEWAY:
Chancellor Gauman,
if I may interrupt.

179
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,590
I appreciate your efforts
in plotting this flight plan,

180
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,926
but, if we could,

181
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,594
I'd like
to negotiate a course

182
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,388
that's a little more...

183
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,056
direct.

184
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,314
Well, what
an unexpected pleasure.

185
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,483
Welcome to the Mess Hall.

186
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,651
Would you like me
to show you around?

187
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,612
My physiology has
reasserted the need

188
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,239
to process
solid nutrients.

189
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,865
The Doctor has
prepared a list

190
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,117
of dietary
requirements.

191
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,119
You will provide
them for me.

192
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,912
Let's see
what we have here.

193
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,124
250 grams glycoproteins,

194
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,294
consisting of
53 percent polypeptides

195
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,838
and 26 percent
fibrous glycogen...

196
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,132
Ugh.

197
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,925
Doesn't sound
very appetizing.

198
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,553
However, a plate
of my chadre kab

199
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,513
should satisfy most
of these essentials,

200
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,641
while providing a pleasurable
culinary experience

201
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,185
at the same time.
Pleasure is irrelevant.

202
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,895
Well, I beg to differ.

203
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,982
A good meal involves much
more than simply providing

204
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,442
the proper nutrients.

205
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,902
Why is that?

206
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,071
Uh, well, it's a...

207
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,490
There's a certain
satisfaction

208
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,824
that comes
from eating food

209
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,493
that's been
carefully prepared.

210
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,578
I'm sure once you try it,
you'll understand.

211
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,289
Now, how would you
like your chadre kab?

212
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,915
Boiled? Baked?
Stir-fried?

213
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,709
Preparation is irrelevant.
Is irrelevant-- maybe.

214
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,044
Maybe not.

215
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,631
This is the first time
ingesting food for you

216
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,549
for quite awhile.

217
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,468
We'll go a little
easy on your stomach.

218
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,927
Steamed.

219
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,558
Yes...

220
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,978
This, uh... This recipe
has been in my family

221
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,522
for generations.

222
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,565
It's considered a delicacy
among my people.

223
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,984
You are Talaxian.

224
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,735
Guilty as charged.

225
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,237
Species 218.

226
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,532
Well, I suppose so.

227
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,283
Your biological
and technological

228
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,202
distinctiveness
was added to our own.

229
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,039
I hadn't realized that.

230
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,375
A small freighter,
containing a crew of 39,

231
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,502
taken in the Dalmine Sector.

232
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,920
They were easily assimilated.

233
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,130
Their dense musculature

234
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,841
made them
excellent drones.

235
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,595
Well, lucky for you,
I guess.

236
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,974
Your nutrients.

237
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,397
Follow me.

238
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,705
Please.

239
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,415
Please what?

240
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,042
It's customary to sit
while eating.

241
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,433
Uh, is something
wrong?

242
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,851
I am unaccustomed
to this.

243
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,395
Borg do not sit.

244
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:54,399
Well, this is a day of
firsts, then, isn't it?

245
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,695
Now...

246
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,989
Take a bite.

247
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,493
Uh... try that one.

248
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,331
Just kind of, uh...

249
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,333
scoop some up.

250
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,545
That's the way.

251
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,171
Right into your mouth,

252
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,006
just like a
little scout ship

253
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,509
flying into
a shuttle bay.

254
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,055
Take it out.
Keep your mouth closed.

255
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,682
That's right.

256
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,809
Now, you chew--

257
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,062
chew, chew, chew,
chew, chew.

258
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,399
And swallow.

259
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,613
Uh, swallow. Uh...

260
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,491
( swallows )

261
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,828
( swallows )

262
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,791
Curious sensation.

263
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,334
You'll get used to it.

264
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,752
Have some more.

265
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,145
May I bring you
something else?

266
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,897
A soothing cup of tea,
perhaps?

267
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,735
( shrieking )

268
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,161
( gasps )

269
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,249
You will be assimilated.

270
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,127
Resistance is futile.

271
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,381
( grunts )

272
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,299
CREWMAN:
Did you see that?

273
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,436
CHAKOTAY:
What about this course?

274
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,313
It's a marginal
adjustment.

275
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,857
The nearest
populated system

276
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,775
is more than three
light-years away.

277
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,109
Definitely not.

278
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,028
You'd pass
directly through

279
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,363
the Agrat-Mot Nebula,

280
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,657
a key resource
in our trade negotiations

281
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,076
with the Nassordin.
I could chart the nebula,

282
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,036
try to avoid...
No, no.

283
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,540
Are your translators
malfunctioning?

284
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,876
TUVOK:
<i>Captain Janeway to the Bridge.</i>

285
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,336
If you'll excuse me.

286
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,630
( alarm beeping )

287
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,923
Report.

288
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,842
I've received
an alert from Security.

289
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,094
Seven of Nine attacked
Neelix in the Mess Hall,

290
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,179
and three other crewmen
on Deck 2.

291
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,848
Janeway to Seven of Nine.

292
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,142
Seven, if you can hear me,
respond.

293
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,686
What's her location?

294
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,063
Deck 6,
Section 28-Alpha.

295
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,816
Take a security team.

296
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,611
GAUMAN:
Captain... what is happening
here?

297
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,986
I wish I knew,
Chancellor.

298
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,322
Chakotay, seal off Deck 6.

299
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,952
BORG COLLECTIVE:
<i>Seven of Nine.</i>

300
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,079
<i>( many indistinct</i>
<i>voices overlapping )</i>

301
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,724
MALE CREWMAN:
<i>Security to Captain Janeway.</i>

302
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,684
<i>We've just seen Seven of Nine.</i>

303
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,352
<i>Her Borg shields</i>
<i>are fully operational</i>

304
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,146
<i>and they've adapted</i>
<i>to our phasers.</i>

305
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,398
Acknowledged.

306
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,151
Bridge to all
security personnel.

307
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,154
Configure your weapons
to a rotating modulation,

308
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,072
but keep them on "stun."

309
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,117
Borg?
You have Borg on your ship?

310
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,619
It's not what
you think.

311
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,995
She is a member of my crew.

312
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,872
We liberated her
from the collective.

313
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,332
She's no longer a Borg.

314
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,584
Then why is she equipped
with Borg shields?

315
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,961
I don't know.

316
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,011
She's able to cross
through the security fields.

317
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,430
She's entering
the armory on Deck 6.

318
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,731
Deck 10.

319
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,944
She's in a turbolift.
Cut power to the turboshafts.

320
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,529
She's blocking
my commands

321
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,572
with a Borg encryption code.
Janeway to Tuvok.

322
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,366
Seven's apparently
headed for Deck 10.

323
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,034
Can you get there
before she does?

324
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,495
I'm moving
into position now, Captain.

325
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,874
We'll take
position here.

326
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,592
( turbolift arriving )

327
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,471
TUVOK:
Lower your weapon,

328
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,139
and stand down.

329
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,769
Fire.

330
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,025
( grunts )

331
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,902
( grunts )

332
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,073
<i>Tuvok to Bridge.</i>
<i>We were unsuccessful.</i>

333
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,492
I have wounded.

334
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,411
She's moving toward
Junction 32-Alpha.

335
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,996
The Shuttle Bay.

336
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,831
I'm erecting a force field.

337
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,918
Harry, reroute all
available power to Deck 10.

338
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,294
Done.

339
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,517
She's accessing
transporter control.

340
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,360
She used
a site-to-site transport.

341
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,780
She's in a shuttlecraft...

342
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,990
powering engines.
Seal the launch doors.

343
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,872
Tractor beam.
No effect.

344
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,917
She's remodulated
the shuttle's shield harmonics.

345
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,543
KIM:
Captain...

346
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,587
Seven's headed directly
into B'omar space.

347
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,089
She's gone
to warp.

348
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,049
She's masked the
shuttle's ion trail.

349
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,343
I've lost her signal.
She's gone.

350
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,024
We'll do everything in our power
to find her,

351
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,526
but we will need permission
to enter B'omar space

352
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,361
to track her shuttle
effectively.

353
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,906
Let's tally
the events, shall we?

354
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,575
First, you arrive
uninvited and unwelcome,

355
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,036
requesting a shortcut
through our space.

356
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,039
Then you proceed to unleash
some sort of rogue Borg,

357
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,583
and now you want
us to help you get it back.

358
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,543
I apologize
for what's happened here,

359
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,588
but we certainly didn't
"unleash" anyone.

360
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,382
We can resolve this
situation quickly, gentlemen,

361
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,843
if we work together.

362
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,553
Captain Janeway,
after what I've seen here,

363
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,806
I question
your competence.

364
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,391
May I remind you that
you're still on my ship--

365
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:49,313
And you are only one vessel
among many of ours.

366
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,984
Your Borg will be dealt with
quickly and efficiently.

367
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,361
It's being tracked
as we speak.

368
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,404
Tracked... how?

369
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,324
Every vessel, every object,

370
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,244
every particle of dust
that crosses our borders

371
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,456
is immediately identified
and traced

372
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,416
by our perimeter grid.

373
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,669
The Borg will be found...
and destroyed.

374
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,421
Chancellor...
There will be no sharing
of information.

375
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,133
From this point on, your vessel
will maintain a distance

376
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,593
of at least five light-years
from our borders.

377
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,428
Any deviation

378
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,015
will be considered
an act of aggression.

379
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,102
Commander,

380
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,397
escort our guests
to the transporter room.

381
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,365
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

382
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,992
<i>I've assembled a team</i>

383
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,037
<i>to analyze every square meter</i>
<i>of the cargo bay.</i>

384
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,997
<i>This has essentially been</i>
<i>her quarters</i>

385
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,790
<i>for the past two months.</i>

386
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,918
<i>I'm determined</i>
<i>to find something here</i>

387
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,880
<i>that might shed some light</i>
<i>on Seven of Nine's actions.</i>

388
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,427
( tricorder beeping softly )

389
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,184
You're taking this kind
of hard, aren't you?

390
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,561
What's that
supposed to mean?

391
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,234
We had a working
relationship.

392
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,195
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

393
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,697
It's not what
you're thinking.

394
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,658
What am I
thinking, Harry?

395
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,786
Never mind.

396
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,880
( beeping intensifies )

397
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,890
Take a look at this.

398
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,022
Anything?

399
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,316
It's a Borg
data-link.

400
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,735
It contains a succession
of log entries

401
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,862
written in Borg
alphanumeric code.

402
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,823
I'm getting pretty good
with the Borg language.

403
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,199
I think I can
translate them.

404
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,994
Get on it.

405
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,704
It seems we've made quite
an impression on the B'omar.

406
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,999
In the last hour, they've
doubled the number of ships

407
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,374
patrolling
their borders,

408
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,043
and they've increased
the sensitivity

409
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,670
of the perimeter
grid by 36 percent.

410
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,005
So much for diplomacy.

411
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,589
The Doctor analyzed
the data

412
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,716
from Seven of Nine's
last transport.

413
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,845
He's found something
he wants us to see.

414
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,680
Maybe this was
inevitable.

415
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,723
Even if Seven did want
to stay on<i> Voyager,</i>

416
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,809
her Borg nature
may have won out.

417
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,187
We can remove implant
after implant,

418
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,856
but maybe
at her core,

419
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,691
she'll always be part
of the collective.

420
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,943
No. I won't
accept that.

421
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,905
Deck 5.

422
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,158
She was responding to us--

423
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,243
interacting with people
outside of the collective

424
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,786
for the first time.

425
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,788
She was adapting
to this environment

426
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,623
and to this crew.

427
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,667
But where is she going?

428
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,252
We've scanned space

429
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,046
for a distance
of 40 light-years.

430
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,131
We've found no evidence
of Borg ships,

431
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,966
so she can't be trying
to rejoin the collective.

432
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,219
She may plan to take the
shuttle back to Borg space.

433
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,762
10,000 light-years from here?
I don't think so. No.

434
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,431
Something else
is going on.

435
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,060
We're missing a piece
of the puzzle.

436
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,229
In the meantime,
the B'omar intend to find her,

437
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,023
and if they do,
she'll probably resist them.

438
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,734
One more reason
for us to find her first.

439
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,781
What have you found,
Doctor?

440
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,575
Something
most peculiar.

441
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,827
This graphic represents
the matter conversion data

442
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,662
from Seven of Nine's
last transport.

443
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,622
If you'll notice,
there's a high concentration

444
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:39,335
of Borg organelles in the bone
marrow and lymphatic tissue.

445
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,962
The dormant nanoprobes
in Seven of Nine's cells

446
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,130
have reasserted themselves--

447
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,715
taken over blood
cell production,

448
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,218
and they're growing
new Borg implants.

449
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,969
13 percent
of the Borg technology

450
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,388
I removed three weeks ago

451
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,514
has regenerated
in a matter of hours.

452
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,226
You said the nanoprobes in
her bloodstream were dormant.

453
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,518
What reactivated them?

454
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,104
I don't know.

455
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,606
But I've developed a way
to stop the process.

456
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,483
This hypospray contains
a genetic resequencing vector.

457
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,819
It should neutralize
the nanoprobes.

458
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,697
That means someone needs
to get close enough to do it.

459
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,746
Report.

460
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,915
We've analyzed
the B'omar perimeter grid.

461
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,292
It's sophisticated,

462
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,127
but not without
its vulnerabilities.

463
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,587
It might be possible
to penetrate the grid

464
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,299
by recalibrating our shields
to match its frequency.

465
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,342
The trick is going to be
our energy signature.

466
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,010
<i>Voyager's</i> too big to hide,

467
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,721
but a shuttlecraft with
the proper shield modulation

468
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,348
and its engines powered down

469
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,892
could drift right through
without so much as a peep.

470
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,229
Nice work, gentlemen.
Proceed.

471
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,398
The Doctor's genetic
resequencer

472
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,192
should keep her sedated
until you get back to the ship.

473
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,069
Once you've penetrated
the perimeter,

474
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,821
there will be no further
communication

475
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,407
with<i> Voyager.</i> 
You'll be on your own.

476
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,491
Captain, it is possible

477
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,744
that Seven will adapt
to the resequencer.

478
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,913
I know.

479
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,832
If it fails,

480
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,584
and you're unable
to reason with her...

481
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,088
you have my authorization
to stop her...

482
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,090
with any force necessary.

483
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,219
Understood.

484
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,189
BORG COLLECTIVE:
<i>Seven of Nine,</i>

485
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,816
<i>grid nine-two</i>
<i>of subjunction 12.</i>

486
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,362
( raven shrieking in distance )
<i>You will be assimilated.</i>

487
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,697
( console beeping )

488
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,922
B'OMAR:
<i>Borg drone, you have committed</i>

489
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:53,511
<i>an infraction</i>
<i>against the B'omar Sovereignty.</i>

490
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:57,639
Cut power to your engines
and lower your shields.

491
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,683
Prepare to be boarded.

492
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,018
( alarm blaring )

493
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,104
You will proceed no further.

494
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,023
We will not...

495
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,908
I'm detecting weapon
signatures...

496
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,327
Federation and B'omar.

497
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:22,456
Five B'omar vessels
are adrift, heavily damaged.

498
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,582
Life signs are stable.

499
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,293
I've located
Seven's shuttle.

500
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,712
It's 2.5 million
kilometers from here.

501
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,340
Adjust course
to intercept.

502
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,805
The implants in Seven's body

503
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,474
are disrupting
the transporter signal.

504
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,017
I can't get a lock.

505
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,103
See if you can remodulate
our transporters

506
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,896
to match her shields.

507
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,148
You want to beam
in there?

508
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,942
Yes.

509
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,819
I don't think
that's such a good idea, Tuvok.

510
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,155
Close quarters,
Borg against Vulcan?

511
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,366
No offense, but you
don't stand a chance

512
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,867
if she decides
to put up a fight.

513
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,744
It's my hope
that the element of surprise

514
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,246
will work in my favor.

515
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,458
Do you have a better idea?

516
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,545
Come to think of it, no.

517
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,089
( alarm beeps )

518
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,591
She's charging weapons.

519
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,510
Set my coordinates
for the aft compartment.

520
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,305
Ready.
Energize.

521
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,908
Come on, Tuvok.
Give me a sign.

522
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,420
COMPUTER:<i> Warning. Propulsion</i>
<i>systems are off-line.</i>

523
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,172
Damn!

524
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,734
That's a level-5
force field, Lieutenant.

525
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,279
I suggest you be
more careful.

526
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,073
Why have you
left<i> Voyager?</i>

527
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,118
I am Borg.

528
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,913
You were Borg...
but you're human now.

529
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,375
You are part
of our crew.

530
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,965
For a brief time,
I was human.

531
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,844
But I have come to realize
that I am Borg.

532
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,264
I will always be Borg.

533
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,642
What prompted this realization?

534
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:51,355
Every Borg ship is coded to emit
a distinct resonance frequency

535
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,358
to guide drones who have become
separated from the collective.

536
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,901
A homing beacon.

537
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,070
Yes.

538
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,155
I am following a signal.

539
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,825
A Borg vessel is waiting for me.

540
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,079
We've scanned
this entire region for Borg.

541
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,914
There are none.

542
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,957
You're wrong.

543
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,378
They are here.

544
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,595
Vulcan.

545
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,431
Species 3259.

546
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,932
Your enlarged neocortex

547
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,727
produces superior
analytical abilities.

548
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,731
Your distinctiveness
will be added to our...

549
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,149
Seven?

550
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,490
No.

551
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,663
I will not assimilate you.

552
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,667
Once I have returned
to the collective,

553
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,544
you will go back to<i> Voyager</i>

554
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,338
and tell Captain Janeway
what's happened to me.

555
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,176
Thank her for her patience...

556
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,345
for her kindness.

557
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,598
Curious.

558
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,684
Your behavior
demonstrates

559
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,395
affection
and sentiment.

560
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:17,023
Traits of humanity.
Hardly Borg.

561
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,819
You have been
experiencing

562
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,072
hallucinations,
flashbacks?

563
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,532
Yes.

564
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,075
Does that usually occur

565
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,286
when a resonance signal
is activated?

566
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,706
No.

567
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,750
COLLECTIVE:
<i>Seven of Nine,</i>

568
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,504
<i>grid nine-two</i>
<i>of subjunction 12.</i>

569
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,922
But I can hear them...

570
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,842
calling me.

571
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,803
I'm frightened.

572
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,013
That's understandable.

573
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,056
Lower the force field.

574
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,891
We can return
to<i> Voyager</i>

575
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,687
and find out what's
happening to you.

576
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,814
I am your shipmate.

577
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:00,025
We can return to<i> Voyager</i> 
together.

578
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,030
I must rejoin the collective.

579
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,079
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

580
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,208
<i>I've been trying to retrace</i>
<i>Seven of Nine's footsteps--</i>

581
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,877
<i>her actions</i>
<i>during the last few days--</i>

582
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,253
<i>but I'm still no closer</i>

583
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,506
<i>to understanding</i>
<i>what's happened.</i>

584
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,887
Captain?

585
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,681
Am I disturbing you?

586
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,932
Not at all, Harry.

587
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,061
I've managed to decipher
Seven's log entries.

588
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,606
And...?

589
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,940
There's nothing
that indicates

590
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,484
she was planning
to leave the ship.

591
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,737
The entries are
pretty unremarkable.

592
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,613
She describes
her daily routines,

593
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,281
the number of hours
spent regenerating,

594
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,616
that sort of thing.

595
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,284
There were some
personal log entries,

596
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,871
mostly observations
about the crew's behavior.

597
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:56,915
I'm mentioned
in quite a few of them.

598
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,335
Apparently, she finds
my behavior easy to predict,

599
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,670
whatever that means.

600
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,171
Don't take it personally.

601
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,382
Coming from Seven,
that's probably a compliment.

602
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,885
( chuckles )

603
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,763
Uh, the most recent entries
are kind of strange.

604
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,182
Descriptions of
bizarre images,

605
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,934
almost like a record
of her dreams.

606
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,395
The hallucinations?
Maybe so.

607
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,397
Sometimes she's
in a Borg vessel

608
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:23,066
running... or hiding
behind a bulkhead,

609
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,610
falling down a shaft.

610
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,528
Borg everywhere,
chasing her.

611
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,821
Nightmarish stuff.

612
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,406
What about this... bird?

613
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,283
She mentions it
several times.

614
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,326
It flies at her,
shrieking.

615
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,828
I don't know
what it means.

616
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,663
"The feathers are black.

617
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,666
"Wingspan approximately
one half meter.

618
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,585
"The eyes are yellow

619
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,797
"and it has a powerful
triangular beak.

620
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,632
"When it looks at me...

621
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,469
"I am paralyzed.

622
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,430
"I cannot move.

623
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,015
"It seems to know me,

624
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,853
"but I don't understand
how that's possible.

625
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,522
"It's merely a bird,

626
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,318
an inferior form of life,

627
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:11,114
but the sight of it
fills me with fear."

628
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,075
It sounds like she's describing
a member of the...

629
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,704
Corvidae family,
like a crow or...

630
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,710
( whispers )
Or a raven.

631
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,632
She's describing a raven.

632
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,717
Why is that important?

633
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,720
Because now I know
what to look for.

634
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,434
Chakotay, calibrate
our long-range sensors

635
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,603
to scan for
any Federation signature

636
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,104
other than
our two shuttlecraft.

637
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,731
Captain?
Do it.

638
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,358
Bring the ship about, Ensign,

639
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,361
and lay in a course
for B'omar space.

640
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,821
Aye, Captain.

641
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:07,045
The resonance signal is coming
from the lunar surface.

642
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,010
The Borg are waiting
for me there.

643
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,555
I don't know
why I'm frightened.

644
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,931
They are my people.

645
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,226
If you are afraid,
then leave this place.

646
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,436
Once I have been reintegrated
into the collective,

647
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,146
my fears will disappear.

648
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,942
Deactivate the force field.

649
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,778
I will accompany you
to the surface.

650
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,031
You don't need
to go alone.

651
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,870
You would be assimilated.

652
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,663
I don't believe so.

653
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,123
I think the situation
is not what it appears.

654
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,084
What do you mean?
What else could it be?

655
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,045
I am uncertain,
but I am willing

656
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,839
to go with you to the surface
to find out.

657
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,642
JANEWAY:
Voyager<i> to Paris.</i>

658
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,436
Paris here, Captain.

659
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,646
Glad to hear your voice.

660
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,523
Tuvok is with Seven of Nine.

661
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,234
I haven't been able to establish
communication with him

662
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,653
since he transported
to her shuttle.

663
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,155
I've tracked them
to an M-Class moon

664
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,951
orbiting the fifth planet
of a yellow dwarf star.

665
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,411
<i>I'm picking up</i>
<i>an unusual resonance signal</i>

666
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,329
<i>from the surface--</i>
<i>it's erratic.</i>

667
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,498
<i>I haven't been able</i>
<i>to identify it.</i>

668
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,084
Acknowledged.

669
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,002
We've detected
several B'omar ships

670
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,088
closing in on your position.

671
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,672
What's your condition?

672
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,132
<i>Warp engines are off-line.</i>

673
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,968
Shields are
at 50 percent.

674
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,887
JANEWAY:
<i>Try to locate them, Tom.</i>
<i>We're on our way.</i>

675
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,727
( tricorder beeping )

676
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,437
The signal's
getting stronger.

677
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,355
They're here.
I'm sure of it.

678
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,483
This way.

679
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,615
If you wish, we can return
to the shuttle.

680
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,787
No. I have
to find out.

681
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,549
What is it?

682
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,677
TUVOK: It's a Federation
vessel,

683
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,971
partially assimilated
by the Borg.

684
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,973
There are
no life signs.

685
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,891
Tritanium decay
suggests

686
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,268
it has been here
for nearly 20 years.

687
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,830
This vessel is familiar.

688
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:57,632
( repetitive buzzing beeps )

689
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,848
This is the signal
that's drawn me here.

690
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,103
( beeps stop )

691
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,358
Annika!

692
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,738
WOMAN:
Run, Annika!

693
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,199
Run! Hide!

694
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,000
Papa?

695
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,920
Help me.

696
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,217
( gasps, then whimpers )

697
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,556
No! No!

698
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,852
Seven, I'm here.

699
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,771
Listen to me.

700
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,651
Come.

701
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,376
It happened here.

702
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,837
This is where it began.

703
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,257
This is where
I was assimilated.

704
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,759
( sighs )

705
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,562
This was our ship.

706
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,067
We lived here.

707
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,321
We lived here for a long time.

708
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,660
My father did experiments.

709
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,995
They were very important

710
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:53,539
and we had to travel
a long way.

711
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,129
I had my birthday here.

712
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,634
My cake had
six candles on it and...

713
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,596
and one more to grow on.

714
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,352
And then the men came.

715
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:20,358
Papa tried to fight them,
but they were too strong.

716
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,530
I tried to hide.

717
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,701
Maybe they wouldn't find me
because I was little.

718
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,619
But they did.

719
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,708
And then Papa said
we were going to crash

720
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,170
and... the big man
picked me up...

721
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,174
and then suddenly,
we weren't on this ship anymore.

722
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,967
We were somewhere else.

723
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,809
And then I became Borg.

724
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,854
Fascinating.

725
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,605
This resonance signal
must have been active

726
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,149
since the ship
was assimilated

727
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:05,403
and<i> Voyager</i> passed
within range.

728
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,446
The ship is under attack.

729
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,657
The B'omar.

730
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,076
The ship will collapse.

731
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,203
We must get out of here.

732
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,342
The B'omar still
aren't responding to our hails.

733
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,927
CHAKOTAY:
Standing by to fire.

734
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,845
Target their weapon systems.

735
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,889
Tom, what's your status?

736
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,515
<i>I've located Tuvok and Seven,</i>

737
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,142
<i>but there's a lot</i>
<i>of interference.</i>

738
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,644
I'm attempting
to lock onto them now, Captain.

739
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,900
This way!

740
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,119
( grunts )

741
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,210
Are you all right?

742
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,170
I am undamaged.

743
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,174
This was the only
way to the hatch.

744
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,509
Perhaps there is
another way out.

745
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,764
There's a hull rupture
in the forward compartment.

746
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,933
It may provide
a means of escape.

747
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,737
Start digging.

748
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,077
Quickly!

749
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,294
We've disabled
two of their ships.

750
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:46,087
The third is still
firing at the surface.

751
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:49,632
We're being hailed,
audio only.

752
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,969
GAUMAN:<i> You're committing</i>
<i>an act of war, Captain.</i>

753
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,263
You've left me no choice,
Councilor.

754
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,475
<i>Reinforcements are arriving.</i>
<i>You will be destroyed...</i>

755
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,935
I don't have time for this.
Target their weapons array.

756
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,522
Seven,
I need your help!

757
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,136
PARIS:
<i>I've got them, Captain.</i>

758
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,888
<i>We're on our way back</i>
<i>to</i> Voyager.

759
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:41,893
Acknowledged. Good work.

760
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,479
I'm detecting a fleet
of B'omar vessels approaching.

761
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,105
68 ships.

762
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,608
Ensign, as soon as
Mr. Paris's shuttle has docked,

763
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,570
take us out of B'omar space.
Warp 8.

764
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,239
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.

765
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:59,618
Looks like there won't be
any shortcuts this time.

766
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,765
There you are.

767
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,683
I wanted to tell you
that the Doctor said

768
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,186
he could adjust
one of your implants

769
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:28,398
so that you won't receive
any more homing signals.

770
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,857
Thank you.

771
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,025
I hope you don't mind

772
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,818
that I activated
this program.

773
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,820
Not at all.

774
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,451
I've been thinking
about what you said...

775
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:43,662
that this was a place
to encourage your imagination.

776
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,915
Is that appealing
to you?

777
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,002
I'm not certain.

778
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,093
I find myself...
constructing scenarios,

779
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:01,264
considering alternative
possibilities.

780
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:04,142
What if my parents and I
had not encountered the Borg?

781
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,352
What would our lives
have been?

782
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:12,358
I would have been raised
by them, learned from them.

783
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,611
They would have influenced
what I became--

784
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,404
who and what I am.

785
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,823
And you...

786
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,619
would have done
the same for them.

787
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,787
If you'd like to know
more about your parents,

788
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,832
there's information
in the Federation database.

789
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,459
Information?

790
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:32,878
It seems they were
fairly well-known.

791
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,922
For being unconventional,

792
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:39,385
and for some rather unique
scientific theories.

793
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,513
You might like to read
what's there.

794
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,389
It might...

795
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,933
encourage
your imagination.

796
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,187
Perhaps I will.

797
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,231
Someday.

798
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,277
Good night, Captain.

799
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,950
( holodeck door opens, closes )

800
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,711
