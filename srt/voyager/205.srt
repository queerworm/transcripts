1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,170
JANEWAY:
Voyager<i> to Shuttlecraft</i> Drake.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,047
<i>Prepare for</i>
<i>emergency transport.</i>

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,466
<i>Mr. Kim, can you hear me?</i>

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,301
<i>We're attempting</i>
<i>to lock onto you.</i>

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,637
<i>Harry?</i>

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,054
WOMAN:
Harry?

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,684
Hey, it's time to wake up.

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,397
What's wrong?

9
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,235
Libby...

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,779
Yes?

11
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,487
This can't be happening.

12
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,991
What's wrong with you?

13
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,164
Libby, it's really
you, isn't it?

14
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,336
Come on. You're going
to be late.

15
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,545
What?

16
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,966
You have a meeting.
0900, remember?

17
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,051
You've only been obsessing
about it for a week.

18
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,803
I don't want
Lieutenant Lasca blaming me

19
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,178
because you weren't on time

20
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,848
for the biggest meeting
of your career.

21
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,934
Now, get dressed and I'll
make you some breakfast.

22
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,651
Come on.
The eggs are getting cold.

23
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,114
What's with you today?

24
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,160
The date.
What's the date?

25
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,452
The date?

26
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,079
What day is today?

27
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,956
49011.

28
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,168
So this isn't the past,
it's the present.

29
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,212
San Francisco.

30
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,466
This can't be a dream.

31
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,178
It's too... real.

32
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,847
It's too clear.

33
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,099
So what does that leave?

34
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,643
A holodeck?

35
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,853
A hallucination?

36
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,647
Some kind of trick?

37
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,315
The last thing I
remember was piloting

38
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,693
a shuttlecraft
on my way back to<i> Voyager.</i>

39
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,653
We have a long day ahead of us.

40
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,073
Could we play this little game
another time, please?

41
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,992
No...

42
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,870
you can't be Libby.

43
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,454
It's not possible.

44
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,043
My name is
Ensign Harry Kim

45
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,503
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

46
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,671
Where am I?

47
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,297
Is this some sort
of simulation?

48
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,591
That's not
funny, Harry.

49
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,843
Talking about
<i>Voyager</i> like that.

50
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,679
The memorial service was
only two months ago.

51
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,931
Danny was your
best friend.

52
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,766
How could you joke
about that?

53
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,144
Danny... Danny Byrd?

54
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,439
I'm done with
this conversation.

55
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,857
Go to work.

56
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,316
I'll see you
tonight.

57
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,867
What is going on?

58
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,239
MAN:
Harry!

59
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,784
Coming right up.

60
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,169
Here you go.

61
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,837
Vulcan mocha,
extra sweet.

62
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,046
Thanks.

63
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,465
So, today's
the big day, huh?

64
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,758
What do you mean?

65
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,635
You know, the meeting.

66
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,304
The new ship
you're designing.

67
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,848
And don't forget, you promised
to bring me a model.

68
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,058
And I'm going to hang it
right there in my window

69
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,226
and I'll tell everyone

70
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,145
"Harry Kim,
he designed that ship.

71
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,023
He came into my shop
every morning."

72
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,318
Look, I know this is going
to sound a little funny

73
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,569
but how long have I been
coming to this coffee shop?

74
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,904
How long?

75
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,698
Well, let's see.
Since you left the academy.

76
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,325
How long is that?
Eight... eight months.

77
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,909
Eight months?

78
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,329
And you've seen me every day?

79
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,081
Well, not<i> every</i> day.

80
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,875
You like to sleep
late on Sunday.

81
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,127
But if had your fiancée,
I'd sleep late too.

82
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,461
Fiancée?

83
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,838
We're getting married?

84
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,175
Ahh, yes. There were
many mornings I woke up

85
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,220
I said the same thing to myself
when I was about to be married

86
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,305
but don't worry. It will pass.

87
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,017
I don't think you've ever had
a morning quite like this one.

88
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,644
Hey, Harry! You ready to go?

89
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,022
Um... where?

90
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,606
Very funny. Come on.

91
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,317
We better get moving
if we're going to catch

92
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,693
the transport
to headquarters.

93
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,778
I'm not sure I can go.

94
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,404
I'm not feeling very well.

95
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,656
Maybe I should just go home.

96
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,575
Come on, come on.

97
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,244
It's just a case
of the jitters.

98
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,661
You'll do just fine.

99
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,226
Relax, Harry.

100
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,896
If all goes well, you'll walk
out of this room a lieutenant.

101
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,607
Let me see that
warp coil schematic.

102
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,359
The what?

103
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,194
The coil diagram...

104
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,948
the one with the new
plasma flow equations.

105
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,908
I forgot
to bring it.

106
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,326
Forgot?

107
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,994
Harry, we need
that diagram to show

108
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,830
that we've worked out
the dilithium fracture problem.

109
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,292
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:42,421
Well, we'll just
have to improvise.

111
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,505
Good morning.

112
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,218
I have a meeting at 1100 with
the head of Starfleet Security.

113
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,929
She doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

114
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,347
Let's get this underway.

115
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,598
Lieutenant Lasca?

116
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,516
Thank you, admiral.

117
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,981
Ladies and gentlemen,

118
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,317
you are looking at
the new runabout<i> Yellowstone.</i>

119
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,610
It's equipped with
tetrion plasma warp nacelles

120
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,571
and designed for a variety
of mission profiles.

121
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,158
Yes, Lieutenant, I've looked
over your specifications.

122
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,162
It's an interesting design,
but how do you propose

123
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,373
to address the dilithium
fracture problem?

124
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,959
Tetrion plasma
tends to disrupt subspace.

125
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,295
LASCA:
I'm actually glad you
asked that question, sir.

126
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,505
We've been working on the
problem for several weeks

127
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,008
and I think you'll see
that we have found an answer.

128
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,550
I'd like to
introduce you

129
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,885
to the engineer
who designed

130
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,095
these new warp engines.

131
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,347
And, I might add,

132
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,015
he is the most promising
young engineer

133
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,725
to come out of the academy
in a long time.

134
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,769
Ensign Harry Kim.

135
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,034
Harry.

136
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,453
STRICKLER:
Is there a problem,
Ensign?

137
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,873
Actually, sir, there is.

138
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,047
Come on, Harry.
Pull it together.

139
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,466
We've been waiting
for this for six months.

140
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,092
Ensign, are you ill?

141
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,054
Yes, sir.

142
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,014
I'm very ill.

143
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,517
I would like to...

144
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,644
continue this presentation
at a later date.

145
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,397
Well, unfortunately, Ensign,

146
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,898
I'm leaving
for a three-week tour

147
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,150
of the Cardassian border
in a few days.

148
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,111
It will have to wait
until after then.

149
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,783
Harry... you better be dying.

150
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,275
I guess I'm pretty good.

151
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,665

00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,938
Harry.

182
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,899
What are you doing
back so early?

183
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,693
Oh. Hi.

184
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,070
I wasn't feeling too well,
so I decided to come home.

185
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,655
You don't look
sick to me.

186
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,657
Coming home for a little
visit with Libby, are we?

187
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,200
Ah, to be young.

188
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,826
Don't worry. I'll
keep your secret.

189
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,161
Thanks.

190
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,746
Listen, I know this is
going to sound strange

191
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,708
but I forgot to look
at the street number

192
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,376
when I left this morning

193
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,253
and I don't remember
which building I live in.

194
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,421
Could you...?

195
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,882
Tell you
where you live?

196
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,509
You're not playing
some kind of a prank

197
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,844
on your old pal
Cosimo, are you?

198
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,762
No. Like I said...

199
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,349
I haven't been
feeling well and...

200
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,684
everything's
kind of foggy.

201
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,893
Okay, okay, okay.

202
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,645
Well, you live
right over there--

203
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,147
fourth floor,
apartment 4-G.

204
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,066
Thanks.

205
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,443
Harry.

206
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,027
Don't look
so concerned.

207
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,154
Everything's
going to work out.

208
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,157
You have a wonderful job,
a beautiful fiancée.

209
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,492
Everything is
going to be fine.

210
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,744
Trust me.

211
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,704
Hmm?

212
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,884
(<i> door closes )</i>

213
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,802
LIBBY:
Hello? Who's there?

214
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,432
It's just me, Libby.

215
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,807
Harry?

216
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,103
Are you okay?

217
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,189
Yeah.

218
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,733
I'm fine.

219
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,278
You feel
a little warm.

220
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,821
God, you're tense.

221
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,824
Why don't you tell me
what happened today.

222
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,621
Nothing.

223
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,750
Everything.

224
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,587
I'm not sure
what happened.

225
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,550
Harry...
forget about work.

226
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,804
Try to relax.
You're home now.

227
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,973
What can I do to help?

228
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,814
Just...
tell me you love me.

229
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,357
(<i> chuckles</i> )

230
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,025
I tell you that
every day.

231
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,902
Aren't you getting
sick of hearing it?

232
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,155
No.

233
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,824
In fact...

234
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,327
pretend I haven't
heard you say it

235
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,580
in a long time.

236
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,292
Pretend that we haven't
seen each other for months.

237
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,127
Okay.

238
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,841
I love you, Harry.

239
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,176
Welcome home.

240
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,847
So...

241
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,559
if we haven't seen
each other for months...

242
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,811
where have you been?

243
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,524
Oh...
on a starship.

244
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,651
Thousands of
light years away.

245
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,444
A mission?

246
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,071
Yeah.

247
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,782
We got a little lost.

248
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,492
Aww.

249
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,536
Sounds lonely.

250
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,998
You can't imagine.

251
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,417
Tell me something.

252
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,001
Hm?

253
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:23,964
You didn't stop at Risa
along the way, did you?

254
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,133
No.

255
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,555
No pleasure planet
excursions, I'm afraid.

256
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:35,810
You thought about me
the whole time?

257
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,687
Every day.

258
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,733
Every nanosecond.

259
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,111
Do me a favor.

260
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,154
Hm?

261
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,199
Don't ever
leave me again.

262
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,567
"Orlando, Parsons, Peterson,
Platt, Porter..."

263
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,444
Wait a minute-- Paris.

264
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,989
Where's Tom Paris?

265
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,490
Computer, access
service record

266
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,077
of Starfleet officer
Thomas Eugene Paris.

267
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,163
"Convicted of treason.

268
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,456
"Sentenced to 18 months

269
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,208
"at the New Zealand
penal settlement.

270
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,421
"Paroled on stardate 48702.

271
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:12,675
Last reported whereabouts:
Marseille, France."

272
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,343
Harry?

273
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,012
It's 4:00
in the morning.

274
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,263
What are you doing?

275
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,432
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

276
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,894
So I thought I'd
catch up on some work.

277
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,229
When are you
going to tell me

278
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,440
what's going on?

279
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,650
There's nothing going on, okay?

280
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,361
You're not a very good liar,
Harry.

281
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,989
You've been acting strange
all day

282
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,658
and I'm not the only one
who's worried about you.

283
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,244
Lieutenant Lasca called
this afternoon.

284
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,162
He said he's never
seen you so agitated.

285
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,875
So don't tell me there's
nothing going on.

286
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,252
Libby...

287
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,505
it's hard to
explain right now

288
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,927
and I do want to tell you,
but I need you to trust me.

289
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,971
I do trust you.

290
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,513
I love you.

291
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,265
That's why
I'm marrying you.

292
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,018
I would hope you would
have the same trust in me.

293
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,814
All right.

294
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,108
This...

295
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,985
this is going to sound
a little crazy

296
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,736
from your perspective

297
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,572
but I am not who
you think I am.

298
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,907
Oh?

299
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,199
All of this--

300
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,078
it's not supposed
to be happening.

301
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,871
I don't belong here.

302
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,042
If you're having
second thoughts

303
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,004
about getting married,
why didn't you just say so?

304
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,296
You don't understand.

305
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,008
What I'm trying to say is...

306
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,846
I'm from another reality.

307
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,931
Another reality?

308
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,642
That's right.

309
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,853
Harry, you're starting
to scare me.

310
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,479
I know.
I'm scared too.

311
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,065
Maybe you should talk
to a counselor...

312
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,358
a neurologist.

313
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,360
There may be something
wrong with you.

314
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,778
I will.

315
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,280
But there's someone else
I need to see first.

316
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,282
Where are
you going?

317
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,701
Marseille, France.

318
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,536
What for?

319
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,829
I've got to see Paris.

320
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,413
But, you just said...

321
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,249
you were going
to Marseille.

322
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,085
It's a long story.

323
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,422
Trust me.

324
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,757
Okay?

325
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,302
Okay.

326
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,375
MAN:
Hey, watch it, will you?

327
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,627
I'm trying to set up
a shot here.

328
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,296
Tom.

329
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,340
Who the hell are you?

330
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,431
You don't know
me, do you?

331
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,851
Sure. We were at the academy
together, right?

332
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,186
No.

333
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,232
Oh. Well, it must
have been the<i> Exeter.</i>

334
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,483
We served on
the<i> Exeter</i> together?

335
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,028
Try<i> Voyager.</i>

336
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,655
Ah...<i> Voyager.</i>

337
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,953
Well, sorry to disappoint
you, but...

338
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,084
...I never set foot
on that ship.

339
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,835
I can't say that I'm sorry

340
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,463
considering what
happened to it.

341
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,339
You know about the mission
to the badlands?

342
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,425
Oh, yeah.

343
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,510
Captain Janeway asked if

344
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,805
I'd help her track down
that Maquis ship

345
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,475
in exchange for an early
release from the penal colony.

346
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,310
But you said no?

347
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,980
Are you kidding?
I said yes.

348
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,150
Sounded better than
Starfleet rehab.

349
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,737
Anyway, I got as far

350
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:06,117
as Deep Space Nine, where I got
into a bar fight with a Ferengi

351
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,409
and I was thrown
into the brig

352
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,955
by a very unpleasant
shapeshifter.

353
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,915
Janeway tried
to get me released

354
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,502
but my parole was revoked
by Starfleet Command.

355
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,174
<i>Voyager</i> left without me.

356
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,849
That Ferengi, was he trying
to sell you Lobi crystals?

357
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,936
Yeah.

358
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,065
How do you know
about that?

359
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,067
Because I was there--

360
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,153
In my reality, anyway.

361
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,865
Tom, I know this is going
to sound crazy,

362
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,909
but I was on<i> Voyager,</i>
and so were you.

363
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,369
You never got into a bar
fight with that Ferengi.

364
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,706
You stopped him from
selling me Lobi crystals.

365
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,916
And you did lead us
into the badlands.

366
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,253
You're right.
That does sound crazy.

367
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,214
Something's happened.

368
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,758
Somehow reality has
been changed--

369
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,635
a temporal anomaly,
an alien influence--

370
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,137
I can't explain how.

371
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,348
All I know is
that it's true.

372
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:14,101
I was in a shuttlecraft
heading back to<i> Voyager</i>

373
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,105
and then I woke up here,
on earth.

374
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,238
What is it you want?

375
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,740
Come with me to
Starfleet Headquarters.

376
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,700
Help me run
a computer simulation

377
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,119
of what happened
on that shuttle.

378
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,412
You're the best pilot
I've ever seen.

379
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,041
And if anyone can
figure it out, it's you.

380
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,500
(<i> snickering</i> )

381
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,336
(<i> laughing</i> )

382
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,381
God...

383
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:47,051
You... you had me there
for a minute.

384
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,470
You really did,
but then you blew it.

385
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,390
What are you talking about?

386
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,766
You're not getting me

387
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,227
to set foot inside
Starfleet headquarters.

388
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,646
So you tell whatever admiral
or captain who sent you

389
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,065
that I'm not interested in

390
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,234
being another pawn in
one of their games.

391
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,526
It's not a game!

392
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,362
Oh, it isn't?

393
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,614
Oh, that's a shame.

394
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,366
I like games.

395
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,660
You once told me

396
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,330
that you used to treat life
like one big game--

397
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,626
Rules, players.
Winners, losers.

398
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,045
You never took
any of it seriously

399
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,005
until you lost.

400
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:29,135
You know, you're starting
to annoy me.

401
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,971
You also told me you were afraid
of what would happen to you

402
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,641
if you didn't take
Captain Janeway up on her offer.

403
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,560
Now I see why.

404
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,355
What do you see...

405
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,441
Ensign?

406
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:50,239
A loser...
and a drunk.

407
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,457
I guess in this reality

408
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,667
that's all you'll ever be.

409
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,909
What's going on?

410
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,786
Harry, just relax.

411
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,163
Why does everyone say relax

412
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,581
when they're about to do
something terrible?

413
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,376
Starfleet knows
what you've been doing.

414
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,461
Which is what, exactly?

415
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,545
Breaking into classified files

416
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,840
using forged
security access codes.

417
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,092
I haven't forged anything.

418
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,469
And I<i> can</i> explain.

419
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,137
That's why we're here.

420
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,973
We're going to take you back
to Starfleet Headquarters.

421
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,808
They want to ask you
a few questions.

422
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,769
Harry, please--
just go with them.

423
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,313
Tell them what
you told me.

424
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,316
Everything will be alright.

425
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,736
I don't think I have a choice
at the moment.

426
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,072
I'll see you later.

427
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,293
You claim to have<i> Voyager</i>
security protocols

428
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,421
because you were
an officer on<i> Voyager.</i>

429
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,671
Yes, sir.

430
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,299
Lost in the Delta Quadrant.

431
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,884
Yes, sir.

432
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,178
And Ensign Daniel Byrd--

433
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,680
you say that he's taken
your place on that ship?

434
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,015
Yes, sir.

435
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,270
And this is all because...

436
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,274
reality has been
changed somehow?

437
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,026
Yes, sir.

438
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,195
But you don't have
a single shred of evidence

439
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,613
to back up
your claims.

440
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,158
(<i> door opens</i> )

441
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,619
Harry, I don't
doubt for a minute

442
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,956
that you believe you're
telling the truth

443
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,500
but we have to consider
all the possibilities.

444
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,001
Like what?

445
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,545
Like you could
be delusional

446
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,089
or you could have had your
memory centers altered

447
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,551
so that you think what
you're saying is the truth

448
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:19,012
or you could be an alien
masquerading as Harry Kim.

449
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,474
That's crazy.

450
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,767
I am Harry Kim.

451
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,727
Check my DNA
if you don't believe me.

452
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,396
Run a microcellular scan of

453
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,815
my cerebral cortex to see
my memory's been altered.

454
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,485
Everything
I'm saying is true.

455
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,403
Mr. Kim, why did you travel

456
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,156
to Marseille, France
this morning?

457
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,912
I went to look up an old friend.

458
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,248
You have
poor taste in friends.

459
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,666
Thomas Paris
is a convicted traitor

460
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,668
and a Maquis
sympathizer.

461
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,671
Now, what did you
talk about with him?

462
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,550
I tried to tell him
what's happened.

463
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,218
I wanted his help.

464
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,595
His help?

465
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,556
To run a shuttle simulation?

466
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,850
Why?

467
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,396
To figure out how I got here,
and how I can get back.

468
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,608
There must be temporal anomaly
somewhere, or...

469
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,863
You think I'm a spy, don't you?

470
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,157
You think I'm working
for the Maquis.

471
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,409
We're here to find
the truth, Ensign.

472
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,077
whatever that might be.

473
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,787
That's it.

474
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,498
I'm not answering
any more questions

475
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,249
until I have legal counsel.

476
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,043
You have that right.

477
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:35,172
Harry, we want to help you,
but try to understand.

478
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,258
What you are telling us
doesn't make much sense.

479
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,553
All we know so far is
that you have been seen

480
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,596
talking with a
Maquis criminal

481
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,599
and you've broken into
classified Starfleet records.

482
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,562
Until there is something else--
something concrete

483
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,480
those are the fact
in this case

484
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,192
and you have to admit
the facts look pretty bad.

485
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,280
STRICKLER:
We will be monitoring
your movements

486
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,865
until further notice.

487
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,950
I believe you know
the restrictions.

488
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,411
No off-world travel,

489
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:06,745
and if you tamper
with the anklet

490
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,455
security will be
immediately alerted

491
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,790
and you will be
formally charged.

492
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,292
Do you understand?

493
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,422
Yes, admiral.

494
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,802
We'll be spending a lot
time together, Ensign,

495
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,012
and I assure you,

496
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,432
we will get
to the bottom of this.

497
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,766
You're dismissed.

498
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,345
Troubles, Harry?

499
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,973
You could say that.

500
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,767
Let's have some coffee.

501
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,813
I was sent here to watch you--

502
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,857
to make sure
that you were all right.

503
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,568
But now it's clear
that you are not.

504
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,903
Who are you?

505
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,906
We exist in what
you would call

506
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,285
a temporal inversion fold
in the space-time matrix.

507
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,287
It's not necessary
to understand.

508
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,748
It only matters that
there was an accident.

509
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,793
Your shuttle intersected
one of our time-streams

510
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,504
and... boom!

511
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,713
A few things were altered

512
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,131
as the result
of the accident.

513
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:44,092
History and events
were scrambled a bit

514
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,969
and you ended up here.

515
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,638
Well, you've got
to get me back.

516
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:51,684
Ah...
we don't know how.

517
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,226
What?

518
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,021
We only know that
an accident occurred.

519
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,398
We don't know how or why.

520
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,734
Well, that's not good enough.

521
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,153
There's got to be
something we can do.

522
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,988
Where is this
time-stream of yours?

523
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,865
Maybe I can use it to get back.

524
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,575
Mmm...

525
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,911
the time-stream weaves through
the galaxy like a thread.

526
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,331
I could show you how to find it
and you could try to recreate

527
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,625
the conditions that existed
before the accident

528
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,503
and fly back into it,
but there's no guarantee

529
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,920
what will happen to you
if you do.

530
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,381
What do you mean?

531
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,258
Well, you may be able
to change reality again

532
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,679
but there's no way to predict
<i>how</i> it would change.

533
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,807
You could end up at any point
in the space-time continuum.

534
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,100
You might return to
your original reality

535
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,811
or you might
find yourself

536
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,646
a billion years in the future

537
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,440
or at some time
before sentient life

538
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,775
even existed on your planet.

539
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,820
I guess I'll have
to take that chance

540
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,198
because somehow
I have to get back.

541
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,077
Are you so sure?

542
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,246
This is a pretty good
place for you, Harry.

543
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,456
You have a wonderful
job with Starfleet,

544
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,084
a beautiful woman
who loves you.

545
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,254
Why be so quick to turn your
back on all this?

546
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,091
Maybe this is your... fate?

547
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,676
Isn't that the word
your people use?

548
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,220
That thing which
was meant to be? Hmm?

549
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,849
Seems to me you're
actually a very lucky man.

550
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,396
What about Danny Byrd?

551
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,231
He isn't so lucky.

552
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,734
And Tom Paris?

553
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,445
Fate wasn't so kind to him.

554
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,406
No.

555
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,617
It isn't supposed
to be this way.

556
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,535
I'm supposed to be on<i> Voyager</i>

557
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,120
in the Delta Quadrant,

558
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,123
and that's where
I have to go.

559
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,879
Very well.

560
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,508
This will tell you
where the time-stream

561
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,177
intersects this
region of space.

562
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,263
That's as much
as I can do for you.

563
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,182
Thanks.

564
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,061
Good luck,

565
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,688
Harry Kim of<i> Voyager.</i>

566
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,273
You're going to need it.

567
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,901
Unless, of course,
you decide to stay.

568
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:09,112
In which case I'll see you
in the morning, same time--

569
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,574
Vulcan mocha, extra sweet.

570
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,159
(<i> chuckling</i> )

571
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,015
Libby...

572
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,558
I didn't hear you come in.

573
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,768
Obviously.

574
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,353
You're in enough trouble
as it is.

575
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,313
What do you want them to do,
put you in prison?

576
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,732
No.

577
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,276
I'm just trying to get back
to where I belong.

578
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,863
Where you belong.

579
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:53,448
You used to say you
belonged here with me.

580
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,661
But I guess everything's
changed, hasn't it?

581
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,037
Look...

582
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,917
I know the last few days

583
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,418
must have been pretty
tough on you--

584
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,628
Do you?!

585
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,338
Do you really know
what it's like

586
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:12,175
when the person you love
suddenly changes?

587
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,970
It's still me--
the guy who was

588
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,806
in your seat at
the Ktarian music festival.

589
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,516
The guy who took three weeks

590
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,101
to work up the courage
to ask you out.

591
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,856
The guy who still wakes up
in the middle of the night

592
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:29,568
and says your name out loud
hoping you'll answer back.

593
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,362
But if you're really Harry,

594
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,113
you wouldn't
be trying so hard

595
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,448
to get away from me.

596
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,743
I'm not trying
to get away from you.

597
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,203
I love you.

598
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:46,710
And I promise you I want to stay
here more than anything.

599
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,504
But I can't.

600
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,882
I don't understand.

601
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,175
I don't understand any of this.

602
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,556
I don't think
anybody knows me

603
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,808
as well as you do.

604
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,185
So you of all
people should know

605
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,563
that once I've made up
my mind about something

606
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,981
I can't let it go.

607
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,193
In some ways...

608
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,654
it'd be a lot easier
to forget about<i> Voyager</i>

609
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,575
just settle in here
and build a life...

610
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,202
but that wouldn't be me.

611
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,082
You wouldn't be
getting the Harry Kim

612
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,541
you fell in love with.

613
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,839
Does that make any sense?

614
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,674
(<i> beeping</i> )

615
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,259
The tampering alarm.

616
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,344
Security will be
here any second.

617
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,931
I'd better go.

618
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,225
I promise you, I'm going
to try to get back.

619
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,852
It may take a while

620
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:50,523
and I may not make it,
but I swear I will try.

621
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,787
Sorry.

622
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,838
(<i> grunting</i> )

623
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,344
(<i> grunting</i> )

624
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,146
Hold it!

625
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:00,552
Get up!

626
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,721
PARIS:
Excuse me.

627
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,975
There goes my bank shot.

628
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,727
What are you doing here?

629
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,520
Helping out a friend.

630
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,022
Let's go.

631
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,865
So how did you find me?

632
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,700
I still have a few
friends at Starfleet.

633
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,451
They told me you were
in some serious trouble.

634
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,205
Yeah. Starfleet thinks
I'm a Maquis spy.

635
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,664
I know the feeling.

636
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,834
Those security anklets
really chafe, don't they?

637
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,170
You're the last person
I expected to help me.

638
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,880
Let's just say
it's been a long time

639
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,299
since anybody gave a damn
about my future, including me.

640
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,510
I don't know if I'm
supposed to be on<i> Voyager</i>

641
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,179
like you've told me.

642
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,514
But it sounds a whole lot better
than the life I have here.

643
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,267
I'm willing to take
my chances, Ensign.

644
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,269
Call me Harry.

645
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,979
You always did.

646
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,689
It won't be long
before they find us.

647
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,149
We'd better keep moving.

648
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,693
Wait, I found a way to
get back to my reality.

649
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,029
The problem is I'll need
a ship to do it.

650
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,864
I think I have access
to a runabout,

651
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,075
but I'm going to have to break
it out of spacedock.

652
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,619
Sounds to me like
you need a pilot.

653
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,328
Know anyone who's qualified?

654
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,039
I know someone who used
to be pretty good

655
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,332
and if I'm not mistaken,
he still knows a few tricks.

656
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,252
I have an office at
Starfleet headquarters.

657
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,544
I think we can access

658
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,255
the runabout launch codes
from there.

659
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,631
Site-to-site
transporter.

660
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,924
With friends like mine,

661
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,508
you never know when
it'll come in handy.

662
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,718
Where's your office?

663
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,013
Main complex, level 6,
subsection 47.

664
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,016
I can beam us in, but we'll
only have a few minutes

665
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,102
before security starts
kicking down the door.

666
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,728
Let's do it.

667
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,487
So, Harry, once we're
on board the runabout,

668
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,655
what's the plan?

669
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,990
The alien said that
if I recreate

670
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,283
the conditions
of the accident

671
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,034
and fly into
the time-stream,

672
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,411
there's a chance I might be able
to get back into my reality.

673
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,663
Might?

674
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,539
He couldn't give me
any guarantees.

675
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,083
Security's just been alerted

676
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,002
to an unauthorized transport
in the building.

677
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,419
It'll take them another
20 seconds

678
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,712
to track it to this office.

679
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,839
How are you coming?

680
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,423
Almost there.
I've bypassed

681
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,967
the runabout
security lock-outs.

682
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,636
They're onto us.
We got to go.

683
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,929
Hold on. I've almost got it.

684
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,182
Now!

685
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,649
Overriding
initialization codes.

686
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,442
Main power
coming on-line.

687
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,361
Let's get
those engines going.

688
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,905
Powering up
main fusion reactor.

689
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,740
COMPUTER:
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

690
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,160
<i>Unauthorized launch</i>
<i>in progress.</i>

691
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,911
The space door is closing.

692
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,706
Warp core and main
propulsion are on-line.

693
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,750
Releasing docking clamps,
moorings cleared.

694
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,211
Here we go.

695
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,720
We're clear.

696
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,805
I'm entering
the coordinates

697
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,183
of the time-stream
into the main computer.

698
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:57,937
Adjusting course to match,
going to full impulse.

699
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,982
We've got a starship
on our tail, nebula class.

700
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,650
I'll try to lose them, Harry,

701
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,236
but they're a lot faster
than we are.

702
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,404
MAN:
<i>Attention runabout</i> Yellowstone.

703
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,116
<i>Power down your engines</i>
<i>or we will open fire.</i>

704
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,660
They're going to try to do
everything they can to stop us.

705
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,871
They think we're trying
to steal this prototype.

706
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,290
They're closing
to 5,000 kilometers.

707
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,839
Shields down to 70%.

708
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,800
50%.

709
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,302
29%.

710
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,263
I thought you said this ship
was new and improved.

711
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,764
It is.

712
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,724
But it looks like they haven't
finished working on

713
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,351
the defensive systems.
In fact,

714
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,395
some of the safety interlocks
aren't even in place.

715
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,355
A few more of those hits
and I don't--

716
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,524
We're losing
antimatter containment.

717
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,193
Attempting to
stabilize the field.

718
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,737
We're approaching the
coordinates of the time-stream.

719
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,241
The containment field
is weakening.

720
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,825
We could be looking
at a core breach.

721
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,536
The ship's closing
to 3,000 kilometers.

722
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,205
If we can't
shake them off,

723
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,915
maybe we can slow
them down a little.

724
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,166
This runabout
is equipped with

725
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,960
tetrion plasma warp nacelles.
So?

726
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,088
Tetrion plasma emits
multiflux gamma radiation.

727
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,048
It disrupts subspace.

728
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,217
We could vent
the warp plasma.

729
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,760
The second they hit
the plasma cloud,

730
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,178
their engines would stall,

731
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,139
It would give us a few seconds
of breathing room.

732
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,307
Exactly.

733
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,849
Unlocking the warp
drive manifold.

734
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,810
Venting drive plasma.

735
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,276
Any second...

736
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,488
They've dropped
to one-tenth impulse.

737
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,452
Our containment field's
at critical.

738
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,953
We'd better hurry.

739
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,497
All right, let's recreate
my shuttle accident.

740
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,292
I think I was traveling
at 140,000 KPH.

741
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,876
You think?

742
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,129
Look, that was another lifetime.
I'm doing the best I can.

743
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:49,382
Increasing speed
to 140,000 KPH.

744
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:52,551
Now, I also remember
running a polaron scan.

745
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,346
The scanning beam
was sweeping at a radius

746
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,514
of half a million
kilometers.

747
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,599
No, wait...
a quarter million.

748
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,688
Activating polaron scan.

749
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,482
That should do it.

750
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:06,941
Approaching coordinates.

751
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,485
Impact in four...

752
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:09,694
three...

753
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,029
two...

754
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,616
Did we miss it?

755
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,160
We passed through
the coordinates,

756
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,745
but the runabout
was unaffected.

757
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,622
The starship
has repowered its engines.

758
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,708
They'll be here
in under a minute.

759
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,877
I have to get into
that time-stream.

760
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,295
Wait a minute.

761
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,630
I'm forgetting something.

762
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,632
The emergency transport.

763
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,925
The last thing
I remember hearing

764
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,094
was Captain Janeway's
com voice.

765
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,305
She said she was trying to beam
me off the shuttle.

766
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,931
That's it. I've got
to beam off the ship.

767
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,183
Are you crazy?

768
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,600
We have to recreate
all the conditions

769
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,229
of the accident--
including that one.

770
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,147
We just lost
antimatter containment.

771
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,773
25 seconds
to core breach.

772
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,317
I've locked onto
the time-stream.

773
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,568
Get on the
transporter pad.

774
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,819
Not yet, the core's breaching.

775
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,196
We've got to shut
it down first.

776
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,531
There's no time!

777
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,241
That ship'll be here
in another 30 seconds.

778
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,992
In 15 seconds, this ship
is going to explode.

779
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,618
You'll be killed.

780
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,871
Look, if you're right,
then things will be changed

781
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,331
back to the way they're
supposed to be,

782
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,916
and you'll find me
back on<i> Voyager.</i>

783
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,792
And if I'm wrong,
if this doesn't work

784
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,627
you'll be blown up
right here.

785
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,340
Go!

786
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,222
JANEWAY:
Voyager<i> to Shuttlecraft Drake.</i>

787
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,057
<i>Prepare</i>
<i>for emergency transport.</i>

788
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,683
<i>Mr. Kim, can you hear me?</i>

789
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,437
<i>We're attempting</i>
<i>to lock on to you... Harry?</i>

790
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:26,854
Kim here, captain.

791
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,898
<i>Harry, we need you</i>
<i>to drop your shields.</i>

792
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,983
Stand by.

793
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,069
<i>Shields down, captain.</i>

794
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,653
Lieutenant.

795
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,906
The anomaly is sending out
heavy subspace distortions.

796
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,450
I can't get
a positive lock on him.

797
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,701
The hull is starting
to buckle under the stress.

798
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,161
He won't survive much longer.

799
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,955
Tuvok, can you boost
the transporter signal?

800
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,124
Negative. The signal is
at maximum gain.

801
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,708
Ten seconds to hull breach.

802
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,043
He's just out
of reach.

803
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,628
B'elanna, can you tie
the transporter

804
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,338
directly into the main
deflector dish.

805
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,798
Use it to extend
the signal.

806
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,174
I'll try.

807
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,968
Hull breach in progress.

808
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,389
We've got him, Captain.

809
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,099
Mr. Chakotay,
analyze the sensor logs.

810
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,601
I want to know what
happened out there.

811
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:05,810
Aye, captain.

812
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,395
<i>Voyager</i> to
transporter room two.

813
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,813
Are you all right,
Mr. Kim?

814
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,440
KIM:
<i>I think so, captain.</i>

815
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,817
<i>Is Lieutenant Paris there?</i>

816
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,527
Yes, he's here. Why?

817
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,237
It's a long story.

818
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,863
I look forward
to hearing it.

819
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,865
I'll be in my ready room.

820
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,582
We think
your shuttlecraft

821
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,542
was caught in some kind
of temporal anomaly.

822
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,751
A time-stream?

823
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,878
Yes, you could
call it that.

824
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,713
I've already been
briefed, commander.

825
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,549
Welcome back.

826
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,759
Kind of a rough ride, huh?

827
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,972
What is it, Harry?

828
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,807
I owe you one.
