1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,589
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 48623.5.</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,802
<i>THERE ARE 246 ELEMENTS</i>
<i>KNOWN TO FEDERATION SCIENCE.</i>

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:13,096
<i>WE BELIEVE WE HAVE</i>
<i>JUST DISCOVERED THE 247th</i>

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:17,142
<i>INSIDE THE RING SYSTEM</i>
<i>OF A CLASS-D PLANET.</i>

5
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,645
THE ELEMENT HAS
AN UNUSUALLY LARGE ATOMIC MASS--

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,438
OVER 550 NUCLEONS.

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,648
AND THE RATINGS ARE CONSTANT.

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,483
THE ELEMENT APPEARS
TO BE STABLE.

9
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,319
A STABLE TRANSURANIC ELEMENT
INSIDE A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,863
THIS IS A FIRST.

11
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,698
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD
MAKE WITH THIS STUFF?

12
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,784
PROBE CASINGS THAT COULD GO INTO
THE CORE OF A SUN.

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,453
ULTRATHIN REACTOR SHIELDING.
THAT'S ASSUMING WE CAN MINE IT.

14
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,913
ENSIGN, TRY AND LOCATE

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,874
THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION
OF THE ELEMENT.

16
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,792
Kim:
THE ELEMENT IS PRESENT
IN MOST OF THE ASTEROIDS

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,335
THAT COMPRISE THE RINGS.

18
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,712
I CAN ISOLATE A SAMPLE
AND BEAM IT ABOARD.

19
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,254
OR BETTER YET,

20
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,882
MAYBE WE COULD GET A FIRST-HAND
LOOK AT THIS ELEMENT

21
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,717
IN ITS NATURAL
ENVIRONMENT.

22
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,927
IT LOOKS LIKE MOST
OF THESE ASTEROIDS

23
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,804
SUPPORT CLASS-M
ATMOSPHERES.

24
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,390
GOOD IDEA. COMMANDER,
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,808
AYE, CAPTAIN.

26
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,269
MR. KIM, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO JOIN US?

27
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,604
I WOULDN'T MISS IT, SIR.

28
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,400
THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,862
IS ABOUT 30 METERS
DIRECTLY AHEAD.

30
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,864
I'M PICKING UP
A LARGE CAVERN IN THERE.

31
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,699
THE READINGS ARE...

32
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,784
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

33
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,913
IT'S ORGANIC.

34
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:22,708
SOME KIND OF
BIOPOLYMER RESIDUE.

35
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,919
I WANT TO SEE
WHAT'S AHEAD.

36
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,813
THE READINGS ARE HIGHER
OVER HERE

37
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,775
BUT I STILL CAN'T FIND
THE SOURCE OF THE...

38
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,444
(<i> gasps</i> )

39
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,029
COMMANDER?

40
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,538
CLASS FIVE HUMANOID.

41
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,540
IT APPEARS TO BE DEAD.

42
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,312
CAPTAIN, THERE ARE
18 BODIES HERE--

43
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,108
ALL HUMANOID--
11 MALE, 7 FEMALE.

44
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,609
FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL,

45
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,945
THEY'RE IN VARIOUS STAGES
OF DECOMPOSITION.

46
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,238
SOME HAVE BEEN HERE
FOR YEARS.

47
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,698
Others, no longer than
a few days.

48
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,325
In fact, one body arrived
less than 12 hours ago.

49
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,577
ARRIVED FROM WHERE?

50
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,787
I don't know, Captain.

51
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,705
BUT FROM THE POSITION
OF THE ARMS

52
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,541
I'D SAY WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME
KIND OF BURIAL SITE.

53
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,085
WHAT ABOUT THE ELEMENT
WE DISCOVERED?

54
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,504
IT'S EMANATING FROM
THEIR BODIES, CAPTAIN.

55
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,090
WE THINK IT'S SOME
KIND OF BYPRODUCT

56
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,093
of their decomposition process.

57
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,262
I recommend we leave these
bodies in peace, Captain.

58
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,848
HOWEVER, MR. KIM
HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION.

59
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,433
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, CAPTAIN,

60
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,602
I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH
THE COMMANDER.

61
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,147
THIS IS OUR FIRST CONTACT
WITH THIS RACE.

62
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,648
AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE
LEARNING ALL WE CAN ABOUT THEM.

63
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,234
It's a unique
anthropological opportunity.

64
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,862
I understand the chance for
scientific discovery, Captain,

65
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,031
BUT WHATEVER BELIEF THIS RACE
HAS, THEY CLEARLY MEANT

66
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,574
FOR THEIR DEAD
TO BE LEFT ALONE

67
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,660
AND I THINK WE SHOULD
RESPECT THAT.

68
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,037
I'M AFRAID I AGREE WITH
COMMANDER CHAKOTAY.

69
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,206
SET YOUR TRICORDERS
FOR PASSIVE SCANS.

70
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,540
I DON'T WANT
TO DISTURB ANYTHING.

71
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,834
Captain, the sanctity

72
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,335
OF THESE BODIES
SHOULD BE RESPECTED.

73
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,839
I RECOMMEND WE MAKE
VISUAL OBSERVATIONS ONLY.

74
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,090
NO TRICORDERS.

75
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,716
VERY WELL.

76
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,218
KEEP ME INFORMED.

77
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,179
Janeway out.

78
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,847
ALL RIGHT.

79
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,347
THE ONLY SENSORS YOU
HAVE LEFT ARE YOUR EYES.

80
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,724
CONCENTRATE
ON DETAILS.

81
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,018
WE'LL HAVE TO DO
A THOROUGH REPORT

82
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,769
WHEN WE GET BACK.

83
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,190
COMMANDER, THANKS
FOR LETTING ME

84
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,441
VOICE MY OPINION
TO THE CAPTAIN.

85
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,651
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME

86
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,153
I WENT ON A
TOMB EXCAVATION

87
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,863
ON KTARIA SEVEN.

88
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,448
I WANTED TO KEEP A MEMENTO
OF THE EXPERIENCE.

89
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,659
SO I PICKED UP A ROCK
FROM THE BURIAL SITE.

90
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,369
ONLY I FOUND OUT LATER
IT WASN'T JUST A ROCK.

91
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,914
WHAT WAS IT?

92
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,791
IT WAS A SACRED STONE.

93
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,669
THE KTARIANS LAY THOUSANDS
OF THEM IN THE TOMB.

94
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,213
EACH ONE REPRESENTS
A SPECIAL PRAYER.

95
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,089
WITHOUT REALIZING IT

96
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,259
I HAD DESECRATED
THAT MAN'S GRAVE.

97
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,427
WELL...

98
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,139
I THINK I'VE FOUND OUT
ABOUT ALL I CAN WITH MY EYES.

99
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,977
REALLY? WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED
ABOUT THIS CULTURE SO FAR?

100
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,064
THEY LIKE TO BURY THEIR DEAD
ON ASTEROIDS.

101
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,192
THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN TELL
WITHOUT A TRICORDER.

102
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,818
NO ARTIFACTS,
NO INSCRIPTIONS.

103
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,444
JUST SOME NAKED DEAD PEOPLE.

104
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,697
YOU'RE LOOKING,
BUT YOU'RE NOT SEEING.

105
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,324
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NAKED
SAYS A LOT.

106
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,825
IT MEANS THIS RACE
DOESN'T BELIEVE IN

107
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,451
DRESSING THE DECEASED.

108
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,037
AND THE LACK OF ARTIFACTS
COULD INDICATE

109
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,412
THEY DON'T BELIEVE
ANY WORLDLY GOODS

110
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,041
CAN BE TAKEN INTO
THE AFTERLIFE.

111
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,376
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

112
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,128
THEY BELIEVE IN
AN AFTERLIFE AT ALL?

113
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,215
LOOK AT THE POSITION
OF THE ARMS AND HANDS.

114
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,134
THE BODIES HAVE BEEN ARRANGED
IN POSES OF SERENITY

115
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,678
AND THEY APPEAR TO BE WRAPPED IN
THE SAME BIOPOLYMER RESIDUE

116
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,972
WE FOUND OUT IN THE
PASSAGEWAY--

117
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,682
ALL INDICATIONS THAT THIS
CULTURE

118
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,017
HAS A GREAT DEAL OF RITUAL

119
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,144
ASSOCIATED WITH
THE DISPOSING OF THE DEAD.

120
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,813
THAT NORMALLY INDICATES
SOME BELIEF IN THE AFTERLIFE.

121
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,732
THE KLINGONS BELIEVE
IN AN AFTERLIFE

122
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,318
BUT THERE'S NO
BURIAL RITUAL.

123
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,736
THEY JUST DISPOSE
OF THE CORPSE

124
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,696
BY THE MOST EFFICIENT
MEANS POSSIBLE.

125
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,240
GOOD POINT.

126
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,159
HOWEVER, SOME ARCHEOLOGICAL DIGS
ON THE KLINGON...

127
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,288
(<i> high-pitched whine</i> )

128
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,459
TRICORDERS.

129
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,002
A DIMENSIONAL DISTORTION
IS FORMING.

130
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,046
SOME KIND OF
SUBSPACE VACUOLE.

131
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,216
CHAKOTAY TO<i> VOYAGER.</i>
EMERGENCY BEAM-OUT.

132
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,843
Janeway:
We're having trouble
locking onto your signals.

133
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,053
STAND BY.

134
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,346
HAVE EVERYONE STAND
CLOSER TOGETHER.

135
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,639
I'M GOING TO TRY A BLIND
BEAM-OUT

136
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,224
centered on your com signal.

137
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,311
ACKNOWLEDGED. ENERGIZE!

138
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,232
BRIDGE TO TRANSPORTER ROOM
THREE. DO YOU HAVE THEM?

139
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,192
Subspace distortions

140
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,485
FROM THE VACUOLE ARE INTERFERING

141
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,736
with the transporter lock.

142
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,489
I'm attempting
to compensate.

143
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,450
OKAY. I THINK I'VE GOT THEM.

144
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,581
CHAKOTAY AND LIEUTENANT TORRES
ARE ABOARD.

145
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,208
SO IS ONE OF
THE HUMANOID BODIES

146
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,710
but there's no sign
of Ensign Kim.

147
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,963
SCAN THE ASTEROID.

148
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,965
NO LIFE SIGNS, CAPTAIN.

149
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,717
I'M BROADENING THE SCAN.

150
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,263
NOTHING. HE IS NOWHERE IN
THE ENTIRE ASTEROID FIELD.

151
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,600
SESKA, INITIATE EMERGENCY
TRANSPORT PROCEDURE 21 ALPHA.

152
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,853
I'M ALREADY ON IT, CAPTAIN.
IT'S NO USE.

153
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,271
HIS PATTERN'S GONE,

154
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,857
and the subspace vacuole
has disappeared.

155
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,151
I'm looking at
the transporter logs.

156
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,944
MY ONLY GUESS IS HE WAS
PULLED INTO THE VACUOLE.

157
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,113
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THE BODIES
WE FOUND IN THE CAVERN.

158
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,199
IT'S SOMEONE ELSE.

159
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,658
THIS BODY MIGHT HAVE COME OUT
OF THE VACUOLE

160
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,285
AT THE SAME TIME
KIM WAS TAKEN IN.

161
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,744
WAIT A MINUTE.

162
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,788
I'M SHOWING SIGNS
OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY

163
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,374
IN THE BRAIN.

164
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,376
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE DIED
JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.

165
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,711
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO REVIVE HER.

166
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,838
IF WE CAN, WE MIGHT
GET SOME ANSWERS.

167
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,382
WE CAN'T INTERFERE

168
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:12,593
WITH THIS WOMAN'S
NATURAL PROCESS OF DEATH.

169
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,721
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST
WE DO, COMMANDER?

170
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,223
KIM'S GONE.

171
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,724
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO MIGHT BE ABLE

172
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,478
TO TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

173
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,271
BEAM US DIRECTLY
TO SICK BAY.

174
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,605
Seska:
Aye, Commander.

175
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,817
DEATH IS THE END OF THIS LIFE

176
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,363
BUT IT IS ALSO THE BEGINNING
OF A NEW JOURNEY.

177
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:35,992
PTERA WILL NOW THRIVE
IN THE NEXT EMANATION.

178
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:40,121
THIS IS BOTH HER SACRED DUTY
AND HER GREAT PRIVILEGE.

179
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,499
All:
<i>ELER'ATAH.</i>

180
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,834
AS SHE BEGINS HER TRANSITION

181
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,421
WE PROMISE
TO CARRY MEMORIES OF HER

182
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,048
SO THAT WHEN WE ENTER THE...
(<i> banging</i> )

183
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:54,094
Kim:
HELP! GET ME OUT OF HERE!

184
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,803
SHE'S... ALIVE!

185
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,138
DEACTIVATE THE CENOTAPH--

186
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,432
QUICKLY!

187
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,862
HERE IT IS.

188
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,073
THANKS.

189
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,787
A LOT OF MEMORIES IN THIS.

190
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,290
WE'RE SO PROUD
OF YOU, HATIL.

191
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,209
THIS IS SUCH
A GENEROUS, SELFLESS ACT.

192
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,380
IT'S MY LAST GIFT FOR YOU
AND THE CHILDREN.

193
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,591
AND IT'S ONE WE WILL
ALWAYS CHERISH.

194
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,054
(<i> crying</i> ):
BUT I'M STILL GOING
TO MISS YOU.

195
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,599
I KNOW.

196
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,142
I'LL MISS YOU TOO.

197
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,938
BUT I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE NEXT EMANATION

198
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,399
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO JOIN ME.

199
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,945
GIVE MY LOVE
TO YOUR FATHER.

200
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,072
TELL HIM THAT THE
GARILI TREES HE PLANTED

201
00:10:56,072 --> 00:11:00,952
HAVE BEEN IN BLOOM
FOR THREE YEARS STRAIGHT.

202
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,287
I WILL.

203
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,629
GOOD-BYE.

204
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,963
GOOD-BYE.

205
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,108
LIE DOWN.

206
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,528
IT'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

207
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,862
WE WON'T HARM YOU.

208
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,408
WHO IS THAT?

209
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,327
WE'RE NOT SURE YET.

210
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:46,080
WE THINK HE CAME
FROM THE NEXT EMANATION.

211
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,457
THE NEXT EMANATION?

212
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,044
YOU MEAN HE'S COME BACK?

213
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,711
COME BACK
FROM WHERE?

214
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,339
WE'VE CALLED FOR
THE THANATOLOGIST.

215
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,965
HE'LL BE HERE
ANY MOMENT.

216
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,551
I DON'T THINK
THERE SHOULD BE

217
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,428
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION
ABOUT THIS UNTIL HE ARRIVES.

218
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,025
HOW DID YOU
GET HERE?

219
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,029
I'M NOT SURE.

220
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,578
I JUST SORT OF WOKE UP
INSIDE ONE OF THOSE PODS.

221
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,414
I WAS CONDUCTING
AN INVESTIGATION

222
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,665
ON AN ASTEROID.

223
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,292
WE FOUND SOME DEAD BODIES.

224
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,546
THEN THERE WAS SOME KIND
OF SUBSPACE PHENOMENON.

225
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,923
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU SAW DEAD PEOPLE THERE?

226
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,841
(<i> door opening</i> )

227
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,102
I'M DOCTOR NERIA,

228
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,689
THE CHIEF THANATOLOGIST
OF THIS FACILITY.

229
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,192
ENSIGN HARRY KIM OF
THE FEDERATION STARSHIP<i> VOYAGER.</i>

230
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,321
I SEE.

231
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,157
WHAT RACE ARE YOU FROM?

232
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,119
WE CALL OURSELVES HUMAN.

233
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,079
WE COME FROM A PLANET
CALLED EARTH

234
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,331
IN A DISTANT PART
OF THE GALAXY.

235
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,792
HE SAID HE SAW DEAD
PEOPLE ON AN ASTEROID.

236
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,587
DEAD?

237
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,298
LOOK, CAN YOU TELL
ME WHERE I AM?

238
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,302
DOCTOR, WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN?

239
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,762
REST, HATIL.

240
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,347
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR CONCERN.

241
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,898
MAY I SPEAK TO YOU
PRIVATELY, ENSIGN HARRY?

242
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,610
JUST HARRY'S FINE.

243
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,403
WE ARE THE VHNORI

244
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:44,574
AND THIS IS OUR HOMEWORLD.

245
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,200
WE WERE INVESTIGATING
ONE OF THE ASTEROIDS

246
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,286
IN THE RINGS
AROUND YOUR PLANET.

247
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,289
THERE ARE NO RINGS
AROUND OUR WORLD.

248
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,252
SO... THE SUBSPACE VACUOLE

249
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,297
MUST HAVE TRANSPORTED ME
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

250
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,924
DO YOU HAVE ANY STAR CHARTS
I COULD LOOK AT?

251
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,551
I'D LIKE TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE I AM NOW

252
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,844
IN RELATION TO WHERE I WAS.

253
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,888
WHERE YOU ARE NOW

254
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,308
IS IN THE WORLD
OF THE LIVING.

255
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,435
WHERE YOU CAME FROM WAS...

256
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,147
ANOTHER DIMENSION.

257
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,982
ANOTHER DIMENSION?

258
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:23,237
YES. YOU RETURNED
FROM THE NEXT EMANATION.

259
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,905
THE AFTERLIFE.

260
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,207
HOW WERE YOU ABLE
TO REVIVE HER?

261
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,000
IT'S A SIMPLE
PROCESS, REALLY.

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,419
SHE DIED OF A CANCEROUS GROWTH
ON THE BRAIN STEM.

263
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,756
I REMOVED THE TUMOR,
REPLICATED NEW NEURAL TISSUE

264
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,550
AND USED THE STANDARD STARFLEET
POSTMORTEM

265
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,593
RESUSCITATION TECHNIQUE FOR
A CLASS 5 LIFE FORM.

266
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,722
WHY WAS SHE COVERED
WITH THIS BIOPOLYMER?

267
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,515
SHE WASN'T COVERED
WITH IT EXACTLY.

268
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,434
THE BIOPOLYMER IS A BYPRODUCT
OF HER OWN TISSUES.

269
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,895
EXPLAIN.
AS HER TISSUES DECAYED,

270
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,980
THE CELL MEMBRANES BROKE DOWN

271
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,357
INTO A BIOPOLYMER RESIN,

272
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,819
WHICH WAS THEN EXCRETED BY
HER EPIDERMAL LAYER.

273
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,071
MY GUESS IS IT'S A
NATURAL DECOMPOSITION

274
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,989
PROCESS FOR THIS SPECIES.

275
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,367
SO THE OTHER BIOPOLYMER FIBERS
WE FOUND IN THE CAVERN...

276
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,535
WERE PROBABLY THE RESULT

277
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,871
OF OTHER BODIES
THAT HAD DECOMPOSED

278
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,623
AND LEFT A RESIDUAL MEMBRANE.

279
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:20,127
IN ESSENCE, COMMANDER, YOU WERE
STROLLING THROUGH DEAD BODIES.

280
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,257
CAN YOU WAKE HER?

281
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,466
YES, OF COURSE.

282
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,469
KES, 2cc's OF NETINALINE.

283
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,276
HELLO.

284
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,985
Janeway:
I KNOW THIS MUST BE

285
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,362
VERY CONFUSING FOR YOU,

286
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,239
BUT YOU ARE ALL RIGHT.

287
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,158
MY NAME IS
KATHRYN JANEWAY.

288
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,828
I'M PTERA.

289
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,371
WHERE'S MY BROTHER?

290
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,498
YOUR BROTHER?

291
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,834
I'M AFRAID
HE'S NOT HERE.

292
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,961
BUT HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

293
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,755
THEY'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

294
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,840
PTERA, WE WERE
ABLE TO REMOVE

295
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,801
THE TUMOR FROM YOUR BRAIN.

296
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,260
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

297
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,804
WE REVIVED YOU...

298
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,972
THIS IS
THE NEXT EMANATION?

299
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
THIS IS THE AFTERLIFE?

300
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,229
NO. NO, IT'S NOT.

301
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,522
YOU'RE ON A STARSHIP.

302
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,982
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

303
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,275
MY BROTHER'S SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

304
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,485
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

305
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,403
LET ME EXPLAIN.
NO!

306
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,656
NO. GET AWAY FROM ME.

307
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,990
THIS ISN'T RIGHT!
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT!

308
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,992
(<i> screaming</i> )

309
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,298
YOU'RE SAYING THERE WAS A
WOMAN IN HERE

310
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,800
JUST BEFORE I ARRIVED?

311
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,344
THAT'S RIGHT.
HER NAME WAS PTERA.

312
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,471
SHE WAS DYING
OF A TUMOROUS LESION

313
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,473
TO HER MIDBRAIN.

314
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,391
DYING?

315
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,435
SO SHE WASN'T DEAD YET?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

316
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,981
SHE DIDN'T DIE UNTIL
THE CENOTAPH WAS ACTIVATED.

317
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,440
THAT'S THE PURPOSE
OF THE CENOTAPH--

318
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,192
IT TERMINATES
A PERSON'S LIFE

319
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,403
JUST BEFORE THE APPEARANCE
OF A SPECTRAL RUPTURE

320
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,322
AND THEN IT
ALLOWS THEIR BODY

321
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,492
TO BE TAKEN
TO THE NEXT EMANATION.

322
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,077
SPECTRAL RUPTURE...

323
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,913
WELL... I CAN SHOW YOU.

324
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,753
THIS LOOKS LIKE WHAT WE WOULD
CALL A SUBSPACE VACUOLE.

325
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,381
DOES THE CENOTAPH
CREATE THESE RUPTURES?

326
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,841
NO. THEY'RE NATURAL
OCCURRENCES--

327
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,258
ONCE EVERY SIX HOURS.

328
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,219
THIS ENTIRE COMPLEX
WAS BUILT ON THIS SITE

329
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,221
BECAUSE A SPECTRAL RUPTURE
OCCURS HERE.

330
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,224
WE HAVE THOUSANDS
OF SUCH SITES ON OUR WORLD.

331
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:45,356
FORGIVE MY CURIOSITY, HARRY,
BUT YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON

332
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,943
EVER TO COME BACK
FROM THE AFTERLIFE.

333
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,278
I HAVE QUITE
A FEW QUESTIONS.

334
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:55,700
YOU SAID
THAT YOU SAW DEAD BODIES?

335
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,910
THAT'S RIGHT.

336
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,831
THERE WERE 7 FEMALES,
11 MALES.

337
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,207
SOME OF THE BODIES
HAD BEEN THERE FOR YEARS.

338
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,710
OTHERS JUST FOR A FEW DAYS.

339
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,128
ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHEN WE DIE

340
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:12,550
WE GO TO SOME ASTEROID
AND DECOMPOSE?

341
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,886
WELL...

342
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,637
THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKED LIKE TO US.

343
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,472
THESE BODIES...

344
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,100
DID YOU PERFORM ANY KIND OF
BIOSCANS ON THEM?

345
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,351
WAS THERE ANY SPECIFIC

346
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,938
MEDICAL DATA THAT
YOU CAN REMEMBER?

347
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,274
DOCTOR, MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST STOP RIGHT THERE.

348
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,527
THIS IS WHAT MY PEOPLE CALL
A FIRST CONTACT SITUATION

349
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,362
AND WE'VE LEARNED
TO BE VERY CAREFUL

350
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,741
ABOUT HOW MUCH WE TELL
ALIEN CULTURES WE'VE JUST MET.

351
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,243
I WOULD LIKE TO START
A COMPLETE BIOANALYSIS

352
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,703
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

353
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,582
IF YOU'LL JUST FOLLOW
DR. RANORA.

354
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,751
BIOANALYSIS?

355
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,921
LOOK, ALL I WANT TO DO
IS GET BACK TO MY SHIP,

356
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,547
AND I THINK THERE
MIGHT BE A WAY TO USE

357
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,966
THIS SPECTRAL RUPTURE
OF YOURS TO...

358
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,051
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

359
00:18:55,051 --> 00:19:01,474
YOU ARE OUR FIRST GLIMPSE
INTO WHAT LIES BEYOND DEATH.

360
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,937
WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THIS
OPPORTUNITY PASS US BY.

361
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,690
Chakotay:
<i>WE'VE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS</i>

362
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,984
<i>OF THE RING SYSTEM.</i>

363
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,234
OUR SENSORS HAVE DETECTED

364
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,694
OVER 200,000 ALIEN BODIES

365
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,072
ON VARIOUS ASTEROIDS
IN THE RINGS.

366
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,573
FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL

367
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,867
A SUBSPACE VACUOLE
APPEARS ABOUT EVERY TWO HOURS

368
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,078
DEPOSITS A BODY,
AND THEN DISAPPEARS.

369
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,622
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON
THOSE VACUOLES.

370
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,124
CONCENTRATE ON TRYING
TO PROBE THEM

371
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,583
WITH A HIGH-RESOLUTION SCAN.

372
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,002
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANY SIGN OF MR. KIM.

373
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,920
Zimmerman:
Sick bay to Captain Janeway.

374
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,171
GO AHEAD.

375
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,589
Our guest
has regained consciousness

376
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,341
and she's a little calmer
this time.

377
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,594
I'M ON MY WAY.
YOU HAVE THE BRIDGE.

378
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,348
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

379
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,266
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T
TELL YOU ANYTHING MORE.

380
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,435
YOU'VE TOLD ME
QUITE A BIT.

381
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,895
AT LEAST NOW I HAVE AN IDEA

382
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,941
OF WHAT MIGHT
HAVE HAPPENED TO MR. KIM.

383
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,860
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

384
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,654
WELL, I'D LIKE SOME ANSWERS.

385
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,197
ABOUT WHAT?

386
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,867
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
TO MY PEOPLE WHEN WE DIE.

387
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,288
WE'RE NOT SURE, EXACTLY,

388
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,082
BUT FROM WHAT WE DO KNOW,

389
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,126
THE VACUOLES
DEPOSIT THE BODIES

390
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,962
ON THE ASTEROIDS
IN THIS RING SYSTEM.

391
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,421
AND THEN WHAT?

392
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,923
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN.

393
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,424
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EVOLVE

394
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,928
INTO A HIGHER LEVEL
OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN WE DIE--

395
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,472
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GAIN A GREATER
UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE.

396
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,724
ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS

397
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,726
ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE ANSWERED.

398
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,270
PTERA, I KNOW THIS
MUST BE FRIGHTENING FOR YOU.

399
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,398
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE.

400
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:37,570
IT WOULD FRIGHTEN ME,
BUT PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

401
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,032
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS

402
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,616
DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T ANY.

403
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,372
MY BROTHER...

404
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,085
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I'D SEE HIM AGAIN.

405
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,253
I HAD SO MANY
THINGS TO TELL HIM

406
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,756
ABOUT HIS CHILDREN...

407
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,925
THE PEOPLE HE LEFT BEHIND...

408
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,013
BUT HE ISN'T HERE, IS HE?

409
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,598
HE'S...

410
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,394
SO, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW?

411
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,440
SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE
ON THIS... THIS... STARSHIP?

412
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,861
PTERA, I AM GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

413
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,488
TO FIGURE OUT
JUST HOW YOU GOT HERE

414
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:25,159
AND AS SOON AS I KNOW ANYTHING,
I WILL TELL YOU.

415
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,121
ALL RIGHT?

416
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,413
ALL RIGHT.

417
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,749
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET OUT OF SICK BAY.

418
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,085
LET YOU WALK AROUND FOR A WHILE;
CLEAR YOUR MIND.

419
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,920
MAYBE GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

420
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,379
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

421
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,549
YES. ACTUALLY, I COULD USE
SOMETHING TO EAT.

422
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,342
WHAT WAS THAT?

423
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,970
JANEWAY TO BRIDGE. REPORT.

424
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,679
THERE'S SOME KIND
OF DIMENSIONAL DISTORTION

425
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,057
FORMING NEAR MAIN ENGINEERING,
CAPTAIN.

426
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,809
IT LOOKS LIKE A
SUBSPACE VACUOLE.

427
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,145
JANEWAY TO ENGINEERING.
B'ELANNA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

428
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,231
I'VE PINPOINTED THE LOCATION,
CAPTAIN.

429
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,565
IT'S RIGHT HERE IN ENGINEERING.

430
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,818
STAND BY.

431
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,207
HATIL, WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

432
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,752
I'M JUST NOT
SURE I'M READY

433
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,255
THAT'S ALL.

434
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,757
I... I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

435
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,260
NEITHER DO I.

436
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,221
IT'S JUST THAT I'M
STARTING TO WONDER

437
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:31,267
WHAT REALLY HAPPENS
WHEN WE DIE...

438
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,811
IF I'M REALLY
GOING ON

439
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,439
TO A HIGHER LEVEL
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

440
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,484
THE ALIEN, WHAT HAS
HE BEEN TELLING YOU?

441
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,986
ALL HE'S DONE

442
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,946
IS MADE ME STOP AND THINK

443
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,949
ABOUT SOMETHING WE'VE
ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED.

444
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,786
AND NOW THAT I'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT

445
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,040
I'M NOT SO EAGER TO GO
THROUGH WITH IT ANYMORE.

446
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,751
HATIL, WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT HIM

447
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,671
OR WHY HE'S COME HERE,
OR WHY HE'S SPREADING LIES

448
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,506
ABOUT THE NEXT EMANATION.

449
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,133
ALL I KNOW
IS YOU CAN'T THROW AWAY

450
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,011
A LIFETIME OF BELIEF
BECAUSE OF HIM.

451
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,013
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

452
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,185
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO THINK ANYMORE.

453
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,646
I'M SCARED, ARAYA.

454
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,608
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

455
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,945
THINK ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

456
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,739
HE'S WAITING FOR YOU.

457
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:36,165
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE
TRANSFERENCE RITUAL.

458
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,090
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
OR WHERE YOU COME FROM

459
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,343
BUT YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MY HUSBAND.

460
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,802
I'M SORRY.

461
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,554
I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

462
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,141
HARRY,

463
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,352
YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE MY WIFE.

464
00:23:56,352 --> 00:24:00,398
SHE'S HAVING TROUBLE
UNDERSTANDING MY CONCERNS

465
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,942
ABOUT THE AFTERLIFE.

466
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,902
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

467
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,780
I'M, UH...

468
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,908
GETTING READY TO DIE.

469
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,745
FORGIVE ME FOR ASKING AGAIN,
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING

470
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,915
ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT FIND
IN THE NEXT EMANATION?

471
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,084
EVERYONE KEEPS ASKING ME THAT

472
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,962
AND I JUST KEEP GIVING
THE SAME ANSWER.

473
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,964
I DON'T KNOW.

474
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,508
BUT YOU DO COME
FROM THE AFTERLIFE.

475
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:33,347
I COME FROM A DIFFERENT REALITY,
MAYBE ANOTHER DIMENSION

476
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,724
AND MAYBE IT IS YOUR AFTERLIFE.
I DON'T KNOW.

477
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,894
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT THERE
ARE COUNTLESS BILLIONS OF

478
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,605
PEOPLE THERE WHO ARE BORN,
LIVE, AND DIE,

479
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,898
JUST LIKE YOU DO HERE.

480
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,860
BUT YOU DID SEE
MY PEOPLE THERE.

481
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,654
YOU SAID THEY WERE DEAD.

482
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,740
YES, BUT...

483
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,453
LOOK. FOR ALL I KNOW,
YOUR THANATOLOGISTS ARE RIGHT.

484
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,914
AND ALL I SAW WERE THE CORPOREAL
REMAINS OF YOUR PEOPLE,

485
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,917
AND YOU DO GO ON TO
A HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS.

486
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,253
BUT IT'S, UH...

487
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,840
IT'S ALSO
POSSIBLE THAT...

488
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,051
THERE IS NO HIGHER
EXISTENCE FOR US--

489
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:16,056
THAT WHEN WE DIE, WE
SIMPLY CEASE TO EXIST.

490
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,976
I...

491
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,479
I REALLY CAN'T SAY.

492
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:25,024
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO YOUR PEOPLE AFTER THEY DIE.

493
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,068
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO MY PEOPLE AFTER THEY DIE.

494
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:32,739
DON'T YOU HAVE THANATOLOGISTS,
PEOPLE WHO STUDY DEATH?

495
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,075
WELL, SORT OF.

496
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:39,537
THERE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN
MEDICAL EXPERTS...

497
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,665
PHILOSOPHERS, THEOLOGIANS,

498
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,083
WHO HAVE SPENT
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME

499
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,961
DEBATING WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER DEATH,

500
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,506
BUT NO ONE'S COME UP
WITH AN ANSWER YET.

501
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,300
MY PEOPLE HAVE COME
TO THINK OF DEATH

502
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,513
AS JUST ANOTHER STAGE
OF OUR EXISTENCE.

503
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:59,308
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
WHO ARE EVEN EAGER TO DIE.

504
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,268
IF THEY FEEL
DEPRESSED

505
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:05,981
OR LONELY IN THIS LIFE, THEY
SIMPLY MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE.

506
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,900
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

507
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,069
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE?

508
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,742
EVER SINCE THE, UM...

509
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,077
ACCIDENT...

510
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,790
LIFE HASN'T BEEN EASY.

511
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,712
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS
IS MORE MY FAMILY'S IDEA

512
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,215
THAN IT IS MINE.
YOUR FAMILY.

513
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,718
I'M A BURDEN TO THEM RIGHT NOW.

514
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,305
IT TAKES A LOT OF THEIR TIME
AND RESOURCES TO CARE FOR ME

515
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,933
AND I CAN'T GIVE
MUCH BACK TO THEM.

516
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:46,480
SO THERE WAS A FAMILY MEETING,
AND IT WAS AGREED THAT...

517
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,733
I SHOULD MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT EMANATION.

518
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,240
YOU LOOK APPALLED.

519
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,159
IT'S NOT MY PLACE
TO JUDGE YOUR CULTURE,

520
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,744
BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

521
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,872
IT'S A LITTLE CHILLING
TO HEAR THAT.

522
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:09,795
EVEN THOUGH THE FAMILY
DID IT OUT OF... LOVE...

523
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:17,052
AND EVERYONE WAS HAPPY FOR ME
AND THEY SAID THEY'D SEE ME

524
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,264
WHEN THEY GOT
TO THE NEXT EMANATION...

525
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,934
I HAVE TO ADMIT

526
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,811
THERE IS A LITTLE VOICE
INSIDE OF ME

527
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,188
THAT IS TERRIFIED OF DYING

528
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,691
AND SINCE
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU...

529
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,195
THAT LITTLE VOICE
HAS STARTED TO GET...

530
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,364
LOUDER.

531
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,458
I'M READING ANOTHER VACUOLE
FORMING ON THE SHIP.

532
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,918
TUVOK, REMODULATING
THE SHIELD HARMONICS.

533
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,086
IT'S NO USE, CAPTAIN.

534
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,922
THE VACUOLE
IS STILL FORMING.

535
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,967
(<i> high-pitched whine</i> )

536
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,723
TAKE THE BODY
TO THE SHIP'S MORGUE.

537
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,437
<i>( beeping</i> )

538
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,607
THIS IS ODD.
THREE BODIES HAVE APPEARED

539
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,859
ON<i> VOYAGER</i> SO FAR,
AND EACH ONE OF THEM

540
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,070
HAS RELEASED SOME KIND
OF NEURAL ENERGY.

541
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,738
IN EVERY CASE,
THE ENERGY HAS PASSED

542
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,993
THROUGH THE HULL AND
OUT INTO THE RINGS.

543
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,870
THE ENERGY'S FREQUENCY
IS IDENTICAL

544
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,831
TO THE AMBIENT RADIATION
IN THE ASTEROID FIELD.

545
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,709
THE VACUOLES
ARE DISRUPTING

546
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,671
THE WARP CORE'S
MAGNETIC INTERLOCKS.

547
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,922
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
WE LOSE ANTIMATTER CONTAINMENT.

548
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,174
THE VACUOLES HAVE ALL FORMED

549
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,885
WITHIN 20 METERS
OF THE WARP CORE.

550
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,720
THEY MIGHT BE
ATTRACTED TO IT.

551
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,263
JANEWAY TO BRIDGE.

552
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,432
MR. PARIS, LAY IN A COURSE.
I WANT TO GET AT LEAST

553
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,726
a half a light year away.
Warp seven.

554
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,853
AYE, CAPTAIN.

555
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,820
PARIS TO JANEWAY.

556
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,447
I'VE BROUGHT US OUT OF WARP.

557
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,700
WE'RE POINT SIX LIGHT-YEARS
FROM THE RING SYSTEM.

558
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,160
ANY OTHER
SUBSPACE VACUOLES FORMING?

559
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,453
NO.

560
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,830
THE MAGNETIC INTERLOCKS
HAVE STABILIZED.

561
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,082
I THINK WE'RE SAFE OUT HERE.

562
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,375
BEGIN WORKING
ON A WAY TO PROTECT

563
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,834
THE WARP CORE
FROM THESE VACUOLES.

564
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,253
AYE, CAPTAIN.

565
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,800
Kes:
SOMETIMES I COME IN HERE

566
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,263
AND JUST STARE OUT
AT THE STARS FOR HOURS.

567
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,806
I NEVER GET TIRED
OF LOOKING AT THEM.

568
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,809
WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD
WE WOULD SEE BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS

569
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:34,064
IN THE NEXT EMANATION,
COLORS, LIGHTS,

570
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,066
AND THAT WE WOULD
SEE THEM WITH NEW EYES

571
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,402
AND A NEW UNDERSTANDING.

572
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,946
BUT NOW...

573
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,365
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OTHERS--

574
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,659
MY BROTHER...

575
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,786
MY FATHER...

576
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,831
AND EVERYONE BEFORE THEM.

577
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,461
PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY
ON MY WORLD.

578
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,672
DO THEY ALL END UP
AS LIFELESS CORPSES?

579
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,925
WHEN PEOPLE DIE ON MY WORLD,
WE BURY THEM BENEATH THE SOIL

580
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:07,055
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEIR COMRA
IS RELEASED INTO THE AFTERLIFE.

581
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,308
THEIR COMRA?

582
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,310
OUR SOUL, OUR SPIRIT,

583
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,604
THE ESSENCE OF OUR BEINGS.

584
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,022
MAYBE SOMETHING SIMILAR
HAPPENS TO YOU.

585
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,569
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

586
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,614
WE DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANY KIND OF SPIRIT.

587
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:27,159
WHEN WE DIE, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO REAPPEAR AS PHYSICAL BEINGS

588
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,286
WITH ARMS AND LEGS.

589
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,870
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT

590
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,124
OF SENDING OUR PEOPLE
THROUGH THE SPECTRAL RUPTURES.

591
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:39,129
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TRAVEL ON TO
THE NEXT EMANATION AS OURSELVES

592
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,215
AND BE REUNITED
WITH OUR FAMILIES.

593
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,972
BUT NONE OF THAT IS TRUE...

594
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,516
IS IT?

595
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,853
(<i> inhales deeply</i> )

596
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,565
NONE OF THE PEOPLE I LOVE
ARE HERE.

597
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,735
I'M ALONE.

598
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,115
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

599
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,951
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

600
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,496
PLEASE, CAN'T YOU SEND ME HOME?

601
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,582
I THINK THERE IS
ONLY ONE PERSON ON THIS SHIP

602
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,210
WHO COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

603
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,129
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO
GET YOU BACK HOME, PTERA.

604
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,382
ONCE WE LOCATE
OUR MISSING OFFICER

605
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,592
WE'RE HOPING HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO TELL US ENOUGH TO...

606
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,220
WAIT A MINUTE, CAPTAIN. MAYBE
THERE IS A WAY

607
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,264
TO SEND PTERA HOME AND FIND
ENSIGN KIM AT THE SAME TIME.

608
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,891
EXPLAIN.

609
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,394
WHAT IF WE RECREATED
THE TRANSPORTER ACCIDENT?

610
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,312
IF IT'S TRUE THAT HARRY WAS
PULLED THROUGH THE VACUOLE

611
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,481
DURING TRANSPORT, WE MIGHT BE
ABLE TO REPRODUCE

612
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,609
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND SEND PTERA HOME.

613
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,362
WE COULD SEND PTERA THROUGH
WITH A SUBSPACE TRANSPONDER,

614
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,780
AND HOPE THE SIGNAL
WILL PENETRATE

615
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,448
THE DIMENSIONAL BARRIER, AND
ALLOW US TO

616
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,492
LOCK ON TO KIM
WITH A TRANSPORTER BEAM.

617
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,994
RIGHT.
SO I CAN GET HOME?

618
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,414
PTERA, YOU SHOULD KNOW

619
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,417
THAT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
THIS IS GOING TO WORK.

620
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,419
I UNDERSTAND THE RISK,

621
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,961
BUT I'VE ALREADY
BEEN DEAD ONCE

622
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,340
AND I'M PREPARED TO DIE AGAIN
IF NECESSARY.

623
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,426
SO IF THERE'S A CHANCE
I CAN GET HOME

624
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,554
I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK.

625
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,013
ALL RIGHT.

626
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,807
COMMANDER, PREPARE
A SUBSPACE TRANSPONDER

627
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,768
AND TEACH PTERA
HOW TO USE IT.

628
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,102
AYE, CAPTAIN.

629
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,481
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG, SUPPLEMENTAL:</i>

630
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,650
<i>WE'VE RETURNED</i>
<i>TO THE RING SYSTEM</i>

631
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,653
<i>AND WE'RE PREPARING TO SEND</i>
<i>PTERA BACK TO HER DIMENSION.</i>

632
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,364
<i>LIEUTENANT TORRES HAS FOUND</i>
<i>A WAY TO TEMPORARILY PROTECT</i>

633
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,450
<i>THE WARP CORE</i>
<i>AGAINST THE VACUOLES</i>

634
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,204
<i>BUT SHE IS UNCERTAIN HOW LONG</i>
<i>HER MEASURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE.</i>

635
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,624
YOU UNDERSTAND THE INSTRUCTIONS
FOR MR. KIM IF YOU FIND HIM?

636
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,208
YES.

637
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,543
WE'VE GOT ONE,
COMMANDER,

638
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,545
FORMING TEN METERS
BELOW US, DECK 13.

639
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,963
OKAY, LET'S SEE IF
YOUR DAMPENING FIELD

640
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,215
IS GOING TO PROTECT THE
WARP CORE.

641
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,470
THE FIELD IS FLUCTUATING
SLIGHTLY, BUT HOLDING.

642
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,639
ENGINEERING TO
TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE.

643
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,641
There's a vacuole forming on
Deck 13.

644
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,267
Magnetic interlocks are stable.

645
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,518
ACKNOWLEDGED.

646
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,187
I SEE THE VACUOLE. LOCKING ON.

647
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,696
GOOD LUCK, PTERA.

648
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,074
Seska:
I HAVE A TRANSPORTER LOCK.

649
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,368
ENERGIZING.

650
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,996
MATCHING HER PATTERN
TO THE SUBSPACE DISTORTIONS.

651
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,416
WAIT A MINUTE. THE VACUOLE
IS SHUTTING DOWN.

652
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,876
I CAN'T GET HER PATTERN THROUGH.

653
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,544
ABORT THE PROCEDURE.
PULL HER BACK.

654
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,589
I'M TRYING.
I'M LOSING HER PATTERN.

655
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,925
SHUNT EMERGENCY POWER
INTO BUFFER TANK FOUR.

656
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,554
THAT'S IT. I'VE GOT THE PATTERN.

657
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,359
SHE'S DEAD.

658
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,613
IS THERE ANY BRAIN ACTIVITY?
CAN WE REVIVE HER?

659
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,700
JANEWAY TO LIEUTENANT TORRES.
HOW LONG UNTIL WE HAVE TO LEAVE?

660
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,743
I'd say we're safe
for another two hours.

661
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,787
THAT GIVES US TWO HOURS
TO FIND MR. KIM.

662
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,122
WE'LL HAVE TO STAY WITHIN
HIGH-RANGE SCANNER RANGE.

663
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,582
PERFORM ANOTHER
SUBSPACE SCAN.

664
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,710
THIS TIME, EXTEND
THE SCAN RADIUS TO 10AU.

665
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,919
I'M ON MY WAY
TO ENGINEERING.

666
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,504
JANEWAY OUT.
Aye, Captain.

667
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,507
ENSIGN, BEAM HER
ONTO ONE OF THE ASTEROIDS.

668
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,217
AYE, CAPTAIN.

669
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,887
THAT'S WHERE SHE
WAS MEANT TO BE.

670
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,978
I HOPE YOU FIND
YOUR AFTERLIFE, PTERA.

671
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,652
WHY?

672
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,237
WE WANT TO MAKE
A MORE DETAILED SCAN

673
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,864
OF YOUR
MICROCELLULAR STRUCTURES

674
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,282
AND A COMPLETE EXAMINATION
OF YOUR NEURAL CHEMISTRY.

675
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,953
THIS FACILITY ISN'T EQUIPPED FOR
SUCH A DETAILED BIOANALYSIS.

676
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:43,289
THE COMPLEX AT PAFFRAN
HAS EVERYTHING WE NEED.

677
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,251
LOOK, IF MY SHIP
IS STILL SEARCHING FOR ME

678
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,253
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
STAY THERE FOREVER.

679
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,671
I HAVE TO GET BACK.

680
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,130
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

681
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,925
WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU GOT HERE.

682
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,052
THEN MAYBE I CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET BACK.

683
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,888
LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT ONE
OF THOSE CENOTAPHS.

684
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,389
THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT.

685
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,016
WORD ABOUT YOU HAS SPREAD
VERY QUICKLY, HARRY.

686
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,851
NOT ONLY IN THE SCIENTIFIC
WORLD,

687
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,436
BUT IN THE COMMUNITY
AT LARGE.

688
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:08,523
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE
WHO ARE VERY... NERVOUS

689
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,233
ABOUT WHAT YOU REPRESENT.

690
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,485
SOME EVEN SEE YOU AS A THREAT
TO THEIR BELIEFS

691
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,946
ABOUT THE AFTERLIFE.

692
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:17,532
WE NEED TO TAKE YOU
TO A MORE SECURE LOCATION.

693
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,118
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

694
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,870
WAIT!

695
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,456
I'M SORRY, HARRY.

696
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,499
IT'S OUT OF MY CONTROL.

697
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,719
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

698
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,764
PREPARING FOR
THE TRANSFERENCE RITUAL.

699
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,185
THIS IS A CEREMONIAL SHROUD

700
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:51,024
THAT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY
FOR FIVE GENERATIONS.

701
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:54,277
SO THEY MAKE YOU WRAP YOURSELF
IN YOUR OWN DEATH SHROUD?

702
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:58,991
IT'S SOMETHING WE LOOK
FORWARD TO, ACTUALLY.

703
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:02,702
I REMEMBER
WHEN MY FATHER USED THIS SHROUD

704
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:07,373
AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM.

705
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,209
THE DIFFERENCE IS,
WHEN MY FATHER PUT THIS ON

706
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:16,049
THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN HIS MIND
ABOUT WHERE HE WAS GOING.

707
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,176
CAN'T YOU JUST BACK OUT?

708
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,929
SAY YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND?

709
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:26,977
I... HAVE THOUGHT OF JUST
WALKING OUT AND DISAPPEARING.

710
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,980
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS
IN THE CARARIAN MOUNTAINS.

711
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,775
THEY WOULD BE WILLING
TO LET ME STAY WITH THEM.

712
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,111
BUT MY FAMILY
WOULD WORRY ABOUT ME.

713
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,114
THEY'D WONDER
WHAT WAS HAPPENING

714
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:46,245
IF I WAS ALL RIGHT,
IF I WERE HURT...

715
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,166
NO. EVERYONE'S EXPECTING
A TRANSFERENCE RITUAL

716
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,169
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM ONE.

717
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,504
WHAT IF YOU DID DISAPPEAR

718
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,007
INTO THE MOUNTAINS...

719
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,801
BUT YOUR FAMILY
THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD?

720
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:04,389
I MEAN, THEY'RE HERE FOR
A TRANSFERENCE RITUAL, RIGHT?

721
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,100
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING?

722
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,643
IT'S PERFECT.

723
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,270
THOSE CENOTAPHS SEND YOUR PEOPLE
BACK TO MY DIMENSION

724
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,857
WHICH IS WHERE I WANT TO GO.

725
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:17,736
<i>VOYAGER'S</i> PROBABLY STILL NEAR
THE ASTEROID SEARCHING FOR ME.

726
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,072
AS SOON AS I APPEAR,

727
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,282
THEY'LL PICK UP MY SIGNAL
AND BEAM ME ABOARD.

728
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,743
AND YOU...

729
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,245
YOU CAN
JUST DISAPPEAR.

730
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,915
YOUR FAMILY WILL
THINK YOU'RE DEAD

731
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,374
AND YOU CAN LIVE
OUT YOUR LIFE

732
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,793
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

733
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,756
HARRY, IF YOU GO
INTO THAT CENOTAPH

734
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,383
AND GO THROUGH
WITH THE TRANSFERENCE RITUAL

735
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,010
YOU'LL DIE.

736
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,805
WELL, IF<i> VOYAGER</i> CAN
BEAM ME ABOARD QUICKLY ENOUGH

737
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:50,309
OUR DOCTOR SHOULD BE ABLE
TO REVIVE ME.

738
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,688
MEDICINE'S PRETTY ADVANCED
IN OUR CULTURE.

739
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,815
I'VE HEARD OF CASES WHERE PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR HOURS

740
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,651
AND STILL BEEN BROUGHT
BACK TO LIFE.

741
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,486
BUT IT'S NOT CERTAIN...

742
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:08,995
NO, IT'S NOT, BUT I THINK THIS
IS MY ONLY CHANCE TO GET HOME.

743
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,215
THE SHROUD HAS TO BE WRAPPED
IN A PARTICULAR WAY.

744
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,841
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW.

745
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,718
BUT WE HAVE TO HURRY.

746
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,430
I'M SCHEDULED FOR TRANSFERENCE
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

747
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,438
A PLEASANT TRIP, HATIL.

748
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,399
SAY HELLO TO VAREL AND TOYAN.

749
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,527
I'LL SEE YOU THERE
IN A FEW YEARS.

750
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,906
WE ARE JOINED HERE TODAY

751
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:49,494
TO BID FAREWELL
TO OUR DEAR FRIEND HATIL GARAN.

752
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,955
WE SALUTE NOT ONLY HIS LIFE,

753
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:55,458
BUT THE MANNER IN WHICH
HE HAS CHOSEN TO END IT.

754
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,377
HE MAKES A NOBLE SACRIFICE TODAY

755
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,923
THAT HIS FAMILY
MAY HAVE A BETTER TOMORROW.

756
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,759
WE PREPARE TO SEND HIM
ON TO THE NEXT EMANATION

757
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,511
WITH THE FULL KNOWLEDGE
AND FAITH

758
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:11,099
THAT THE LIFE HE WILL FIND THERE
IS BETTER THAN THE ONE HERE,

759
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,311
THAT HE WILL NO LONGER
BE HAMPERED BY HIS INFIRMITY,

760
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:18,815
AND THAT HE WILL COME
TO UNDERSTAND THE COSMOS

761
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,319
IN A WAY THAT HE COULD
NEVER HAVE IMAGINED.

762
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,825
GOOD-BYE, HATIL.

763
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,702
I LOVE YOU.

764
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,936
ANOTHER VACUOLE. DECK 15.

765
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,438
THE BODY OF AN ALIEN FEMALE
HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

766
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,774
CHAKOTAY
TO TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE.

767
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,651
LOCK ONTO THE BODY ON DECK 15

768
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,111
AND TRANSPORT IT
TO ONE OF THE ASTEROIDS.

769
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,404
Seska:
Aye, sir.

770
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,406
STATUS ON THE WARP CORE,
LIEUTENANT.

771
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,409
THE DAMPENING FIELD'S
DOWN TO 21 PERCENT.

772
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,662
THE INTERLOCKS WON'T
HOLD MUCH LONGER.

773
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,540
I RECOMMEND
LEAVING, CAPTAIN.

774
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,426
VERY WELL.

775
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,096
MR. PARIS,
BRING US ABOUT.

776
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,764
PREPARE TO
RESUME OUR...

777
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,392
CAPTAIN,
I'M PICKING UP A VACUOLE

778
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,310
FORMING ON DECK 12.

779
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,895
IT DEPOSITED A HUMAN BODY...

780
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,897
Janeway:
HUMAN?

781
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,481
BUT IT'S DEAD.

782
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,943
JANEWAY TO SESKA.

783
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,319
THERE'S A BODY
ON DECK 12.

784
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,570
BEAM IT DIRECTLY
TO SICK BAY.

785
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,988
Seska:
Yes, Captain.

786
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,372
2cc's CORDRAZINE.

787
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,932
(<i> gasping</i> )

788
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,812
Dr. Zimmerman:
RELAX, MR. KIM.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

789
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,188
YOU'RE ALIVE.

790
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,722
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

791
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,724
NO, NOT AT ALL.
PLEASE.

792
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,226
THANK YOU.

793
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:05,148
SO HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

794
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:08,609
BETTER. I'LL BE READY
FOR DUTY TOMORROW MORNING.

795
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,529
YOU'RE OFF DUTY
FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

796
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,698
CAPTAIN, I'M FINE.

797
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,117
IT'S NOT A REFLECTION
ON YOUR CAPABILITIES, ENSIGN.

798
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:20,913
I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO REFLECT ON WHAT'S HAPPENED.

799
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,541
THIS MAY NOT MAKE
MUCH SENSE TO YOU NOW--

800
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,294
A YOUNG MAN
AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER--

801
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,920
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU LEARN

802
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,967
AS YOU MOVE UP THE RANKS AND GET
A LITTLE OLDER IS THAT...

803
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,971
YOU WISH YOU HAD MORE TIME
IN YOUR YOUTH TO REALLY ABSORB

804
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,016
ALL THE THINGS
THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.

805
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:44,103
IT GOES BY SO FAST.

806
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,857
IT'S SO EASY TO BECOME JADED,
TO TREAT THE EXTRAORDINARY

807
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,693
LIKE JUST ANOTHER DAY
AT THE OFFICE.

808
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,404
BUT SOMETIMES,

809
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:57,409
THERE ARE EXPERIENCES
WHICH TRANSCEND ALL THAT.

810
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,660
YOU'VE JUST HAD ONE, MR. KIM,

811
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,164
AND I WANT YOU TO LIVE WITH IT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

812
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,833
WRITE ABOUT IT
IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

813
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,919
PAINT...

814
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,962
EXPRESS YOURSELF
IN SOME FASHION.

815
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,132
THE BRIDGE WILL STILL BE THERE
IN TWO DAYS.

816
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,927
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

817
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:21,558
I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE PREOCCUPIED
WITH THE EXPERIENCE.

818
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,892
I MEAN, ALL THOSE PEOPLE THINK

819
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,562
THAT THEY KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEATH.

820
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,397
THEY LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

821
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,274
THEY'RE PREPARED FOR IT.

822
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:33,319
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
NONE OF IT'S REAL.

823
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,114
THEY DON'T HAVE AN AFTERLIFE.

824
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,866
THEY JUST DECAY
INSIDE THOSE ASTEROIDS.

825
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,827
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE OF THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

826
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,582
THAT NEURAL ENERGY
THEIR BODIES RELEASE--

827
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,542
IT BECOMES PART
OF THE AMBIENT

828
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,044
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD
SURROUNDING THE PLANET.

829
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,213
OUR READINGS
ALSO INDICATE

830
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,591
THE ENERGY IS UNUSUALLY DYNAMIC.

831
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,217
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL
OF VARIATION

832
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:59,804
IN PATTERN COMPLEXITY,
QUANTUM DENSITY...

833
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:05,017
ARE YOU SAYING YOU THINK
THEY DO HAVE AN AFTERLIFE?

834
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,936
THAT THE ENERGY FIELD
IS WHERE THEY EXIST

835
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,188
AT A HIGHER LEVEL
OF CONSCIOUSNESS

836
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,190
JUST LIKE THEY BELIEVE?

837
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,736
I'M NOT CERTAIN.

838
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,739
BUT I AM CERTAIN ABOUT THIS--

839
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,660
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT DEATH

840
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,914
IS FAR, FAR GREATER
THAN WHAT WE DO KNOW.

841
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:32,211
SEE YOU IN TWO DAYS, ENSIGN.

842
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,796
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
