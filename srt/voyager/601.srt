Stay the course!

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,842
They're breaking through.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,426
We'll be dead if we don't
get the shields back up.

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:10,928
Arm yourselves!

00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,304

8
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:14,974
Who attacked you?

9
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,308
We don't know.

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,769
We can't communicate
with them.

11
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,271
They've been attacking
us for weeks.

12
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,983
Your crew has been running
criminal experiments here.

13
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,985
I know.
I designed them.

14
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,695
You?

15
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,363
That's a violation
of your programming.

16
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,950
They deleted
my ethical subroutines.

17
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:35,619
It's easy to cling to principles
when you're standing on a vessel

18
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,914
with its bulkheads intact,
manned by a crew
that's not starving.

19
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,333
It's never easy,
but if we turn our backs

20
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,169
on our principles,
we stop being human.

21
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,881
I'm putting an end
to your experiments,

22
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,591
and you are hereby relieved
of your command.

23
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,427
I rerouted transporter control
to a panel in the next junction.

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,762
We can...

25
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,645
Bridge, they've got
the field generator.

26
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,605
What do you mean,
they've got it?

27
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,273
I don't know how, but they
beamed it off of<i> Voyager.</i>

28
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,067
We're going home.

29
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,361
We can't let<i> Voyager</i>
stop us now,

30
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,197
not when we're this close.

31
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,993
Shields are down.
Arm yourselves.

32
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,327
Get us out of here.

33
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,373
<i>And now the conclusion.</i>

34
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,293

(<i> alien screeching stops</i> )

40
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,441
Good guess.

41
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,778
I used a deflector pulse
to reinforce the shields.
It won't hold for long.

42
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,030
PARIS: Bridge to
Sick Bay. We have
a medical emergency.

43
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,449
Doctor, respond.
Ensign.

44
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,452
Casualty reports
are coming in.
Two dead, 13 wounded.

45
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,328
We took heavy damage
to the engines.

46
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,997
The<i> Equinox?</i>
They've gone to warp.

47
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,291
Any sign of
nucleogenic particles?
No.

48
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,585
Then they haven't
engaged their enhanced
warp drive yet.

49
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,962
Keep looking for...

Report.

52
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,974
The shield grid
is back in place.

53
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,600
The aliens are
staying clear.

54
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,143
Are sensors
picking up<i> Voyager?</i>

55
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,104
It looks like
they're under attack.

56
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,275
Maintain course.

57
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,972
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

58
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,198
Captain, I found
the Doctor's mobile
emitter on Deck 9.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,575
You might want
to take it to Sick Bay.

61
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,585
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )

62
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,894
PARIS:
Any sign of the Doc?

63
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,271
I've got him right here.

64
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,985
Please state
the nature of the...

65
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,402
Don't bother.

66
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,905
You should start with Chakotay.

67
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,616
I've got him stabilized,
but he's got internal injuries.

68
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,910
We found your emitter
on Deck 9.

69
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,079
I was taken hostage
by the<i> Equinox crew.</i>

70
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,206
I deactivated
myself to escape.

71
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,042
Did you stop them?
No.

72
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,503
I'd ask for a status report,
but I'm not sure
I'd want to hear it.

73
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,755
Harry's analyzing the sound
we've been hearing.

74
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,882
He thinks it's some form
of communication.

75
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,510
Well, I once figured out
how to speak with
a Terrelian Seapod.

76
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,428
This couldn't be
that much harder.

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,056
Once I get out of Sick Bay,
I'll lend him a hand.

78
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,809
We should all be
focusing our efforts
on finding the<i> Equinox.</i>

79
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,520
First things first--
we've got to stop
these attacks.

80
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,230
JANEWAY: Our enemies
aren't the aliens.

81
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,024
They're the humans
aboard the<i> Equinox.</i>

82
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,317
It's crucial
that you don't...

(<i> door chimes</i> )

86
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,745
Who is it?

87
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,414
It's Max.
I've brought you a visitor.

88
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,791
Hold on.

89
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,960
Come in.

90
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,382
I'm glad you're okay.

91
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,261
I've been using this
synaptic stimulator.

92
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,971
I was just
taking a stroll

93
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,556
along the
Tenkaran Coast.

94
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,350
You're welcome
to try it.

95
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,810
State your intentions.

96
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,064
You know, once we get
our enhanced warp drive

97
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,983
back on line, we'll
be on our way home.

98
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,944
But it'll still take
months to get there.

99
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,323
You can spend that time
in the brig, or...

100
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,951
you can become
part of this crew.

101
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,995
I'd prefer the latter.

102
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,997
I'd prefer the brig.

103
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,542
You know, Janeway's
not the only captain

104
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,087
who can help you
explore your humanity.

105
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,173
You would be an
inferior role model.

106
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,385
Janeway clung to her morality

107
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,427
at the expense of her crew.

108
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,431
Maybe you should learn
from that mistake.

109
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,309
Her only mistake
was trusting you.

110
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,773
Take care of her wound.

111
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,998
BURKE:
First-degree phaser burns,
minor lacerations.

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,293
Looks like we'll
have to amputate.

113
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,086
That was a joke.

114
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,046
You're supposed to smile
and make a witty retort.

115
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,881
I'm familiar
with human banter.

116
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,507
Yours is crude
and predictable.

117
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,927
You know, Seven--
can I call you Seven?

118
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,804
We don't have many
luxuries around here.

119
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,389
All we've got is each other.

120
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,974
You might try letting
your shields down,

121
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,767
or else it's going
to be a lonely trip.

122
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,477
I'll be damned.

123
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,314
Looks like our Doctor
left us a replacement.

124
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,441
Seven...?

125
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,567
We are captives.

126
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,736
I was attacked
by their EMH.

127
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,989
Looks like he downloaded
you into our database.

128
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,284
Good. You can treat
your friend.

130
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,002
Marla to Bridge.
RANSOM: Go ahead.

131
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,711
We're ready.
Acknowledged.

132
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,422
Infuse the enhanced warp drive

133
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,090
with 20 isograms
of the compound.

134
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,758
Aye, sir.

135
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,721
Warp drive ready.

136
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,390
Engage.

139
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,064
What happened?

140
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,275
Power relays are off-line.
They've been encoded.

141
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,614
Give us the codes.
No.

142
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,075
If she won't give us
the codes, maybe we could
extract them ourselves.

143
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,703
Seven's cranial infrastructure
is highly complex.

144
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,706
You'll need months
just to figure out what
she had for breakfast.

145
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,666
That's why
you're gonna help us.
I refuse.

146
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,793
Do it or I'll
erase your program.
Be my guest.

147
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,004
Doctor.
Don't worry. They need me.

148
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,965
They'd be cutting off
their holographic nose
to spite their face.

149
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,967
Now, I suggest you...

150
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,969
RANSOM:
All right, Doctor.

151
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,139
Now, get to work.
You know what
we're looking for.

152
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,932
Very well.

153
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,519
She'll try to resist.
I'll have to restrain her.

154
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,103
Doctor.

155
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,855
I deleted
his ethical subroutines.

156
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,857
He'll be a little more
cooperative now.

157
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,567
You keep me posted.
Aye, Captain.

158
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,277
This way, please.

159
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,579
It's not exactly Shakespeare,
but it gets the point across.

160
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,456
A small olive branch
is still an olive branch.

161
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,124
Run this through
your translation matrix.

162
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,253
Set your weapons down.
Commander?

163
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,547
Somebody's got to start
trusting somebody around here.

164
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,509
Belay that order.
I appreciate your optimism,
but, in this case, weapons.

at 62 percent.

177
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,885
That should buy us another
few minutes of peace and quiet.

178
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,637
I suggest we make
the most of it.

179
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,514
Focus your efforts on repairing
the warp drive.

180
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,808
We've got to find
the<i> Equinox.</i>

181
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,810
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to take another
stab at the message.

182
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,020
If we can reroute...
They're not listening,
Chakotay.

183
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,524
We should be tracking Ransom,
not tinkering with adverbs.

184
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,237
Want your First Officer's
advice?

185
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,739
Allow me.
Our deflector's losing power

186
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,950
and when it fails,
we'll be defenseless.

187
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,453
It's <i> Voyager </i> we should
be worrying about,
not the<i> Equinox.</i>

188
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,914
You'd make a great
First Officer.
It's advice worth taking.

189
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,834
Maybe so, but we have a crew
member trapped on that ship.

190
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,212
Is this really about Seven,
or is it about Ransom?

191
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,298
I don't know
what you're talking about.

192
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,425
You've been known
to hold a grudge.

193
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,761
This man betrayed Starfleet,
he broke the Prime Directive,

194
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,555
dishonored everything
you believe in,

195
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,182
and threw<i> Voyager</i>
to the wolves.

196
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,682
Borg, Hirogen, Malon--

197
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,310
we've run into our share
of bad guys.

198
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,727
Ransom's no different.

199
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,272
Yes, he is.
You said it yourself.

200
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,984
He's human.
I don't blame you
for being angry,

201
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,153
but you can't compromise
the safety of this ship

202
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,322
to satisfy some
personal vendetta.

203
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,990
I appreciate your candor.

204
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,493
Now let me be just as blunt.

205
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,995
You're right, I am angry.

206
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,247
I'm damned angry.

207
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,916
He's a Starfleet Captain

208
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,794
and he's decided
to abandon everything
this uniform stands for.

209
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,089
He's out there right now
torturing and murdering
innocent life-forms

210
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:59,093
just to get home
a little quicker.
I'm not going to stand for it.

211
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,474
I'm going to hunt him down
no matter how long it takes,

212
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,434
no matter what the cost.

213
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:10,855
If you want to call
that a vendetta,
go right ahead.

214
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,667
Why did you bring us here?

215
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,751
This planet has
a parthogenic
atmosphere.

216
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,046
It'll keep us
from being detected
while we make repairs.

217
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,840
We also found a few
deuterium deposits.

218
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,010
Take an away team, Noah,
and see if you can
localize the ore.

219
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,470
You won't be protected
from the aliens.

220
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,389
Arm yourselves
with phasers.

221
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,140
At the first sign of trouble,
we'll beam you back.

222
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,309

There's a silver lining

Just think-- we're
finally going to see Earth.

229
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,621
You are obviously
delusional.

230
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,914
Allow me to repair
your program.

231
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,333
Now, why would I want you
to do that?

232
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,043
You of all people
should understand.

233
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,379
Being unfettered
by ethical subroutines

234
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,798
has made me far more efficient.

236
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,344
I'm going to extract

237
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,473
It contains an index
of her memory engrams.

238
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,225
But once I've removed it,
her higher brain functions,

239

language, cognitive skills
will be severely damaged.

240
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,989
Tell me the codes.

241
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,741
No.

242
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,994
Janeway was right
about one thing--

243
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,288
you are unique.

244
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,915
Now, it would be a shame
to lose you.

245
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,627
Your compassion
is irrelevant.

246
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,755
You think this
is easy for me?

247
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,216
The sight of you
on that table...

248
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,679
But you're leaving
me no choice.

249
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,055
"No choice."

250
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,099
You say that frequently.

251
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,976
You destroy life-forms

252
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,603
to attain your goals,

253
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,523
then claim that they
left you no choice.

254
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,817

comfort you?

You wanted to see me?

263
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,901
It's not like you to submit
recommendations in writing.

264
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,945
The last time we spoke,
you weren't exactly receptive.

265
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,907
I'm afraid I'm not going to be
very receptive this time either.

266
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,159
It's an interesting idea,
but the Ankari

267
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,952
are 50 light-years
in the wrong direction.

268
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,622
I understand that,
but they're the ones

269
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,957
who introduced Ransom
to these life-forms.

270
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,335
It stands to reason
they might be able
to communicate with them--

271
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,128
tell them to call off
their attacks.

272
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,048
Our first priority
is to find Ransom.

273
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,221
Still no sign
of nucleogenic particles?

274
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,556
Not yet.

275
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,849
Then he couldn't
have gotten far.

276
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,475
Without his enhanced drive,

277
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,645
his ship's only capable
of warp 6.

278
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,273
I've been studying
his service record.

279
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,777
He's had his share of run-ins
with hostile aliens.

280
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:48,364
It seems that when
he's being pursued,
he tends to hide.

281
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,158
At Epsilon IV he ran into
a Klingon bird-of-prey.

282
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,454
Played a game of cat and mouse
for three days in a nebula

283
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,831
before the Klingons
finally gave up.

284
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,376
Two years later,
he eluded a Romulan warbird

285
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:05,005
by taking his vessel
into the atmosphere
of a gas giant.

286
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,841
Go to Astrometrics.

287

288
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,053
you would hide if
your ship was damaged.

00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,597

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,793

00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,004
We might need to use

299
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,631
It's funny,

of McKinley Park.

00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,676
I used to take
my sister there
when we were kids.

301
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,720
This place looks
just like it.

302
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,847
As I recall, there was
a family of ground squirrels

303
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,640
who lived
right over there.

304
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,976
And there was a patch
of poison ivy next to it.

305
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,102
When I was 10, I walked
right through it

306
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,355
and I swelled up like
a Regellian blood worm.

307
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,649
When I get back to Earth,
the first thing
I'm going to do is...

00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,727
People are dying over here.

347
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,521
I wish you didn't have
to be one of them.

348
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,439
Max, please...

349
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,362
Shields are weakening.
We've almost got him.

350
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,405
Keep targeting
their weapons array.

351
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,240
One more torpedo
ought to do it.

352
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,201
Captain...
Fire.

353
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,375
Weapons are down!

354
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,003
Janeway to Ransom.
Surrender your vessel.

355
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,213
We still have thrusters,
don't we?

356
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,548
Aye, sir.

357
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,091
Lay in a course

358
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,468
through the planet's
atmosphere--

359
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,595
60-degree vector.

360
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,478
What the hell is he doing?

361
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,855
Follow him.

362
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,569
We're crossing
the upper thermosphere.

363
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,529
Phasers.

364
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,370
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

365
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,249
Shields are weakening--

366
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,210
31 percent...

367
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,502
29...

368
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,048
Inertial dampeners are off-line.

369
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,219
Captain, if we lose our shields,
we'll be attacked by the aliens.

370
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,344
(<i> grunts</i> )

371
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,555
Captain!

372
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,640
Break off pursuit!

373
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,188
They're retreating.

374
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,647
Take us up!

375
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,404
They took heavy damage--
shields, propulsion.

376
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,322
Get us out of here.

377
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,618
They've gone to warp.

378
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,494
Match their course
and speed.

379
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,914
We can't, not until we restore
primary systems.

380
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,040
Time?

381
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,291
We'll need
a few hours.

382
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,918
(<i> sighs</i> )

383
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,336
At least we didn't
come away empty-handed.

384
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,766
I want Ransom's tactical status.

385
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,102
I want it now, Mr. Lessing.

386
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,939
Or what?

387
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,899
You'll hit me?

388
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,028
No, Crewman.

389
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,615
I'll drop the shields
around this room,

390
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,410
and let your little friends
come pay you a visit.

391
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,996
That would be murder.

392
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,040
You could also call
it "poetic justice."

393
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,296
I suppose the plan is
that you're going to come
to my rescue now, right?

394
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,256
There's no plan
as far as I know.

395
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,799
The Captain's
on her own.

396
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,343
Ransom's
status, now.

397
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,345
No way in hell.

398
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,353
We all make our own hell,
Mr. Lessing.

399
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,523
I hope you enjoy yours.

400
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,233
The com is active.

401
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,651
We'll be outside

402
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,695
if you have a change of heart.

403
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,206
What are
you doing?

404
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,874
Weren't you listening?

405
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,501
Don't do this.

406
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,128
He'll break.

407
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,755
(<i> eerie whirring</i> )

408
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,551
Bridge to the Captain.

409
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,179
We've lost shields
in Section 29-Alpha.

410
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,722
I know. Stand by.

411
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,265
He's a loyal officer.

412
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,142
He's not going
to betray his Captain.

413
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,352
Put up the shields.

414
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,811
He'll break.

415
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,064
Captain!

416
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,899
As you were.

417
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,153
COMPUTER:
Level nine authorization
required.

418
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,654
Damn it, Kathryn!

419
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,781
You're panicking.
He's going to talk.

420
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,951
Captain, a fissure is opening
in that section.

421
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,410
Understood.

422
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,850
Okay, you've demonstrated
your loyalty to your Captain.

423
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:58,687
Fine. Now let's talk
about the Ankari.

424
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:07,154
If there's an Ankari vessel
less than two light-years
from here,

425
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,073
why haven't we
detected it?

426
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,158
Apparently, they use
a unique form of propulsion,

427
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,451
which makes them
hard to find.

428
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,288
You think they'll be
willing to help us?

429
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,415
It's worth a try.

430
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,750
Mr. Lessing has agreed
to show you how to
adjust the sensors.

431
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,252
Once you find
the Ankari ship,

432
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,212
set a course.
Aye, sir.

433
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:26,132
Did our prisoner disclose
any other information?

434
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,841
I'm afraid not.

435
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,136
The rest of you continue
with the repairs.

436
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,845
Dismissed.

437
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,724
Commander.

438
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,351
All right.

439
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,519
We're going to try
it your way.

440
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,688
But I want to make
one thing clear.

441
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,816
Our first priority
is to get Ransom.

442
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,360
If there's one thing
you've made clear, it's that.

443
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,696
We've had our
disagreements, Chakotay,

444
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,991
but you've never
openly opposed me.

445
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,617
You almost killed
that man today.

446
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,994
It was a calculated risk

447
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,745
and I took it.
It was a bad call.

448
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,538
I'll note your
objection in my log.

449
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,124
I don't give a damn
about your log.

450
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,792
This isn't about rules
and regulations.

451
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,169
It's about right and wrong.

452
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,878
And I'm warning you--

453
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,006
I won't let you
cross that line again.

454
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:11,385
Well then you
leave me no choice.

455
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,721
You are hereby
relieved of duty
until further notice.

456
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,894
What's happened
to you, Kathryn?

457
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,647
I was about to ask you
the same question.

458
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,786
They are not responding.

459
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,455
Tractor beam.

460
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,374
Captain, the Ankari ship
has done nothing to...

461
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,833
Just do it.

462
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:50,174
We're being hailed.
On screen.

463
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,967
Starfleet.

464
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,010
Yes.

465
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,470
Leave us alone.

466
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,389
There's nothing of value
on our ship.

467
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,140
We need your guidance.

468
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,434
Your spirits of good fortune
are attacking us.

469
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,769
Of course they are.
You've been killing them!

470
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,272
We are not the ones responsible.

471
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,316
<i>Equinox.</i>

472
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,859
That's right.

473
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,610
Can you communicate
with the aliens?

474
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,406
Release my ship.

475
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,865
I can't do that.

476
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,117
Not until you agree
to talk to them.

477
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,246
I will summon them,

478
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,206
but<i> you must talk to them.</i>

479
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,291
<i>You </i> must convince them.

480
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,924
(<i> eerie whirring</i> )

481
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,720
(<i> screeching</i> )

482
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:42,976
They say they want
the humans to die.

483
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,729
A difficult place
to start a negotiation.

484
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,273
Will they
understand me?

485
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,149
Yes.

486
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,151
We didn't do
this to you.

487
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,946
We're trying to stop
the humans who did.

488
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,949
(<i> screeching</i> )

489
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,743
They don't believe
you would harm your own kind.

490
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,288
We have rules
for behavior.

491
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,457
The<i> Equinox</i> has
broken those rules

492
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,292
by killing your species.

493
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,168
It's our duty
to stop them.

494
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,088
(<i> screeching</i> )

495
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,673
Give us the<i> Equinox.</i>

496
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,760
Give us
the<i> Equinox.</i>

497
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,764
They insist on destroying
the ones who were responsible.

498
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,642
We will punish them
according to our own rules.

499
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,520
(<i> screeching</i> )

500
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,481
They will be
imprisoned.

501
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,357
They will lose
their freedom.

502
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,276
(<i> screeching angrily</i> )

503
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,445
All right.

504
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,698
If you stop
your attacks,

505
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,909
I'll deliver
the<i> Equinox to you.</i>

506
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,869
Captain...
I know what I'm doing, Tuvok.

507
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,456
These beings would destroy
Captain Ransom and his crew.

508
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,374
What's their answer?

509
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,876
Your behavior is irrational.
We could find another solution.

510
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,711
I've already confined
my First Officer
to quarters.

511
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,255
Would you like
to join him?

512
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,632
Well?

513
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,216
(<i> screeching</i> )

514
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,759
They agree.

515
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,682
We're going
to need more fuel.

516
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,603
We've only got enough
left to jump another
500 light-years.

517
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,980
"Fuel"? Is that
the euphemism

518
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,815
we're using now?

519
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,901
You mean we need to
kill more life-forms.

520
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,403
Several more.

00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,380
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

703
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,216
<i>With the </i> Equinox <i> destroyed,</i>

704
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,011
<i>the aliens have withdrawn</i>
<i>to their realm.</i>

705
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,971
<i>I've reinstated Chakotay,</i>

706
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,348
<i>and we've set a course</i>
<i>for home.</i>

707
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,725
Good as new.

708
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,228
I'd like you to regenerate
for the next few hours.

709
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,396
It'll help stabilize
your cortical array.

710
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,274
Understood.

711
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,860
Regarding the...

712
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,696
unpleasantness
aboard the<i> Equinox,</i>

713
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,157
I hope you don't
think less of me.

714
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,284
Your program was altered.

715
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,828
It's quite disconcerting
to know that all
someone has to do

716
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,497
is flick a switch to
turn me into Mr. Hyde.

717
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,792
Perhaps you should
enhance your program
with security protocols.

718
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,669
It will prevent such
tampering in the future.

719
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,338
Good thinking.

720
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,340
When I'm done regenerating,
I will assist you.

721
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,133
Thanks.

722
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,427
You were off-key.
I beg your pardon?

723
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,223
"My Darling Clementine,"
third verse, second measure.

724
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,974
That's impossible.

725
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:57,354
Your vocal modulations
deviated by 0.30 deci-hertz.

726
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,814
I can assist you
with that as well.

727
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,192
Really?

728
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:05,778
Holodeck 2,
tomorrow, 1600 hours.

729
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,573
Just you, me...

730
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,243
and a tuning fork.

731
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,619
I look forward to it.

732
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,504
The last time we
welcomed you aboard,

733
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,757
you took advantage
of our trust.

734
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,260
You betrayed
this crew.

735
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,846
I won't make
that mistake again.

736
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,182
Noah Lessing,
Marla Gilmore,

737
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:37,685
James Morrow, Brian
Sofin, Angelo Tassoni,

738
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,605
you are hereby
stripped of rank.

739
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:44,150
You'll be expected to serve
as crewmen on this vessel.

740
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,527
Your privileges
will be limited,

741
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,696
and you'll serve
under close supervision

742
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,408
for as long
as I deem fit.

743
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,577
This time, you'll
have to earn our trust.

744
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,829
Dismissed.

745
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,421
Repairs?

746
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,172
Coming along.

747
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,722
How's the crew?

748
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,183
A lot of frayed nerves.

749
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,690
Neelix is organizing
a potluck...

750
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,526
to help
boost morale.

751
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,156
Will I see you there?

752
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,199
I'm replicating
the salad.

753
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,285
I'll bring the croutons.

754
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,665
Chakotay...

755
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,552
you know...

756
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,100
you may have had
good reason

757
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,894
to stage a little mutiny
of your own.

758
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,943
The thought had
occurred to me,

759
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,904
but that would have
been crossing the line.

760
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,036
Will you look at that.

761
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:30,507
All these years,
all these battles.

762
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,634
This thing's never
fallen down before.

763
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,687
Let's put it back up
where it belongs.
