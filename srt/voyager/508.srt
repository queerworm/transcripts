1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:04,171
DOCTOR:
...and since I was
the only crew member

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,090
who could survive
the corrosive atmosphere,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,635
it was up to me to
retrieve the data module

4
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,052
and save the day.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,974
Ah, here I am...

6
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:16,558
mission accomplished.

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,810
Ah...

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,561
DOCTOR:
Then, of course
there was

9
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,396
the perilous mission
to La'voti V.

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,357
You remember that one,
don't you, Mr. Paris?

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,651
How could I forget?

12
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:29,321
Here you are
after your unfortunate slip

13
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,366
into the fetid mud pits
of Pala Mar.

14
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,742
(<i> chuckling</i> )

15
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,827
Hey, I was pushed.

16
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:35,911
Of course you were.

17
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,454
JANEWAY:
Thank you,
Doctor.

18
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,456
We've all enjoyed
your holo-images enormously.

19
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,333
DOCTOR:
Oh, but I haven't
finished yet.

20
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,668
There's more?

21
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,252
The best is yet to come,
Lieutenant.

22
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,171
I've created a fascinating

23
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,009
12-part holographic essay
which I call "Under the Skin:

24
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,594
Humanoid Anatomy as Art."

25
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,263
Let's begin
with this stunning magnification

26
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,975
of the Vulcan
reproductive gland.

27
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,687
2100 hours, Commander.

28
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,397
All systems
reporting normal.

29
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,773
CHAKOTAY:
Acknowledged.

30
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,444
Like I said, it's 2100 hours.

31
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,946
I heard you the first time,
Harry.

32
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,407
They've been in
there over an hour.

33
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,784
I'm aware of that.

34
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,412
Didn't the Captain ask you
to rescue them after 30 minutes?

35
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,872
Harry, you and I
were lucky enough

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,791
to enjoy the Doctor's
scintillating exhibition

37
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,292
for two full hours.

38
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,295
Would it really be fair of us
to deny our friends

39
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,006
the same
unforgettable experience?

40
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,466
Of course not, sir.

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,723
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

42
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,349
We'll do it again soon.

43
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,477
We've still got thousands
of light-years to while away.

44
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,896
This could be a weekly event.

45
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,689
What happened to going
to Yellow Alert

46
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,315
after half an hour?

47
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,985
Commander Chakotay appears to
have disobeyed a direct order.

48
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,653
Definitely grounds
for court-martial.

49
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,821
(<i> Torres chuckles</i> )

50
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,284
Hey, Neelix.

51
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,410
Coffee?

52
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,161
I could use
a whole pot.

53
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,789
Let me guess.

54
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,417
The Doctor's
photographic essay?

55
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,210
One mind-numbing
image after the next.

56
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,796
Oh, I don't know.

57
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,090
I thought some of those
pictures were pretty funny.

58
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,175
You mean like the one where Tom
slipped into a mud pit?

59
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,427
(<i> laughing</i> )

60
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,553
You're famous.

61
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,888
Then, of course,
there's the one

62
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,431
depicting a certain
Chief Engineer

63
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,308
with her foot stuck
in a plasma injector.

64
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,643
What?

65
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,519
Really? Well, I seem
to have missed that one.

66
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,772
The Doctor must have taken it
out of the exhibition.

67
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,482
Oh, I can't wait to
get my hands on it.

68
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,234
Maybe I can distribute it to
everyone's personal database.

69
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,153
Try it
and I'll kill you...

70
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,240
right after I finish deleting
the Doctor's program.

71
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,201
What'd you put in
this coffee, Neelix?

72
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,041
KIM:
I'm reading
a massive energy wave

73
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,918
900,000 kilometers
off the starboard bow,

74
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,961
heading right for us.

75
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,962
Source?

76
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,046
Unknown.

77
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,840
Shields up.
Evasive maneuvers.

78
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,634
The wave just changed course.

79
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,969
It seems to be tracking us!

80
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,053
Go to warp 8.

81
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,805
Too late.
Engines are down.

82
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,222
Everybody hang on.

83
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,465
All stop.

84
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,633
Shields are holding.

85
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,342
Minor damage
to the hull plating

86
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,343
on Deck 15.

87
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,303
No injuries.

88
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,679
Stand down Red Alert.

89
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,807
KIM:
Captain, when
the wave hit,

90
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,934
our communications array
received a download.

91
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,310
What sort of download?

92
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,645
I'm not sure.

93
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,188
Lots of information.

94
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,482
I can't decipher it,
but there's an audio component.

95
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,276
JANEWAY:
Let's hear it.

96
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:21,989
(<i> screeching, whistling</i>
<i>alien language</i> )

97
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,079
Harry, try all the standard
decryption algorithms.

98
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,371
JANEWAY:
It's strange.

99
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,957
The wave
followed us,

100
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,375
but it didn't cause any damage.

101
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,922
Instead, we get a download
to our database.

102
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,674
I'd say it's a pretty good bet

103
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,509
somebody's trying
to tell us something.

104
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,802
PARIS:
The wave left

105
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,179
a residual ion trail.

106
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,346
We might be able
to locate its point of origin.

107
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,932
Set a course.

108
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,992
Looks like it's taken
quite a beating.

109
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,035
Life signs?

110
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,452
One. Nonhumanoid.

111
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,038
It's very faint.

112
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,080
Probably injured.

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,372
Beam it to Sick Bay.

114
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,916
Are you sure that's
wise, Captain?

115
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,710
I'm betting that
message we received

116
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,961
was some sort
of distress call

117
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,546
and if we're
going to help,

118
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,006
I'd rather do
it on<i> Voyager.</i>

119
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,092
The physiology is so unusual

120
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,469
the tricorder can't make heads
or tails of it.

121
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,222
The creature's
obviously injured,

122
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,307
but I haven't a clue
how to treat it

123
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,892
or even diagnose it.

124
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,686
My scans came up with something
interesting, Captain.

125
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,563
The interfaces on
the alien's vessel

126
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,149
can only be activated
chemically.

127
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,068
I'm guessing that this life-form

128
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,320
somehow interfaces directly
with the ship's systems

129
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,281
using biochemical secretions
to give commands.

130
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,075
That would explain
how it can fly a ship.

131
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,993
I'm hoping this can
also help us figure out...

132
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,161
(<i> alien screeches</i> )

133
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,413
(<i> Torres grunting,</i>
<i>alien screeching</i> )

134
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,790
(<i> yelling</i> )

135
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,500
No! You'll hurt B'Elanna!

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,960
Get it off of me!

137
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,712
Janeway to Kim.
Beam the alien life-form

138
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,340
<i>back to its vessel now!</i>

139
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,217
I'm having trouble
getting a lock.

140
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,260
(<i> gasping</i> )

141
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,178
It's piercing
her neck!

142
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,475
Her heart and lungs
are seriously compromised

143
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,228
and her kidneys are failing.

144
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,980
The creature's also secreting
some kind of paralyzing agent

145
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,107
into her bloodstream.

146
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,441
How do we get
it off her?

147
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,650
I can't remove it surgically,

148
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,236
not without doing
irreparable harm

149
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,445
to B'Elanna's internal organs.

150
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,988
Can we get a lock
on the creature--

151
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,031
transport it off?

152
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,490
Not unless we want to beam

153
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,743
B'Elanna's cardiopulmonary
system along with it.

154
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,036
PARIS:
We have to do something!

155
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,662
No one is disputing
that, Mr. Paris.

156
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,290
The question is, what? 

157
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,708
If I'm to have any hope
of devising a treatment,

158
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,919
I'll need to brush up
on my exobiology.

159
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,837
What do you mean,
"brush up"?

160
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,132
Don't you have all this
information in your database?

161
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,508
I may be a walking
medical encyclopedia,

162
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,052
but even I don't
know everything.

163
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,595
My matrix simply isn't
large enough.

164
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,222
Maybe we can do
better than giving you

165
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,141
a crash course
in exobiology.

166
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,226
Maybe we can provide
you with a consultant.

167
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,727
I'd be delighted, but how?

168
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,897
By isolating the computer's
exobiology data files

169
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,858
and merging them
into an interactive matrix.

170
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,444
A hologram.
Exactly.

171
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,028
That may not be
as simple as it sounds.

172
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,239
It would need to be nearly
as sophisticated as I am--

173
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,532
tactile interfaces,
personality subroutines...

174
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,951
Harry could do it.

175
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,995
Search the database
for a leading exobiologist.

176
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,413
If you want to add
a personality,

177
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,123
it may as well be based
on a real person.

178
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,874
I'll have Harry meet you
on Holodeck 2.

179
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,835
Stay with her
and monitor her vital signs.

180
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,128
Call me if there's any change.

181
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,095
KIM:
I still have my doubts
about this, Doc.

182
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,014
It's one thing to
create a simple hologram,

183
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,515
but you're trying to merge

184
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,725
an extensive database
with an interactive matrix.

185
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,102
Don't be a pessimist,
Mr. Kim.

186
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,354
Together, we'll create

187
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,189
a masterpiece
of holographic art.

188
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,065
A subject for your
next slide show?

189
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,566
Perhaps.
Can't wait.

190
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,195
What's the name of that
exobiologist you chose?

191
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,322
Crell Moset.

192
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,698
Here's the file.

193
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,116
Let's start with
the parameters

194
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,493
for physical
appearance.

195
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,662
Computer, display
a holographic simulation

196
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,122
of Crell Moset.

197
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,959
Have you mentioned
to anyone else

198
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,378
that this guy's
a Cardassian?

199
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,629
What difference
does it make?

200
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,755
Maybe you haven't heard.

201
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,882
They're not the exactly

202
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,425
the friendliest folks
in the galaxy.

203
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,135
I don't care if he's
the nastiest man

204
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,513
who ever lived, as long as he
can help us save B'Elanna.

205
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,014
Good point.

206
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,059
Computer, transfer
all referenced medical files

207
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,768
to the simulation.

208
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,145
<i>Transfer complete.</i>

209
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,731
Now install
personality subroutines

210
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,774
and voice approximation.

211
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,818
<i>Installation complete.</i>

212
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,115
Dr. Moset, I'd like
to consult with you

213
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,616
about an alien life-form.

214
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,203
(<i> squeaky, distorted voice):</i>
I am Crell Moset,

215
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,705
Chief Exobiology Specialist
Cardassia Prime,

216
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,208
(<i> staticky</i> ):
...to perform
all surgical procedures.

217
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,377
This is going well.
What's wrong?

218
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,670
Some sort of overload
in the interactive matrix.

219
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,464
Can you clear it up?

220
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,882
I'm trying.

221
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,010
Computer, install
a recursive algorithm.

222
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,721
<i>Algorithm installed.</i>

223
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,681
Try it again.

224
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,392
Dr. Moset?

225
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,603
(<i> normal voice</i> ):
My friends call me Crell.

226
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,530
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Crell.

227
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,532
And you, good man,
what's your name?

228
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,994
Actually, I'm in between
names at the moment.

229
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,788
I'm an Emergency
Medical Hologram.

230
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,373
Interesting.

231
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,083
But his friends
call him Doc.

232
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,710
Aha. May I presume?

233
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,129
Certainly.

234
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,006
So, Doc, how can an
old surgeon like me

235
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,968
help a technological
<i>marvel</i> such as yourself?

236
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,803
Oh, well...

237
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,264
I've got a patient
with a rather unusual problem.

238
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,225
She's become fused
with a nonhumanoid life-form

239
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,518
I know nothing about.

240
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,353
Nonhumanoid exobiology

241
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,314
happens to be one
of my specialties.

242
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,399
That's exactly why we've
created your program.

243
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,650
Program?

244
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,110
You're a hologram as well.

245
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,488
Interesting.

246
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,197
I'd like to see the
patient right away.

247
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,991
Mr. Kim, would you do
the honors, please?

248
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,576
No problem.

249
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,744
Listen,
if he destabilizes again,

250
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,371
take him off-line
and call me.

251
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,414
Understood.

252
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,461
Lieutenant,

253
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,795
may I present
Crell Moset?

254
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,380
It's a pleasure.

255
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,715
She's been drifting
in and out of consciousness.

256
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,551
Don't be rude, Lieutenant.

257
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,676
To him?

258
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,180
No offense, Doc,
but he's just a...

259
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,223
A brilliant scientist
who's here to help us.

260
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,975
This way, Crell.

261
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,478
Hmm... I can see why
you're having difficulty.

262
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,229
Its physiology
doesn't match

263
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,898
any of the standard
templates in our database.

264
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,818
My guess would be
a cytoplasmic life-form.

265
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,070
I agree. And from
what I can tell,

266
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,239
it has co-opted
her vital systems.

267
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,574
She's Klingon...

268
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,536
No, the cranial ridges
are less pronounced.

269
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,702
Klingon-human hybrid.

270
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,954
Exactly.

271
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,289
Let's hope your instincts

272
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,291
about the creature
are equally insightful.

273
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,417
I'm afraid

274
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,419
this one is going
to require more

275
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,004
than a visual assessment.

276
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,131
You have an
isomolecular scanner.

277
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,884
No. Just a standard issue
Starfleet tricorder.

278
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,680
No wonder you're having problems
making an accurate diagnosis.

279
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,140
I suggested an upgrade
to the Starfleet people

280
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,850
at a joint medical conference,

281
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,688
but they assumed I was
just an arrogant Cardassian

282
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,399
trying to prove
his superiority...

283
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,568
or maybe they thought
I was a spy.

284
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,944
I hope you weren't
too offended.

285
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,946
It's an unfortunate reality.

286
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:23,076
Sometimes even enlightened
races can't find common ground.

287
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:29,040
I may be able
to recalibrate this thing.

288
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,000
There. That should help.

289
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,965
Amazing.

290
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:42,136
Well, someone from Starfleet
appreciates me.

291
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,974
I've instructed the computer
to assign symbols

292
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,394
to all the tones received
in the transmission.

293
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,523
Looks like there were over
10,000 separate sounds

294
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,024
used in this section
of the message.

295
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,610
It's going to be
a tough code to crack.

296
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,860
Maybe we can get
a little help

297
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,404
from the alien
vessel's data banks.

298
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,988
Good idea.
Janeway to Seven of Nine.

299
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,532
<i>Yes.</i>

300
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,701
Any chance of downloading
the alien's data banks?

301
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,244
<i>We're looking for anything</i>

302
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,246
<i>that might help us</i>
<i>understand their language.</i>

303
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,373
<i>We don't know how much time</i>
<i>B'Elanna has left.</i>

304
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,041
We must move quickly.

305
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,502
The vessel is on the verge
of a complete systems failure.

306
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,170
Prepare to
download the data.

307
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,589
I heard the Captain.

308
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,133
Is there a problem?

309
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,468
No. No problem.

310
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,886
You seem uncomfortable
taking orders from me.

311
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,639
It's just that I'm
used to taking orders

312
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,056
from B'Elanna,
that's all,

313
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,891
and to tell you the
truth, she doesn't...

314
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,560
Doesn't like me.
Yes, I am aware of that.

315
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,270
However, the Captain
left me in charge

316
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,812
during Lieutenant Torres'
absence.

317
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,523
Her feelings about me
are irrelevant.

318
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,525
Activate the interface
transceiver.

319
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,611
Begin the download.

320
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,738
I'm picking up

321
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,989
a fluctuation

322
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,949
in the alien ship's
power source.

323
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,744
It's disrupting
the interface transceiver.

324
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,703
Reinitialize.

325
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,079
I'm working on it.

326
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,791
Its systems are overloading.

327
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,208
Red Alert.

328
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,752
<i>Engineering to Bridge.</i>

329
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,920
<i>The alien vessel</i>
<i>is destabilizing.</i>

330
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,798
<i>Its destruction is imminent.</i>

331
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,716
Can you download
the information first?

332
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,593
We're trying.

333
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,720
Captain, it's going to explode.

334
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,138
Ensign, back us off.

335
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,899
What do we know so far?

336
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,068
The life-form has taken
control of her body

337
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,445
at the autonomic level,

338
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,405
drawing proteins
from her tissues,

339
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,449
white blood cells
from her arteries.

340
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,242
Which can be interpreted
in several ways.

341
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,536
A form of attack.

342
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,078
I find it odd

343
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,331
that a species would evolve
an attack mechanism

344
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,291
that would leave it
so vulnerable.

345
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,252
Why not do its damage
and retreat?

346
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,796
A parasite perhaps?

347
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,297
Yes, I think so,

348
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,800
but not any ordinary variety.

349
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,136
It's unlikely it could
sustain itself like this

350
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,680
over the long term.

351
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,306
Its own systems
are damaged.

352
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,016
It's doing this
as a stopgap measure

353
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,893
to keep itself alive.

354
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,104
So the patient's heart,
lungs, kidneys--

355
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,233
they're all augmenting
the alien's damaged system.

356
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,984
It's using B'Elanna
as a life preserver.

357
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,779
But if it needs
her to survive,

358
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,741
it's not about to let
go without a fight.

359
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,158
I'd like to think
that's a fight

360
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,243
you and I can win.

361
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,245
We do work well
together.

362
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,999
I just wish we had
access to my laboratory.

363
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,087
It has all the instrumentation
we would need.

364
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,756
Well, we'll just
have to improvise.

365
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,298
Not necessarily.

366
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,885
We may be able to create
a reasonable facsimile

367
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,511
of your laboratory
in our holodeck--

368
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,763
providing, of course,

369
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,598
you can give an
accurate description.

370
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,480
Tom.

371
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,735
Hey, there.

372
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,196
I can't move.

373
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,699
I know.

374
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,991
But don't worry.

375
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,702
We'll get this thing off you.

376
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,871
Just think.

377
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,289
I could force
you to listen

378
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,665
to rock 'n' roll all day

379
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,793
and you wouldn't be able
to do a thing about it.

380
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,421
Who is that?

381
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,839
Relax.

382
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,507
He's just a hologram--

383
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,843
a specialist in exobiology.

384
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,344
The Doc thinks
he might be able

385
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,138
to help you.

386
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,390
Can't he find somebody else?

387
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,226
Apparently, this guy's the best.

388
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,521
Besides, he's just
a walking database.

389
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:25,693
Hologram or not,
he's Cardassian.

390
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,986
As far as I'm concerned,

391
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,863
they're all
cold-blooded killers.

392
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,908
I understand how you feel.

393
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,661
Unfortunately,
that cold-blooded killer

394
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,705
may be the only one
who can save your life.

395
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,175
Impressive.

396
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,760
Mm.

397
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,095
Is this where you did your work
on the Fostossa virus?

398
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,890
No. Actually, I was

399
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,727
on Bajor at the time,
during the occupation.

400
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,981
A sad chapter in
Cardassian history.

401
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,566
We had no business
being there,

402
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,528
but try telling that
to the politicians.

403
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,447
When I think of the resources
that were squandered,

404
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,533
the lives that were lost...

405
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,369
From what I understand,
you saved thousands of lives.

406
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,914
In retrospect,
I don't know how.

407
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,958
The military had
everything they needed,

408
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,376
but the civilian hospitals?

409
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,420
No staff,
the crudest equipment...

410
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,421
Don't tell me.

411
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,673
You were forced
to improvise.

412
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,633
Yes!
I know what that's like.

413
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,176
I didn't have
the resources

414
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,471
to try traditional methods,
so I experimented

415
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,517
with procedures that never
would have occurred to me

416
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,435
under ordinary circumstances.

417
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,606
The discovery of the cure was
almost accidental, really.

418
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,941
You're being
modest, Crell.

419
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,150
No.

420
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,527
You made
medical history.

421
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,487
You won the Legate's
Crest of Valor.

422
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,155
Awards aren't
important, Doc.

423
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,991
It's the work
that matters.

424
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,159
Of course.

425
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,287
Still, the recognition
of your peers, your government,

426
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,873
must be very satisfying.

427
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,208
I'm sure you've made your
share of breakthroughs.

428
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,379
Naturally. Unfortunately,
no one from Starfleet

429
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,797
ever hears about them.

430
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,173
I toil in obscurity.

431
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,843
Why don't you show me
your patient records?

432
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,804
At least I'll know about
your accomplishments.

433
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,347
All right.

434
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,767
Everything seems
to be in order.

435
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,226
Shall we get to work?

436
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,938
Computer, create
a holographic re-creation

437
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,439
of the alien in Sick Bay.

438
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,526
Hand me that cortical
stimulator, will you?

439
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,072
Yes. Thank you.

440
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,910
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

441
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,328
<i>While the Doctor seems</i>
<i>to be making progress,</i>

442
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,623
<i>Commander Chakotay and I</i>
<i>have hit a wall</i>

443
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,126
<i>in our attempt</i>
<i>to decipher the alien message.</i>

444
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,753
It was a distress call, right?

445
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,380
So maybe if we retransmitted
that message,

446
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,967
others of the species would
realize we need their help.

447
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,927
We don't know
where they are.

448
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,470
We'll send it on
all subspace bands.

449
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,097
If they're out there,
they'll hear it.

450
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,723
They might turn out
to be unfriendly.

451
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,725
The Doctor's pretty sure
the alien is simply

452
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,811
trying to survive. I agree.

453
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,395
It'll be a difficult
first contact,

454
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,188
but we might find a way
to communicate.

455
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,732
It's worth a shot.

456
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,863
Tuvok, reroute auxiliary power
to the deflector dish.

457
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,741
Retransmit the alien's message
on all subspace bands.

458
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,242
TUVOK:
Aye, Captain.

459
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,038
Deflector at full capacity.

460
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,540
Chakotay.

461
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:34,214
(<i> humming melody</i> )

462
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,342
(<i> humming same melody</i> )

463
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,344
(<i> humming together</i> )

464
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,727
I'm sorry.

465
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,646
My wife tells me
I'm tone deaf.

466
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,730
Not at all.

467
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,773
You were right on key.

468
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,358
If you enjoy music,

469
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,069
we can run some opera programs
after we're finished.

470
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,362
I'd like that.

471
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,198
I think we're ready
for a look inside.

472
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,533
Scalpel?

473
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,286
Forgive me for saying so,

474
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,539
but this appears to be
a rather crude instrument,

475
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,708
especially when we have
such advanced equipment

476
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,250
at our disposal.

477
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,836
I often find
the simplest tool

478
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,212
is the most effective.

479
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,339
All of our
elaborate scanners

480
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,590
and laser scalpels--

481
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,092
they remove us
from our subjects.

482
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:21,137
Actually feeling
the anatomy,

483
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,222
the consistency of
the internal organs,

484
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,141
it can be very
instructive.

485
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,686
Why don't you
do the honors?

486
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:33,024
Make a vertical incision, say,
12 centimeters, starting here.

487
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:37,987
(<i> squealing</i> )

488
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,864
We're hurting it.

489
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,824
Doctor, it's a hologram.

490
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,826
Of course.

491
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,871
I guess as a hologram myself,
I have a certain empathy.

492
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:47,955
Keep going.

493
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,546
Extraordinary.

494
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,548
Look at that
series of nodes.

495
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,758
They appear
to be clustered

496
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,926
along the
primary nerve.

497
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,594
Multiple neocortices,
I'd say.

498
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,679
Suggesting a highly
intelligent species.

499
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,432
Yes, but also presenting
us with a point of attack.

500
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,558
Attack?

501
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,435
If we induce
a neurostatic shock

502
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,770
in one of these nodes,

503
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,563
I believe it will
travel to the others,

504
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,356
the creature will
lose motor function

505
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,150
and we'll be able
to remove it.

506
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,569
The procedure will probably
kill the creature.

507
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,820
Probably.

508
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,073
I'd like to find a way
to save them both.

509
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,117
So would I
in an ideal situation,

510
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,701
but we have to set
priorities,

511
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,912
which, in this case,
is your crewmate.

512
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,496
This is a sentient
life-form.

513
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,664
For all we know,

514
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,499
it could be this
species' Einstein,

515
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,667
its Picasso.

516
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,795
Or he could be
a psychotic criminal.

517
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,463
The point is,
we don't know

518
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,381
and we have
choices to make.

519
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,467
Your program's
destabilizing.

520
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,676
This is such poor timing.

521
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,178
I'll have to take
you off-line,

522
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,638
but don't worry.

523
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,307
We'll have you up and
running again in no time.

524
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,518
Computer, take Medical
Consultant Program off-line.

525
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,520
Doctor to Ensign Kim.

526
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,730
Go ahead, Doc.

527
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,356
<i>Our new program's</i>
<i>destabilizing.</i>

528
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,608
I'll meet you in Sick Bay.

529
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,277
We'll try
to reinitialize him there.

530
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,820
Tabor, I could use some help.

531
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,946
Yes, sir.

532
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,909
KIM:
Try again.

533
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:07,910
No luck.

534
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,328
Would it be easier

535
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,998
if we reduced
the hologram's memory load?

536
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,249
Maybe, but I don't want

537
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,375
to do that unless
we absolutely have to.

538
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,588
What's going on?

539
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,216
My consultant's gone off-line.

540
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,302
The Cardassian?

541
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,512
You can leave him off.

542
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,265
I'm surprised
by your attitude, Lieutenant.

543
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,267
I never took you for someone

544
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,811
who would make generalizations
based on race.

545
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,771
When it comes to Cardassians,

546
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,108
I'm guilty as charged.

547
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:43,196
I understand your experience
with them was unpleasant,

548
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,531
but if you give Crell a chance,
I think you'll find

549
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,700
that he's a friendly,
compassionate man,

550
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,952
not to mention a genius
who's trying to save your life.

551
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,956
I'll skip the introductions
if it's all the same to you.

552
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,499
Suit yourself,

553
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,544
but you should know
I plan on asking the Captain

554
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,672
to keep him on
as a permanent consultant.

555
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:05,467
I'm not the only one who's going
to have a problem with that.

556
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,890
How's it coming?
We're close.

557
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,474
Actually, I think
that should do it.

558
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,893
Good.

559
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,186
Computer, reactivate

560
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,730
Medical Consultant Program
Beta-1.

561
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,483
Hello, again.

562
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,361
My God.

563
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,570
What's wrong?

564
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,322
That's Crell Moset.

565
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,532
Yes. Do I know you?

566
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,078
He killed my brother,
my grandfather--

567
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,913
hundreds of people.

568
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,249
He's a mass murderer.

569
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,463
You must be mistaken.

570
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,924
It's no mistake.

571
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,926
Moset performed experiments
on living people.

572
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,011
Thousands of Bajorans
were killed

573
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,304
in his so-called hospital.

574
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,264
Is this true?

575
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,514
No, no. He's...

576
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,641
There must be some
misunderstanding.

577
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,935
The liar.

578
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,228
Take it easy, Tabor.

579
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,146
Whoa. He's just
a hologram.

580
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,398
I'm upsetting him.

581
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,523
I should go.

582
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,816
I'm sorry about this.

583
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,526
(<i> sighs</i> )

584
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,238
Computer, transfer
Medical Consultant Program

585
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,739
to Holodeck 2.

586
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,373
TABOR:
I can still remember

587
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,167
the sounds
his instruments made...

588
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,045
the screams of his patients...

589
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,130
the smell...

590
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,464
of chemicals and dead flesh.

591
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,053
He operated on
my grandfather...

592
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,846
exposed his
internal organs

593
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,640
to nadion radiation.

594
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,475
It took six days
for him to die.

595
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,396
He blinded people so he
could study how they adapted,

596
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,356
exposed them to polytrinic
acid just to see

597
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,900
how long it would take
for their skin to heal.

598
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,736
Ensign, the man you're accusing
cured the Fostossa virus.

599
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,572
He stopped an epidemic that
killed thousands of Bajorans.

600
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,490
By infecting hundreds
of people...

601
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,369
so that he could experiment
with different treatments--

602
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,912
old, helpless people...

603
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,622
like my grandfather...

604
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,874
because he considered
their lives worthless.

605
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,460
How do you know this?

606
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,044
Everybody knew.

607
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,464
I remember some of the Maquis
under my command

608
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,425
talking about an infamous
Cardassian doctor.

609
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,387
Could these simply
have been rumors

610
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,973
spread by Bajorans
who hated the Cardassians?

611
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,141
I was there.

612
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,977
I don't understand

613
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,355
why this isn't
in our database.

614
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,857
The Cardassians
didn't exactly publicize

615
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,859
their wartime medical practices.

616
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,487
I wouldn't be surprised
if the real Moset went on

617
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,113
to live a normal life.

618
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,740
He's the Chairman
of Exobiology

619
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,409
at the University of Culat.

620
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,372
We may not be able
to do anything

621
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,539
about the real
Moset, Commander...

622
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,418
but the program
should be destroyed.

623
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,420
Every trace of
that man's research

624
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,297
should be deleted
from the database.

625
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,135
I had a bad feeling
about that hologram

626
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,512
the second I saw him.

627
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,930
Looks like your instinct
was right.

628
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,226
I won't let him near me.

629
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,769
You're kidding, right?

630
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,272
No, I am dead serious.

631
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,940
B'Elanna...

632
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,402
If I let that pig
operate on me...

633
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:13,239
I'll be benefiting
from other people's suffering.

634
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,907
You're not being rational.

635
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,243
I won't do it.

636
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,537
(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

637
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,372
What's happening?

638
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,541
Her cytotoxin levels are
going through the roof.

639
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,625
Pulse is rapid
and irregular.

640
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,462
No doubt you've said
something to upset her.

641
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:32,132
What she's upset about, Doc,
is your Cardassian buddy.

642
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,092
Tell him.

643
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,427
DOCTOR:
Tell me what?

644
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,720
She refuses
to let him treat her.

645
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,139
B'Elanna, we're very close
to a solution.

646
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,266
Do it...

647
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,725
(<i> panting):</i>
...without him.

648
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,810
I don't know that I can.

649
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,937
Find another way.

650

(<i> gasps</i> )

651
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,607
She's going

652
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,651

658
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,758
DOCTOR:
Ensign.

659
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,884
You wanted to see me?

660
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,303
We've been looking
for evidence

661
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,221
that might support
Tabor's accusations.

662
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,431
Anything?

663
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,141
Actually, that's
why we called you here.

664
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,976
It's not looking good.
Show me.

665
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,311
We've been reviewing data

666
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,062
on the Cardassian
occupation of Bajor--

667
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,814
the alleged site
of Moset's crimes.

668
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,649
Strategic information,
log entries kept in battle,

669
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,320
sensor scans from Starfleet
vessels-- this, for example.

670
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,531
Requisition records from
one of Crell Moset's hospitals.

671
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,241
He was purchasing
biochemical agents,

672
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,743
including every known strain
of the Fostossa virus.

673
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,621
Of course he needed
samples of the virus.

674
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,539
That's how vaccines
are developed.

675
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,707
Take a look at
the requisition orders.

676
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,711
DOCTOR:
Moset didn't ask for
any of the enzymes

677
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,047
normally required for
synthesizing a vaccine.

678
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,424
It gets worse.

679
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,968
Four days after he received
the virus samples,

680
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,677
there was a minor outbreak
of Fostossa

681
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,096
in the vicinity
of his hospital.

682
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,680
Prior to that date,

683
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,935
there had not been a single case
in the entire province.

684
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,479
I have to report
these findings

685
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,147
to Commander Chakotay.

686
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,026
It is curious.

687
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,695
The Borg are accused of
assimilating information

688
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,406
with no regard for life.

689
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,575
This Cardassian
did the same

690
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:24,077
and yet, his behavior
is tolerated.

691
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,342
Ah, there you are.

692
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,053
I'm almost ready
to begin the surgery.

693
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,597
Lieutenant Torres won't allow
you to have anything to do

694
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,683
with her treatment.

695
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:48,060
Because of that Bajoran?

696
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,854
We've gathered some
corroborating evidence.

697
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,315
It appears that he's
telling the truth.

698
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,275
You committed
a series of atrocities

699
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,277
during the Cardassian War.

700
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,406
Thousands of Bajorans
died on your surgical tables.

701
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,199
That's absurd.

702
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,369
And even if it were true,
I'm only a hologram

703
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,247
and I have no memory
of those events.

704
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,749
They're not part
of my programming.

705
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:15,337
But you are the holographic
representation of Crell Moset.

706
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,215
Your program,
despite all its brilliance,

707
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,427
is based on his work.

708
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,429
He infected patients,

709
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,266
exposed them to polytrinic acid,
mutilated their living bodies

710
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,519
and now we're reaping the
benefits of those experiments.

711
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,940
Medically, ethically,
it's wrong.

712
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,610
What do you suggest
we do about it?

713
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,362
I'm not sure.

714
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,198
We may have
to delete your program.

715
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,617
Delete me?

716
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,619
What about our patient?

717
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,996
I suppose I'd have to try
and treat her on my own.

718
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,833
No offense,
but you need me.

719
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,918
I realize that.

720
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,336
You're a physician.

721
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,172
You know there's always
a price to pay

722
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,134
for the advancement
of medical science.

723
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,843
Sometimes that price
is too high.

724
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,262
Torture?

725
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,056
Your word, not mine.

726
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,726
I cured the Fostossa virus,
didn't I?

727
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,312
So these experiments
you say I conducted

728
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,355
obviously helped me
devise a treatment.

729
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,899
Imagine how many lives
would have been lost

730
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,859
if I hadn't eliminated
this disease.

731
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,153
That doesn't justify

732
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,822
using people
in laboratory experiments.

733
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,824
As I explained to you,

734
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:30,537
during the occupation,
I was forced to improvise.

735
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,373
I used what resources I had.

736
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,418
And ethical considerations,
they mean nothing to you?

737
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,963
Ethics are arbitrary.

738
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:46,136
How do you suppose your own
database was developed? Hmm?

739
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,807
My God, half the medical
knowledge acquired on Earth

740
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,810
came through experiments
on lower animals.

741
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,394
But not people.

742
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,438
It's convenient
to draw a line

743
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,149
between higher and lower
species, isn't it?

744
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,401
This is the 24th century, Crell.

745
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,154
Your kind of barbarism
ended a long time ago

746
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,072
or, at least, it should have.

747
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,367
What difference
does it make

748
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,828
how long ago the
research occurred?

749
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:13,246
What matters is
that we can use it

750
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,081
to help patients today.

751
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,418
Now, are you going

752
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:25,217
to delete my program and all
of the research it contains,

753
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:30,013
or are we going to use it
to save B'Elanna's life?

754
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,478
(<i> door chimes</i> )

755
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,146
Come in.

756
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,357
Commander.

757
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,779
This request of yours
to be relieved of duty--

758
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,239
I won't grant it.

759
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,115
I have the right
to resign my commission.

760
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,492
For what reason?

761
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,161
Moral objections
to this ship's medical policy.

762
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,997
(<i> sighs</i> )

763
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,917
I understand how
difficult this is for you,

764
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,086
but you've got to
let go of the past.

765
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,796
Focus on today,
and today,

766
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,256
B'Elanna's life
is in danger.

767
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,091
Everything else
should be put aside.

768
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,259
You don't have the right

769
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,719
to violate the memory
of my family.

770
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,721
As long as that Cardassian
hologram is on line,

771
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,264
that's exactly
what you're doing.

772
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,766
It's not that simple.

773
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,308
It is to me.

774
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,770
Crell Moset killed thousands
of people in his hospitals.

775
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,189
As long as we're willing
to benefit from his research,

776
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,691
we're no better than he is.

777
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,197
If I had weeks, or even days,

778
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,199
maybe I could come up
with an alternative,

779
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,744
but time is of the essence
and Moset's idea will work.

780
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,203
Then you've got
to use it.

781
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,497
Even if the Doctor
could perform the surgery

782
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,832
without Moset's help,

783
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,542
he'd still be using
the man's research.

784
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,586
That would be going
against B'Elanna's wishes.

785
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,129
We're talking about
a woman who has

786
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,590
alien tendrils
sapping the life out of her.

787
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,592
She's obviously
not thinking straight.

788
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:49,593
On the contrary.

789
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,344
Her concerns are based in logic.

790
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,221
(<i> scoffing</i> ):
Logic?

791
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,515
If the Doctor uses knowledge
that Moset gained

792
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,643
through his experiments,
we would be validating

793
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,145
his methods, inviting
further unethical research.

794
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,772
We'd be setting
a terrible precedent.

795
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,149
We're in the middle
of the Delta Quadrant.

796
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,108
Who would know?

797
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,652
We would know.

798
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,027
Fine.

799
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,947
Let's just deactivate
the evil hologram

800
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,114
and let B'Elanna die.

801
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,032
At least, we'd have
our morals intact.

802
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,952
Tom.
And you, Chakotay,

803
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,829
since when do you care
what Starfleet thinks?

804
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,622
This isn't about rules
and regulations.

805
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,165
This is about doing
what's right.

806
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,750
Spoken like a true Maquis.

807
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,585
Well, if you'd just
set aside your hatred

808
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,128
of the Cardassian
for one second...

809
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,506
Enough, Lieutenant.
All right, all right.

810
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,133
The arguments have been made
and we're running out of time.

811
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,468
The fact is, you're both right.

812
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,761
But when it comes down to it,

813
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,554
the only issue
I'm concerned about

814
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,516
is the well-being of that
crew member lying in Sick Bay.

815
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,851
We'll wrestle with the morality

816
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,101
of this situation later--

817
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,562
after B'Elanna is
back on her feet.

818
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,148
Doctor, you have
my authorization to proceed

819
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,775
with Moset's assistance.

820
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,818
Yes, Captain.

821
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,195
Any consequences
of this decision

822
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,155
will be my responsibility.

823
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,408
Dismissed.

824
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,711
Thanks.

825
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,684
MOSET:
Scalpel.

826
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,575
Ensign Kim,
do you hear something?

827
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,243
Hear what?

828
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,412
A series of
high frequencies.

829
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,080
They are getting louder.

830
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,249
Must be those Vulcan
ears of yours.

831
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,084
(<i> high-pitched alien language)</i>

832
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,460
I hear it, too.

833
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,921
Anything on sensors?

834
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,171
(<i> alien language gets louder)</i>

835
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,257
It appears to be
an alien com signal.

836
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,926
Triaxilating wavelengths.

837
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,260
Origins?
Unknown.

838
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,970
(<i> signal getting very loud</i> )

839
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,180
KIM:
Captain, a vessel just
dropped out of warp.

840
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,724
Approaching fast
off the port bow.

841
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,767
On screen.

842
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,351
(<i> loud signal continues</i> )

843
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,311
CHAKOTAY:
Can we dampen
it a little?

844
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,479
Negative.

845
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,440
(<i> signal stops</i> )

846
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,860
Harry, tell me that was just
their way of saying hello.

847
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,278
I wish I could.

848
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,906
The universal translator
doesn't have a clue.

849
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,867
Perhaps they are waiting
for our response.

850
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,453
Well, then,
let's give them one.

851
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:25,999
Open a channel,
all subspace bands.

852
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,210
This is Captain Janeway of
the Federation Starship Voyager.

853
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,880
We cannot interpret
your message,

854
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,632
but please try to understand,

855
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,594
we are on a peaceful mission
and we intend you no harm.

856
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:41,264
We have one of your kind
on board our ship.

857
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,850
It's injured and we're
attempting to provide treatment.

858
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,184
If you can understand...

859
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,186
(<i> loud, screeching</i>
<i>alien language</i> )

860
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:52,109
MOSET:
I'm ready to stimulate
the primary neural pathways.

861
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,403
Cortical probe.

862
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,242
I'm applying it
to the primary neocortex.

863
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,619
(<i> shrieking</i> )

864
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,664
Its motor control
is weakening,

865
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,208
but not enough to
release the patient.

866
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,796
Our little friend
needs a bigger jolt.

867
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,841
I'm increasing the
pulse frequency...

868
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,216
(<i> shrieking</i> )

869
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,718
The synapses
are degenerating.

870
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,845
You're killing it.

871
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,721
Don't lose your
nerve, Doctor--

872
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,056
not when we're
this close.

873
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,641
Lower the pulse
frequency.

874
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,060
If I do that, the creature
will regain control.

875
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,394
I don't care.
Lower the pulse.

876
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,022
Doctor...
Lower the pulse frequency

877
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,690
or I'll take
your program off-line.

878
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,029
You realize you're reducing
our chances of saving her?

879
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,196
Not necessarily.

880
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,405
Give me the probe.

881
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,033
The probe, Doctor.

882
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,913
If we apply the pulse
to the secondary neocortex,

883
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,415
we should be able to
achieve the same results

884
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,416
at a lower frequency.

885
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,711
Not particularly
efficient.

886
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,382
But it might prove
interesting.

887
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,093
I'm reading an energy surge
in their forward section.

888
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,260
(<i> rumbling</i> )

889
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,180
Shields!

890
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,437
Doctor to Bridge.
The holodeck's going off-line.

891
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,773
<i>What's happening up there?</i>
Stand by, Doctor.

892
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,109
They've locked on to us
with some sort of tractor beam.

893
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,652
It's draining our power.

894
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,030
CHAKOTAY:
Reroute emergency power
to the holodeck.

895
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,782
Send an antimatter surge
through the shield matrix.

896
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,367
See if that'll
loosen their grip.

897
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,286
No effect.

898
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,747
We do have weapons.

899
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,207
No. If they wanted
to destroy us,

900
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,875
they wouldn't be using
a tractor beam.

901
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,793
They're trying to rescue
their crew member.

902
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,795
Captain...
This isn't about logic, Tuvok.

903
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,089
It's about instinct.

904
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,715
Now, I may not speak
their language,

905
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,258
but I have a gut feeling

906
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,468
they don't want an armed
conflict any more than we do.

907
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,262
Bridge to Doctor.
What's your status?

908
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,806
The procedure's working.
Almost there, Captain.

909
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,267
It's losing motor control.
The tendrils are withdrawing

910
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,228
from her lungs,
liver, kidneys...

911
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:54,022
(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

912
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,774
The alien's life signs
are failing.

913
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,817
We need a substitute
for the metabolic energy

914
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,027
it was taking from B'Elanna.

915
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,947
Could we restore
its own metabolism?

916
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,032
Perhaps. Give it
40 milligrams of stenophyl.

917
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,118
It's going
into anaphylactic shock.

918
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:10,329
All right. Increasing
the dosage to 60 milligrams...

919
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,290
We've lost power
on Decks 7 through 12.

920
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,708
Shields are failing,
Captain.

921
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,709
Doctor?

922
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,961
Stand by, Captain.

923
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,420
Anaphylaxia
is subsiding.

924
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,881
Its electrolytic reactions
are increasing.

925
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,050
Its metabolism is
stabilizing on its own.

926
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,010
Bridge, beam the life-form
to its ship.

927
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,642
Transport complete.

928
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,186
The alien ship is
withdrawing, Captain.

929
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:38,900
(<i> alien signal resumes</i> )

930
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,026
You're welcome.

931
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,994
I've released B'Elanna
to her quarters.

932
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,703
Her condition?

933
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,748
Stable, but her nervous system
has suffered extreme trauma.

934
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,209
She'll need time to recover--
several days, at least.

935
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,003
Good work.

936
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,088
I should caution you, Captain--

937
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,882
when I told her
that we'd used Moset's program,

938
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,550
she was unhappy,
to put it mildly.

939
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,178
I nearly had to sedate her.

940
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:09,931
It sounds like her Klingon
temper has fully recovered.

941
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,684
It practically qualifies
as a chronic condition.

942
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,187
(<i> sighing</i> ):
I'll speak to her.

943
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,771
There's one more topic
of concern.

944
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,940
Should we delete the program

945
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,985
or keep Moset in our database
for future emergencies?

946
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:27,032
I'm inclined to leave
this up to you, Doctor.

947
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,326
You are the Chief Medical
Officer on this ship.

948
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,911
As far as I'm concerned,
there's no one

949
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,413
more qualified than you
to make that decision.

950
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,373
Thank you, Captain.

951
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,875
But please make it quickly.

952
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,293
I'm eager to resolve
this matter.

953
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,128
There's been enough
moral controversy

954
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,296
on this ship for one day.

955
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,219
(<i> door chimes</i> )

956
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,261
Come in.

957
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,183
At ease.

958
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,186
Interesting fragrance.

959
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,230
I'm surprised
it hasn't set off

960
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,856
the environmental alarms.

961
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,525
It's a combination
of mental relaxant

962
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,569
and expeller of demons.

963
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,696
It's an ancient Klingon remedy.

964
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,324
Feeling any better?

965
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,326
I'm alive.

966
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,245
I hope you can understand

967
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,414
why I went against
your wishes, B'Elanna.

968
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,457
Losing you
was unacceptable.

969
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,005
I know you're angry, but we
need to put this behind us.

970
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,090
Understood?

971
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,091
Is that an order?

972
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,800
Yes.

973
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,636
You can't order someone to get
rid of an emotion, Captain.

974
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,597
And what emotion is that?

975
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,975
You had no right
to make that decision for me!

976
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,769
I'm the Captain.

977
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,645
You're my crewman.

978
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,481
I did what I thought best.

979
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:49,072
I get the feeling there are
still a few demons in the air.

980
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,741
Let's hope this does
the trick, hmm?

981
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,792
(<i> humming</i> )

982
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,090
Doc...

983
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,258
how's our patient?

984
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,384
Recuperating.

985
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,719
(<i> sighing</i> ):
We did it.

986
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,097
Yes... we did.

987
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:17,350
A celebration is in order.

988
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,936
How about listening
to that opera

989
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,855
you promised me?

990
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,565
Oh, you're, uh...

991
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,736
still wrestling with
your ethical subroutines.

992
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,322
Take my advice.

993
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,449
It's a waste of time.

994
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:36,453
What's important is that
we saved two lives today.

995
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm not concerned with today.

996
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,958
It's tomorrow I'm worried about.

997
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,128
Captain Janeway has left
your future in my hands.

998
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,421
She believes that,

999
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,381
as<i> Voyager's</i> Chief
Medical Officer,

1000
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,757
it's up to me to decide

1001
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,261
whether your program
remains in our database.

1002
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:59,184
Personally, I predict a long
and fruitful collaboration

1003
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,143
between us.

1004
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,602
Oh?

1005
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,647
Think about
what we accomplished

1006
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,649
in the last 24 hours.

1007
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,610
Our first case was a triumph.

1008
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,946
Both patients are thriving

1009
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:16,201
and we advanced the frontiers
of medical science.

1010
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,703
I've already outlined a paper

1011
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,873
that you and I
will one day present

1012
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,583
to the Federation
Medical Academy:

1013
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:28,546
"Total Systemic Invasion
of a Klingon-human Hybrid

1014
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,509
By a Cytoplasmic
Pseudo-parasite."

1015
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:35,512
Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

1016
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,348
Are we also going to tell them

1017
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:40,975
where you honed
your surgical techniques?

1018
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,144
A footnote, perhaps--

1019
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:47,399
"For further details,
see Cardassian death camps."

1020
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,567
Those techniques
were crucial this morning.

1021
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,110
Where was your sarcasm then?

1022
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,406
I didn't come here to debate
the issue with you, Crell.

1023
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,740
I came here to inform you

1024
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,992
of my decision.

1025
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,954
"It is my judgment that

What about the well-being
of your crew?

You're confronted by
new forms of life every day--

1034
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,355
many of them dangerous.

1035
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,357
You need me.

1036
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,983
Delete my program

1037
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:35,196
and you violate the first oath
you took as a physician:

1038
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,241
"Do no harm."

1039
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:42,954
"Do no harm..." you have
no right to say those words.

1040
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,539
Computer...

1041
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,832
You can erase my program,
Doctor,

1042
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,960
but you can never
change the fact

1043
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,837
that you've already used
some of my research.

1044
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:57,427
Where was your conscience
when B'Elanna was dying

1045
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:00,096
on that table?

1046
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:03,182
Ethics? Morality?

1047
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,226
Conscience?

1048
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,187
Funny how they all go
out the airlock

1049
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,855
when we need something.

1050
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:17,071
Are you and I
really so different?

1051
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,954
Computer, delete
