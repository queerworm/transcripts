1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,549
Ah!

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,176
Surprised?

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,764
(<i> grunts</i> )

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,184
What's wrong?

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,771
Can't figure out
why I'm still not running, huh?

6
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,147
Can't read my thoughts?

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,237
Go ahead. Attack!

8
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,198
Take my ship.

9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,616
Damn ship!

10
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,201
Hold together.

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,619
Hold.

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,959
Ah! Ah!

13
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,249
Wormhole?

14
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,376
TUVOK:
Approximately
400 million kilometers

15
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,670
from our current position.

16
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,463
Take a look at the
transkinetic vector.

17
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,382
It leads to Sector 001.

18
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,926
It looks like
a wormhole,

19
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,637
but we're detecting
massive bioplasmic activity.

20
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,805
That suggests a life-form.

21
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,306
Neutrino flux?

22
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,850
Erratic.

23
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,935
A direct route
to Earth's doorstep

24
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,227
out of the blue.

25
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,480
What's wrong with
this picture?

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,107
We should launch
a probe.

27
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,692
Go to Yellow Alert.

28
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,610
Prepare a class-5 probe.

29
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,946
Let's see
what's really out there.

30
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,868
<i>Daily Log, Seven of Nine.</i>

31
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,244
<i>While we failed to locate</i>
<i>a new source of deuterium,</i>

32
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,204
<i>our mission had</i>
<i>educational value</i>

33
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,124
<i>for at least</i>
<i>one member of the crew.</i>

34
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,502
If you go looking for
deuterium tomorrow,

35
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,753
can I come?

36
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,964
Well, that's up to the Captain.

37
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,465
It's likely
you'll be replaced

38
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,925
by a more
experienced officer.

39
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,844
But this is my
first away mission

40
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,345
and I didn't get
to do anything.

41
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,972
I disagree.

42
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,516
You familiarized yourself
with this vessel.

43
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,561
Well, can't we make first
contact with somebody

44
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,146
or get in a
space battle?

45
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,271
Yeah...

46
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,398
can't we?

47
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,649
Another time, perhaps.

48
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,111
Hey, Naomi,
you want to take the helm?

49
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,154
Can I?

50
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,321
Ensign.

51
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,781
She'll be familiarizing herself

52
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,158
with the vessel.

53
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,576
Here.

54
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,078
Okay.

55
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:07,206
First, bring us up to
one-quarter impulse.

56
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,624
Hit this control,
then that one.

57
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,045
One-quarter impulse, aye.

58
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,964
Now, you think you can chart
a course back to<i> Voyager?</i>

59
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,674
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,938
They're in a hurry.

61
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,355
Crewmen Boylen
and White--

62
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,191
frequently late for
their duty shifts.

63
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,026
Ah.

64
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,445
Speaking of late,
I'll make a deal with you.

65
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,863
I'll explain to Sam

66
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,282
why her daughter's
two hours late for bedtime

67
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,201
if you start
on the survey report.

68
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,410
Acceptable.

69
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,661
Have fun.

70
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,587
You're back.

71
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,005
I was beginning to worry.

72
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,466
The survey took longer
than expected.

73
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,717
Lucky our
deuterium shortage

74
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,010
is no longer
an issue.

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,387
A wormhole.

76
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,764
KIM:
The wormhole.

77
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,849
It leads all
the way back to Earth.

78
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,351
The odds of finding
such a phenomenon

79
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,519
are infinitesimal.

80
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,981
Never bet
against the house.

81
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,860
What are you doing?

82
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,695
Looking
for anomalous readings.

83
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,239
You will find none.

84
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,116
He's right-- no
subspatial contortions,

85
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,284
no temporal variance.

86
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,952
The probe we sent
in has already

87
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,288
picked up faint signals
from the other side.

88
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,956
B'Elanna's still
downloading them,

89
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,541
but she's pretty sure
they're from Starfleet.

90
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,335
This wormhole is only
300 million kilometers away.

91
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,964
Long-range scans
should've detected it days ago.

92
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,924
Perhaps it was
an oversight on your part.

93
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,219
If it'll make you feel
better, run a diagnostic.

94
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,513
In the meantime,
let's maintain course.

95
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,446
(<i> door chimes</i> )

96
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,532
Come in.

97
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,075
I've completed my diagnostic.

98
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,077
Sensors are operating
at peak efficiency.

99
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,745
Then there's nothing
to worry about.

100
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,206
On the contrary.

101
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,624
The wormhole's neutrino levels
are extremely erratic.

102
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,043
I thought so, too...

103
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,003
until I received this.

104
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,048
It turns out those
faint signals we detected

105
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,924
were communiquÃ©s from Starfleet.

106
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,220
They assure me the neutrino flux
is nothing to worry about.

107
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,470
Starfleet may be in error.

108
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,889
We should run further scans.

109
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,517
No time.
The wormhole might destabilize.

110
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,436
The Doctor often instructs me,
"to look before I leap."

111
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,939
It is an antiquated adage,

112
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,440
but I believe
it is relevant.

113
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,817
I have another one for you--

114
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,069
"He who hesitates is lost."

115
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,611
Captain...

116
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,031
I think we're avoiding
the real issue here, Seven.

117
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,866
You're still feeling
uncomfortable

118
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,743
about returning
to the Alpha Quadrant.

119
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,328
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

120
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,081
Trust me. You're going
to thrive on Earth

121
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,457
just as you've thrived
on<i> Voyager.</i>

122

(<i> door chimes</i> )

123
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,585
Yes?

124
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,796
Letter number two.

125
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,631
I'm getting jealous.

126
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,221
Mark.

127
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,639
Apparently his engagement
was broken off.

128
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,100
What about you?
Any news?

129
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,643
A full pardon and
reinstatement to Starfleet.

130
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,478
I've even been offered
a professorship

131
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,939
in anthropology
at the Academy.

132
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,899
JANEWAY:
Oh, Chakotay,
congratulations,

133
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,317
but it's not fair.

134
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,319
CHAKOTAY:
Don't worry.
It's only part-time.

135
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,613
JANEWAY:
How am I expected to run
a ship without you?

136
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,198

00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,788
Ambassador?

183
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,709
I guess they thought I'd
have a flair for quadrupeds.

184
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,967
(<i> excited conversation</i> )

185
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,809
Ensign, I require
a moment of your time.

186
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,811
Sure.

187
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,397
Have you noticed
anything unusual

188
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,690
about the crew's behavior
since we returned?

189
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,650
Like...?

190
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,486
When I presented
the Captain with evidence

191
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,821
that the wormhole may not
be what it appears to be,

192
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,365
she seemed unconcerned.

193
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,658
Really? That doesn't
sound like her.

194
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,868
I believe the crew

195
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,620
is being deceived
by false telemetry,

196
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,997
as well as overly-optimistic
correspondence.

197
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
The letters from home?

198
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,001
I got one, too.

199
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,753
No doubt containing
good news.

200
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,338
Oh, I'll say.

201
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,466
An old buddy of mine
offered me a spot

202
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,426
at the new test flight center
in Australia.

203
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,386
Beautiful beaches,

204
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,179
a chance to pilot

205
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,514
the latest experimental ships.

206
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,057
I can't believe it.

207
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,310
Then you doubt the veracity
of the letters as well.

208
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,437
Are you kidding?

209
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,398
I've already written back
and accepted the job.

210
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,991
Computer, activate the EMH.

211
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,285
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

212
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,496
The wormhole is not
what it appears to be.

213
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,289
I believe that
the crew is being...

214
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,873
Hold on. Wormhole?

215
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,125
You weren't informed.

216
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,502
Not a peep.

217
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,545
Considering
everyone's recent behavior,

218
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,921
that's not surprising.

219
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,672
Since the discovery
of this wormhole,

220
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,134
the crew has ignored obvious
signs that it's a deception.

221
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,677
You must determine if there
is a physiological explanation.

222
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,472
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Seven of Nine to the Bridge.</i>

223
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,807
On my way.

224
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,060
I'll call in a few crewmen
for routine examinations.

225
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,770
That should allow me to run

226
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,230
the necessary
diagnostics.

227
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,364
We've just entered
visual range.

228
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,032
I thought you'd like
to take a look.

229
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,618
We're starting
to get images

230
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,119
from the other side.

231
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,372
There is
considerable interference.

232
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,167
I think I can help clear it up.

233
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,795
Try it now.

234
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,066
How long
until we reach the wormhole?

235
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,985
53 minutes.

236
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,071
Maintain course.

237
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,906
CHAKOTAY:
All hands, this is the Bridge.

238
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,782
Secure all systems.

239
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,245
JANEWAY:
When we reach Earth's orbit,
lay in a descent trajectory,

240
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,207
North American continent,
Starfleet Headquarters.

241
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,634
Computer,
perform a gravimetric scan

242
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,345
of the wormhole's interior.

243
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,598
Look for inconsistencies
in the spatial gradient.

244
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,726
<i>The anomaly is consistent</i>
<i>with a class-1 wormhole.</i>

245
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,436
<i>No irregularities detected.</i>

246
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,647
Recalibrate sensors
and try again.

247
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,734
<i>No irregularities detected.</i>

248
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,820
Isolate grid 925 and magnify.

249
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,535
Computer, is that a vessel
in grid 91?

250
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,203
<i>No vessel has been detected.</i>

251
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,749
Open a com channel.

252
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,292
<i>Channel open.</i>

253
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,253
Alien vessel,
this is the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

254
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,963
Respond.

255
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,423
Alien vessel...

256
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,843
<i>Who are you?</i>

257
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,388
Seven of Nine,
Federation Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

258
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,889
Our ship is on
an intercept course

259
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,601
3.4 light-years
from your position.

260
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,311
<i>Turn around.</i>

261
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,397
<i>You're being deceived.</i>

262
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,649
How?

263
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,358
<i>He knows what you want.</i>

264
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,785
Computer, identify the cause
of the power failure.

265
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,120
TUVOK:
Captain's orders.

266
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,913
Power from Astrometrics
has been rerouted

267
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,416
to the navigational array,
at least until we've completed

268
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,042
our journey
through the wormhole.

269
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,004
I've made contact with a vessel
inside the anomaly.

270
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,297
Starfleet?

271
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,507
Alien.

272
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,592
The pilot attempted
to warn us away.

273
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,225
Sensors show no record
of an incoming transmission.

274
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,977
The sensors are malfunctioning.

275
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,604
He said we were being deceived,

276
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,148
that the wormhole is not
what it appears to be.

277
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,693
The preponderance of data
suggests otherwise.

278
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,235
The data is flawed.

279
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,237
As is your reasoning.

280
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,325
May I ask you
a personal question?

281
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,288
Are you looking forward
to seeing your wife and family?

282
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,207
Indeed.

283
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,836
And is that desire stronger
than you expected it to be?

284
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,587
Your point?

285
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,422
I believe
you are being manipulated.

286
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,175
Someone or something
is compromising your logic.

287
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,136
Otherwise, you would be willing
to listen to my concerns.

288
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,515
Access to the Astrometrics Lab

289
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,226
is restricted
until further notice.

290
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,604
Dismissed.

291
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,625
(<i> soft clattering</i> )

292
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,006
(<i> thump</i> )

293
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,866
Naomi Wildman.

294
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,951
Your presence here
is unauthorized.

295
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,745
State your intentions.

296
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,330
I'm... hiding.

297
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,874
From whom?

298
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,083
Everyone.

299
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,543
They're all acting strange.

300
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,295
Even Mom.

301
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,088
Elaborate.

302
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,007
She keeps smiling all the time,
talking about Earth

303
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,968
like it's the greatest place
in the universe.

304
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,513
You do not share your mother's
desire to return to Earth?

305
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,724
<i>Voyager's</i> my home.

306
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,102
If we go to Earth,
I'll have to leave the ship.

307
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,021
I'd miss my room, Neelix...

308
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,317
you and I wouldn't be able
to play Kadis-Kot anymore.

309
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,697
Curious.

310
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,617
You and I appear to be
the only ones not affected.

311
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,952
Affected by what?

312
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,121
I am not certain.

313
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,249
Stay here until I return.

314
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,346
Computer, activate EMH.

315
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,974
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

316
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,391
Where's the Doctor?

317
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,434
Off-line.

318
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,811
Why?

319
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:00,979
Starfleet orders--

320
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,605
something about the wormhole

321
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,858
interfering with
the holographic systems.

322
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,817
They didn't want

323
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,985
to damage
his program.

324
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,444
He must be reactivated.

325
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,697
No can do, not until
we're on the other side.

326
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,365
It's urgent.

327
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,284
Believe it or not,
I am capable of handling

328
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,745
almost any medical problem
you might have.

329
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,717
I was just coming
to see you.

330
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,301
Why?

331
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,846
I'm afraid I have
some troubling news.

332
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,181
Evidently, our wormhole
passes through

333
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,684
a layer of subspace
monitored by the Borg.

334
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,143
Starfleet's concerned

335
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,729
that your neural
transceiver

336
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,731
might attract some
unwanted attention.

337
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,524
We need to deactivate
your implants.

338
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,859
You should not
attempt to do so

339
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,318
without the Doctor's
supervision.

340
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,778
Unfortunately,
he's off-line.

341
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,113
Then the procedure
is inadvisable.

342
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,491
Try to relax. We're only
going to keep you in stasis

343
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,284
until we've reached
the Alpha Quadrant.

344
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,745
I realize
the prospect

345
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,372
of returning to Earth
is frightening to you.

346
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,417
It's perfectly natural for you
to resist the unknown,

347
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,835
but you're in good hands.

348
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,504
Resistance is futile.

349
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,597
JANEWAY:
What's our distance, Tom?

350
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,143
2,000 kilometers and closing.

351
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,355
Good-bye, Delta Quadrant.

352
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,443
No more Hirogen hunting parties,
Malon garbage scows.

353
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,819
By this time tomorrow,

354
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,448
it'll be Cardassians,
Romulans, Ferengi...

355
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,033
<i>Chakotay to the Bridge.</i>

356
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,534
Go ahead.

357
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,202
<i>I've spoken to Seven of Nine.</i>

358
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,038
<i>We're putting her into stasis.</i>

359
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,289
Well, make it fast.

360
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,916
We don't want the Borg to crash

361
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,542
our welcome
home party.

362
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,298
I need to adjust
my regeneration parameters.

363
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,638
How long will I
remain inactive?

364
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,432
A couple of hours
to be on the safe side.

365
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,733
Security alert!

366
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,321
Naomi Wildman.

367
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,993
<i>Security's on their way,</i>

368
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,869
Chakotay.
What happened?

369
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,372
<i>Seven's trapped us behind</i>
<i>some kind of Borg force field.</i>

370
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,666
Try to disable it.

371
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,586
CHAKOTAY:
Naomi...

372
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,379
go back to your quarters.

373
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,673
Pay attention to me.

374
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,508
If this indicator
begins to flash,

375
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,760
enter the following
series of commands.

376
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,512
Watch carefully.

377
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,638
Naomi.

378
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,890
Do you understand?

379
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,143
Yes.

380
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,686
Naomi...

381
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,521
I'm giving you a direct order.

382
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,648
Step away from the console.

383
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,199
She's blocking my commands.

384
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,703
Keep trying.

385
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,626
Computer, lock onto
my coordinates

386
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,712
and initiate
a site-to-site transport.

387
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,838
Main Engineering.

388
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:31,856
Seven?

389
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,733
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,745
We've got phaser fire
in Engineering.

391
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,413
Janeway to Security.

392
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,000
Computer, erect a level-10
force field around Engineering.

393
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,587
Lock out the command controls
with Borg encryption code 294.

394
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,881
Seven's tapping
into the engine manifold.

395
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,841
She's trying to shut down
impulse drive.

396
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,020
Bridge.

397
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,272
She has erected
another force field.

398
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,649
<i>It will require several minutes</i>
<i>to deactivate it.</i>

399
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,527
Where is she exactly?

400
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,864
Engineering
Console 16-Beta.

401
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,449
Captain?

402
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,993
I'm sending an EM surge
to that station.

403
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,914
Seven's going into stasis
whether she likes it or not.

404
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,421
She's down, Captain.

405
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,423
PARIS:
Captain...

406
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,050
we're at the threshold.

407
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,510
JANEWAY:
Take us in.

408
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,865
Report.

409
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,785
It's just spatial turbulence.

410
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,829
JANEWAY:
It's beautiful.

411
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,008
Steady as she goes.

412
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,624
Seven, wake up.

413
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,709
Seven of Nine.

414
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,420
Wake up.

415
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,963
(<i> groaning</i> )

416
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,300
Force field.

417
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,945
You are damaged.

418
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,822
It's just a scrape.

419
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:32,990
The crew?

420
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,702
Unconscious. Sort of.

421
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,579
(<i> deep, groaning rumble</i> )

422
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,915
(<i> console beeping</i> )

423
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,001
Our hull is demolecularizing.

424
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,836
Do wormholes do that?

425
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,673
No... they don't.

426
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,925
Return to your quarters

427
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,302
while I assess the situation.

428
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,887
But I can help.

429
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,596
My mom says two heads

430
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,224
are better
than one.

431
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,767
Isn't that
the Borg philosophy, too?

432
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,479
Simplistic, but accurate.

433
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,772
Please...
I don't want to be alone.

434
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,711
Neelix!

435
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,009
Oh, Neelix.

436
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,263
He will survive.

437
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,475
Neelix.

438
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,143
We must keep moving.

439
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,773
Naomi Wildman.

440
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,155
We will return for him.

441
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,923
I don't think that's Earth.

442
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,258
No.

443
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,260
So, where are we?

444
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,646
I've restored partial systems.

445
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,234
I'm reading
organic compounds,

446
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,278
bioplasmic
discharges,

447
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,072
a vast network
of neural pathways.

448
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,657
Is it a life-form?

449
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,453
If it is,
it's the largest I've seen--

450
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:45,372
over 2,000 kilometers
in diameter.

451
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,751
What are you doing?

452
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,462
My earlier scans
revealed a vessel.

453
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,005
I'm trying to find it again.

454
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,965
Somebody else is stuck here?

455
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,842
Possibly.

456
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,844
There.

457
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,138
It's heavily damaged,
but still functioning.

458
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:04,475
Alien vessel, respond.

459
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,561
<i>This is the Starship</i> Voyager.

460
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,062
<i>Please respond.</i>

461
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,068
I told you
to stay away.

462
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,820
Why didn't you listen?

463
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,532
<i>Our crew believed they were</i>
<i>returning to their homes.</i> 

464
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:23,243
<i>Everything</i>
<i>they've always wanted, correct?</i>

465
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,204
Yes.

466
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,913
<i>He deceived them.</i>

467
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,291
"He"?

468
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,001
I believe
we should work together

469
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,378
to escape this anomaly.

470
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,254
Lower your shields
and I'll beam you aboard.

471
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,341
<i>Shields are the only thing</i>
<i>holding my ship together.</i>

472
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,800
<i>I'd be destroyed.</i>

473
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,428
I will enhance
your shield emitters.

474
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,348
<i>You won't fool me that easily.</i>

475
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,017
I assure you
we are not a deception.

476
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,144
<i>Oh, how convenient.</i>

477
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,106
<i>An enormous starship</i>
<i>comes to my rescue.</i>

478
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,360
<i>You might try</i>
<i>a more subtle approach.</i>

479
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,321
My scans indicate
that your shields will fail

480
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,198
in approximately 15 minutes.

481
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,076
Join us, or you can
remain on your vessel,

482
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,328
secure in the knowledge
that you were not deceived,

483
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,206
but that knowledge will do you
little good when you are dead.

484
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,627
Decide now.

485
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,631
<i>All right.</i>

486
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,759
<i>All right!</i>

487
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,932
<i>I'm taking my shields down.</i>

488
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,293
Ow!

489
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,302
You look real enough,
but over the years,

490
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:08,056
he's made me believe
many things are real--

491
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,643
a fortune at my fingertips,

492
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,604
good friends
risen from the dead.

493
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,564
You're referring
to the anomaly

494
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,774
we've entered.

495
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,192
"Anomaly"?

496
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,527
It's a beast.

497
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,696
Cunning, deadly.

498
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,490
What does it want?

499
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,992
You...

500
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,827
your ship...

501
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,371
antimatter, biomatter.

502
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,457
He consumes it.

503
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,293
Everyone believed
it was a wormhole.

504
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,836
Hmm, telepathy...

505
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,922
psychogenic manipulation.

506
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,468
He senses your thoughts,
your desires,

507
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,804
and then he preys on them.

508
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,305
Like a pitcher plant.

509
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,724
Pitcher plant?

510
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,352
The Doctor taught me about it
in botany class.

511
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,520
It catches insects

512
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,689
by mimicking
pheromones.

513
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,315
Yes, you're right,

514
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:02,319
but this one
doesn't eat insects.

515
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,407
He eats starships.

516
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,035
You are familiar
with this life-form?

517
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:13,997
Familiar? I've been hunting it
for nearly 40 years.

518
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,375
And have you become impervious
to its telepathy?

519
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:22,255
Almost, but there are days
when he can still trick me.

520
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,299
Like yesterday.

521
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:29,054
I thought I had found a way
to kill him once and for all.

522
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,516
I'd allow him
to begin consuming my ship,

523
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:37,979
and then I'd fly directly
to his most vulnerable system--

524
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,816
his primary neural plexus. Boom!

525
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,986
I'd destroy him
from the inside out.

526
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,865
But he knew.

527
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:53,370
He showed me
what I wanted to see.

528
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,541
I was nowhere near
his neural plexus.

529
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:01,961
I was flying directly
into his digestion chamber.

530
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,926
And speaking of digestion...

531
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,845
How do we get out
of the monster?

532
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,513
It's not a monster.

533
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,140
It's a bioplasmic organism,
and we will find a way out.

534
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,809
MALE:
No.

535
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,562
The girl's right.

536
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,439
He's a monster

537
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,943
and the only way out
is to destroy him.

538
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,995
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

539
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,997
Your ship is
being devoured.

540
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,959
I'd say that's
an emergency.

541
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,127
NAOMI:
The monster

542
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,503
ate his ship, too.

543
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,755
"Monster"?

544
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,924
I want to see your
weapons manifest.

545
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,133
"Weapons"?

546
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,676
This is a Sick Bay,
not an arsenal.

547
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,177
What's going on?

548
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,472
<i>Voyager</i> has been lured
into the digestive chamber

549
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,098
of a bioplasmic organism.

550
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,726
We require your assistance
in charting an escape route.

551
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,312
Slow down. The last
thing I remember

552
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,272
I was speaking
to Mr. Paris.

553
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,316
He said the wormhole posed
a threat to my program.

554
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,402
MALE:
The beast has been
manipulating your crew.

555
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,695
The moment he realized you were

556
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,988
beginning to suspect something,

557
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,157
he made sure
you were deactivated.

558
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,909
And who
might you be?

559
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,076
The local
monster expert?

560
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,703
As a matter
of fact,

561
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,831
I am.

562
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:23,168
He's been fooling you for days,
creating false sensor readings,

563
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,755
and he's been altering
your crew's thought patterns--

564
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,425
a little neurogenic telepathy
to make them lower their guard.

565
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,261
That might explain
the heightened dopamine levels

566
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,681
I found during my "routine
examinations" of the crew.

567
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,474
Have you informed
the Captain?

568
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,851
She's asleep.

569
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,018
Asleep?

570
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,603
It's our proximity
to the creature.

571
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,271
The neurogenic field
is stronger here.

572
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,649
It's already rendered most
of the crew unconscious.

573
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,901
Does your vessel's database
contain information

574
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,277
on the creature's anatomy?

575
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,320
Of course.

576
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,197
Retrieve it.

577
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,784
In the meantime,
let's work

578
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,870
on a wake-up call
for the crew.

579
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,344
Computer, increase
neurotransmitter levels

580
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,388
by 29 percent.

581
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,848
A cortical inhibitor?

582
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,599
I thought it
might disrupt

583
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,018
the organism's
hold on her.

584
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,185
It won't.

585
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,437
I already tried
a similar procedure.

586
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,106
I don't remember asking
for a second opinion.

587
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,107
(<i> groans</i> )

588
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,234
It's working.

589
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,861
She's regaining
consciousness.

590
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,991
Doctor.

591
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:39,160
You're being exposed to
a powerful neurogenic field.

592
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,454
You've been unconscious
for several hours.

593
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,209
They're here.

594
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,879
Who?

595
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,214
The Maquis.
They're alive!

596
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,925
B'Elanna, you're
still on<i> Voyager.</i>

597
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,217
You're hallucinating.

598
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,011
Starfleet thinks
you've all been killed.

599
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,096
Computer, increase
neurotransmitter levels

600
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,097
another ten percent.

601
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,139
What happened?

602
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,641
B'Elanna, focus
on my voice.

603
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,727
She doesn't want to.

604
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,071
They never want to.

605
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:37,052
It's the silence I hate...

606
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,931
the way he takes you
without a fight.

607
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,225
It was the same way
with the<i> Nokaro.</i>

608
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:51,733
A crew of nearly 3,000--
families mostly, mine included--

609
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:56,071
looking for
a new world to settle,

610
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,449
but they came across
our friend here

611
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,077
and he showed them
what they wanted to see--

612
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:08,291
a glistening green paradise.

613
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,586
By the time I responded
to their distress call,

614
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,588
all that was left of them

615
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,883
was some fading
engine emissions.

616
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,928
That was 39 years ago.

617
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:23,348
39 years, two weeks,
four days...

618
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,850
Do you mind?

619
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,476
The situation is
dismal enough.

620
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:30,480
I'm just trying to explain
who we're up against.

621
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,232
Well, I'm getting
a pretty good idea on my own.

622
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,776
Judging by these bio-scans,

623
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,820
the organism's been
devouring life-forms

624
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,237
for a bit longer
than 39 years.

625
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,782
I'd estimate
it's at least 200,000 years old.

626
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,910
The intelligent always survive.

627
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,411
I wouldn't go that far.

628
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,622
It appears to operate
on highly evolved instinct.

629
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,125
I haven't detected
any signs of sentience.

630
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,251
Oh, he's intelligent,
all right--

631
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,380
smart enough to fool your crew

632
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,506
into taking
you off-line.

633
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,466
No need to
get personal.

634
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,467
(<i> laughs</i> )

635
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,261
(<i> rumbling</i> )

636
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,429
Seven.

637
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,015
I'm here.

638
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,311
Are we still inside
the monster?

639
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,148
Yes, but we are going
to find a way out.

640
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,108
MALE:
There!
This is it!

641
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,902
Exactly what we need.

642
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,116
These class-9 torpedoes
in your weapons manifest.

643
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,743
If we can bring
your vessel deeper

644
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,495
into the creature's
digestive tract

645
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,748
and detonate one
of these charges,

646
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,624
we might be able
to destroy it.

647
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,502
Starfleet's not in the habit
of killing life-forms.

648
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,505
Even if that life-form
is about to kill you?

649
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,216
If I could take a few hours

650
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,634
to examine the creature
more thoroughly...

651
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,802
SEVEN:
There is no time.

652
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,054
We kill him!

653
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,391
Maybe there's another way.

654
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,685
Explain.

655
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,062
Any living organism,

656
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,312
no matter how large,

657
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,357
will attempt to expel
a foreign body.

658
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,028
If we could just make
<i>Voyager</i> a little less tasty...

659
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,488
My scans indicate that your
weapons are tetryon-based.

660
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,324
If you were to fire one
at a pocket of antimatter

661
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,410
released from our warp core,
it would produce

662
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,079
an electrolytic
reaction.

663
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,997
Would that
make<i> Voyager</i> taste bad?

664
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:15,334
It might at that.

665
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,799
Once I've beamed you
back to your ship,

666
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,135
try adjusting your shields
to this frequency.

667
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,053
You'll find them
more resistant

668
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,638
to the bioplasmic
discharges.

669
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,890
You seem to know a
little about everything--

670
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,351
medicine, exobiology,
shield harmonics.

671
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,479
I'm something
of a renaissance EMH.

672
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,355
I could use
a crewmate like you.

673
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,399
The beast would have
a difficult time

674
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,444
manipulating
a hologram's desires.

675
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,863
An Ishmael to your Ahab?

676
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,615
No, thank you.

677
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:48,326
You're turning down
the hunt of a lifetime.

678
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,287
As appealing as that sounds,

679
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,914
I'm a doctor,
not a dragon slayer.

680
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,834
My program requires
that I do no harm.

681
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,502
Shame.

682
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,354
Qatai's vessel is ready.

683
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,857
I've rerouted Bridge controls
to Engineering--

684
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,359
ops, tactical, helm--
all integrated into one station.

685
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,527
Efficient.

686
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,820
I thought
you'd like it.

687
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,113
I'm plotting a course

688
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,532
for the organism's
esophageal aperture.

689
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:31,203
Prepare to release
the antimatter.

690
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,046
Hull integrity's dropped
another 13 percent.

691
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,089
Doctor.

692
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,465
Ready on my end.

693
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,218
<i>Voyager</i> to Qatai.
Prepare to fire.

694
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:51,223
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

695
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,807
Wait! Wait!

696
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,519
No, no. No, no, no.

697
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,063
What's wrong?

698
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,814
<i>That last jolt</i>

699
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,902
must have destabilized
my targeting sensors.

700
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,905
I could establish an interface
to<i> Voyager's</i> targeting array.

701
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,199
<i>Don't bother.</i>
<i>I know my ship.</i>

702
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,909
<i>It's just being stubborn.</i>

703
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,121
Ah!

704
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,086
Ready.

705
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:24,130
Initiate the burst on my mark.

706
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,257
Now.

707
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,354
Like the taste of that?

708
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:40,939
I'm reading violent contractions

709
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,775
throughout
the digestive chamber.

710
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,402
It's working.

711
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,904
We're moving back through
the esophageal aperture.

712
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,910
<i>Voyager</i> has been expelled.

713
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,662
We're 3.9 kilometers
from the organism.

714
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,914
After just one burst?

715
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,749
For a big fellow,

716
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,335
he certainly has a low tolerance
for tummy ache.

717
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,421
Qatai's vessel was
also released.

718
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,838
Hail him.

719
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,930
<i>Why haven't you ejected</i>
<i>a second burst?!</i>

720
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,598
We've cleared the organism.

721
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,225
<i>You've been deceived!</i>

722
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,311
<i>We're both still inside it!</i>

723
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,313
(<i> console beeping</i> )

724
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,397
He's right.

725
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,982
I'm reading bioplasmic energy.

726
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,444
I am impervious
to the creature's influence.

727
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:28,653
You were impervious

728
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,363
when it was creating
the illusion

729
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,614
of<i> Voyager</i> getting home

730
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,950
because you didn't
share that desire,

731
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,953
but now we're trying to escape,
which is what you want.

732
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,704
<i>Think about it!</i>

733
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:43,751
<i>He's showing you</i>
<i>exactly what you want to see.</i>

734
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,171
Seven!

735
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,050
Initiate another
antimatter burst.

736
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,388
Now.

737
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,849
Fire.

738
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,642
QATAI:
<i>There.</i>

739
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,031
<i>We're out.</i>

740
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,073
Are we certain?

741
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,575
No sign of bioplasmic energy.

742
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,576
We've escaped.

743
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,537
I'm taking us out of range.

744
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,955
Maximum warp.

745
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,082
I'd better see to the crew.

746
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,962
<i>Well, I'll be on my way.</i>
<i>Thanks for your help.</i>

747
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,839
Your engines have taken
heavy damage.

748
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,257
You require our assistance.

749
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,550
<i>No time.</i>

750
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,886
<i>The beast is</i>
<i>already altering course.</i>

751
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,554
<i>I'll handle the repairs myself.</i>

752
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,391
The procedure would take
several days.

753
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,767
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

754
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,770
<i>Just get your ship home.</i>

755
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:49,359
<i>And watch out</i>
<i>for pitcher plants.</i>

756
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,451
Location?

757
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,120
We're still
in the Delta Quadrant.

758
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,163
Scan the wormhole.

759
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,664
Find out what went wrong.

760
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,793
It's gone.

761
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,921
I can't find it on sensors.

762
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,382
KIM:
Captain.

763
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,133
Bridge controls
have been routed

764
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,301
to Engineering--

765
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,720
ops, tactical,
helm-- all of it.

766
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,138
Bridge to Engineering.

767
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,390
SEVEN:
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

768
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,767
Seven? What's going on?

769
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,310
<i>The Doctor will explain.</i>

770
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,105
I will file a complete report
in the morning

771
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,191
after I have regenerated.

772
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:34,820
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 52542.3.</i>

773
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,697
<i>We've deployed</i>
<i>a series of beacons</i>

774
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,658
<i>to warn other vessels</i>
<i>about the bioplasmic creature</i>

775
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,745
<i>and resumed a course for home--</i>
<i>our real home.</i>

776
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:51,670
Naomi Wildman.

777
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,005
Don't worry.

778
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,549
My presence here
is authorized.

779
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,550
By whom?

780
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,676
Mom.

781
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,179
She thinks I need to
learn more about Earth.

782
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,265
I see.

783
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:03,766
And does studying
this image

784
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,144
increase your desire
to go there?

785
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,146
Not really.

786
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,482
I concur.

787
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,191
It is unremarkable.

788
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,360
But my mom likes it

789
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,155
and even Neelix can't wait
to get there,

790
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,366
so I guess
it can't be that bad.

791
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:24,078
Given this crew's determination
to return home,

792
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,206
I have no doubt we will
see it for ourselves someday.

793
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,887
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

794
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,060
(<i> sighs</i> )
