Nobody touch him.
He's mine.

24
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,220
Wait. This is a mistake.

25
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,304
I don't belong here!

26
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,348
You don't?

27
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,101
Well, I'll just take
you home, then.

28
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,561
All right?

29
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,026
This one's mine.

30
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,111
I say he's not.

31
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,488
He's the reason
that I'm here.

32
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,326
He was my partner
in a bombing.

33
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:07,497
We killed 47 patrollers
on Akritiri-- 47!

34
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,752
And then this<i> scum</i>
confessed to the tribunal

35
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,503
and gave them my name.

36
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,090
So I'm telling you again,
he's mine.

37
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,467
I'm keeping him.

38
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,139
( sighs )

39
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,601
Take him.

40
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,480
For now.

41
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,002
KIM:
Did you have
to hit me so hard?

42
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,670
PARIS:
Trust me-- around here,

43
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,214
you don't want anybody
thinking you're soft.

44
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,424
Thanks for the tip.

45
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,926
Is there any food?

46
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,720
I haven't had anything
to eat since I got here.

47
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,846
How long is that?

48
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,473
A couple of days.

49
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,892
( scoffs )
Some shore leave, huh?

50
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,770
What happened to you
after they split us up?

51
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,982
The Akritirians
interrogated me.

52
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,152
When I wouldn't confess
to the bombing,

53
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,403
they dragged me
in front of a judge.

54
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,158
He said you'd already
confessed for the both of us,

55
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,826
and then
he pronounced me guilty.

56
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,662
That's<i> exactly</i>
what happened to me.

57
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,289
Then they must
have drugged me,

58
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,790
because the next
thing I knew,

59
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,333
I woke up at the
bottom of the chute

60
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,709
to that welcoming party.

61
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,545
We've got to explain
to somebody

62
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,214
that there's been
a mistake.

63
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,549
Who did you have in mind?

64
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,010
A guard.

65
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,385
The warden.

66
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,139
I haven't seen
anybody like that.

67
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,308
A prison without guards?

68
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,810
The other inmates say

69
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,646
this place is 300
meters underground.

70
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,317
Maybe the Akritirians figure
guards aren't necessary.

71
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,110
Can I have some more?

72
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,820
What do you think
this is?

73
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,613
A hotel?
There<i> isn't</i> any more!

74
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,074
Take it easy!

75
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,203
( sighs )

76
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,292
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,338
I'm...<i> really</i> 
starting to get edgy.

78
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,340
I think it's the clamp.

79
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,549
The what?

80
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,222
That's what the prisoners
call it.

81
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,890
Everybody has one.

82
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,268
What is it?

83
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:37,022
I'm guessing it's some kind
of synaptic stimulator.

84
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,192
Anyway, it's affecting
my nervous system.

85
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,736
I've been getting jumpier
ever since I got here.

86
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,031
Not to mention,
this thing<i> itches</i> like crazy.

87
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,782
What do you think it's for?

88
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,743
Maybe it's some kind
of torture device.

89
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,037
We could try
taking them out.

90
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,997
No! I saw someone try it.

91
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,623
It killed him.

92
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,590
What we have to do

93
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,134
is find a way out
of this place.

94
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,929
Hm.

95
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,392
Let's get something
straight first.

96
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,560
What?

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,022
The next time you take
a swing at me,

98
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,857
I'm hitting back.

99
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,945
( alarm blaring )

100
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,238
What's that?

101
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,157
Another prisoner,
maybe?

102
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,285
PRISONER:
Food coming!

103
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,078
Food!
Join me for dinner?

104
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,379

105
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,673

106
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,222
No! There's got
to be more!

107
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,723
( screams )

108
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,477
( groans )

109
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,360
I don't think he was going
to eat it anyway, do you?

110
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,118
He's dead.

111
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,497
I think I've lost
my appetite.

112

117

<i>They continue to deny us</i>

Anything?

121
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,857
I have completed another
full sensor sweep,

122
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,234
including a multispectral
subsurface scan.

123
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,819
I still cannot locate
their life signs

124
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,529
or their combadges.

Ambassador Liria
is hailing us.

127
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,452
On screen.

128
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,246
I'm only in the mood
for good news today, Ambassador.

129
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,248
LIRIA:
<i>I'm afraid I can't oblige.</i>

130
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,125
Are you saying
they're dead?

131
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,378
<i>No, they're</i>
<i>very much alive.</i>

132
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,005
Then where
are they?

133
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,342
<i>Your men have been convicted</i>
<i>of the terrorist bombing</i>

134
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,261
<i>at the Laktivia recreational</i>
<i>facility, which resulted</i>

135
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,639
<i>in the death of 47</i>
<i>off-duty patrollers.</i>

136
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,018
I assure you,
Ambassador,

137
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,644
my people had nothing to do
with this attack.

138
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,938
<i>We found chemical traces</i>

139
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,024
<i>of the explosive used</i>
<i>in the bombing</i>

140
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,608
<i>on their hands and clothing.</i>

141
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,152
I'm sure
the same could be said

142
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,987
of anyone who was near
the explosion.

143
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,073
It's hardly enough evidence
for a conviction.

144
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,325
<i>The explosive</i>
<i>was trilithium based.</i>

145
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,910
<i>There is no source</i>

146
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,080
<i>of trilithium</i>
<i>anywhere in our system.</i>

147
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,748
<i>So, you can imagine</i>

148
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,042
<i>our surprise</i>
<i>when our investigation revealed</i>

149
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,421
<i>that your ship is powered</i>
<i>by dilithium--</i>

150
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,464
<i>which our scientists</i>
<i>tell us is convertible</i>

151
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,384
<i>into trilithium.</i>

152
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,386
<i>We have long suspected</i>

153
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,637
<i>that the so-called</i>
<i>Open Sky terrorists</i>

154
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,599
<i>had off-world collaborators.</i>

155
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,060
<i>Now we know who they are.</i>

156
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,355
Captain, two Akritirian ships
are approaching

157
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,275
at bearing
271 mark 64.

158
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,735
<i>Prepare your ship</i>
<i>for inspection, Captain.</i>

159
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,364
If it will help confirm
our innocence, I'll consider it.

160
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,408
But first, I want to know
where my people are being held,

161
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,034
and I want to talk
to them immediately.

162
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,121
<i>Communication with inmates</i>
<i>is not permitted.</i>

163
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,123
If you want my cooperation,
Ambassador,

164
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,375
you're going to have
to do better than that.

165
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,502
<i>Perhaps</i>
<i>you've misunderstood me.</i>

166
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,463
<i>Let me clarify our position.</i>

167
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,298
<i>Your vessel</i>
<i>is being impounded.</i>

168
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,841
<i>You and your crew</i>
<i>are under arrest.</i>

169
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,260
<i>Prepare to be boarded.</i>

170
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,179
Captain, their ships
are powering weapons.

171
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,223
Mr. Tuvok, raise shields.

172
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,975
Mr. Chakotay, take the conn.

173
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,518
I'd like to resolve
this situation

174
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,103
peacefully, Ambassador,

175
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,230
but let me clarify my position.

176
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,899
I will not allow
this ship to be boarded.

177
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,154
<i>That, Captain,</i>
<i>is an error in judgment.</i>

178
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,157
<i>( intense</i>
<i>dramatic score playing )</i>

179
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,206
Captain, should I
return fire?

180
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,459
That's not going to help us
get Tom and Harry back.

181
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,668
We need to regroup.

182
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,710
Get us out of here, Commander.

183
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,045
CHAKOTAY:
Aye, Captain.

184
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,348
( soft chattering )

185
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,192
( footsteps approaching )

186
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,030
What took you so long?

187
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,906
I've been back
at least half an hour.

188
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,952
You're starting to
feel it, aren't you?

189
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,204
I guess I am.

190
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,414
It gets worse
all the time.

191
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,790
We have to fight it.

192
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,586
Let's focus on
something positive.

193
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,882
How about...

194
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,468
a seven-course dinner?

195
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,222
I suppose you didn't
find any food.

196
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,225
Well... I found close
to 50 good citizens

197
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,435
in this quaint
little community,

198
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,437
but not a grocer
among them.

199
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,314
I take it that's a no.

200
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,731
Yeah.

201
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,776
But if we ever do get
our hands on some food,

202
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,405
I found a lovely
spot for a picnic.

203
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,739
Great.

204
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,701
All we need
are the Delaney sisters,

205
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,536
and we could
make a day of it.

206
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,455
So, how about you?

207
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,249
Come across anything
interesting

208
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,291
in your travels?

209
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,626
If you mean an escape route,

210
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,712
I ran into nothing
but solid walls.

211
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:34,795
( sighs heavily )

212
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,339
Me, too.

213
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,757
As far as I can see,
the only way to the surface

214
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,510
is that chute
in the main chamber.

215
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,471
The question is:
How do we get into it

216
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,724
without getting fried
by that force field?

217
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,184
You saw what happened
to the man who reached inside.

218
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,270
That's where this
might come in handy.

219
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,854
I thought if
we could get

220
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,856
our hands on
some loose wiring,

221
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,316
you might be able to use it
to rig a device

222
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,402
that would short out
the force field,

223
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,195
long enough for us
to get into the tube.

224
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,573
It's worth a try.

225
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,157
Yeah.

226
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,410
Now, if we could only
figure out a way

227
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,496
to short out these implants,
we'd be all set.

228
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,460
There's no indication
they followed us.

229
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,877
I guess they're
more interested

230
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,630
in getting rid of us
than finding out the truth.

231
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,090
We've got to go back
for Harry and Tom.
B'Elanna...

232
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,384
We have no information
as to their whereabouts,

233
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,801
and if we return
to Akritirian space,

234
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,803
we are sure to encounter
further hostilities.

235
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,723
Tuvok is right.
Let's concentrate on

236
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,391
proving
Harry and Tom's innocence.

237
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,726
How do we do that?

238
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,061
We know the explosive
was trilithium-based.

239
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,647
If we find the source
of that trilithium,

240
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,356
it may lead us
to the real bombers.

241
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,484
Our long-range scans indicate
that Liria was right.

242
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,235
There's no trilithium
in this sector.

243
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,446
What about paralithium?

244
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,615
It's used as a fuel

245
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,408
for some ion-based
propulsion systems

246
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,702
and it<i> can</i> be converted
into trilithium.

247
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,120
Review our sensor logs

248
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,872
of ships entering and leaving
Akritirian space

249
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,916
during the time
we were in orbit.

250
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,377
If anybody's using
paralithium for fuel,

251
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,254
I want to find out
who they are

252
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,464
and where they went.

253
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,096
Come on, come on, come<i> on...</i>

254
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,265
Take it easy.

255
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,933
You'll get it.

256
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,608
( object clangs )

257
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,151
( breathing heavily )

258
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,444
( stamps foot )

259
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,531
I can't think!
I can't concentrate!

260
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,450
Okay, okay,
concentrate on this.

261
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,704
Uh... Um...

262
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,580
Crown roast of lamb

263
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,167
with, uh...
a bed of wild rice

264
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,629
and a 2296 Chateau
Lafite Rothschild...

265
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,174
at the<i> real</i> Sandrine's.

266
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,346
Or how about shrimp
with fettran sauce,

267
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,014
flambé noodles,

268
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,435
and fudge ripple pudding.

269
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,437
Good one.

270
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,105
Okay. Uh...

271
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,817
A couple of barbecued
T-bone steaks

272
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,069
with baked Risan beans

273
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,572
and... cherry pie
for dessert.

274
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,032
Let's see you
top that one.

275
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,743
Right now, I'm so hungry,

276
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:13,120
I could eat a bowl of
Neelix's leola root stew.

277
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,622
Me, too.

278
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,876
Never thought
I'd say that.

279
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,420
I'm ready to
give it a try.

280
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,799
So far, so good.

281
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,511
( grunts )

282
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,431
Are you okay?

283
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,476
What are you doing?

284
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,604
Just out for a
little stroll.

285
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,440
Move it!

286
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,401
What's that?

287
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,403
A pipe.

288
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,196
Let's see it.

289
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,281
Come on.

290
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,032
I'd really recommend

291
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,492
that you stay
out of my way.

292
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,202
Heh. You should have
thought of that

293
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,162
<i>before</i> you took him!

294
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,832
( clamoring )

295
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,592
Come on, Tom!

296
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,432
( grunts )

297
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,559
Tom!

298
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,781
( screaming )

299
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,575
Back off! Back off!

300
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,410
Back off! Back off!

301
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,210
Hang on. I'm getting
you out of here.

302
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,880
No fight. No fight.

303
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,384
If he doesn't
bleed to death,

304
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,678
he'll die
from infection.

305
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,137
We've got to get him
to a doctor.

306
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,722
Of course. We'll call
an emergency vehicle

307
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,390
and rush him
to a hospital.

308
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,518
( prisoners laughing )

309
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,480
( groaning )

310
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,695
Hey!

311
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,824
What do you want
for the dead man's boots?

312
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,284
MAN 1: Nice!

313
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,870
MAN 2: I'll take
his shirt, too.

314
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,296
You can make it.

315
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,589
Just a few more steps,

316
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,800
and we'll be back
to the shelter.

317
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,092
Home, sweet home.

318
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,681
Harry.
Yeah?

319
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,017
I'm hurt pretty bad.

320
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,852
I'll take
care of it.

321
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,103
Promise me something.

322
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,023
What?

323
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,400
If things get worse...

324
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,570
if it comes down
to making a choice,

325
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,989
don't worry about me.

326
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,075
Take care of yourself.

327
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,331
Do we have a deal?

328
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,543
Quiet.

329
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,921
Hey!

330
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,714
What are you
doing in there?

331
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,716
Get out.
This place is ours.

332
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,135
Get out! Get out!
Get out!

333
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,944
( footsteps and groaning )

334
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,237
Okay, here's the deal.

335
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,949
My boots for
some clean cloth,

336
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,158
a liter of water,
two of those food cakes,

337
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,411
and my friend gets to stay
in there until he's better.

338
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,791
I don't take in boarders.

339
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,375
What about
the rest of it?

340
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,005
I don't like the color.

341
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,256
( sighs )

342
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,300
Come on, let's go.

343
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,135
This guy's not
going to help us.

344
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,555
Just tell me what you want

345
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,390
for the food
and the bandages, okay?

346
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,853
That pipe you were working with
interests me.

347
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,730
I can't trade the pipe.

348
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,356
Then I guess
we don't have a deal.

349
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,110
Now move on.
You're blocking my light.

350
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,781
I'll take you with me.

351
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,700
Take me where?

352
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,036
I know a way
out of this place.

353
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,496
I've been in here
six years.

354
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,456
I've never heard
of a way out.

355
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,916
The chute.

356
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,377
Anybody that tries
to get in there

357
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,046
gets hit with an energy pulse.

358
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,507
With this pipe,
I can disable the force field.

359
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,551
With a little luck,
we can make it to the surface.

360
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,561
What are you staring at?

361
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,107
I'm trying to figure out
if you're a liar...

362
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,693
or if the clamp has
already made you crazy.

363
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,986
Neither.

364
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,988
And I'll prove it to you.

365
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,074
You stand your ground.

366
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,200
I like that.

367
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,744
Then we have a deal?

368
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,873
Just remember one thing:

369
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,503
If you're lying,
I'll kill you.

370
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,633
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

371
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,677
<i>So far, we've located</i>
<i>three ships</i>

372
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,762
<i>with paralithium plasma</i>
<i>emissions,</i>

373
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,598
<i>but none of them appears</i>
<i>to have produced explosives.</i>

374
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,934
<i>We're currently in pursuit</i>
<i>of a fourth vessel.</i>

375
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,394
We're in hailing range

376
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,354
of the Akritirian
freighter, Captain.

377
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,690
TUVOK:
I'm only reading
two life signs aboard.

378
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,025
Open a channel.

379
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,526
This is Kathryn Janeway

380
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,611
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager</i>

381
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,490
to the captain
of the Akritirian cargo vessel.

382
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,242
<i>I'm the captain</i>
<i>of this vessel.</i>

383
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,243
<i>What do you want?</i>

384
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,703
Two of my crew members

385
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,205
were convicted
by the Akritirians

386
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,664
of a terrorist bombing.

387
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,167
We're trying to prove
their innocence,

388
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,836
and we have reason to believe
a ship like yours,

389
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:57,090
which uses paralithium for fuel,
might have been involved

390
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,092
in the production
of the explosives.

391
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,801
<i>( whispers</i> )
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

392
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,928
<i>Quiet.</i>

393
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,470
<i>This is a cargo vessel.</i>

394
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,264
Then you won't mind
if a few of my crew members

395
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,974
come aboard to have
a look around.

396
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,893
<i>Not if they don't mind</i>
<i>having their throats cut.</i>

397
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,895
JANEWAY: There's no need
to be abrupt...

398
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,399
I guess you're not
the only captain

399
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,943
who doesn't want
their ship boarded.

400
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,153
TORRES: Captain,
I'm picking up

401
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,030
residual traces
of trilithium.

402
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,157
They're faint,
but they're there.

403
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,702
I think we may have found
our bomb makers.

404
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,370
Mr. Tuvok, send
a security detail

405
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,248
to Transporter Room 2.

406
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,291
Lieutenant Torres,
beam the two of them aboard

407
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,334
and tractor their ship
into the shuttle bay.

408
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,003
Aye, Captain.

409
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,261
You have no right
to hold us.

410
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,637
My people
have been accused

411
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,973
of aiding a terrorist group
called Open Sky.

412
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,515
What do you
know about them?

413
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,683
They're not
terrorists.

414
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,684
They're patriots.

415
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,436
One day, they'll lead

416
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,980
the legitimate government
of our people.

417
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,231
We don't have

418
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,483
to answer any of
their questions, Piri.

419
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,902
It sounds to me
like your young friend here

420
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,654
sympathizes
with these patriots.

421
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,905
She's not
my friend.

422
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,448
She's my sister.

423
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,285
And our political views
are none of your business.

424
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:10,288
I don't know much
about your world,

425
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,831
but I do know that my people

426
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,749
are being held
for a crime they didn't commit,

427
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,585
and I'm going to do everything
in my power to get them out.

428
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,920
Do you understand that?

429
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,672
We have confirmed
that explosives

430
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,756
were indeed produced

431
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,716
aboard their ship.

432
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,051
Escort them to the brig.

433
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,678
TUVOK:
Aye, Captain.

434
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,847
And have Mr. Chakotay
lay in a course

435
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,347
for the Akritirian border.

436
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,975
Let my
sister go.

437
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,434
She didn't have anything
to do with the bombing,

438
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,560
and she's only 14.

439
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,688
Prison doesn't
scare me.

440
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,689
Quiet, Piri.

441
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,024
Please.

442
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,026
You don't know
what you're saying.

443
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,737
Nobody ever gets out
of prison on Akritiri.

444
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,157
They'll just let
her rot in there

445
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,658
for the rest of her life.

446
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,953
I admire your desire
to protect your sister, but...

447
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,913
it's not really
up to me, is it?

448
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,581
Tell them
what we know.

449
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,582
Tell me what?

450
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,709
Piri, don't.

451
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,418
Our brigade found out

452
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:02,298
where the maximum security
detention facility is located.

453
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,051
My sister has quite
a vivid imagination.

454
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,553
With this ship,
you can attack the prison

455
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,347
and get your
people out.

456
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,098
I'm sorry,

457
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,143
that's not how we do things
where I come from.

458
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,353
Coward.

459
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:23,819
Mr. Tuvok,
see that they get a bath

460
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,696
and a hot meal.

461
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,374
I don't trust
that guy, Harry.

462
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,875
I can handle him.

463
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,378
Just watch
your back, okay?

464
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,963
Try to get some rest.

465
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,007
Remember our deal?

466
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,759
What deal?

467
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,386
If it comes down to it,

468
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,221
you're going to save
yourself, right?

469
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,681
If you see a chance,

470
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,267
just go.

471
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,560
Don't come back for me.

472
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,271
I think the clamp

473
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,731
must really be starting
to make you crazy.

474
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,024
I'm serious, Harry.

475
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,484
Getting tired
of waiting.

476
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,446
I gotta go.

477
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,490
Harry...

478
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,793
Oh! Damn it!

479
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,669
Don't fight it, use it.

480
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,048
How do I do that?

481
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,174
I feel like there's

482
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,466
a million fire ants
in my brain.

483
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,637
Good. Make them
work for you.

484
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,847
How?

485
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,934
Fire ants sound vicious.

486
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,894
Imagine them as your army

487
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,314
moving in a vast wave
to conquer your enemy.

488
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,441
There's a massive struggle
going on inside you--

489
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,319
a battle to the death
between you and the clamp.

490
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,280
You have to use whatever force
you can to defeat it.

491
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,990
I'd rather
use my energy

492
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,242
to work on getting
out of here.

493
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,208
When I first got here,
I assumed the clamp

494
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,461
was just a refined form
of torture

495
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,922
to make our prison stay
that much more arduous.

496
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,471
Gradually, I began
to understand it more fully.

497
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,431
It's all right here
in my manifesto--

498
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,350
my insights, my reasoning...

499
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,478
My evidence.

500
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,482
It's an experiment.

501
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:28,277
They're studying us
like animals--

502
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,571
pitting us against each other
to find out what happens.

503
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,531
You can see that,
can't you?

504
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:36,869
I guess so.

505
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,497
The greatest threat,
of course, would be

506
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,248
if we started to cooperate
with each other,

507
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,540
so they prevented that.

508
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,504
But there had to be
more to it than that,

509
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,047
and the longer I was in here,

510
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,132
the more I knew it was my job
to figure it out.

511
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,967
That's the reason
I was put here,

512
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,593
and eventually...

513
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,348
it came to me

514
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:01,935
as though a fireball
had exploded in my mind.

515
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:08,401
And the realization gave me
a power over the others.

516
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,445
They don't come
near me anymore.

517
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:16,616
They're afraid of me,
because I know the truth.

518
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,080
Well...?

519
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,748
Don't you want to know
what it is?

520
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,959
What is the ultimate purpose
of the clamp?

521
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,003
Okay.

522
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,469
It's inspired,
brilliant.

523
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:39,557
It's a method for controlling
the prison population.

524
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,726
We kill each other off.

525
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,479
Sure. Whatever you say.

526
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,398
So you must enter
into the battle.

527
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,607
If you let the clamp
control you,

528
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,444
you'll end up
like that crazy old man

529
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,694
that took over your shelter.

530
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,488
But if you learn
to control<i> it,</i>

531
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,906
you'll survive...

532
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,950
like me.

533
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,916
( beeping )

534
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,502
Yes.

535
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,878
I plan to be out of here

536
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,630
before it even
becomes an issue.

537
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,007
Go ahead.

538
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,675
Touch it.

539
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,580
( grunting )

540
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,021
What do you see?

541
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,106
Some kind of hatch.

542
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,952
What do you see?

543
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,996
Are we
at the surface?

544
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,023
Heh. Harry.

545
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,817
How are you feeling?

546
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,656
I was dreaming...

547
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,450
about Megan Delaney.

548
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,661
( laughs )

549
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,539
Next time,
I'll try not to wake you.

550
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,628
The chute...

551
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,547
You made it in?

552
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,927
Did you
find a way out?

553
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,682
Not yet...

554
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,726
but we're very close.

555
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,644
It's just a matter of time.

556
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,355
So you've got
to hang in there, okay?

557
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,413
Wh... Wha...

558
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,706
What happened to me?

559
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,873
Easy, Tom.

560
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,917
You got stabbed, remember?

561
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,669
Who...

562
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,713
Who did it?

563
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,256
One of the prisoners.

564
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,593
No...
No, it was you!

565
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:05,178
I'm trying
to change your bandage.

566
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,722
No! Get away from me!

567
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,724
Please! I'm trying
to help you.
Get away from me!

568
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,850
Tom!

569
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,311
Tom, give me the pipe.

570
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,399
We need it to get out of here.
Remember?

571
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,819
It's okay.

572
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,739
Let me take it.

573
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,258
Harry...

574
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,972
What's happening to me?

575
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,189
You're gonna be okay.

576
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,614
Harry...

577
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,115
Yeah?

578
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,828
Don't leave me here.

579
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,889
Close your eyes.

580
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:43,485
( prisoners hooting, shouting
and laughing maniacally )

581
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,871
( shouting and wild laughter
continues )

582
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,554
Sleep well?

583
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:12,765
No.

584
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,057
How about
your friend?

585
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,101
Is he dead yet?

586
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,770
Shut up!

587
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,405
The chute leads
to a docking port, right?

588
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,910
Some kind of ship must come
to drop off food,

589
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,620
drop off new prisoners.

590
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,247
So maybe we could
get aboard the ship.

591
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,791
It's getting
the best of you.

592
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,292
I know we could do it.

593
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,752
You think they're just
gonna open the hatch

594
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,462
and ask us if we'd
like a ride home?

595
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,131
We'd have
the element of surprise.

596
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,717
And they'd have
the pulse guns.

597
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,852
If we could hold them off...

598
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,980
distract them...

599
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,024
just for a few minutes...

600
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,027
I could
establish our location...

601
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,696
MAN:
That's enough!

602
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,031
...get a message to<i> Voyager</i>

603
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,993
and they could
get us out of here.

604
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,453
We'll need weapons.

605
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,998
I've never
let anyone see this,

606
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,293
but I'm going to let
you read my manifesto.

607
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:26,421
It'll teach you
how to control the clamp.

608
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,384
I don't want to read
your crazy manifesto.

609
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,636
Take it.

610
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,429
Learn everything
I know.

611
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,808
Now, are you going
to help me or not?

612
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,856
If I were like
the others...

613
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,151
I'd kill you.

614
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,030
But I don't lose control.

615
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,783
That's the difference
between me

616
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,368
and you.

617
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,173
Listen!
Listen to me, everybody!
MAN: Now what's he want?

618
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,550
This is important.

619
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,968
I've got something to say.

620
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,136
Something you want to hear.

621
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,555
It's what you've
been waiting for.

622
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,724
What the hell
do<i> you</i> want?

623
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,727
I've found a way
out of here.

624
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,479
( laughter and shouting )

625
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,857
There's no way out.

626
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,692
There is!

627
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,109
Through the chute!

628
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,278
I've been inside.

629
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,446
( grunts )

630
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,865
Listen!

631
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,617
We have to work together.

632
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,537
They'd like us all
to kill each other,

633
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,664
but we have to cooperate.

634
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,709
If we do,
we can get out of here.

635
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,045
If you've been in the chute,

636
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,671
where does it lead?

637
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,048
MAN:
Yeah! Yeah!

638
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,883
Space.

639
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,467
( derisive shouts and laughter )

640
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,306
It's the truth.

641
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,017
We<i> can</i> escape...

642
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,438
<i>if</i> we work together!

643
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,274
( grunts )

644
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,918
What the hell
are you doing?

645
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,169
Stay back.

646
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,466
You've ruined it.

647
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,761
This is mine.

648
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,263
It's mine!

649
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,018
( screaming )

650
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,773
Please! No!

651
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,025
Please!

652
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,026
Harry!

653
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,069
No!

654
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,824
( screaming )

655
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,828
Go ahead.

656
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,704
Finish him.

657
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,684
You wanted to kill him,
didn't you?

658
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,144
He's my best friend!

659
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,062
No, no, that's
where you're wrong.

660
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,772
He's too far gone
to be your friend.

661
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,398
All he is now is a burden.

662
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,733
That's not true!

663
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,694
He eats your food,
he ruined your device--

664
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,236
he's given in
to the clamp.

665
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,530
You've got to get rid of him

666
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,614
before he brings you
down with him.

667
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,574
Quiet!
You've got a chance

668
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,951
to make something
of your life in here,

669
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,953
but as long as that carcass
is in my hut,

670
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,748
we'll never be able to go on
to more important things.

671
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,250
What the hell are
you talking about?

672
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,837
We've got to disseminate
the manifesto,

673
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,255
gather our followers,

674
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,799
train them.

675
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,720
You're insane.

676
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,096
You want my protection?

677
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,430
You want to live
under my roof?

678
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,557
Get rid of him.

679
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,185
I don't need
your protection!

680
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,397
How long do you
think you'll last

681
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,690
against Pit
and the others,

682
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,233
without me
looking out for you?

683
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,948
Go ahead. Take it.

684
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,784
Think of what
a relief it will be

685
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,786
to not have
that responsibility,

686
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,247
to be free
of his ranting.

687
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,145
I'm not a killer.

688
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,773
If you want
to survive in here...

689
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,399
you'd better learn to be.

690
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,071
If that's what it takes
to stay alive...

691
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,202
then I'd rather die.

692
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,412
( shank clangs )

693
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,081
Get out now.

694
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,918
And take him with you...

695
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,046
or I<i> will</i> kill him.

696
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,804
<i>Unless you've decided</i>
<i>to relinquish control</i>

697
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,513
<i>of your vessel, Captain,</i>

698
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:31,184
<i>I suggest that you do not</i>
<i>proceed across our border.</i>

699
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,811
We've captured
the ship and crew

700
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,396
responsible for the bombing
at the Laktivia Canteen.

701
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,815
<i>I see...</i>

702
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,441
I'm prepared to trade them

703
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,485
for the immediate
and unconditional release

704
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,487
of Lieutenant Paris
and Ensign Kim.

705
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,865
<i>Your crewmen have already</i>
<i>been tried and convicted.</i>

706
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,452
Are you saying those
convictions can't be reversed,

707
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,330
no matter what new evidence
is brought to light?

708
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,873
<i>You are correct.</i>

709
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,042
That is an outrageous policy.

710
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:00,588
<i>I assure you, it has proved to</i>
<i>be a most effective deterrent.</i>

711
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,924
<i>Good day, Captain.</i>

712
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,509
( sighs in disgust )

713
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,636
So much for negotiating.

714
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,472
What should we do
with the prisoners?

715
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,017
Bring Vel
to my ready room. Now.

716
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,354
I want the location
and shield code

717
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,773
to the maximum security
detention facility.

718
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,399
What's wrong,

719
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,111
the Akritirians didn't
agree to your terms?

720
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,530
No, as a matter of fact.

721
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,490
But I suspect you will.

722
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,202
And what makes you so sure?

723
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:33,163
Because if you don't,
you and your sister

724
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,665
are going to spend the rest
of your lives in prison.

725
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,257
I'll take you
to the prison,

726
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:47,510
and I'll get you in,

727
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,180
but there are members
of Open Sky in there

728
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,431
and I want to
get them out, too.

729
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,976
I don't think you understand
the way this works.

730
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,853
You tell me
what I want to know,

731
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:00,523
and after I get my people back,
I let you and your sister go.

732
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,567
That's not good enough.

733
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,904
Mr. Tuvok, inform
the Akritirians

734
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,281
that we're ready
to turn the prisoners over.

735
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,658
( scoffs )

736
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,660
All right.

737
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,287
TUVOK:
Crewman Foster,

738
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,497
take the prisoner
to Commander Chakotay.

739
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,167
He will upload
the coordinates and codes.

740
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,382
May I ask how you propose

741
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,550
to get past the
Akritirian patrols?

742
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,885
No doubt they will attack

743
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,595
as soon as<i> Voyager</i>
crosses the border.

744
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,513
That's exactly why
the rescue team

745
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,932
won't be aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

746
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,975
Captain?

747
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,977
If I'm not mistaken,

748
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,439
Mr. Neelix's ship
is still in our shuttle bay.

749
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,774
Yes.

750
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,234
However,
Mr. Neelix's vessel

751
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:46,903
has extremely limited
combat capabilities.

752
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,531
Then we'll have to be
very careful, won't we?

753
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,414
PIT:
I want his clothes

754
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,749
and I want his shoes!

755
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,834
This man is my friend.

756
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,045
Nobody touches him.

757
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:07,465
Back off! You won't
have to get hurt.

758
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,344
( alarm blaring )

759
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,887
New prisoner!

760
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,807
( inmates clamoring )

761
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:24,857
I got her!

762
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,778
Hands on your heads.
Do it now!

763
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,155
NEELIX [OVER INTERCOM]:
<i>Neelix to Lieutenant Tuvok.</i>

764
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,907
Go ahead.
<i>We've got company.</i>

765
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,618
Two Akritirian patrol ships
on an intercept course.

766
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,787
I'm not sure how long
I can hold them off.

767
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,998
TUVOK:<i> We are moving as quickly</i>
<i>as we can, Mr. Neelix.</i>

768
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,624
KIM:
Captain!

769
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,002
Where's Tom?

770
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,004
He needs help.

771
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,551
MALE ALIEN:<i> Akritirian patrol</i>
<i>to alien vessel.</i>

772
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,304
<i>Disengage immediately.</i>

773
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:55,721
Akritirian patrol?

774
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,225
Uh, am I in Akritirian space?
Oh, dear.

775
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,979
I-I thought this was
the Heva VII refueling port.

776
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,647
Uh, you wouldn't, by any chance,

777
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,942
be able to recommend a...
respectable establishment

778
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,404
where I could have
my navigational array repaired?

779
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,282
<i>Disengage immediately.</i>
<i>This is your final warning.</i>

780
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,659
JANEWAY:<i> Janeway to Neelix.</i>
<i>Everyone's aboard.</i>

781
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,370
Acknowledged.

782
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,288
I know it's a little
cramped back there,

783
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,665
so if there's anything I can do
to make you more comfortable...

784
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,959
<i>Neelix!</i>
<i>Just get us out of here!</i>

785
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,003
Of course, Captain.

786
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,964
Talaxian vessel
to Akritirian patrol.

787
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,757
My apologies
for the little mix-up.

788
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,344
I'll be departing now,
per your orders.

789
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,731
<i>Power down your engines</i>
<i>and prepare to be boarded.</i>

790
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,359
Eh, what was that, patrol?
That last message was garbled.

791
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,152
( rumbling from phaser strikes )

792
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,786
NEELIX: I've always thought
of my piloting skills

793
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,247
as modest, at best,

794
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,749
and the conditions
were extremely dangerous.

795
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,503
Still, I did outmaneuver
those Akritirians, didn't I?

796
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,671
You did a terrific
job, Neelix.

797
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,132
I agree.
Excellent piloting.

798
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,800
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Captain,

799
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,386
because I've been thinking...

800
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,930
Until Tom here
gets back on his feet,

801
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,350
perhaps I could try my hand
at conn for a while.

802
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,809
That won't
be necessary.

803
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,603
Lieutenant Paris
is just fine,

804
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,146
thanks to excellent
doctoring.

805
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,814
I finished analyzing
these implants,

806
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,233
and you'll be happy
to know that the treatment

807
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,401
I provided will
successfully

808
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:32,777
counteract their
effect on you.

809
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,153
What exactly
was the effect?

810
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,780
My readings indicate
that the implants

811
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,156
are designed
to stimulate the production

812
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,950
of acetylcholine
in the hypothalamus.

813
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,618
That would explain
the agitation.

814
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,870
Hm. Acetylcholine
is a brain chemical

815
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,124
common to the neural
structures of most humanoids.

816
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,959
Essentially,
it helps stimulate

817
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,128
one's aggressive
tendencies.

818
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,630
Zio was right.

819
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,048
( sighs )

820
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,926
Come on, Harry.

821
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,470
We're overdue
for that steak dinner.

822
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,264
I guess so.

823
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,349
What do you mean,
you guess so?

824
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,642
It's the thought
of that dinner

825
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,726
that kept us going.

826
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,228
So what
do you think?

827
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,646
Uh, a baked potato?

828
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,023
A big mound of
deep-fried onion rings?

829
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,442
Tom...

830
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,486
Maybe, maybe, uh...
some grilled mushrooms.

831
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,613
Tom, listen to me.

832
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,948
I...

833
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,867
I almost killed you.

834
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,077
What are you saying?

835
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,370
You're the one
that kept me alive.

836
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,664
I was ready to hit
you with the pipe.

837
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,291
Don't you remember?

838
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,546
You want to know
what I remember?

839
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,674
Someone saying,
"This man is my friend.

840
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,427
Nobody touches him."

841
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,514
I'll remember that
for a long time.

842
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:46,934
So, what do you say
we blow

843
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,021
a week's worth
of replicator rations?

844
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,857
So, what's for dessert?

845
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,984
Cherry pie,
don't you remember?

846
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,278
What about the fudge
ripple pudding?

847
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,155
Ah! Yes...

848
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:06,204
