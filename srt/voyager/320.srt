1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,759
Let's mark the coordinates
of that trinary star.

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,345
It'll be a good reference
point for this sector.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,180
Didn't we
already pass

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,474
a trinary system
like this?

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,059
Not that I remember. Why?

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,478
It just seems familiar.

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,438
Perhaps you're experiencing
a paradoxical

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,357
state-dependent
associative phenomenon.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,610
Déjà vu.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,445
( soft chuckle )

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,531
Yeah, I-I guess so.
( monitor beeps )

12
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,783
Captain, there is
a ship approaching,

13
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,618
bearing 215 mark 8.

14
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,203
On screen.

15
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,454
Their shields are down

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,331
and their weapon systems
are unpowered.

17
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,791
They're hailing us.

18
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,293
MALE:
<i>My respects to you.</i>

19
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,713
<i>I'm Alben,</i>
<i>Captain of the</i> Nerada.

20
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,964
Captain Kathryn Janeway

21
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,090
of the Federation Starship
<i>Voyager.</i>

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,425
<i>I thought I was familiar</i>

23
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,177
<i>with every type of ship</i>
<i>in this sector,</i>

24
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>but I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like yours before.</i>

25
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,223
We're not from around here.

26
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,017
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>let me welcome you</i>

27
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,434
<i>to Nasari territory.</i>

28
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,728
That ship's going to fire.

29
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,270
What?

30
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,898
Captain, we've got
to defend ourselves.

31
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,774
I am detecting no threat.

32
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,569
Tactical control
has been routed

33
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,820
to the Ops station.

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,363
Our weapon systems
are charging.

35
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,448
Raising shields
and firing phasers.

36
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,163
TUVOK:
Direct hit.
They are returning fire.

37
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,832
Red Alert!

38
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,834
( alarm blaring )

39
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:31,258
<i>( dramatic</i>
<i>theme music playing )</i>

40
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,365
Hail them. We've got to
put a stop to this.

41
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,408
Captain, I had
to act quickly.

42
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,077
You will explain
yourself, Mr. Kim,

43
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,370
but right now,
you're relieved.

44
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,164
Commander, you're at Ops.

45
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,666
TUVOK: They are not
responding to hails.

46
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,462
There's pressure building up
in Plasma Conduit G-6.

47
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,548
Ashmore, open up
the emergency vents.

48
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,176
I'll try to reroute
the plasma flow.

49
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,803
Shields are down to 70 percent.

50
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,096
Get us out of here.

51
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,430
CHAKOTAY:
Warp engines are down.

52
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,224
They are in pursuit.

53
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
Bridge to Engineering. What's
the status of the warp drive?

54
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,311
The plasma injectors
are off-line, Cap--

55
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,190
We're working on them now.

56
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,691
( both gasp )

57
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,401
A plasma conduit
just blew in Engineering.

58
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,820
Propulsion systems are down.

59
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,572
They're reporting
casualties.

60
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,742
Target their weapons array
and fire.

61
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,623
They've suffered damage
to their weapon systems

62
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,252
and shield emitters.
They are moving away.

63
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,628
( sighs )

64
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,135
I want to know exactly
what you thought you were doing.

65
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,888
Their weapons were charging.
They were about to fire at us.

66
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,932
We could have been
destroyed.

67
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,768
Sensor logs indicate that their
weapon systems were not powered.

68
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,020
Then they must have fooled
our sensors somehow.

69
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,773
I detected a tetryon surge
coming from their ship.

70
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,859
There are many possible sources
of increased tetryon emissions.

71
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,154
It may have been an irregularity
in their warp field.

72
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,074
No.
It was their weapons.

73
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,201
That whole "welcome to Nasari
territory" was a trick.

74
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,660
How could you know that?

75
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,417
I can't explain that.

76
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,044
I just knew.

77
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,630
I was only trying
to protect the ship.

78
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,381
I trust your
intentions, Ensign,

79
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,716
but your actions
are going to need

80
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,176
a little more
justification.

81
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,011
I want you to analyze
the sensor logs,

82
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,013
and see if there's any
basis for Mr. Kim's hunch.

83
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,681
TUVOK:
Aye, Captain.

84
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,143
In the meantime,
I'm suspending you from duty.

85
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,311
Go to Sick Bay.

86
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,063
Let the Doctor have
a look at that cut.

87
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,744
Still no respiration.

88
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,704
Her blood pressure is
90/40 and dropping.

89
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,748
She has second-degree
burns on her lungs.

90
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,792
I'll need to do
a pulmonary regeneration.

91
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,877
Her neural tissues are
starting to degenerate.

92
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,838
Oxygen deprivation--
we've got to get her breathing.

93
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,464
Try ten milligrams
pulmozine.

94
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,133
( crew members coughing )

95
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,970
No effect.

96
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,263
20 milligrams.

97
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,390
( gasping )

98
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,561
Is she going
to be all right?

99
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,107
Yes. Another patient
snatched from the jaws of death.

100
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,656
Let me take care of that.

101
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,243
B'Elanna almost got killed.
It's my fault.

102
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,703
What do you mean?

103
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,538
I started that fight.

104
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,333
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

105
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,252
For a moment,
I was absolutely sure.

106
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,753
And now you're not?

107
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,548
It's fading.

108
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,844
What I did and how I felt--
it doesn't make any sense.

109
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,595
And it could
have been worse.

110
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,472
What if they'd been more
powerful than we were?

111
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,891
I could have
gotten everyone killed.

112
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,351
But none of that
happened.

113
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,895
B'Elanna got hurt,
and she'll recover.

114
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,732
Harry, you can't undo
what's been done.

115
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,484
You're right.

116
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,487
Thanks.

117
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,754
Raising shields
and firing phasers.

118
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,300
I can't explain it;
I just knew.

119
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,344
I never wanted
you to get hurt.

120
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,428
That's supposed to make me
feel better?

121
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,764
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,683
Harry, I'm here.

123
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,769
Don't worry.

124
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,645
You'll feel better soon.

125
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,523
I can make
some soup for you.

126
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,317
Would you like that?

127
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:28,949
I won't go anywhere
as long as you need me.

128
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,369
We raised you to be
a responsible boy.

129
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,661
I try to be.

130
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,830
I'm suspending you from duty.

131
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,165
Mom...

132
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,111
Well, the good news is
I won't have to quarantine you.

133
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,696
There's no sign of an infectious
agent anywhere in your body.

134
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,490
And the bad news?

135
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,784
If I don't find
the cause of this rash,

136
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,078
it will be difficult
to treat.

137
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,580
Last night, I had a dream
about being sick

138
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,582
with the Mendakan pox
when I was nine.

139
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,210
Do you think this
could be a recurrence?

140
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,215
I've never considered dreams
as a diagnostic tool before.

141
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:31,636
Your unconscious mind
sensed these developing symptoms

142
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,181
and tried to provide
an explanation?

143
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,934
Hm. Such recurrences of this
particular illness are rare,

144
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,978
but I will consider
the possibility.

145
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,605
( device beeping )
Hm.

146
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,065
What?

147
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,733
In addition to your
visible symptoms,

148
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,527
your blood chemistry has
been slightly altered.

149
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,778
Is that serious?

150
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,738
No, but
it's not consistent

151
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,740
with the symptoms
of the Mendakan pox.

152
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,537
Doctor, you don't think
there could be any, uh...

153
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,248
psychological effects
from this disease, do you?

154
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,084
Such as...?

155
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,920
I've been having this
strange déjà vu feeling.

156
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,342
Then yesterday on the Bridge,
I had this sudden instinct

157
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,178
and I acted on it
by firing without orders.

158
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,014
I'd certainly call that
atypical behavior.

159
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,518
Your scans haven't shown
any neurological abnormalities,

160
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,187
but I will run
a closer analysis.

161
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,148
Doctor, she's
regaining consciousness.

162
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,902
Good morning, Lieutenant.

163
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,237
( groans )

164
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,406
Morning?

165
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,157
What am I doing here?

166
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,700
There was an accident
in Engineering.

167
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,285
A plasma conduit exploded.

168
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,704
I've treated you for second
and third degree burns

169
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,039
and several
broken ribs.

170
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,416
I expect you'll make
a full recovery.

171
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,167
( groans )

172
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,169
After you've spent at least
one more day in Sick Bay.

173
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,924
This time, Doctor,
I'm not going to argue with you.

174
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,307
Harry.

175
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,560
What happened to your face?

176
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,562
We're still trying
to figure that out.

177
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,439
It's kind of cute.

178
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,315
Makes you look like
a speckled<i> targ.</i>

179
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,484
( laughs, then coughs )

180
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,279
B'Elanna...

181
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,406
I'm really sorry you got hurt.

182
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,366
Hey, it's all part

183
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,785
of the adventure
of space travel, right?

184
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,037
I know, but, um...

185
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,332
What? What is it?

186
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,043
Never mind.

187
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,421
I'm glad you're going
to be all right.

188
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,714
Thanks.

189
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,468
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
cut visiting hours short.

190
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,969
Ensign, you can go.

191
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,846
I'll contact you with
the results of my analysis.

192
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,181
Take care of yourself.

193
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,351
See you later, Spot.

194
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,812
( chuckles )

195
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,073
Captain...

196
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,326
I accept full responsibility
for my mistake.

197
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,161
I was completely out of line,

198
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,121
even if I believed that
other ship was charging weapons,

199
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,498
which they probably weren't.

200
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:08,793
Harry, they<i> were</i>
charging weapons.

201
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,421
I<i> was</i> right.

202
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,465
Tuvok has confirmed
that the tetryon surge

203
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,342
matched the energy signature

204
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,219
of that particulate beam
they shot at us.

205
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,639
They would have taken us
completely by surprise.

206
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,682
As soon as I saw their ship,

207
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,645
I felt this sudden...

208
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,896
suspicion and loathing.

209
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,191
I knew we were in trouble.

210
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,776
Which brings us back to
the larger question.

211
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,279
How did I know?

212
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,327
I really wish I could
tell you, Captain, but...

213
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,120
for the past few days,
this area of space

214
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,206
has seemed more and more
familiar to me.

215
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,583
If I didn't know
it was impossible,

216
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,460
I'd swear I've been here before.

217
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,463
We'll have to consider
every possible explanation.

218
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,340
Oh, believe me, I have been--

219
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,676
space-time anomalies,

220
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,637
alien telepathy,
alternate realities...

221
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,431
The list gets weirder
as it goes on.

222
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,143
Then there's
your sudden illness,

223
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,563
which may not be
a coincidence.

224
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,980
<i>Tuvok to Janeway.</i>

225
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,691
<i>There are three ships</i>
<i>approaching</i>

226
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,942
<i>of the same configuration</i>
<i>as the Nasari vessel.</i>

227
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,528
On my way.

228
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,865
They'll intercept
in 36 minutes.

229
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,367
Can we outrun them?
I doubt it.

230
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,285
Engineering's still
working on repairs.

231
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,995
We could manage
warp 3 at best.

232
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,957
Let me see a star chart
of this region.

233
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,463
Head for this system.

234
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,881
I think we can make it.

235
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,133
Is this another
hunch, Ensign?

236
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,471
We'll be safe there.
I'm sure of it.

237
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,476
Tactical status.

238
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,645
The aft shield emitter
is off-line.

239
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,188
Phasers are operational,

240
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,940
but torpedo
launchers are not.

241
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,735
I strongly advise
against a confrontation.

242
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,115
Follow Harry's course.

243
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,452
Speed-- as fast as we can go.

244
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,881
TUVOK:
The Nasari vessels

245
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,217
will overtake us
in two minutes.

246
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,386
We're coming up
on that star system.

247
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,806
We'll pass it if
we stay at warp.

248
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,392
Slow to impulse.

249
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,394
We're making our stand here.

250
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,064
They'll enter weapons range
in a few seconds.

251
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,240
Taresia.

252
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,660
What does that mean?

253
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,328
Do you know this place?

254
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,164
Yes. It was in my dream.

255
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,957
There is
another ship approaching

256
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,793
from the third planet.
Is it Nasari?

257
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,835
No, but they're
on an intercept course

258
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,130
and their weapons
are fully powered.

259
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,382
Prepare for
evasive maneuvers.

260
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,717
CHAKOTAY:
Aye, Captain.

261
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,051
We'll be all right.

262
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,562
The unidentified vessel

263
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,272
has disabled
all the Nasari ships.

264
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,816
They are retreating.

265
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,360
What's your next
trick, Harry--

266
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,278
pull a shuttlecraft
out of a hat?

267
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,239
Open a channel to that ship.

268
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,492
They're already hailing us.

269
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,951
FEMALE:
<i>Alien vessel.</i>

270
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,371
<i>This is</i>
<i>the Taresian starship.</i>

271
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,039
<i>There you are.</i>

272
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,125
<i>Our sensors detected you</i>
<i>aboard your ship.</i>

273
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,085
<i>I'm glad to see you're safe.</i>

274
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,504
Do you know me?

275
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,755
<i>In a way.</i>

276
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,716
<i>I know you are</i>
<i>one of my people.</i>

277
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,425
What?

278
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,177
<i>You are Taresian.</i>

279
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,596
<i>Welcome home.</i>

280
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:01,901
JANEWAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50732.4.</i>

281
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,654
<i>The Taresians have escorted us</i>
<i>back to their homeworld</i>

282
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,281
<i>so we can continue</i>
<i>to investigate their claim</i>

283
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,660
<i>that Ensign Kim</i>
<i>is a member of their race.</i>

284
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,749
FEMALE:
Welcome.

285
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,751
We're so glad
to have you here.

286
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,336
This is a day
of celebration.

287
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,714
Another Taresian
has returned.

288
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:23,840
Welcome.

289
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,300
You're home
now, Harry.

290
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,802
Uh, wait a minute.

291
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,054
I still don't understand
how this is possible.

292
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,472
We'd like to ask
some questions

293
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,850
before we start
celebrating.
Of course.

294
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,936
Our doctor has found
some genetic fragments in my DNA

295
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,689
which could be part
of an alien genetic structure.

296
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,901
Yes, those are
your Taresian genes.

297
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,736
They're becoming active.

298
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,696
We'd be happy
to provide your doctor

299
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,156
with some DNA samples
for comparison.

300
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,117
What I want to know is
how I could have gotten them.

301
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,329
You were conceived here
on this world.

302
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,290
While you were still
an embryo,

303
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,292
you were placed in stasis
and taken to Earth

304
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,503
to be implanted in the womb
of an Earth woman.

305
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,298
My mother.
What did you do to her?

306
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,633
She would
have been completely

307
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,843
unaware
of the procedure.

308
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,597
After the implantation process,
the child begins to incorporate

309
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,266
some DNA
from the surrogate parent.

310
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,644
You developed physically
as a human,

311
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,647
so she would have thought
you were her natural child.

312
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,398
But you're saying I'm not.

313
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,568
We understand
how you feel.

314
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,862
Everyone here was born
on other worlds.

315
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,114
We all found our way
back home, like you,

316
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,743
and discovered we're not quite
who we thought we were.

317
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,829
Harry, maybe you'd
like to sit down.

318
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,080
Why don't you go get him
something to drink?

319
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,210
All of your children are
born to alien parents?

320
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,712
Yes.

321
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,006
And when they return,
each child brings an infusion

322
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,426
of new genetic material,
as well as years

323
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,595
of firsthand experience
about another culture.

324
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,973
But Harry wasn't trying
to return here.

325
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,600
We came to the Delta Quadrant
by accident.

326
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,561
His DNA was encoded
with certain instincts,

327
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,648
including the desire
to explore space.

328
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,525
Your "accident"

329
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,443
may have brought
him here faster,

330
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,531
but he<i> always</i> would have been
driven to find his way back.

331
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:17,203
You are the first to return
from such a great distance.

332
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,457
Harry...

333
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,421
That's how Taresians say
thank you, isn't it?

334
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,260
But how could I know so much
about a place I've never been?

335
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,680
It's been coded
into your Taresian genes.

336
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,348
As you've gotten
closer to home

337
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,475
and seen familiar sights,
your dormant genetic memory

338
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,728
has been
reawakened.

339
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,313
You'll remember more about us
as you spend time here.

340
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,567
I know it all seems strange now,
but you are one of us, Harry.

341
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,485
Can't you feel it?

342
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,698
Yes.

343
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,409
I can.

344
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,828
Then stay with us a while
and celebrate.

345
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,830
Come, have something to eat.

346
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,172
Is this the standard
welcome home reception?

347
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,050
For males, it is.

348
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,718
They're very rare.

349
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:17,722
Our population is
90 percent female.

350
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,432
Really?

351
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,642
I want to thank you again

352
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,519
for your help
in combating the Nasari.

353
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,564
Do you have any idea
why they tried to attack us?

354
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,524
They probably detected
a Taresian

355
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,359
aboard your ship,
as we did.

356
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,946
For the Nasari, that's
reason enough to destroy you.

357
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,655
Are your people
at war?

358
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,449
We have no interest
in fighting with them,

359
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,868
but they seem determined
to destroy<i> us.</i>

360
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,288
Our defense capabilities prevent
them from attacking directly,

361
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,831
but they do
everything in their power

362
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,208
to stop our people
from returning home.

363
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,627
TUVOK:
I see.

364
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,211
That might explain

365
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,171
Mr. Kim's instinctively
hostile reaction to them.

366
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,673
It's a defense mechanism

367
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,717
we've programmed
into all our children.

368
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,218
Are the Nasari likely
to attack us again

369
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,054
when we leave your space?

370
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,181
I think eventually they'll tire
of waiting for you to come out.

371
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,227
In the meantime, I'd advise you
to simply stay here for a while.

372
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,942
KIM:
These are words.

373
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,359
Mm-hm.
Can you read them?

374
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,694
Almost.

375
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,155
Our written language
is very complicated.

376
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,158
I can teach it to you
if you're interested.

377
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,701
Oh, that looks good.
What is it?

378
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,453
Spiced<i> hatana.</i>

379
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,038
I prepared it myself.

380
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,790
Harry, try some.

381
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,086
I'd like to find out
if I have any relatives here.

382
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,546
Maybe talk
to my biological parents.

383
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,299
I'm afraid none of us get

384
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,176
the chance
to meet our fathers.

385
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,970
They're the ones who take
the embryos to other worlds.

386
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,429
Your father must
have left here

387
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,848
a very long time ago
to make it all the way

388
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,058
to the Alpha Quadrant.

389
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,102
Ensign, we're transporting
back to the ship.

390
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,898
I'd like to stay
for a while.

391
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,608
I still have
a lot of questions.

392
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,818
Of course, Harry.

393
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,695
Contact us
when you're ready.

394
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,697
We'll see you later.

395
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,414
DOCTOR:
It's a positive match.

396
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,584
These genetic fragments
within Ensign Kim's DNA

397
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,211
are clearly Taresian.

398
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,547
Why haven't they shown up
in his medical scans before?

399
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,549
I went back and checked
his scans carefully.

400
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,467
These fragments have apparently
been disguising themselves

401
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,760
as the recessive elements

402
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,721
which normally exist
within all DNA,

403
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,263
but over the past few days,

404
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,682
they've become
increasingly dominant

405
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,184
over his human genes.

406
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,310
And they provided him
with new knowledge.

407
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,605
Yes, by forming neural
connections in his brain.

408
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,024
All humanoid babies

409
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,984
are born with certain
instinctive knowledge--

410
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,402
how to recognize
the shape of a face,

411
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,154
how to hold their
breath underwater.

412
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,697
It all comes from their genes.

413
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,116
The Taresians must have
found a way to manipulate

414
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,993
genetic material to implant

415
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,162
very specific knowledge
into their children.

416
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,538
It's scientifically plausible,

417
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,874
but quite a feat
of genetic engineering.

418
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,250
So what the Taresians
have been telling us

419
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,376
appears to be true.

420
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,171
Harry<i> is</i> 
one of their people.

421
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,631
And he's becoming more like them
every day, both physically

422
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,383
and neurologically.

423
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,927
I wonder how that's
going to influence him

424
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,803
when<i> Voyager's</i> ready to leave?

425
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,889
Of course,
when that might happen

426
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,557
is another question entirely.

427
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,308
Are the Nasari
still out there?

428
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,685
All three ships
are holding position

429
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,771
just outside the
Taresian system.

430
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,856
Even if we can't
wait them out,

431
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,983
we may only be postponing
another conflict.

432
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,359
I'd much rather find a way

433
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,070
to convince them
we're not their enemies.

434
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,571
Apparently, the Nasari

435
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,823
only consider Ensign
Kim their enemy.

436
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,491
Perhaps they would
be more receptive

437
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,577
to diplomacy
if he were not aboard.

438
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,787
Contact Harry.

439
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,622
Let him know
we'll be leaving orbit.

440
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,665
With any luck, we'll
be back in a few hours

441
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,542
with this matter resolved.

442
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,632
I joined the merchant fleet
so I could get into space

443
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,843
because I wanted to explore
every corner of the galaxy.

444
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,554
Like me with Starfleet.

445
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,057
All my life that's
all I ever wanted to do.

446
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,350
Now I guess I know why.

447
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,479
Strange to think
that some alien DNA fragments

448
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,814
have been controlling my life.

449
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,356
MALE:
Not controlling.

450
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,984
Influencing, yes.

451
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,568
You probably inherited
some Taresian traits

452
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,905
like... a talent
for math or music.

453
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:06,993
Yes. I always wondered
why I loved music so much

454
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,121
when my parents--
my human parents--

455
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,039
were practically tone deaf.

456
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,041
Wait. Wait a minute.
What is that?

457
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,793
Something to make
you feel good.

458
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,838
It's just a mild
mood enhancer.

459
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,507
No side effects.

460
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,301
You'll like it.

461
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,303
I think I'll pass.
Thanks.

462
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:28,014
This is Malia.

463
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,890
She's going to be
my first wife.

464
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,185
First?
Uh-huh.

465
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,312
You're already planning
on a second?

466
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,896
And a third.

467
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,024
We'll all be joined
with Taymon tonight.

468
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,692
What do humans call it

469
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,819
when a man and
women are joined?

470
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,445
It's called marriage.

471
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,781
But it's usually
one woman with one man.

472
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,825
How unusual.

473
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,995
I hope you come
to our ceremony.

474
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,788
I wouldn't miss it.

475
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,879
Don't be afraid to
indulge yourself, Harry.

476
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,298
Everybody here wants
you to be happy.

477
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,842
You're important to us.

478
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:08,428
That's what my human parents
used to say to me--

479
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,472
how special I was.

480
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,850
They'd been trying
to have a baby for years

481
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,894
until I came along.

482
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:18,564
They called me
their "miracle child."

483
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,982
They were right.

484
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,444
They spoiled me rotten,
making sacrifices

485
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,031
so they could give me
everything I wanted.

486
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,490
Sounds like you
were pretty lucky.

487
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,909
They loved you.

488
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,702
But I never felt like

489
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,411
I deserved
that kind of devotion.

490
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,999
I didn't see what was
so special about me.

491
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,589
I used to imagine that
I had these hidden powers.

492
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,175
I'd grow up to be
stronger than a Klingon

493
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,010
or able to read
people's minds.

494
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,305
Anything to make me more
than just an average kid.

495
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,182
Turns out your parents
were right about you.

496
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:57,019
You<i> have</i> been special
all of your life.

497
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,106
Feels pretty good,
doesn't it?

498
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,859
Yeah.
It does.

499
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,321
Mm... Let me relax
your muscles for you.

500
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,449
Uh, that would be great.

501
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,953
( sighs )

502
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,248
I think you're going to learn
to like it here, Harry.

503
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,624
I already like it.

504
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,127
Enough to stay?

505
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,088
I don't know about that.

506
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,174
I'm happy where I am
on<i> Voyager.</i>

507
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,344
You could be
happy here, too.

508
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,055
It's nothing you have
to decide right now.

509
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,224
Just enjoy yourself

510
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,600
while you're here.

511
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,977
( chuckles )

512
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,273
This uniform seems
so restrictive.

513
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,899
Why don't you let me

514
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,068
find you something
more comfortable?

515
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,486
Thanks.

516
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,822
I mean...

517
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,749
<i>I agree</i>
<i>with you completely, Captain.</i>

518
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,877
<i>There's no reason for further</i>
<i>hostility between us.</i>

519
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,338
I'm glad to hear it,

520
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,588
and I hope you'll
still feel that way

521
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,923
when Ensign Kim
is back on board.

522
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,259
<i>I doubt</i>
<i>we'll face that problem.</i>

523
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,761
<i>Your crew member</i>
<i>won't be returning to you.</i>

524
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,596
What do you mean?

525
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,599
<i>No one who "comes home"</i>
<i>to Taresia ever leaves again.</i>

526
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,019
<i>There are rumors</i>
<i>about those people.</i>

527
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,021
I'm not interested
in hearsay.

528
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,730
Are there any facts
you can give me?

529
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,192
<i>I fire</i>
<i>on any Taresian I see.</i>

530
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,818
<i>If you take</i>
<i>your crew member back on board,</i>

531
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,236
I<i> will attack your ship!</i>

532
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,364
<i>My best advice to you</i>

533
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,950
<i>is to forget him,</i>
<i>and be on your way.</i>

534
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,328
Do you think
there's any truth

535
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,662
to those rumors
he mentioned?

536
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,331
I don't know,
but I'll feel better

537
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,124
when we've got Harry back.

538
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,834
Set a course
back to the planet.

539
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,885
Captain, sensors indicate
a high-density polaron grid

540
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,303
surrounding
the planet.

541
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,222
A polaron grid?
It wasn't here before.

542
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,682
A network of satellites
was activated to generate it.

543
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,142
Can we get
through the grid?

544
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,229
Unlikely.
The polaric density is too high.

545
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,938
Hail them.

546
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,316
Our communications
are being blocked.

547
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,612
I guess we're
not welcome anymore.

548
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,851
Don't worry.

549
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,187
You'll remember
everything you need to know

550
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,689
about the ceremony
once it begins.

551
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,747
<i>Amal ulat.</i>

552
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,458
Let us be joined.

553
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,170
The joining is complete.

554
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,815
Why do they tie him
like that?

555
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,609
It's tradition.

556
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,486
It symbolizes binding
their lives together,

557
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,404
no longer looking
for anyone else.

558
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,032
Do you find it exciting?

559
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,370
I guess I hadn't really
thought of it that way.

560
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,374
You are going to stay
for the celebration, aren't you?

561
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,793
Actually, I should check in
with<i> Voyager.</i>

562
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,462
They're probably back by now.

563
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,092
( sighs )

564
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,136
Kim to<i> Voyager.</i>

565
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,098
This is Ensign Kim
calling<i> Voyager.</i>

566
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,433
Do you read?

567
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:53,065
Harry... I'm glad you
could be here for this.

568
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,692
It's been interesting.

569
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,361
I was wondering if there's
been any word from<i> Voyager.</i>

570
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,363
Not that I know of.

571
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,032
They probably
haven't returned yet.

572
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,617
It's been a long time.

573
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,703
I hope they didn't run
into trouble with the Nasari.

574
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,204
Oh, try not to worry.

575
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,164
Your Captain may
need some time

576
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,625
to convince those
people to see reason.

577
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,211
Hm, maybe so.

578
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,464
Come... join the
celebration while you wait.

579
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,218
And of course you're
welcome to stay the night.

580
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,726
We've been able
to poke some holes
in the tachyon grid,

581
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,728
but they're too small
to squeeze<i> Voyager</i> through.

582
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,563
Could a shuttle
make it?

583
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,856
I doubt it, and even if one
could, there's another problem--

584
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,359
a Taresian ship is patrolling
the other side of the grid.

585
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,069
And we saw
what they can do.

586
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,238
Ah, Captain, when you
raised some concerns

587
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,948
regarding the Taresians,

588
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,784
I began questioning their story
about Ensign Kim's birth.

589
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,161
I thought you'd confirmed
that he has Taresian DNA.

590
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,998
I did... and he does...
at least, he does now.

591
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,418
But when I checked his
previous microcellular scans,

592
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:58,213
I found no traces of the
Taresian genetic fragments.

593
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,633
I can only conclude
that he wasn't born with them.

594
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,677
Their whole story about
embryo implantation was a lie.

595
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:04,970
He's human.

596
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,014
Yes, although
maybe not for long.

597
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,310
The alien DNA is continuing
to alter his genetic structure.

598
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,270
Within a few days,
he'll be indistinguishable

599
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,730
from a native Taresian.

600
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,940
Do you have any idea
how this new DNA

601
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,191
could have gotten into
his cells?

602
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,859
The most likely
transfer mechanism

603
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,278
would be a retrovirus.

604
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,113
He was probably exposed
during an away mission.

605
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:26,450
Wouldn't the biofilters pick up
the virus and eliminate it?

606
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,993
They may very well have.

607
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:32,080
But once the virus transferred
the DNA into his cells,

608
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,873
"killing the messenger"
wouldn't have helped.

609
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,876
Is there any way to determine
exactly when he was infected?

610
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,420
Indeed there is.

611
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,797
The transporter buffer

612
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:42,048
performs its own version
of a microcellular scan

613
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,509
every time someone uses it.

614
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,803
I reviewed the logs
and found the first appearance

615
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,347
of the alien genes
in his molecular pattern

616
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,474
on stardate 50698.

617
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,100
Our away mission
to that planet

618
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,893
where we found
the vorillium.

619
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,646
Harry was with us
and he<i> was</i> separated

620
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,314
from the group
for a while.

621
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,525
He might have been infected
by something he ate or drank,

622
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,318
even something
he touched.

623
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,279
So Harry gets infused
with alien DNA,

624
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,115
which gives him the instinctive
urge to come here.

625
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,493
Then the Taresians tell him
this elaborate story

626
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,705
to make him believe
he was one of them. Why?

627
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,956
Don't forget that welcoming
committee on the planet.

628
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,125
It sounds as if they're
giving him every incentive

629
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,044
to want to stay on Taresia.

630
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,838
And by keeping us away,

631
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,757
they're making the decision
for him.

632
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,926
Here you are.

633
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,723
I hope you'll be
comfortable here.

634
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,684
Is there anything else
that I can get for you?

635
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,645
No. I'll be fine.

636
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,063
Thanks.

637
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,859
Good night.

638
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,529
Get into bed.

639
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,781
You're going
to tuck me in?

640
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,158
"Tuck you in"?

641
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,494
It's a human custom.

642
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:56,749
Parents tuck their children
into bed, tell them a story,

643
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,835
or sing a lullaby to them
to help them get to sleep.

644
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,712
That's sweet.

645
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,807
Lie back and relax.

646
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,308
( chuckles )

647
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,438
<i>Lekaria san.</i>

648
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,190
Do you understand?

649
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,067
Pleasant dreams.

650
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,485
Mm-hm.

651
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,700
Now close your eyes.

652
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,170
Mm. That's smells good.

653
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,798
Mm-hm.

654
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,467
It's the essence
of rikka flowers.

655
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,218
It's very soothing.

656
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,688
<i>Lekaria san.</i>

657
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,533
Good night, Harry.

658
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,426
<i>You're Taresian.</i>
<i>Welcome home.</i>

659
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,679
<i>I think you'll like it</i>
<i>here, Harry.</i>

660
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,433
We've been lucky
to have you, Harry.

661
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,813
You really have been special
all your life.

662
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,732
You know where your
real home is, Harry.

663
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,026
I think you'll
like it here, Harry.

664
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,321
Stay with me.

665
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,874
It's all right. It's all right.
You were dreaming.

666
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,253
What are you doing here?

667
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,589
We just want to help you relax
and enjoy yourself.

668
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,050
Look, I appreciate
the offer,

669
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,301
but I'd really
rather be alone.

670
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,595
I don't believe that.

671
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,221
I think you've been spending

672
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,724
too many nights alone,
Harry.

673
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,142
You've got to stop
holding yourself back.

674
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,645
I know you have
the same natural desires

675
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,397
as any Taresian.

676
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:10,067
Now, you're free
to act on them.

677
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,110
You can't fight
genetics.

678
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,653
I can try.

679
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,494
I want you
to choose me, Harry.

680
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,038
Choose both of us,

681
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,164
then you'll only have
to find one more wife.

682
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,541
( chuckles )

683
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,127
I'm not joining with you
or with anybody.

684
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,922
But that's the reason why you
were drawn back home, Harry--

685
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,590
to have children.

686
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,258
Listen to your instincts.

687
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,635
No.

688
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:41,431
Like I told you before,
I'm going back to<i> Voyager.</i>

689
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,726
You could never be as valuable
to them as you are to us.

690
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,103
We need you.

691
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,105
You have a responsibility
to your people

692
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,356
to pass on your genes
to the next generation.

693
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,734
If there's anything your
Taresian genes have given you,

694
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,861
it's a sense
of duty and loyalty.

695
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,740
My loyalty is to my crew
and my family back home.

696
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,450
You don't belong
with them anymore.

697
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,911
This is who you are--
one of us.

698
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,746
Your place is here.

699
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,292
We'll make you glad
you stayed.

700
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:13,421
Think of Taymon,
how happy he's been.

701
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,715
Let yourself be happy.

702
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,259
It's the right choice,
Harry.

703
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,929
This is the life
you were always meant to have.

704
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:42,283
Maybe this life
wouldn't be so terrible.

705
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,618
( all chuckle )

706
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,328
It will be wonderful.

707
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,373
You'll have everything
you ever wanted

708
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,292
and a place of honor
among your people.

709
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,753
You'll never be alone
again, Harry.

710
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,672
We'll make sure of that.

711
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,134
Three wives?
Mm-hm.

712
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,635
Hm.

713
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,349
I've got to think
about my choice.

714
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,476
I know you're attracted to me.

715
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,436
There's been a connection
between us

716
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,813
since the moment you got here.

717
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,148
You're right.

718
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,524
I felt it, too.

719
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:23,783
I'm definitely considering you
as one of my wives.

720
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,881
What are you doing?

721
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,799
Well, it's like
you said before,

722
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,594
this could be exciting.

723
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:53,230
Remember, you both...

724
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,981
want to make me happy,
don't you?

725
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,609
This is some
kind of trick.

726
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,489
( grunts )

727
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,491
Sorry about that.
Shh!

728
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,452
( muffled speech )

729
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,896
( whispering ):
Taymon?

730
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,316
It's Harry.

731
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,277
I really need your help.

732
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,906
( buzzes )

733
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,165
Are you in there?

734
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,420
( gasps )

735
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,018
( door code beeping )

736
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,352
( gasps )

737
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,490
( gasps )

738
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,575
So is this what I should expect
on my honeymoon?

739
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,244
It would have been
much easier for you

740
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,871
if you hadn't seen this.

741
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,123
You mean easier for you
to lead me to the slaughter.

742
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,292
What did you do to Taymon?

743
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,502
We must denucleate
a large number of cells

744
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,297
to collect enough genetic
material for conception.

745
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,264
That's why
there are no men here.

746
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,684
They don't leave
with their embryos in stasis...

747
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,686
They're killed.

748
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,604
Any father should be willing
to sacrifice himself

749
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,439
for the sake of his children,

750
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,400
for the continuation
of his race.

751
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,527
Was anything
you told me true?

752
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,906
About Taresians being born
on other worlds,

753
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,325
about my being one of you?

754
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,493
It's true male children
are very rare here,

755
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:16,497
and that we seek out new DNA
to sustain our race.

756
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,334
We need males of other species--
like you--

757
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,961
who can be transformed
into compatible mates.

758
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,297
Transformed?

759
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,925
That's what these genes
are doing to me?

760
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,344
You'll be celebrated
for your contribution.

761
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,012
Don't count on it.

762
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,808
You're going to take me
to a communications terminal

763
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,643
where I can contact my ship.

764
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,105
( door code beeping )

765
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,818
( grunts )

766
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,195
KIM:
Stay out of my way.

767
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,363
This won't work.

768
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,156
You're too important
to us.

769
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,574
Whatever happens to me,

770
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,243
they won't allow
you to leave.

771
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,621
( all gasp )

772
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,792
CHAKOTAY:
If we hit the grid here,
we'll have a few seconds

773
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,420
before the patrol ship
can move in to intercept us.

774
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,338
That doesn't give you much time
to get a lock on Harry.

775
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,714
Then I'll have to be quick.

776
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,258
Are the shields ready?

777
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,385
The new configuration
is stable.

778
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,678
Set a course
for the target coordinates

779
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,513
and engage at full impulse.

780
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,848
Aye, Captain.

781
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,565
We're disrupting the grid,
but we need more speed

782
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,359
to overcome
the inertial resistance.

783
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,153
Increasing power.

784
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,036
We're clear.

785
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,456
I'm not picking up
Harry's com signal.

786
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,791
Initiating level-1
bio-scans of the surface.

787
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,961
Captain, the Taresian ship
is on an intercept course.

788
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,879
Battle stations.

789
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,810
( growling )

790
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,228
( screams )

791
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,742
This could have been
a joyous occasion.

792
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,870
<i>Amal ulat!</i>

793
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,747
Now!

794
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,215
I won't let you do this to me!

795
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,259
Harry, there's nowhere to go.

796
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,682
We've got him.

797
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,227
Setting a new course.

798
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,229
TUVOK:
The Taresians
are in pursuit.

799
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,147
Return fire.
Aye, sir.

800
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,233
Captain, we've got
another problem.

801
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,443
Three Nasari ships
coming straight at us.

802
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,861
Time till intercept?

803
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,363
PARIS:
Less than one minute.

804
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,825
Harry.
Captain.

805
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,495
Welcome back.

806
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,663
We could use your
strategic intuition about now.

807
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,249
JANEWAY: I'm counting
on the Taresians

808
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,000
not to back off
from those Nasari ships.

809
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,419
They won't.
Good.

810
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,836
Let's hope
they're more interested

811
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,338
in fighting
with each other than with us.

812
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,048
Five seconds to intercept.

813
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,226
We are no longer
being pursued.

814
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:26,145
Let's not give them a chance
to change their mind.

815
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,115
But Odysseus had been warned
that these women,

816
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,742
the sirens,
sang a song so beautiful

817
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,203
that any man who heard it
would be lured to his death.

818
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,497
So how did he get the ship
past them?

819
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,082
He told his crew
to cover their ears

820
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,126
so they couldn't hear
the sirens' song.

821
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,003
But he also had them tie him
to the mast of the ship

822
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,755
so he could listen himself

823
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,592
without being led astray
as they sailed past.

824
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:58,719
Anyone would have been drawn in
by these... Taresians.

825
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,556
I have never seen so many
beautiful women in my life.

826
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,308
It wasn't just
the women.

827
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,642
Oh...

828
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,936
( mumbles )

829
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,771
There was also
something exciting

830
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,356
about having a new identity,

831
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,817
being more than just
"young Ensign Kim."

832
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,028
Well, I, for one, am glad
to have a young Ensign Kim

833
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,239
back with us.

834
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,574
Although I still say

835
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:20,992
you should have kept
some of those spots.

836
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,119
I thought they were
very distinguished.

837
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,499
I don't see what's so bad
about being you.

838
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:28,916
You're good at your job,

839
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,126
everybody likes you.

840
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,710
Being likable is fine,

841
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,213
but sometimes I wish
I could be more bold,

842
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,174
confident with women--
more like you.

843
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,759
Like me?

844
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,515
You might want to
reconsider that, Harry.

845
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,308
There could be prison time
involved.

846
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,647
Actually, since
I've been on<i> Voyager,</i>

847
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:53,650
I've tried to be
more like you.

848
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:54,900
That'll be the day.

849
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,694
No, I'm serious.
You're my role model.

850
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,405
You're reliable,
hard-working,

851
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,574
extremely punctual.
Did I mention polite?

852
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,117
Heh, thanks a lot.
