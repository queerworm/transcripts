Warp 7.

00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,844
I've reached

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,419
I'm reading a fracture

00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,386
I'm approaching

( grunts )

26
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,222
But the nacelle
isn't holding.

27
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,932
KIM:
<i>Tie in auxiliary power.</i>

28
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,726
It's no use.

29
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,311
I'm breaking up! I'm breaking---

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,702

(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,650
It's the
pylon again.

36
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,277
Every time we get close
to crossing the threshold,

37
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,405
the subspace torque rips
a nacelle off the shuttle.

38
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,701
What about
a duranium alloy?

39
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,243
We could try using
it to reinforce--

40
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,287
I thought about that already.
It's too brittle.

41
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,248
More coffee?

42
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,710
Ah,
you look like a happy bunch.

43
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,003
We've hit a wall.

44
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,254
Oh. Well, maybe I can help.

45
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,424
Great. Do you know anything
about quantum warp theory

46
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,803
or multispectral subspace
engine design?

47
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,514
No,
but I'm a quick study.

48
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,600
( clears throat )
What are we working on?

49
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,562
Do you have anything to eat?

50
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,065
Sure.
There's some Kalavian biscuits

51
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,983
somewhere in the kitchen.

52
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,446
I guess
I'll go find them myself.

53
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,034
Fill him in.

54
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,285
KIM:
Neelix...

55
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,330
It would take
too long to--

56
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,541
What are you saying?
I'm not smart enough?

57
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,252
I'll have you know
I did two years

58
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,629
as an engineer's assistant
aboard a Trabalian freighter.

59
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,715
I'm well-versed
in warp theory.

60
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,218
Okay, okay,
we'll tell you.

61
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:23,388
We're trying to break
the maximum warp barrier.

62
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,141
Nothing in the universe
can go warp 10.

63
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,851
It's a theoretical
impossibility.

64
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,770
In principle,
if you were ever

65
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,648
to reach warp 10, you'd be
traveling at infinite velocity.

66
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,235
Infinite velocity.

67
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,030
Got it.
So, tha-that means very fast.

68
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,742
It means that
you would occupy

69
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,703
every point in
the universe simultaneously.

70
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,039
In theory, you could go
any place in the wink of an eye.

71
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,958
Time and distance
would have no meaning.

72
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,501
If<i> Voyager</i> achieved
warp 10,

73
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,337
we could be home in as long
as it takes to push a button.

74
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,257
Wow!

75
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,259
And you're working
on this?

76
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,927
We discovered
a new form of dilithium

77
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,221
in the asteroid field
we surveyed last month.

78
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,848
It remains stable at
a much higher warp frequency.

79
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,475
The problem is,
every time

80
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,769
we simulate crossing
the transwarp threshold,

81
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,354
the nacelles get
torn off the ship.

82
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,776
I remember there was a time when
I lost a warp nacelle

83
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,736
going through
a dark matter nebula.

84
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,905
This is
a very different problem.

85
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,284
I realize that.
I'm just using it as an example.

86
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,869
As the ship went
through the nebula,

87
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,289
it sent out
a dark matter bow wave.

88
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,040
Eventually,
so much pressure built up,

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,667
it tore the nacelle
from its housing.

90
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,004
Now, maybe the same thing
is happening to you.

91
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,505
The simulations
don't indicate

92
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,215
any kind of subspace stress
on the nacelles.

93
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,549
PARIS:
Wait a minute.

94
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,761
What about
the shuttle itself?

95
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,180
What do you mean?

96
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,973
Maybe we've been looking
in the wrong place.

97
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,225
What if the nacelles
aren't being torn from the ship?

98
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,686
What if the<i> ship</i> is being torn
from the nacelles?

99
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,605
The hull of the shuttle
is made of tritanium alloy.

100
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,066
At the speeds
we're talking about,

101
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,860
that alloy
could depolarize...

102
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,903
And create
a velocity differential.

103
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,947
The fuselage
would be traveling

104
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,158
at a faster rate of speed
than the nacelles.

105
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,617
That means
we just have to set up

106
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,744
a depolarization matrix
around the fuselage.

107
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,288
That's it!

108
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,792
Neelix,
you're a genius.

109
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,252

00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,882

<i>You've done it! And there's</i>
<i>been no damage to the nacelles.</i>

122
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,038
When you came to me
a month ago

123
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,497
and said
you had a way

124
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,541
to cross
the transwarp threshold,

125
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,961
I thought it was more
of a fantasy than a theory.

126
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,507
Congratulations
to all of you.

127
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,594
So we can try
a manned test flight?

128
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,763
What's your flight plan?

129
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,306
I'll bring the shuttle
up to speed.

130
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,974
The second
I cross the threshold,

131
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,185
I'll cut the engines,
drop out of warp and come about.

132
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,355
After that, we'll analyze
the shuttle's sensor logs.

133
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,565
Once we know it's safe
to travel at transwarp,

134
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,151
we'll try
a more extended flight.

135
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,195
To be honest,
it's almost frightening.

136
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,197
Up till now,
it's all been theory.

137
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,116
I never thought
it would actually happen.

138
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,701
Are we ready for it?

139
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,328
In the last couple
of centuries,

140
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,290
we've always managed to use
new technologies wisely.

141
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,540
I'm confident

142
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,793
this time won't
be any different.

143
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:44,005
Besides, there's no way to put
the genie back in the bottle.

144
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,175
All we can do now is keep
moving forward...

145
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,718
carefully.

146
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,929
Well, good luck,
Mr. Paris.

147
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,557
If this works, you'll be joining
an elite group of pilots.

Zefram Cochrane...

00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,151
I kind of like
the way that sounds.

151
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,069

Can I...
Get you anything?

160
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,179
No, thank you.

161
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,680
Now,
why do I get the feeling

162
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,017
this isn't
just a social call?

163
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,311
I've just spoken to
the doctor...

164
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,687
and it's his opinion

165
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,523
that we let Ensign Kim make
the test flight.

166
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,651
( scoffs softly )

167
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,072
May I ask why?

168
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,617
He checked over
your biometric readings

169
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,328
from the
shuttle simulations.

170
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,704
He says you
have a slight

171
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,081
enzymatic imbalance
in your cerebellum.

172
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,333
So?

173
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,126
I know it doesn't sound
like much,

174
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,961
but he can't predict
what'll happen

175
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,629
when you cross
the threshold.

176
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,298
He believes there's
a small chance

177
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,883
that you could suffer
a brain hemorrhage

178
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,634
under the
subspace stress.

179
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,428
How big a chance?

180
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,472
Two percent.

181
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,806
( scoffs )

182
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,809
Two percent?

183
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,269
( sighs )

184
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,021
I'll take that chance.

185
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,523
There's no reason to.

186
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,899
Ensign Kim is capable

187
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,567
of piloting the shuttle
for this mission.

188
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,069
Yeah, he's capable.

189
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,611
That's not the point.

190
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,239
What is the point,
Mr. Paris?

191
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,242
Well, it's hard to explain,
but...

192
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,869
this is<i> my</i> flight.

193
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,080
<i>Your</i> flight.

194
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,045
When I was a boy,

195
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,797
my father used to tell me
that I was special,

196
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:54,010
that one day
I'd do something significant.

197
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,347
My teachers at school,
all the kids,

198
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,559
everyone used to say,
"Tom Paris is gonna

199
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,228
do something important
when he grows up."

200
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
( sighs )

201
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,650
Obviously,
that didn't happen.

202
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,528
This isn't about
personal redemption.

203
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,613
We're talking
about medical risk.

204
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,074
Your life could be in danger,
and we need you.

205
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,285
Captain, this is the first time
in 10 years

206
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,954
I feel I<i> have</i> a life
to risk.

207
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,874
You're sure about this.

208
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,794
Captain, I've never been so sure
about anything.

209
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,922
Please.

210
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,635
Please,
let me make the flight.

211
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,895
Good luck, Lieutenant.

212
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,360
( door opens, closes )

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
( sighs )

214
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,530
Torres to Bridge.

215
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,074
The prelaunch sequence
is complete, Captain.

216
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,451
Acknowledged.

217
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,328
Ensign Kim,
depressurize the shuttle bay

218
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,745
and open
the space doors.

219
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,789
KIM:
Aye, Captain.

220
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,959
Bridge to
Shuttlecraft<i> Cochrane.</i>

221
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,252
You're cleared
for launch.

222
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,878
PARIS:
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

223
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,673
See you at warp 10.

224
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,843
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

225
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,142
<i>Cochrane</i> to<i> Voyager.</i>

226
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,186
All systems are nominal.

227
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,812
I'm increasing speed.

228
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,981
JANEWAY:
<i>We'll keep up with you</i>
<i>as long as we can.</i>

229
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,399
( chuckles )
( console beeps )

230
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,777
Warp 7,
warp 8...

231
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,321
How's his dilithium matrix
holding up?

232
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,072
There's a slight variance
in the warp field,

233
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,658
but nothing
to worry about.

234
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,868
Torres to
Shuttlecraft<i> Cochrane.</i>

235
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,079
You're clear
for transwarp velocity.

236
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,540
Acknowledged.

237
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,750
Engaging transwarp drive
in four...

238
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,252
three...

239
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,422
two...

240
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,342
PARIS:
<i>Warp 9.7...</i>

241
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,302
<i>9.8...</i>

242
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,346
( muddled ):
<i>9.9...</i>

243
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,015
He is exceeding
our maximum velocity.

244
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,100
I am switching
to long-range sensors.

245
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,810
PARIS:
<i>Warp 9.95!</i>

246
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,937
TUVOK:
He is approaching
the threshold.

247
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,440
Engine output at maximum.

248
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,442
Velocity...

249
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,988
Warp 10.

250
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,240
Yes!

251
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,824
PARIS:
<i>Transwarp engines are stable.</i>

252
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,951
<i>So are the nacelle pylons.</i>

253
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,453
<i>I'm going to--</i>

254
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,163
( voice distorting ):
<i>Oh, my God....</i>

255
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,747
( distortion increases ):
<i>Oh, my...</i>

256
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,166
Lieutenant,
can you hear me?

257
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,335
( console beeping )
KIM: Captain, he just...

258
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,504
Just disappeared
off sensors.

259
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,297
Increase sensor gain
to maximum.

260
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,966
Nothing.

261
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,801
I can't find him.

262
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,096
He's gone.

263
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,849
(<i> dramatic theme continues</i> )

264
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,441
I've done
three full sensor sweeps.

265
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,901
No sign of the shuttle
within five parsecs.

266
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,195
Tuvok, could the shuttle
have been destroyed?

267
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,863
I don't
believe so.

268
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,782
Sensors indicate that he did
cross the warp threshold.

269
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,827
If that's true, then he could be
anywhere in the universe.

270
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,997
We'll just have to keep
searching our small corner.

271
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,790
Run a multispectral sweep.
I want to see if--

272
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,126
TUVOK:
Captain,

273
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,462
there's a quantum surge
off the port bow.

274
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,298
Something is coming
out of subspace.

275
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,012
Janeway to Paris.
KIM: He's alive,

276
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,640
but his life signs
are weak.

277
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,141
Bridge to
Transporter Room 2.

278
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,976
Beam Mr. Paris
directly to Sickbay.

279
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,603
Commander, bring
the shuttle aboard.

280
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,063
I'll be
in Sickbay.

281
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,732
Aye, Captain.

282
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,026
DOCTOR:
His life signs
are normal.

283
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,613
A few elevated
serotonin readings

284
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,989
in the hypothalamus.

285
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,368
From what I can tell,
he's just...

286
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,162
asleep.

287
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,455
Can you wake him?

288
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,872
I don't see why not.

289
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,544
Wake up, Lieutenant!
( gasping )

290
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,799
( sighs )

291
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,634
Are you all right, Tom?

292
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,178
I'm back.

293
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,263
We tracked you until you
crossed the threshold.

294
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,265
Then you disappeared
from our sensors.

295
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,309
Do you remember
what happened?

296
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,356
Oh, yeah.

297
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,570
I was...

298
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,072
I was staring at
the velocity indicator.

299
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,283
It said warp 10.

300
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,119
And then,
as I watched it,

301
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,872
I suddenly realized
that I was...

302
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,750
watching myself
as well.

303
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,544
I could see the outside
of the shuttle.

304
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,086
I could see<i> Voyager.</i>

305
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,130
I could see
inside<i> Voyager.</i>

306
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,091
I could see
inside this room.

307
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,427
For a moment...

308
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,556
I was everywhere.

309
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,643
I mean, 
everywhere, Captain.

310
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,144
With the Kazon...

311
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,814
Back home, with the Klingons,
other galaxies,

312
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,482
it was all there.

313
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,361
I don't know how else
to explain it.

314
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,530
It was like...

315
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,158
Well, no,
it wasn't like anything.

316
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,577
DOCTOR:
Well...

317
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,497
I'm glad
you had a good time.

318
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,916
How did you get back
to<i> Voyager?</i>

319
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,756
I saw that you
were looking for me,

320
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,507
so I took the new engines
off-line

321
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,426
and ended up
back where I started.

322
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,471
But...

323
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,474
Oh, it's starting
to slip away.

324
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,144
It all was so vivid,
and now...

325
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,605
B'ELANNA:
Tom!

326
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,900
Oh, I'm fine.
How's the shuttle?

327
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,694
You brought it back
without a scratch.

328
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,655
The onboard sensors
confirm that you did it.

329
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,031
You made it
to warp 10.

330
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,242
JANEWAY:
Congratulations,
Mr. Paris.

331
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,411
You just made
the history books.

332
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,204
We should download
the shuttle's

333
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,457
sensor logs,
analyze the telemetry

334
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,918
they picked up during the flight
before we make another attempt.

335
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,335
You're not
going anywhere,

336
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,421
at least not
for a few hours.

337
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,549
I have some tests I'd like
to run on your majesty

338
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,050
before I release
you back

339
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,344
into the realm
of ordinary humans.

340
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,972
You may...proceed.

341
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,474
We'll download
the logs.

342
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,559
I'll let you know
what we find.

343
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,937
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

344
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,028
Janeway to Kim.
We're ready.

345
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,864
Acknowledged.

346
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,534
I'm downloading the logs into
the Engineering computer core.

347
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,119
( console beeping)

348
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,789
This data describes,
literally,

349
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,541
every cubic centimeter
in this sector.

350
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,211
It's over 5 billion
gigiquads of information.

351
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,799
It would appear that the theory
of infinite velocity is correct.

352
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,217
It may be possible to occupy
every point in the universe

353
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,178
simultaneously.

354
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,264
B'ELANNA:
Then, it's just a matter of
navigation. If we could figure

355
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,810
out how to come out of
transwarp at a specific point...

356
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,938
...this could get us home.

357
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,064
Oh, it could do more
than that.

358
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,151
It could change the very nature
of our existence.

359
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,154
Think of it.

360
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,114
There would be nothing
beyond our reach.

361
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:16,327
This telemetry is giving us an
invaluable record of the sector.

362
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,954
We can use it
to make a star chart.

363
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,288
Transfer the shuttle logs

364
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,081
to Stellar Cartography
for analysis.

365
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,500
Right.

366
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,632
This is
a new blend.

367
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,385
I'm calling it
Paris Delight.

368
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,722
( chuckles )

369
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,264
It's in honor
of you.

370
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,976
What?

371
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,769
Oh!
Oh, thanks.

372
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,479
That's
very flattering.

373
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,356
I can tell.

374
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,195
Well, you might as well get used
to it. You're a hero now.

375
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,073
Heh, I wish I could say
it was nothing.

376
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,245
Oh!

377
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,330
Oh, I wish Neelix
would name something after me

378
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,665
that tasted a little better.

379
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,752
It smells okay.
No. Trust me.

380
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,046
You're taking your life
into your hands.

381
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,715
So I think the next step

382
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,217
is to try to duplicate
the first shuttle flight,

383
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,552
verify our results.

384
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,095
I agree.

385
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,014
We have to confirm
that none of this was a fluke.

386
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,433
But I do think
that we should increase

387
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,685
the shuttle's memory core
by at least...

388
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,647
( beeping )

389
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,357
What? What's wrong?

390
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,610
( exhaling )

391
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,153
I don't think that coffee
is settling too well.

392
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,823
You wanna go back
to Sickbay?

393
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,535
No, no. I've seen enough
of the doctor for one day.

394
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,122
( groaning )

395
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,749
Oh...
On second thought,

396
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,918
maybe I should--

397
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,544
( groaning )

398
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,174
Torres to Transporter Room 2.
Medical emergency.

399
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,343
Beam Lieutenant Paris
directly to Sickbay.

400
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,887
MAN:
<i>I can't lock onto him.</i>

401
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,305
<i>His pattern keeps changing.</i>

402
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,848
Torres to Sickbay.

403
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,059
We need a medical team
in the mess hall right away.

404
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,311
Hang on,
Tom.

405
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,772
( gasping )

406
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,863
( gasping )

407
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,744
Hmm.

408
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,080
It looks like he's having
an allergic reaction.

409
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,372
What did
he ingest?

410
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,541
Just a cup
of Neelix's coffee.

411
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,461
It's a miracle
he's still alive.

412
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,132
( beeping )

413
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,469
This is strange.

414
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,846
What is?

415
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,348
He's definitely having
an allergic reaction...

416
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,224
to the water
in the coffee.

417
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,602
He's allergic to water?

418
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,646
I don't know
how this is possible, but...

419
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,691
It appears that his entire
biochemistry is changing.

420
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,693
His electrolytes
are breaking down,

421
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,195
interstitial fluids
are congealing.

422
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,905
( gasping acutely )

423
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,747
( gasping continues )

424
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,835
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

425
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,629
The alveoli in his lungs
are mutating.

426
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,133
He's no longer
processing oxygen.

427
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,467
What should we do?

428
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,219
Stand back.

429
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,434
Computer, erect
an isolation field

430
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,145
around
the surgical bay.

431
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,524
Computer, remove all the air
from within the force field

432
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,068
and replace it with
80 percent nitrogen

433
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,486
and 20 percent
acidichloride.

434
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,157
( gasping )

435
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,951
( normal breathing )

436
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,831
He can breathe...
for now.

437
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,291
What's happening
to him?

438
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,752
I have no idea,

439
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,587
but I assume it had
something to do

440
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,463
with his experience
on the shuttle.

441
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,965
( Paris screaming )

442
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,550
( console beeping )

443
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,845
( Paris gasping )
(beeping )

444
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,765
His cellular membranes
are deteriorating.

445
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,558
He's dying.

446
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,854
I need to know more about
what happened on that shuttle,

447
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,564
and I need
to know it now.

448
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,109
Radiation levels, unexplained
anomalies, anything.

449
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,130
You're losing me,
aren't you?

450
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,423
I'm gonna die.

451
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,052
You're too stubborn to die,
Mr. Paris.

452
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,055
I want to try high-saturation
radiometric therapy.

453
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,390
It might slow down
his cellular mutation.

454
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,351
PARIS:
Here lies
Thomas Eugene Paris,

455
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,519
beloved mutant.

456
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,021
A fitting
epitaph,

457
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,940
but I don't intend to
let you use it just yet.

458
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,942
Radiometric emitters
are charged and ready.

459
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,862
Begin with 45 rads per second.

460
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:06,033
Great. Now it'll read
beloved radioactive mutant.

461
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,662
No effect. Increase the dosage
to 85 rads per second.

462
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,038
I'm going to try inhibiting

463
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,291
the cell mitosis with
a bio-suppressor field.

464
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,668
A big funeral,

465
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,546
with lots of pretty girls
all crying...

466
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,965
Except Torres.

467
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,051
Torres doesn't cry.
Do you ever notice that?

468
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,846
I don't trust people
who don't cry.

469
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,598
Of course,
my father...

470
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,643
he'd say crying
is a sign of weakness.

471
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,812
I never believed that.

472
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,147
Do you cry?

473
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,399
It's not in my program.

474
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,527
Shame.

475
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,280
Heh, you know, it's funny.

476
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,699
What I remember most
about being a kid

477
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:50,036
are the times I spent
in my room crying.

478
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,788
I liked my room, though.

479
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,456
It was quiet in there.

480
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,542
People'd leave me alone.

481
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,377
I'd keep the door locked.
Read, play games.

482
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,423
Heh, I lost my virginity
in that room.

483
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,968
Seventeen.

484
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,678
Parents were away
for the weekend.

485
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,306
I'll note that
in your medical file.

486
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,475
( groaning softly )
( instrument beeps sharply )

487
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,144
His lymphatic system
is collapsing.

488
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,104
Increase dosage to 98 rads

489
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,023
per second.

490
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,858
Pepperoni!

491
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,360
God, I'd love
a pepperoni pizza

492
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,863
with Kavarian olives right now.
I'm starving!

493
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,324
His life signs are critical.
Maximum dosage.

494
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,119
Oh... Kiss me.

495
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,080
What?

496
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,582
Not you. Her.

497
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,500
She can't breathe
the atmosphere in here.

498
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,336
Consider it a last request.

499
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,672
Sorry, Tom. If we let down the
force field, you'll suffocate.

500
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,759
Oh, what's the difference?

501
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,096
I'm dying anyway.

502
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,017
Do me a favor.

503
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,103
When I'm gone...

504
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,065
call
Starfleet Headquarters...

505
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,777
And tell Dad that I did it.

506
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,114
Tell him...

507
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,411
( instrument beeping sharply )

508
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,164
Prepare to activate
the neural simulator.

509
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,582
KES:
Ready.

510
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,377
Now.

511
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,837
( gasping )

512
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,089
Again.

513
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,049
( gasping )

514
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,384
Again!

515
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,765
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

516
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,768
( instrument sounds
steady tone )

517
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,854
No neural activity.

518
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,940
We can try to revive him.

519
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,443
His cell membranes
have degraded.

520
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,446
There's nothing more
we can do.

521
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,989
Computer...
( beeps )

522
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,619
Remove the acidichloride gas
from the isolation field...

523
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,746
( beeps )

524
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,166
And deactivate the field.
( beeps )

525
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:04,920
(<i> dramatic theme continues</i> )

526
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,272
It will be necessary
for us to perform an autopsy

527
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,858
on the Lieutenant's body
in the morning.

528
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,028
Until then, I...

529
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,157
suggest you get
some rest.

530
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:59,392
(<i> dramatic theme continues</i> )

531
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,185
( creaking )

532
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,626
( creaking continues )

533
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,562
( breathing heavily )

534
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,564
You're alive.

535
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,322
( panting )

536
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,661
Wha--
What's happening?

537
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,922
All of your internal organs
are functioning again.

538
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,467
In fact...

539
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,676
You seem to have
an extra one.

540
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,762
What?

541
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,641
You have...two hearts.

542
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,612
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

543
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,656
( beeping )

544
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,077
I have
30 seconds before

545
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,121
Security picks up
this transmission.

546
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,457
I'm sending you
all current information

547
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,375
on the warp 10
shuttle flight.

548
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,585
<i>Warp 10?</i>

549
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:52,921
<i>That's impossible.</i> 
Not anymore.

550
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,215
Lieutenant Paris crossed
the threshold this morning.

551
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,842
<i>He survived?</i>

552
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,346
In a manner of speaking.
It's all in the file.

553
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,806
This should prove my worth
to you, Rettik.

554
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,475
<i>We'll see.</i>

555
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,561
( beeps )

556
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,983
( sighs )

557
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,569
DOCTOR:
His body is going
through some sort

558
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,987
of mutation.

559
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,282
His DNA
is rewriting itself.

560
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,326
To what end,
I don't know.

561
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,743
Does this have
anything to do

562
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,538
with the enzymatic
imbalance you found?

563
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,040
No.
Can you stop it?

564
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,083
So far,
nothing has worked.

565
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,544
The mutations are
unlike anything

566
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,212
in Starfleet
medical records.

567
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,548
His internal organs
are being rearranged.

568
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,756
Some have atrophied

569
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,467
and been absorbed
into his body.

570
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,678
And there are at least
three others that have appeared

571
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,388
and have no identifiable
function at all.

572
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,014
What about his brain?

573
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,642
There are neuro-electrical
transmutations at work.

574
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,521
His synaptic patterns are
changing...almost every second.

575
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,691
But he does still
recognize me...

576
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,025
the ship.

577
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,610
He knows who he is.

578
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,405
Can I talk to him?
Of course.

579
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,823
But I feel I
should caution you

580
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,911
that while he
still is Tom Paris,

581
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,288
he's becoming something
else as well.

582
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,709
His personality is
erratic, unpredictable.

583
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,377
There are moments
of lucidity

584
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,003
interspersed
with almost...

585
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,963
deranged behavior.

586
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,965
I'll keep it
in mind.

587
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,511
( beeping )

588
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,068
Pretty disgusting,
huh?

589
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,986
You've looked better.

590
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,241
How do you feel?

591
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:48,203
Like a lab experiment
gone wrong.

592
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,123
Well, we're trying to put
that experiment right.

593
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,042
The doctor's working on a way
to restore your DNA to its--

594
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,252
Why?

595
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,670
Excuse me?

596
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,005
Why?

597
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,342
What I'm becoming will probably
be better than who I was.

598
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,762
Lieutenant,
you know that's not true.

599
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,972
Oh, yes, it is.

600
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,348
Admit it.

601
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,351
Part of you will be glad
to see me gone.

602
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,437
I'm the Maquis traitor
who sits on your Bridge

603
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,814
and insults your uniform,
remember?

604
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,899
We're all concerned
about you, Tom.

605
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,318
We're here to help you.

606
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,653
No, you're not.

607
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,862
You're trying to take this
away from me.

608
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,114
Take what away from you?

609
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,907
What I'm becoming.

610
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,911
How do you know
this isn't good for me?

611
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,497
How do you know
this isn't

612
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,832
the best thing that's ever
happened to me?

613
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,627
That's a possibility,

614
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,837
and then again,
it could kill you.

615
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,340
We need to find out
what's going on.

616
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,758
( scoffs )

617
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,510
You're lying...

618
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,345
Just like him...

619
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,305
Just like everyone
around here,

620
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,223
always lying,

621
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,267
always telling me that I'm
doing a good job,

622
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,977
that you're glad
I'm on the ship,

623
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,521
but none of that's true.

624
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,733
Why can't you
just say it?

625
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,860
You're jealous that I broke
the transwarp barrier

626
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,320
and now you're hoping
I'll die!

627
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,156
You're right, doctor.

628
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,868
I don't think there's
anything I can do here.

629
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,328
Wait, Captain.

630
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,788
I'm sorry.

631
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,042
Please come back.

632
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,422
I know you're doing
what you can. It's just...

633
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,218
I'm scared.

634
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,345
I didn't mean
to lash out at you.

635
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,681
What you're going through
would scare any of us,

636
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,558
but you have to hang on,
Tom.

637
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,018
We're doing everything we can
to help you.

638
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,397
I know you are.

639
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,901
And I know you'll fail!

You know...

643
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:56,415
I used to look up to you,

644
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,125
but now you seem so small,

645
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,712
so insignificant.

646
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,797
You don't even know what--

647
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,965
What-- What--

648
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,803

Doctor?

654
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,121
The rate
of genetic mutation

655
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,415
has accelerated
by 12 percent.

656
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,919
I want you to run
a nucleogenic scan

657
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,713
to determine how much of his
original DNA is left intact.

658
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,800
In the meantime, I'm going to
see about treating him with--

Doctor!

What is it now,
Mr. Paris?

662
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,514
( lisping ):
I need to talk.

663
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,141
So I've noticed.
Is it urgent?

664
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,684
I'm rather busy
right now.

665
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,937
Urgent.

666
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,481
Yes, urgent.

667
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,115
Let...

668
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,951
me out of here.

669
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,578
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

670
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,164
Please.

671
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,207
I can't stay here.

672
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,460
I have to get off this ship.

00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,883
I...

676
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,302
understand.

677
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,806
It's all so clear now.

678
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,390
What do
you understand?

679
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,977
The present...

Listen to me!

I'm everything.

687
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,497
Let me go.

688
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,207
Go where,
Tom?

689
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,334
I can't...

Please!

693
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,557
Something tells me
we'd better hurry.

694
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,394
<i>I believe the answer lies</i>
<i>in forcing his DNA</i>

695
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,937
<i>to revert to</i>
<i>its original coding.</i>

696
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,356
<i>Once that occurs,</i>
<i>his body should return</i>

697
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,316
<i>to its former state.</i>
How do we do that?

698
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,528
<i>We destroy all of the new DNA</i>
<i>in his body.</i>

699
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,364
<i>His cells will have to use the</i>
<i>original coding as a blueprint.</i>

700
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,533
<i>But the only way</i>
<i>to destroy the mutant DNA</i>

701
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,952
<i>is with highly focused</i>
<i>antiproton radiation.</i>

702
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,496
antiprotons?
The only place on this ship

703
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,707
which generates antiprotons
is the warp core.

704
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,084
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>I'd like to place Mr. Paris</i>

705
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,336
<i>in an isotropic restraint</i>
<i>and then infuse it</i>

706
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,506
<i>with controlled antiproton</i>
<i>bursts. A tricky venture,</i>

707
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,258
<i>but I see</i>
<i>no other alternative.</i>

708
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,761
We'll have to take
the warp core off-line.

709
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,096
Then I'll need about three hours
to set up an interface.

<i>there won't be</i>

prepare a five second burst.

732

It came from somewhere

765
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,379
Tuvok doesn't have

805

I've re-examined the data
on Mr. Paris' transformation

806
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,457
and I think I understand
what's happening to him.

807
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,003
The mutations
we observed are natural.

808
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,254
Natural.

809
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,964
The changes in his DNA
are consistent

810
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,382
with the evolutionary
development

811
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,758
of the
human genotype

812
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,802
observed over
the past 4 million years.

813
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,931
Increased brain capacity,
the loss of vestigial organs...

814
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,683
Are you saying
Lieutenant Paris

815
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,310
is evolving?

816
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,895
That's
my theory.

817
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,437
The only difference
between natural

818
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,398
evolution and what happened
to Mr. Paris

819
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,401
is that his changes took place
over a 24-hour period.

820
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,778
Somehow, traveling
at infinite velocity

821
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,947
accelerated the natural
human evolutionary process

822
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,241
by millions of years.

823
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,910
It's possible that
Mr. Paris represents

824
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,412
a future stage
in human development.

825
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,455
Although I can't say
it's very attractive.

826
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,166
What do we do about it?

827
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,210
I think my antiproton
approach was correct.

828
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,961
However, I'll need
to intensify the treatment

You've broken more
than one record.

891
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,893
That's for sure.
( chuckles )

892
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,062
Breaking the threshold.

893
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,608
It was...

894
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,610
incredible.

895
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,862
But somehow, it doesn't mean
as much as I thought it would.

896
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,323
Oh?

897
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,907
I guess I went
into this

898
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,034
looking for a quick fix.

899
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,496
I thought making history
would change things,

900
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,789
not just
my service record...

901
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,625
My reputation.

902
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,751
If I'm not mistaken,

903
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,962
you've changed quite a few
minds on this ship.

904
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,047
You've earned a lot
of people's respect

905
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,382
and admiration.

906
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,510
Yeah.

907
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,136
But I'm starting
to realize

908
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,514
that it's not
other people's opinions

909
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,140
I should be worried about.

910
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,518
It's mine.

911
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,894
Heh, it seems,
Captain,

912
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,439
that I still have
a few barriers to break.

913
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:55,276
I just hope they're not
theoretical impossibilities.

914
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,611
Somehow...

915
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,906
I don't think they will be.

916
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,326
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

917
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,751
(<i> triumphant theme playing</i> )
