1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,095
You're late.
There was a problem

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,848
with the pulse drills
on level four.

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,432
They're going to be
here any moment.

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,142
I want to make
a good impression.

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,102
You're certain
we should be doing this?

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,105
Orek will be pleased that
we took the initiative.

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,107
I hope you're right.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,198
Welcome to Telsius.

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,783
Thank you.

10
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,743
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

11
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,662
This is Commander Tuvok.

12
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,623
We're from the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

13
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,234
"JANEWAY":
We have several mines
like this on Earth.

14
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,112
MINER:
I'm not familiar
with Earth.

15
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,573
That's because it's 30,000
light years from here.

16
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:40,702
30,342.4,
to be exact.

17
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,122
You're a long
way from home.

18
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,082
It's difficult sometimes.

19
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,292
Then I close my eyes
and think

20
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,878
of the farm in Indiana
where I grew up.

21
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,172
For a moment,
I'm home again.

22
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,758
Should we get down
to business?

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,719
Yes. We've had
a shortage of dilithium

24
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,429
for the last two months.

25
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,932
If we can't
replenish our supply,

26
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,643
we may be forced
to suspend work.

27
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,522
Our chief of mining
operations has gone
to the Grenna system...

28
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,357
But, um,
we are authorized

29
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,609
to conduct trades
in his absence.

30
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,278
What are you
prepared to trade?

31
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,448
I'm afraid
the only commodity

32
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,910
we have is,
uh, bolomite.

33
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,875
We really don't have
much use for that.

34
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,127
On the contrary,
Captain.

35
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,505
Bolomite is used in
omega radiation therapy.

36
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,008
The orphans on...
Orphans?

37
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,052
The settlers
on the Narva Colony

38
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,680
were exposed to toxic
levels of omega radiation.

39
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:46,226
The entire adult
population was killed.

40
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,687
We're doing all we can
for the children.

41
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,107
All right.

42
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,275
20 kilotons of dilithium

43
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,319
for an equivalent amount
of bolomite.

44
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,781
We only have ten kilotons left.

45
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,700
Then ten it is.

46
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,618
Captain,
I must point out

47
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,164
that dilithium is worth
nearly twice as much
as bolomite.

48
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,083
Tuvok, these people
need our help.

49
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,252
I'm not going to quibble
over a few tons of ore.

50
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,838
Perhaps we should celebrate.

51
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,092
I wish we could, but there's
a neutronic storm
approaching our ship.

52
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,552
We should be
leaving orbit.

53
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,722
Give us an hour to
finalize the arrangements.

54
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,432
We'll be waiting
to hear from you.

55
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,726
Before we leave,
would it be possible

56
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,519
to tour your facility?

57
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,521
It's our duty
as Starfleet officers to...

58
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,482
Unfortunately,
the storm won't wait.

59
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,359
Maybe on our next visit.

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,032
Live long and prosper.

61
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,001
This hair
is so uncomfortable.

62
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,462
I find it
aesthetically pleasing.

63
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,090
The negotiations?
It would've been perfect

64
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,050
if "Tuvok" hadn't decided
to improvise.

65
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:03,595
I was portraying my character
as truthfully as possible.

66
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,847
Once we finish a
transaction, we leave.

67
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,059
Is that clear?
Indeed.

68
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:16,108
Incoming transmission
for Captain Janeway.

69
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,408
Ready.

70
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,831
This is Captain Janeway.

71
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,041
<i>The bolomite is</i>
<i>ready for transport.</i>

72
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,044
<i>We thank you for</i>
<i>your generosity.</i>

73
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,173
Directive 927
of the Starfleet
General Order:

74
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,008
"Always help
those in need."

75
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,136
Transport complete.

76
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,221
We've enjoyed
meeting you, gentlemen.

77
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:51,392
<i>Uh, Captain, uh, we haven't</i>
<i>received the dilithium yet.</i>

78
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,689
Oh, the neutronic storm
seems to be interfering
with our transporters.

79
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,027
If we don't
leave orbit immediately,
we will sustain heavy damage.

80
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,196
<i>What about</i>
<i>our dilithium?</i>

81
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,281
We'll be back
to deliver it as soon
as the storm clears.

82
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,908
<i>Well, how long</i>
<i>will that be?</i>
Captain Janeway out.

83
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,495
Let's go.

84
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,331
<i>( laughing )</i>

85
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,222
Computer, activate
the sonic shower.

86
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>( humming )</i>

87
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,932
<i>( humming gets louder )</i>

88
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,309
Oh...

89
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,311
adjust the frequency.

90
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,980
<i>( loud humming continues )</i>

91
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,234
Whew! Computer, deactivate
the sonic shower!

92
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,332
Report.

93
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,834
We've got systems failures
on eight decks, Captain.

94
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,460
That explains why
my sonic shower

95
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,462
was a little
louder than usual.

96
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,006
Make that nine decks.

97
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,758
I've run every
diagnostic I know,

98
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,509
and I can't seem to
isolate the problem.

99
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,678
Gremlins.
Excuse me?

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,181
In the early days
of aviation, engineers blamed

101
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,934
imaginary little creatures
called gremlins

102
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,395
for malfunctions
they could not explain.

103
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,063
<i>( beeping )</i>

104
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,023
Well, one of
your gremlins

105
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,401
just paid a visit to
the replicator system.

106
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,702
Tuvok, we saved you a seat.

107
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,331
What's wrong?

108
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,251
Someone has altered
one of my holodeck programs...

109
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,710
again.

110
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,462
Are you sure it isn't

111
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,547
just one of these
malfunctions?

112
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,925
Everything on the
ship's been affected,
including the holodecks.

113
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:51,346
The Oracle of K'Tal
isn't programmed
to wear pajamas.

114
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,557
Well, maybe he overslept.

115
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,436
I am not amused by your
practical jokes, Mr. Paris.

116
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,604
Why do you
always think it's me?

117
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,356
Mr. Kim?

118
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,360
I'd like to
claim credit,
but I'm innocent.

119
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,488
The next time
I visit the holodeck,

120
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,198
I expect to find
my program restored

121
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,866
to its original parameters.

122
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm telling you, Tuvok,
we didn't do it.

123
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,165
I wonder how the oracle
would look in a sombrero.

124
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,958
<i>( laughing )</i>

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,918
Everybody,
stop eating.

126
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,920
Captain, what's wrong?

127
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,256
If I could have everyone's
attention for a moment.

128
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,591
We found a contaminant
in the replicator system.

129
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,011
It's nothing serious,
but if any of you

130
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,888
start to feel a little queasy,
report to Sick Bay immediately.

131
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,933
In the meantime,
the galley is closed.

132
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,395
I wish I hadn't
had seconds.

133
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,984
Here.

134
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,619
Well, that explains it.

135
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,955
Don't tell me
a simple heating
coil in the stove

136
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,125
is responsible for
everything that's gone
wrong this morning.

137
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,627
Any component connected
to the integrated circuitry

138
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,587
can spread
a contaminant.

139
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,423
This isn't
Starfleet issue.

140
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,467
Where did it come from?

141
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,552
I obtained it
during a trade.

142
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,014
With whom?
Sister Dala.

143
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,391
"Sister"?

144
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,143
One of the clerics
on Selnia Prime.

145
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,437
Tom and I met her during
our away mission.

146
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,065
She was the one
trying to help all
those poor orphans.

147
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,025
It's all in our report.

148
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,444
Did you run a diagnostic
before you installed it?

149
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,196
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Captain to the Bridge.</i>

150
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,365
I'm a little busy now.
Can it wait?

151
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,200
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

152
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,285
I'll be right back.

153
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,624
<i>One excuse after another.</i>

154
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,421
<i>You're stalling,</i>
<i>and I don't have time for it.</i>

155
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,382
Captain, this is Mr. Orek.

156
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,634
He's chief of
mining operations
on Telsius Prime.

157
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,220
A problem, Mr. Orek?

158
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,472
<i>Not if you deliver</i>
<i>our dilithium.</i>

159
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,806
Dilithium?

160
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,893
<i>It's all clearly documented.</i>

161
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,937
<i>Ten kilotons of bolomite ore</i>

162
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,524
<i>in exchange</i>
<i>for ten kilotons of dilithium.</i>

163
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,695
I think there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

164
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:18,743
<i>One way or another, I intend</i>
<i>to collect what you owe me.</i>

165
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,042
<i>We've enjoyed meeting you,</i>
<i>gentlemen.</i>

166
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,254
MINER 1:
<i>Captain, we haven't</i>
<i>received the dilithium yet.</i>

167
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,882
<i>Oh, the neutronic storm</i>
<i>seems to be interfering</i>
<i>with our transporters.</i>

168
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,553
<i>If we don't leave orbit</i>
<i>immediately, we will</i>
<i>sustain heavy damage.</i>

169
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,679
MINER 2:
<i>What about our dilithium?</i>

170
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,975
<i>We'll be back to deliver it</i>
<i>as soon as the storm clears.</i>

171
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,729
<i>( sighs ):</i>
Do you still deny you
made the trade?

172
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,107
That woman isn't me.
Who is she, then?

173
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,942
Well, she's obviously
an impostor.

174
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,488
I have transmission logs,
transport records,

175
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,364
scans of your shuttle craft.

176
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,408
I have never been to
your planet, Mr. Orek,

177
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,785
aboard<i> Voyager</i>
or any other vessel.

178
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,038
Our ship's logs will confirm
what the Captain's
been telling you.

179
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,374
How do I know
they're authentic records?

180
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,127
How do we know
<i>your</i> records
are authentic?

181
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,047
You think I falsified data?
Why would I do that?

182
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,592
Perhaps to extort
dilithium from us.

183
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,552
I'm not the thief here.

184
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,180
We are not questioning
your integrity, Mr. Orek.

185
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,889
It does appear
you've been cheated,

186
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,683
but not by me
or anyone on my crew.

187
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,312
How naive do you think I am?

188
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,606
First, you prey upon
the sympathy of my miners

189
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,900
by telling them stories
about poor, orphaned children.

190
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:37,489
Now you try to convince me
you're the victims here.

191
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,616
Did you say
"orphaned children"?

192
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,160
A despicable tactic.

193
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,496
Will you excuse me
for a minute, please?

194
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,167
We are not finished!

195
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,630
Neelix.

196
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,508
Captain, we're
making real progress.

197
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,219
Never mind that.
Tell me more
about this cleric

198
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,720
who gave you
the heating coil.

199
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,350
Sister Dala?
What do you want to know?

200
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,310
Everything.

201
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,564
Well, Tom and I met her
during our away mission.

202
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,191
We were on a small planetoid
in the Wyanti system

203
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,026
searching for a spore
the doctor wanted

204
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,028
to grow anti-viral
proteins with.

205
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,490
I tell you, Neelix,
when I first joined Starfleet,

206
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:24,327
I knew it was going
to be one glamorous
adventure after another.

207
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,329
But I never dreamed that
I'd have the opportunity

208
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,499
to go on
a mold-hunting expedition.

209
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,044
I'm detecting
traces of glamour
in this direction.

210
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,922
Please, go no further.

211
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,924
This is our sanctuary.

212
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,677
Our scans didn't detect
anyone down here.

213
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,179
Our sect is
a solitary one.

214
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,014
We dampen
our life signs

215
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,934
to protect
the privacy of
our meditations.

216
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,270
We're terribly sorry
if we've disturbed you.

217
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,230
Begin the cleansing.

218
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,737
<i>Olat mal pri,</i>
<i>mal pra, mal prolat.</i>

219
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:03,116
<i>Olate kal mi,</i>
<i>kal ma, kal molat.</i>

220
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:07,412
I hope we haven't
committed a serious
transgression.

221
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,997
The transgression was ours.

222
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,668
We should have
guarded the sanctuary
more carefully.

223
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,463
The deities will be angry.

224
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,632
Come on, Neelix.
We better get
out of the way.

225
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,425
Of... Of course.

226
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,135
Our sincere apologies.

227
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,262
If there's anything
that we can do...

228
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:29,643
Forgive me, but
you look familiar.

229
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,604
I don't think that
we've ever met before.

230
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,483
Do you see it?

231
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,151
Yes.

232
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,155
You bear
a striking resemblance

233
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,824
to our Redeemer of Light.

234
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,536
I'm flattered.

235
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,705
Each spring, we make
a pilgrimage to Narva

236
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,458
in his honor
to help the orphans.

237
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,086
Well, that's a very
worthy cause.

238
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,505
It is.

239
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,218
Unfortunately, we have no food
to bring them this year.

240
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,844
Why not?

241
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,889
A blight infected
our hydroponic pods.

242
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,184
The crop
was destroyed.

243
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,312
Maybe we could replicate
some food for you.

244
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,564
We bestow
charity on others.

245
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:20,694
The deities forbid us
from accepting
it ourselves.

246
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,655
How about a trade?
Yeah. Good idea.

247
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,824
You must have something
that we can use.

248
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,242
That way, you wouldn't
be accepting charity

249
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,162
and the deities
would have nothing
to get angry about.

250
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,505
Your heart is as kind
as your face.

251
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:44,634
May the deities
bless you.

252
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,554
JANEWAY:
That's when they gave
you the heating coil?

253
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,473
It was going to take a while
to replicate the supplies
they needed,

254
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,642
so we invited them
back to the<i> Flyer.</i>

255
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,019
That's when they
must have gotten
access to our systems.

256
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,730
Captain?

257
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,357
Did you leave
either of them
alone at any point?

258
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,942
I don't think so.
After we ate,

259
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,863
Tom took Brother Mobar
to see the cockpit,

260
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,742
but I stayed
in the aft section
with Sister Dala, talking.

261
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,912
About what?
Well, me, mostly.

262
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,207
<i>She wanted to know all</i>
<i>about my role on</i> Voyager.

263
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,794
Ambassador,
Morale Officer, Head Chef.

264
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,589
It sounds as though
you're invaluable.

265
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,298
I do what I can.

266
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,509
Where is
your<i> Voyager</i> now?

267
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,679
About three
light-years from here.

268
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,473
Your crew is alone
in this region?

269
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,350
We are the only
Federation starship

270
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,477
within 30,000
light-years.

271
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,312
That must be difficult.

272
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,274
Sometimes it is,
but we manage.

273
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,943
We've single-handedly
taken on the Borg,

274
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,113
the Hirogen, Species 8472...

275
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,823
I'm impressed.

276
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,242
Captain Janeway deserves
most of the credit.

277
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,369
She's an extraordinary woman.

278
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,455
Your captain is a woman?

279
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,665
The finest one I've ever known.

280
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,333
Tell me about her.

281
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,211
Well, uh...
she's commanded<i> Voyager</i>

282
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,963
for almost six years now.

283
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,799
Before that, she was
a science officer

284
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,425
on the<i> Al-Batani.</i>

285
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,594
Where does she come from?
Earth.

286
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,679
It's in the
Alpha Quadrant.

287
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,308
She grew up on
a little farm in
a place called Indiana.

288
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,601
You'd like her.

289
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,269
I'm sure I would.

290
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,899
Sister Dala...
Yes, Brother Mobar.

291
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,486
It's late. We must return
to the sanctuary.

292
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,822
So soon?

293
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,574
It's time for
the evening meditation.

294
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,953
We can't thank you enough
for all you've done.

295
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,538
We're just glad
that we could help.

296
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,166
The blessing.

297
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,794
Certainly.

298
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,012
May the deities
bless these travelers.

299
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,765
<i>Tala ot val.</i>

300
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,017
<i>Tala ot relina.</i>

301
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,102
<i>Sen tala.</i>

302
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,104
<i>Sen relina.</i>

303
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,106
<i>Val golina.</i>

304
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,984
<i>Su ketran.</i>

305
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,195
<i>Tala otval.</i>
<i>Tala ot relina.</i>

306
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,280
Then we transported them
back to their sanctuary.

307
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,574
How long did this
blessing last?

308
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,076
No more than
a minute or two.

309
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,872
That's probably
all they needed.

310
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,790
For what?

311
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,881
Just what I thought.

312
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:32,635
The entire database
was downloaded
18 days ago.

313
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,722
Brother Mobar.
The talisman.

314
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,057
It was obviously
some sort of scanner.

315
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,852
What would a couple
of religious clerics
want with our database?

316
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:45,815
It might help if they wanted
to pose as federation officers.

317
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:50,611
Gentlemen,
I believe you've been had.

318
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,207
The way I see it,
we're both victims.

319
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,418
Your bolomite
was stolen,

320
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,254
and our reputation
has been damaged.

321
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,506
What are you proposing?

322
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,383
You said you had
scans of the vessel

323
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,260
that visited
your mining colony.

324
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,387
If you allow us
to analyze them,

325
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,016
we might be able to
derive the impostors'
warp signature.

326
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,726
We could find them
and recover your property

327
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,352
before they cheat
someone else.

328
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,564
This is all difficult
for me to believe.

329
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:30,526
Two of your crewmen
deceived by clerics?

330
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,196
Hmm! Could they really
have been so naive?

331
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,074
A legitimate question.

332
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,618
It's obvious we're dealing
with clever adversaries--

333
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,537
they fooled both of us.
But I'm confident
we can stop them.

334
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,331
Perhaps I should
contact Telsian Security.

335
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,087
They have persuasive methods
for determining the truth.

336
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,006
In the meantime,
the real thieves

337
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,550
could be halfway
across the sector

338
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,845
with your bolomite
in their cargo hold.

339
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,034
And finally,
our bridge.

340
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,453
Is this a typical
Federation vessel?

341
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,705
Well, the<i> Delta Flyer</i>
may<i> look</i> a little worn,

342
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,833
but that's only because
she's been through
so much.

343
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,709
This ship
has helped fend off

344
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,379
the Borg, the Hirogen,
Species 8472.

345
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,424
Most of your technology
is outdated.

346
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,385
Show him the mothership,
Mr. Chakotay.

347
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,931
The USS<i> Voyager...</i>
Intrepid Class.

348
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:46,393
15 decks of the most
advanced technology
you'll find anywhere.

349
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,688
Dilithium-powered
warp engines,

350
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,525
integrated
bio-neural circuitry,
holodecks...

351
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,569
Is<i> this</i> a typical
Federation vessel?

352
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,322
Every ship in the fleet is built
to exacting standards.

353
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,702
But I'd be lying if I told you
I didn't think<i> Voyager</i>
was exceptional.

354
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,913
As her captain,
I'm not entirely objective.

355
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,834
I'm sure you feel the same way
about your ship.

356
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,837
It is my home.

357
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,589
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Mr. Varn...

358
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,468
because that's exactly
what the Federation is--

359
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:25,975
A home for an extended family
who share resources

360
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:30,270
and come to one another's aid
in time of need.

361
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,857
So, if my ship joins
your Federation,

362
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,693
<i>Voyager</i> will help
me fight my enemies?

363
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:40,781
The primary goal of the
Federation is exploration.
Military objectives...

364
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,994
There's no need
to bore our guest with
Starfleet protocol, Tuvok.

365
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,164
My enemies have
sophisticated
weaponry.

366
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,540
As do we.

367
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,543
Photon torpedoes...

368
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,714
optronically
targeted phasers...

369
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,758
multi-spectrum shielding.

370
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,428
All of which
we would not hesitate to share

371
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,972
with a fellow member
of the Federation.

372
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,433
What will I have
to do to join?

373
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,393
In order to be considered,

374
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,521
a candidate must make
formal application.

375
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,441
An extensive review is conducted
by a committee composed of...

376
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,735
The process is complicated,

377
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,196
but Captain Janeway
has influence

378
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,031
with the Federation council.

379
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:25,284
And you would use that
influence on my behalf?

380
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,329
I'd be foolish not to.

381
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,709
You are just the type of
candidate we're looking for.

382
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,297
I'll have to discuss
this with my shipmates.

383
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,134
Joining the Federation
is a serious commitment.

384
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,052
Take all the time you need.

385
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,638
Captain, our latest orders
from Starfleet Command:

386
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,266
we won't be back here
for at least six months.

387
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,186
Well, perhaps we can discuss
your application then.

388
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,688
If we were
to apply now,

389
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,108
could you assure us
we'd be accepted?

390
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,949
You realize you'll have to
commit considerable resources.

391
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,827
I'll do whatever is necessary.

392
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:13,249
Well, let me be
the first to say...

393
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,002
welcome
to the Federation.

394
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,849
You look like you could
use a cup of coffee.

395
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,185
I've been
flying concentric
search patterns

396
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,770
for the last 12 hours.

397
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,106
Any sign
of the impostors?

398
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,652
Neelix, what has happened to us?

399
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,779
I know exactly what you mean.

400
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,739
I've been over it
a thousand times.

401
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,534
Why didn't we see this coming?
Orphans!

402
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,536
It's the oldest gambit
in the book.

403
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,371
I mean, if it'd been Harry,
I could understand it.

404
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,415
He trusts everybody,
but you and me?

405
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,127
We've dealt with our share
of shady characters.

406
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:02,882
I think maybe...
maybe we've lost our edge.

407
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,387
Hand me one of those
<i>terra</i> nuts.

408
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,848
What are you doing?

409
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,599
Proving you wrong.

410
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,061
Ah, the old shell game.

411
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,688
All we need
now is a mark.

412
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,857
I think I see one coming.

413
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,569
You go ahead.
I'll follow your lead.

414
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,488
Now watch carefully.

415
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,075
I place the<i> terra</i> nut
under the cup.

416
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,077
Then I shuffle them.

417
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,662
Round and round they go.

418
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,706
Keep your eye
on the nut.

419
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,252
But be careful, the hand
is faster than the eye.

420
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,504
Now, for three hours
of holodeck time,

421
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,506
can you tell me
where is the<i> terra</i> nut?

422
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,966
Uh...

423
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,510
There.

424
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,305
No, no.
No, that one.

425
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,725
Oh... I really thought
I had you this time.

426
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,186
Oh, keep trying,
Neelix.

427
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,272
You'll fool me
one of these days.

428
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,399
This looks like
an interesting game.
May I have a turn?

429
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:05,611
Oh, be my guest.
But, uh, you'll have
to wager something.

430
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,865
If I win, you take three
duty shifts in Sick Bay.

431
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,244
And if I win, you take
three shifts in the kitchen.

432
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,412
Done.

433
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,662
Ready?

434
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,125
Now, watch carefully.

435
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,628
Round and round they go.

436
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,546
Follow the<i> terra</i> nut
if you can.

437
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,341
But be careful--
the hand is faster
than the eye.

438
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,302
Careful, Doc,
try not to blink.

439
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,928
Don't you worry, Mr. Paris.

440
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,638
You have to get up
pretty early in the morning

441
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,848
to fool my optical
subroutines.

442
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,066
Where is it, then?

443
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,986
In your left palm.

444
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,869
How did you...?
Superior visual acuity.

445
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,913
See you in Sick Bay.

446
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,005
I'm detecting a vessel
on long-range scans.

447
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,841
The warp signature matches
the impostor's ship.

448
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,968
Harry, tell Tom
his coffee break is over.

449
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,346
Set a pursuit course.
Yes, ma'am.

450
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,685
The photon torpedoes
you gave me are worthless.

451
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,812
No better than plasma flares.

452
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,148
Perhaps you
didn't arm them properly.

453
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,899
And in the middle
of the battle,

454
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,152
the Polonians warned me
to cease hostilities

455
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:32,072
or face destruction at the hands
of your Federation.

456
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,450
You allowed my enemies
to join.

457
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,369
Evidently, the Federation
Council decided that...

458
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,498
Your Federation is a fraud!
I demand reparations.

459
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,376
You'll have to submit
a formal report
to Starfleet.

460
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:48,214
Enough! If you
will not reimburse me,
I'll seize your ship.

461
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,470
Disable the beam!

462
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:00,142
I can't.
We have an
additional problem.

463
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,894
<i>Voyager.</i>

464
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,731
There's another ship
alongside the impostors.

465
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,565
It's got them
in a tractor beam.

466
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,443
Hail both vessels.

467
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,779
No response from either one.

468
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,532
Well, let's try to
get their attention.

469
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,116
Mr. Tuvok...

470
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,827
<i>Voyager's</i> charging weapons.

471
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,163
Perhaps we should
surrender to them.

472
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,457
The Federation has an
extremely humane policy

473
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,583
regarding the treatment
of prisoners.

474
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,213
Hail Varn again!

475
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,298
Do it!

476
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,009
Look on your
scanners, Varn.

477
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,553
Our mothership's
arrived.

478
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,304
She's armed and
ready to defend us.

479
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,266
Tell them to stand down.

480
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:46,397
Release us or<i> Voyager</i>
will destroy you.

481
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,274
The other ship is hailing.

482
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,775
On screen.

483
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,862
Stand down,<i> Voyager.</i>

484
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,489
I have no argument with you.

485
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,491
However, the vessel
you're tractoring...

486
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,659
I paid for my
Federation membership.

487
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,996
The<i> Delta Flyer</i>
belongs to me now.

488
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,040
Sir, I think
you've been misled.

489
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,209
Yes, I have.

490
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,511
Three direct hits.
Shields down to 60%.

491
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,388
Target his tractor beam.
Nobody is taking possession

492
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,308
of the<i> Delta Flyer</i>
today except us.

493
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,523
Lock onto them.
CHAKOTAY:
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,402
Now our tractor generator's
off-line.

495
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,821
Shields down to 41%.

496
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,033
The impostor's ship
is powering engines.

497
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,660
Seven, transport everyone
on that vessel directly
to the brig.

498
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,705
Establishing a lock
on three life signs.

499
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,792
That impact damaged
the transporters.

500
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,169
I'm losing annular confinement.

501
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,463
Harry, reroute
additional power!

502
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,302
They're gone.
JANEWAY:
Seven?

503
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,346
I only got one of them.

504
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,889
Get us out of here,
Mr. Paris.

505
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,517
Aye, Captain.

506
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,956
Nice hair.

507
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:31,084
It's not really my taste.

508
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,297
Posing as a Starfleet captain,

509
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,008
selling memberships
to the Federation...

510
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,177
Too bad we didn't
think of it, Tuvok.

511
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,597
Imagine the resources
we could have acquired
over the past six years.

512
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,476
Indeed.
I have to admit
I'm impressed.

513
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,520
I wish I could say the same.

514
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,105
The great Captain Janeway.

515
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:57,027
Somehow, I expected you
to be... taller.

516
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,029
I make a better you than you.

517
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,156
Oh, I don't know.

518
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,659
I'd say we're
very much alike--

519
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:08,205
resourceful, intelligent,
ambitious--

520
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,166
but with just one
tiny difference.

521
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,876
And what is that?

522
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,961
I'm not a liar and a thief.

523
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,963
You're going
to give me

524
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,299
a detailed account
of everyone you cheated

525
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,843
and exactly what you did
with their property.

526
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,388
Why would I do that?

527
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,931
Because if you don't,

528
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,642
I'm turning you over
to Telsian security.

529
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,103
Oh, is that supposed
to frighten me?

530
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,272
How much do you know
about the Telsians?

531
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:37,234
Just that they're a more
gullible species than most.

532
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,405
Tell her about your
research, Mr. Tuvok.

533
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,366
I beg your pardon,
Captain?

534
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,910
On Telsian law.
I think it's only fair

535
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:51,290
that we let our guest
know what to expect.

536
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:57,463
The Telsian criminal
justice system
is rather barbaric.

537
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,215
Tell her about
the prisons.

538
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,759
Barely habitable.

539
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,637
Inmates often die
of malnutrition

540
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,930
before they are
brought to trial.

541
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,767
Torture is commonplace,
as is disease,

542
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,103
including several
incurable forms
of psoriasis.

543
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,355
I think she gets
the general idea.

544
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,234
Suppose I do tell you.

545
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:22,821
How do I know you won't turn me
over to the Telsians anyway?

546
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:27,159
If you make full restitution
to your victims,

547
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,745
I'll give you safe passage
out of this area.

548
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:33,039
Is that a promise, Captain?

549
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,834
I know it's hard
for you to believe,

550
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,379
but occasionally,
some of us tell the truth.

551
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,550
Give me the<i> Delta Flyer</i>
and three days

552
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,303
to get as far away
from here as I can,

553
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,181
and then I'll send you
the information you want.

554
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,350
How naive do you think I am?

555
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:55,228
As far as the victims
are concerned,

556
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,648
you're the one
who cheated them.

557
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:03,111
Without my help, you'll be
the one who has a problem
leaving this sector.

558
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:09,660
Tuvok, contact
Telsian security.

559
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,044
Tell them we have
a prisoner to turn over.

560
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,095
Psoriasis?

561
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,598
Improvisation is not
foremost among my talents.

562
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,517
Considering I caught you
off guard,

563
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,519
I thought your performance
was exemplary.

564
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,605
Thank you, Captain.
Was your order
to call the Telsians

565
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,440
part of the deception,

566
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,108
or did you actually
want me to contact them?

567
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,236
Not yet. Let's give Dala
some time to think

568
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,279
about those
barbaric prisons.

569
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,532
Do you believe
she'll relent?
I'm not sure.

570
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,410
Something tells me
she's just as stubborn
as I am.

571
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,662
Then, am I
to assume you have
an alternative plan?

572
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:57,165
I'm like you, Tuvok--
making it up as I go along.

573
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:16,685
The Captain said
bread and water,
but I didn't see any harm.

574
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,353
I'm not hungry.

575
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,318
I'll just leave it here...

576
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,322
in case you change your mind.

577
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,954
May I ask you something?

578
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,623
You want to know

579
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,917
if you really resemble
the Redeemer of Light?

580
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,877
I'm not that gullible.

581
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,754
Then what?

582
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,258
Do you ever feel guilty...

583
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,177
taking advantage of people

584
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,305
who actually think that
you care about them?

585
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:59,060
You seem like a good person.
I'm sorry I lied to you.

586
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:03,523
Actually, I think you're
just sorry you got caught.

587
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,860
Probably.

588
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,779
There.
Now you're being honest.

589
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,530
I knew it was possible.

590
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,914
If you don't mind my asking,
why do you do what you do?

591
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:23,209
My father taught me most people
will exploit you if they can.

592
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,755
So, it's best
to exploit them first.

593
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:32,010
You know, I used
to be a lot like you.

594
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:36,014
Living by my wits.
Never trusting anyone.

595
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,350
Always trying to end up

596
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,478
on the more profitable side
of a transaction.

597
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,482
But now you don't hesitate
to help starving orphans.

598
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,567
I changed--

599
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,487
when Captain Janeway
made me part of the crew.

600
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,699
I suppose you
suddenly reformed.

601
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,994
No, no.
Not right away.

602
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,079
At first, I was just
exploiting an opportunity

603
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,208
to get a warm bed,
food, protection.

604
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:07,921
I kept waiting to
find out what the Captain
wanted in return.

605
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,298
But she never asked
for a thing.

606
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,758
On the contrary.

607
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,052
She expected
a great deal from me.

608
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,305
Honesty, loyalty,
hard work.

609
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,474
I should've guessed.

610
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:25,397
But I discovered that
those were commodities
I had in abundance,

611
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,067
and it was much more
profitable to share them

612
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:33,279
than it was to be self-serving
and cynical all the time.

613
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,866
I'm happier than
I've ever been.

614
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,329
I suppose that you think
I could change, too.

615
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,457
Stranger things
have happened.

616
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,045
Do you really think
that she'll give me
safe passage

617
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,171
if I make
restitution?

618
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,008
If that's what
she promised you.

619
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,134
Then what?

620
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,596
I have never done
anything else.

621
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,349
Captain Janeway
let Seven of Nine

622
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,603
remain on board,
and she was Borg.

623
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,689
Are you saying she'd do
the same thing for me?

624
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,316
I'd be willing to talk to her.

625
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,319
I cheated you.

626
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,739
Why are you being so kind to me?

627
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,826
Like my great-grandmother
used to say,

628
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,161
"It's nice to be nice."

629
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,167
Is that tea still warm?

630
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,847
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so clumsy.

631
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,354
Security to the brig.

632
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,430
She's gone.

633
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,859
It's not right
to abandon her.

634
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,986
Going back is
too dangerous.

635
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,237
She's our captain.
No, she's not.

636
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,991
And even if she were,
we wouldn't be able
to rescue her.

637
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,241
We'd be captured ourselves.

638
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,952
Without Captain Janeway,

639
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,996
it will be difficult to
continue our activities.

640
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,623
It's too late for that.
There must be
a logical way...

641
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:53,252
What's logical is to get
as far away as we can.

642
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,964
( <i> beeping</i>  )

643
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,091
There's a vessel
approaching.

644
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,093
It's the
<i>Delta Flyer.</i>

645
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,511
Activate the shields.

646
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,221
They're hailing.

647
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,474
It's Captain Janeway.

648
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,227
Our Janeway or theirs?

649
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,396
<i>Which one did you expect?</i>

650
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,149
I'm pleased
to see you, Captain.

651
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:17,402
Lower the shields
so I can transport aboard.

652
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,362
<i>How were you able to escape?</i>

653
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,114
I'll tell you once I'm aboard.

654
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,241
<i>It's difficult to believe</i>
<i>you weren't detected.</i>

655
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,869
Are you accusing me
of something?

656
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,295
ZAR:
<i>...being cautious.</i>

657
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,631
<i>How do we know</i>
<i>this isn't a deception?</i>

658
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,800
DALA:
<i>Why would I try</i>
<i>to deceive you?</i>

659
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,428
ZAR: <i> You could be helping</i>
Voyager<i> capture us...</i>

660
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,930
Are we in position?

661
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,765
DALA:
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

662
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,183
Ready?

663
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,817
Captain on
the Bridge.

664
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,112
As you were.

665
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,741
Now, what about
the bolomite

666
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,243
and the rest
of our earnings?

667
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,953
They're exactly
where we left them.

668
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,328
Well, it's time to collect them

669
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,997
and leave the region.

670
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,624
Set a course before
<i>Voyager</i> finds us.

671
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,584
You're not in command here.

672
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,712
I just spent
the last 24 hours in
<i>Voyager's</i> brig.

673
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,215
I have no intention
of going back.

674
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:23,843
I'm picking up life signs
on the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

675
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,428
That can't be.

676
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,517
I was right.
You brought them here.

677
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,687
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Whoever it is must've
stowed away.

678
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,355
They're hailing.

679
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,150
On screen.

680
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,359
<i>This is Tom Paris</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Voyager.

681
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,195
<i>Prepare to be boarded.</i>

682
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,614
He's charging weapons.

683
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,032
Evasive maneuvers.

684
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,339
Let's get everything
on board as quickly
as we can.

685
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,217
How many transport
enhancers do you
recommend, Captain?

686
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,885
Do I have to think
of everything?

687
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,595
We'll need
at least ten

688
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,139
if we're going to beam
all that bolomite

689
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,266
through
the geostrata.

690
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,143
Maybe we should take 12.

691
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,646
"We"?
Is there a problem?

692
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,191
In six years
I've never known you

693
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,693
to dirty your hands
with menial labor.

694
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,738
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

695
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,824
You don't trust us.

696
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,450
Who knows what
the two of you planned

697
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,036
while I was
in<i> Voyager's</i> brig?

698
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,704
As Chief of Security
I would never...

699
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,747
It's all right.

700
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,833
We'll all go together.

701
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,919
After you.

702
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,432
DALA:
The next populated sector
is 13 days from here.

703
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,978
When we arrive, we'll
trade the<i> Delta Flyer</i>  for a
new ship.

704
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,357
<i>Voyager</i> will
never find us.

705
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,608
Are all the transport
enhancers in place?

706
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,278
That's the last of them.
We can go now...

707
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,448
if that's acceptable
to you, Captain.

708
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,410
I'm afraid there's been
a change of plans.

709
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,373
I've found the stolen items,
Captain,

710
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,957
you can lock
onto my coordinates.

711
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,584
I told you
she couldn't be trusted.

712
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,211
How could you bring yourself

713
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,879
to deceive your fellow officers?

714
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,382
<i>Voyager,</i> I repeat,
I am in position.

715
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,302
Can you get a lock?
Negative. The geostratum
is too dense.

716
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,221
Keep trying.

717
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,805
Tuvok.

718
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,185
<i>Voyager,</i> now would be
an excellent time

719
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,519
to initiate transport.

720
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,064
You're not
transporting anything.

721
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,486
Captain?

722
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,289
<i>Voyager,</i> please respond.

723
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,251
You're a sight for sore eyes.

724
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,968
Commander... Tuvok?

725
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,886
The one and only.

726
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,183
Logic would indicate

727
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,769
that neither of us
has the advantage.

728
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,647
Your logic is flawed.

729
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,486
Stay where you are.

730
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,368
What did they promise you
for betraying us?

731
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,913
I believe you've
mistaken me
for someone else.

732
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,169
Where's Dala?

733
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,754
I'm afraid she's
indisposed at the moment.

734
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,508
<i>( groaning )</i>

735
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,552
I wouldn't get up
too fast if I
were you, Captain.

736
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,096
It's going to take
another few minutes

737
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,140
for the ambizine
to wear off.

738
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:04,356
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53849.2.</i>

739
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,942
<i>The stolen property</i>
<i>has been returned</i>
<i>to the Telsian miners,</i>

740
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,653
<i>as well as vessels from</i>
<i>seven different worlds.</i>

741
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,032
<i>I'm hoping</i>
<i>that the reputation</i>
<i>of the real Federation</i>

742
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,618
<i>will survive the events</i>
<i>of the last several days.</i>

743
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,871
Round and round they go.

744
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,165
Follow the<i> terra</i> nut
if you can. But remember,

745
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:26,002
the hand is sharper
than your visual acuity.

746
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,255
I thought we'd already
disproved that theory.

747
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,924
You tell me.

748
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,427
( <i> sighs</i>  )
The<i> terra</i> nut
is firmly entrenched

749
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,595
up your right sleeve.

750
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,850
Sorry.

751
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,232
That's impossible.

752
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,193
The old handoff.

753
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,112
Ooh.

754
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,655
That's cheating.

755
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,576
We've still got it.
