1
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:11,887
Where you headed?

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,639
The Bridge.

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,182
Mind if I walk with you?

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,809
Not at all.

5
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,186
So, how's it going?

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,646
Not bad, I guess.

7
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,606
Tuvok still giving you
a hard time?

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:23,983
No more than usual.

9
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:25,651
I don't know about you,

10
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,402
but when I think about
spending 70 years

11
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,364
on the same ship with that guy,
it gives me a headache.

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,950
I get the impression a lot
of the crew agrees with me--

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,452
Maquis and Starfleet.

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,290
Bridge.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,459
So what do you think?

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,919
About what?

17
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,963
About what
I've been saying,

18
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,673
that a lot of the crew
aren't too happy

19
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,591
with our Chief of Security,

20
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,969
and for that matter,
I don't think Captain Janeway

21
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,930
is winning any
popularity contests, either.

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,682
Don't you agree?

23
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,768
Why do I get the feeling
that you're testing me?

24
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,938
Let's just say I'm interested
in your opinion.

25
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,398
Why?

26
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,025
You're a good officer.

27
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,152
I like you,

28
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,655
and I wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

29
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,824
Computer,
halt turbolift.

30
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,117
Look, what's this all about?

31
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,704
There are going to be
some changes around here.

32
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,081
All of the Maquis are
in line, and about 25

33
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,124
of the Starfleet crew
are with us.

34
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,544
Are you saying there's
going to be a mutiny?

35
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,130
And when the
shooting starts...

36
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,051
I'm going to need to know
which side you're on.

37
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,504
( door opens )

38
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,091
Well, Commander...

39
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>Voyager's</i> all yours.

40
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,179
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

41
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,806
Don't worry, Captain, I'll keep
your ship safe and sound.

42
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,141
I'm sure you will.

43
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,893
PARIS:
<i>Shuttle Bay to Captain Janeway.</i>

44
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,477
Go ahead, Mr. Paris.

45
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,563
<i>The shuttle's ready to go,</i>
<i>whenever you are.</i>

46
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,898
On my way.

47
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,649
Captain,
I've been thinking.

48
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,151
Are you sure
you don't want to take

49
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,361
Lieutenant Tuvok with you,
just in case the Rukani

50
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,488
turn out to be less friendly
than they seem?

51
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,241
I assure you, Commander, I have
made thorough preparations

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,702
for the Captain's safety
during her away mission.

53
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,871
You, on the other hand,
are still adapting to

54
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,706
your duties as First Officer.

55
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,791
Under the circumstances,
I believe my time

56
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,293
will be better spent
assisting you in your effort

57
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,504
to justify the trust the Captain
has placed in you.

58
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,590
I appreciate your concern
for my safety,

59
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,299
Mr. Chakotay,
but Tuvok's right.

60
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,969
Lieutenant Paris and I
will be just fine.

61
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,931
I'll see you in 24 hours.

62
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,726
Lieutenant...

63
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,854
I want you to keep close tabs
on the Captain's shuttle.

64
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,065
Let's make sure she doesn't
run into any trouble.

65
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,649
Aye, sir.

66
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,736
Ensign, let's shut down
those transporters

67
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,114
and start that diagnostic
we've been putting off.

68
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,698
Sir, are you sure
we shouldn't wait

69
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,158
for the Captain to get back?

70
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,619
Ensign Kim, you have been given
a direct order.

71
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,329
Do as the Commander
tells you.

72
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,124
Aye, sir.

73
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,003
Have you finished upgrading
the internal sensors, Ensign?

74
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,005
I'm working on it, sir.

75
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,257
( door opens )

76
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,925
I hope so.

77
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,516
Wait here.
Is something wrong, sir?

78
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,436
No. It's just
tomorrow's duty roster.

79
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,446
Sir, Captain Janeway's shuttle
has gone to warp.

80
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,240
CHAKOTAY:
Thank you, Tuvok.

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,117
Chakotay to all hands.

82
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,451
Let's do it.

83
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,995
Sir?

84
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,292
KIM:
Red Alert!

85
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,086
Security to the Bridge!

86
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,921
You're wasting your time, Harry.

87
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,714
All my teams
have taken control

88
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,967
of Security, Engineering
and all key systems.

89
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,303
You'll never get away with this.
People will fight back.

90
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,345
That's going to be
a little difficult.

91
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,224
All your off-duty Starfleet
friends have been locked down,

92
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,518
in quarters.

93
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,936
( yelling )

94
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,022
( grunting )

95
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,323
I guess you've made
your choice.

96
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,365
<i>Jonas to Chakotay.</i> 
Go ahead.

97
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,076
<i>They're putting up a fight</i>
<i>on Deck 2.</i>

98
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,578
<i>We could use some help.</i> 
Carlson, O'Donnell,

99
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,913
get these people
to the brig.

100
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,414
Ayala, take the conn
and move us

101
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,334
out of com range
of Janeway's shuttle.

102
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,544
You're with me.

103
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,510
Deck 2.

104
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,638
Thanks for watching
my back in there.

105
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,183
Right.

106
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,476
Are you okay?

107
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,437
To tell you
the truth, uh...

108
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,565
shooting Harry...

109
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,108
got me a little rattled.

110
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,526
He's only stunned.

111
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,237
We're not going to
kill anybody today,

112
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,530
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

113
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,448
Just stay close.

114
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,916
Stay low.

115
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,417
They've got us
pinned down.

116
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,670
We'll just have to shoot
our way past them.

117
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,297
Ready?

118
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,014
Seska!

119
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,515
It's just like
old times, isn't it?

120
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,142
CHAKOTAY:
Thanks for the help.

121
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,228
We've got to get moving.
Some of Janeway's people

122
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,730
are trying to set up a command
center in the Mess Hall.

123
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,861
( crew shouting )

124
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,573
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

125
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,117
This phaser's set
on wide beam.

126
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,952
I could take you all
in one shot.

127
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,995
Everybody drop
your weapons.

128
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,538
( weapons clattering )

129
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,624
You heard the man.
Drop your weapons.

130
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,042
( more weapons clattering )

131
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,170
Don't look so surprised,
Commander.

132
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,131
I know a winner
when I see one.

133
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm with you.

134
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,134
Do you want me to shoot him?

135
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,011
We're still going to need
a cook.

136
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,471
Chakotay
to Engineering.

137
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,764
What's your status?

138
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,474
MALE:
<i>Engineering is secure.</i>

139
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,393
Transporter Rooms 1 and 2,
status.

140
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,062
MALE 2:
<i>Transporter Room 1</i>
<i>is under control.</i>

141
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,064
FEMALE:
<i>Transporter Room 2 is secure.</i>

142
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,441
Shuttle Bay, status.

143
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,776
MALE 3:
<i>Shuttle Bay is secured,</i>
<i>Commander.</i>

144
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,445
I'll take care
of the prisoners here.

145
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,780
You two get some help and
start rounding up the personnel

146
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,531
that are still locked
down in quarters.

147
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,993
Bring them to Cargo Bay 1.
We did it.

148
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,703
Just like old times.

149
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,961
You did a good job today.

150
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,254
Thanks.

151
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,214
Just make sure
you keep it up.

152
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,091
What's that
supposed to mean?

153
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,345
It means I'm not as easy
to win over as Chakotay.

154
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,805
Come on! Let's go.

155
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,399
Wait here.

156
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,988
Seska, what's going on?
Move it.

157
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,240
Why are we being
treated like prisoners?

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,825
No talking.

159
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,793
Over there,
with the rest of them.

160
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,253
What are you going
to do with us?

161
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,006
I said no talking!
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

162
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,299
I told you
it was a mistake

163
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,759
letting Starfleet
people in on this.

164
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,887
Now's not the time,
Seska.

165
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,766
Take a good look around you.

166
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,561
You're under armed guard.

167
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,190
You may also notice that your
senior officers aren't here.

168
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,359
They're in the brig.

169
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,693
They'll be put off the ship

170
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,364
at the first habitable planet
we come to.

171
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,032
All except Janeway and Paris...

172
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,992
who will arrive
at their rendezvous coordinates

173
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,953
to find
that<i> Voyager's</i> not there.

174
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,831
In short,
I've taken control of the ship.

175
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,417
I don't blame any of you

176
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,168
for the mistakes
of your leaders.

177
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,045
So I'm giving you
a choice.

178
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,630
You can be put off the ship
with your superiors,

179
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,092
or you can do what Neelix

180
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,593
and some of your
other crew members

181
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,970
have already done,
and join me.

182
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,099
If you do,
you'll be part of a crew

183
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,226
that's going to do whatever
it takes to get us home

184
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,186
as fast as possible.

185
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,146
Under my command,

186
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,024
we won't let almighty
Federation principles

187
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,776
get in the way of opportunities,

188
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,153
the way Janeway did
when she destroyed the Array

189
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,863
that could've gotten us home.

190
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,408
And we won't be wasting
precious time,

191
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,160
stopping to investigate
every insignificant anomaly

192
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,329
that we come across.

193
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,664
What we will do...

194
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,376
is use any means necessary
to acquire technology

195
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,336
that can shorten our journey.

196
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,964
To hell
with Starfleet regulations.

197
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,303
You have 15 minutes
to make up your minds.

198
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,762
PARIS:
B'Elanna.

199
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,473
What's going on here?

200
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,974
Computer, freeze program.

201
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,601
Are you in the habit
of just walking in

202
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,227
on people's private
holodeck time?

203
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,354
It's not as if I caught you
dancing the rumba

204
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,897
with a naked Bolian.

205
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,357
We had a lunch date,
remember?

206
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,109
Is it lunchtime
already?

207
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,986
I must've lost track
of the time.

208
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,904
Well, I expected
to find you

209
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,324
shooting pool at Sandrine's,

210
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,576
not hanging out with Seska.

211
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,828
What sort of program
is this, anyway?

212
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,288
It's really something.

213
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,457
I was doing a routine purge
of the database--

214
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,126
you know, taking out old files
that were taking up space--

215
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,877
and I found this holonovel.

216
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,465
It's a kind of "what if" story
all about a Maquis mutiny.

217
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,717
It's completely compelling...
and believable.

218
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,761
I guess it's because
it's all about us.

219
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,555
Who wrote it?

220
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,849
Now that...

221
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,059
is the big mystery.

222
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,899
Whoever the author is
has gone to a lot of trouble

223
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,860
to keep his
identity a secret.

224
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,612
It's been encrypted.

225
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,447
Why do you suppose someone would
try so hard to be anonymous?

226
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,824
Well, think about it.
Whoever plays this program

227
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,076
takes on the role of
a Starfleet Security Officer

228
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,620
who gets approached
by Chakotay

229
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,955
to help the Maquis
take over the ship.

230
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,790
I mean, it's pretty
inflammatory.

231
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,586
You think we should
tell the Captain?

232
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,506
Probably.

233
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,385
It would be pretty hard for us
to give her a full report,

234
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,761
if we don't know
how the story ends.

235
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,223
Excellent point.

236
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,516
Great. Can you
reset it for me?

237
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,393
You?! I was just getting
to the good part.

238
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,935
Oh, come on, B'Elanna,
be a sport.

239
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,979
I've got to be back on duty
in less than an hour.

240
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,273
Besides, isn't half
the fun of a holonovel

241
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,860
having someone
to talk it over with?

242
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,238
All right.
You owe me one.

243
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,666
Where are you headed?
The Bridge.

244
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,543
Mind if I walk with you?

245
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,628
I was kind of
hoping you would.

246
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,129
So how's it going?

247
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,755
Couldn't be better.

248
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,757
Tuvok still giving
you a hard time?

249
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,719
Doesn't he always?

250
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,679
I don't know about you,

251
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,389
but when I think
about spending 70 years

252
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,558
on the same ship with that guy,
it gives me a headache.

253
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,185
Not to mention
an upset stomach.

254
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,898
Bridge.

255
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,657
I hear you're
planning a mutiny.

256
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,745
Computer,
halt turbolift.

257
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,082
Who told you that?

258
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,792
Let's just say there are rumors.
( laughs )

259
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,254
Yeah, well, don't believe
everything you hear.

260
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,173
Of course not.
I just wanted you to know

261
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,468
that whatever happens,
I'm with you.

262
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,804
Computer, resume turbolift.

263
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,058
I'm serious.

264
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,185
Just tell me what
you want me to do.

265
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,276
All right, Ensign,
here it is.

266
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,446
As soon as the Captain
leaves to meet the Rukani,

267
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,324
I want you to put all crew
quarters on lockdown.

268
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,535
I'll ask you if you've finished
upgrading the internal sensors.

269
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,581
If you say yes,
I'll know we're ready to go.

270
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,708
I understand.

271
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,376
I'm watching you.

272
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,170
No tricks.

273
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,802
We are entering
the Rukani sector, Commander.

274
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,180
Inform the Captain.
Aye, sir.

275
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:18,024
Well, Commander... <i> Voyager's</i>
all yours.

276
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,151
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

277
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,402
Don't worry, Captain.

278
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,903
I'll keep your ship
safe and sound.

279
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,238
I'm sure you will.

280
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,990
PARIS:
<i>Shuttle Bay to Captain Janeway.</i>

281
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,492
Go ahead, Mr. Paris.

282
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,410
The shuttle's ready to go,
whenever you are.

283
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,745
JANEWAY:
On my way.

284
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,580
Captain,
I've been thinking.

285
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,166
Are you sure you don't want to
take Lieutenant Tuvok with you,

286
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,668
just in case
the Rukani turn out

287
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,127
to be less friendly
than they seem?

288
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,713
I assure you, Commander,
I have made

289
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,881
thorough preparations
for the Captain's safety

290
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,174
during her away mission.

291
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,009
You, on the other hand,
are still adapting

292
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,178
to your duties
as First Officer.

293
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,138
Under the circumstances,
I believe my time

294
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,349
will be better spent
assisting you in your effort

295
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,560
to justify the trust
the Captain has placed in you.

296
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,020
I appreciate your concern
for my safety, Mr. Chakotay,

297
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,271
but Tuvok's right.

298
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,399
Lieutenant Paris and
I will be just fine.

299
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,235
I'll see you
in 24 hours.

300
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,362
Lieutenant,

301
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,281
I want you to keep close tabs
on the Captain's shuttle.

302
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,534
Let's make sure she doesn't
run into any trouble.

303
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,951
Aye, sir.

304
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,954
Ensign, let's shut down
the transporters

305
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,708
and start that diagnostic
we've been putting off.

306
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,376
Sir, are you sure
we shouldn't wait

307
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,753
for the Captain
to get back?

308
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,254
TUVOK:
Ensign Kim,

309
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,130
you have been given
a direct order.

310
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,216
Do as the Commander tells you.

311
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,718
Aye, sir.

312
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,512
( console beeping )

313
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,765
Have you finished upgrading
the internal sensors?

314
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,309
Yes, sir.
I hope so.

315
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,980
Wait here.

316
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,858
Is anything wrong,
sir?

317
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,944
No. It's just
tomorrow's duty roster.

318
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,454
The Captain's shuttle
has gone to warp.

319
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,996
Thank you, Tuvok.

320
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,041
Chakotay to all hands. Let's do
it.

321
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,669
Sir?
Tuvok, get down!

322
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,598
I guess you've
made your choice.

323
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,142
It's not over yet,
Chakotay.

324
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,311
Take them all
to the brig.

325
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,706
Sir, we have
to do something.

326
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,416
What did you have
in mind, Ensign?

327
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,168
Escape,
retake the ship.

328
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,337
We will indeed
attempt to do so,

329
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,297
when the time is right.

330
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,342
What about
trying it now?

331
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,218
Such a foolhardy proposal

332
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,346
suggests a lack
of proper training.

333
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,055
Need I remind you
that we are confined

334
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,433
behind an electrostatic
force field?

335
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,268
We can't just sit
here and do nothing.

336
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,312
We are hardly
doing nothing.

337
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,815
We are observing
the enemy, watching for

338
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,900
any discernible patterns
in their procedures,

339
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,028
looking for any weakness
in their defenses.

340
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,865
How long is this observing
business going to take?

341
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,450
It's been over an hour already.
I'm getting bored.

342
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,370
I am not concerned with
your amusement, Ensign.

343
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,748
We are in a crisis situation
and we will follow procedure

344
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,500
and procedure dictates
that we wait

345
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,502
for the right opportunity
to attempt an escape

346
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,379
whether it takes
an hour or a week.

347
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,881
A week?!

348
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,049
Who wrote this stuff?

349
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,260
Hold Kim and Tuvok here.

350
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,263
Bring the rest of them
to Cargo Bay 1.

351
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,227
Enjoy the wait.

352
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,607
...and we won't be wasting
precious time

353
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,942
stopping to investigate

354
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,778
every insignificant anomaly
we come across.

355
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,865
What we will do is use
any means necessary

356
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,701
to acquire technology that
can shorten our journey.

357
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,161
To hell with
Starfleet regulations.

358
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,540
You have 15 minutes
to make up your minds.

359
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,834
I don't need 15 minutes.

360
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,420
I'm with you right now.

361
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,925
So, by the time I
got around to joining

362
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,010
Chakotay's band of rebels...
Uh-huh.

363
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,845
he was so suspicious
of my motives

364
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,263
that he assigned
me to lubricate

365
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,806
the warp plasma
manifolds.

366
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,850
You should've tried
going along with the mutiny

367
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,518
from the beginning.
It's much more fun.

368
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,103
Oh, believe me,
next time I will.

369
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,813
I couldn't help
overhearing.

370
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,566
You two are talking
about the new holonovel.

371
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,527
I tried sending
an encoded message

372
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,946
to Captain Janeway's shuttle,

373
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,989
to warn her about the mutiny,

374
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,491
but Chakotay caught me,
phasered me,

375
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,118
and the program reset.

376
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
Next time, I'm going to pretend

377
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,789
to go along
with the conspirators,

378
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,707
and then stage
a counterstrike.

379
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,459
I thought we were
going to keep this

380
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,461
our little secret.
Don't look at me.

381
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,088
I didn't tell him.

382
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,881
I heard about it
from the Doctor.

383
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,132
The Doctor?

384
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,759
I may have let it slip

385
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,803
while I was running
his weekly diagnostic.

386
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,554
Oh, great.

387
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,056
Who else knows about it?

388
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,308
Don't worry about me.
My lips are sealed.

389
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,645
So what's this Ayala tells
me about a new holonovel?

390
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,941
Get in line, Harry.

391
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:14,320
PARIS:
<i>Lieutenant Paris's Personal</i>
<i>Log, Stardate 50953.4.</i>

392
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,196
<i>I've decided to take</i>
<i>B'Elanna's advice</i>

393
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,615
<i>and replay the holonovel,</i>

394
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,450
<i>this time,</i>
<i>as a full-fledged member</i>

395
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,452
<i>of Chakotay's</i>
<i>team of mutineers.</i>

396
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,330
<i>I hope it turns out</i>
<i>better than before.</i>

397
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,417
Where the hell are
those warp engines?

398
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,086
They're still off-line.

399
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,088
We can't seem to get the
dilithium matrix reinitialized.

400
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,380
It's been two days.

401
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,217
Don't worry.
B'Elanna's on it.

402
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,137
Run a full
security sweep.

403
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,472
Something tells me there's
more to this engine problem

404
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,223
than a faulty
dilithium matrix.

405
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,351
You think we've got
a saboteur on board?

406
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,938
There's a ship approaching,
bearing 216 mark 33.

407
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,690
It's Janeway's shuttle.

408
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,316
Open a channel.

409
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,363
Hello, Kathryn.

410
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,865
How did it go
with the Rukani?

411
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,034
<i>You're out of uniform,</i>
<i>Commander.</i>

412
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,869
There have been
a few changes

413
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,203
since you've been gone.

414
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,205
<i>So I've heard.</i>

415
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,000
<i>You think I don't have</i>
<i>any friends left on</i> Voyager?

416
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,919
Apparently, you do,
but I'll find them.

417
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,546
<i>And then what?</i>

418
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,631
<i>Will you kill them</i>
<i>or just put them off the ship?</i>

419
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,091
( sighs heavily )

420
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,593
Nobody has to die here today.

421
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,138
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>a man of your word, Chakotay.</i>

422
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,264
<i>I guess I was mistaken.</i>

423
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,726
I'm sorry
it had to come to this,

424
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,687
but the crew believes I can get
them home faster than you can.

425
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,814
<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>a little difficult</i>

426
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,733
<i>without warp engines,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

427
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,569
Our warp drive may be
temporarily off-line,

428
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,197
but our weapon systems
are fully operational.

429
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,823
They're powering phasers.

430
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,616
Kathryn, don't try to be a hero.

431
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,451
I've been reasonable so far.

432
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,579
I'll allow you
to keep the shuttle.

433
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,956
I'll even transport you
some extra provisions,

434
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,793
but if you don't stand down,
I will destroy your shuttle.

435
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:57,464
<i>You've just threatened</i>
<i>the wrong woman, Chakotay.</i>

436
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,511
What does she think she's
going to accomplish?

437
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,931
We can obliterate them
in one shot.

438
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,557
Not till I
give the order.

439
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,060
Reopen a channel.

440
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,520
I don't know how, but they've
disabled our shields.

441
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,564
We're completely vulnerable.

442
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,151
Target their warp
core and fire.

443
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,783
I always said
Janeway was a fool.

444
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,244
COMPUTER:
<i>Intruder alert on Deck 8.</i>

445
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,912
It's Paris and Janeway.

446
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,248
Janeway's no fool.

447
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,208
She tricked us
into destroying her shuttle,

448
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,627
then transported over
while the shields were down!

449
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,629
She's trying
to free the prisoners.

450
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,880
You've got the Bridge.

451
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,506
You're with me.

452
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,308
Get away from that panel!

453
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,560
( groans )
Oh!

454
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,188
Drop it.

455
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,406
Computer, resume program.

456
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,660
COMPUTER:
<i>The holographic simulation</i>
<i>has ended.</i>

457
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,121
Well, start it up again,
right where it left off.

458
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,499
<i>Unable to comply.</i> 
Why not?

459
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,044
<i>Additional narrative parameters</i>
<i>have not been programmed.</i>

460
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,088
Are you saying
there's no more story?

461
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,423
<i>Affirmative.</i>

462
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,218
This is someone's idea
of a practical joke, right?

463
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,720
<i>Please rephrase the question.</i>

464
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,190
There.

465
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,441
I've bypassed
the security override.

466
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,651
Try it now.

467
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,736
Computer,
identify the author

468
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,530
of holographic
program entitled

469
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,990
"Insurrection Alpha."

470
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,617
COMPUTER:
<i>That information is classified.</i>

471
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,453
I've tried every decryption
protocol I can think of.

472
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,830
Whoever wrote this is good.

473
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,623
Not to mention
sadistic.

474
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,459
I can't believe we've been
left hanging like this.

475
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,962
Any luck?
( both sighing )

476
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,672
Me, neither.

477
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,008
I've discreetly
questioned everybody

478
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,801
I thought I could trust.

479
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,721
Either nobody knows,
or nobody's talking.

480
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,265
Remember the good old days
when it was impossible

481
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,642
to keep a secret
on a ship this small?

482
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,273
Well, if that takes care
of our official agenda,

483
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,526
there's another matter
I'd like to discuss.

484
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,446
Commander Chakotay informs me
there's a new holonovel

485
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,283
that's become quite
popular among the crew.

486
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,993
It's been accessed
47 times

487
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,037
by 33 different
crew members.

488
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,914
I don't suppose anyone here
is familiar

489
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,166
with what we're talking about.

490
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,710
Actually, uh, Captain,
I'm the one who found it

491
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,379
on the auxiliary database.

492
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,881
I've been
running it too.

493
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,175
Anybody else?

494
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,683
I understand that the author
of this little opus

495
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,602
has chosen to remain anonymous,

496
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,562
perhaps because
of the controversial nature

497
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,689
of the story,
which depicts Commander Chakotay

498
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,775
as the leader of
a Maquis mutiny.

499
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,361
Well, now that the cat's
out of the bag...

500
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,947
I want each of you
to talk to your staff

501
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,158
and find out
who our anonymous author is.

502
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,619
That won't be necessary,
Captain.

503
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,039
I am the author
of the program in question.

504
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,416
You, Tuvok?

505
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,252
I never knew
you had literary aspirations.

506
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,171
Not to mention talent.
What a story.

507
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,632
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.

508
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,508
The program
is not a holonovel.

509
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,386
It is
a tactical training scenario.

510
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,431
When you first invited
the Maquis to join our crew,

511
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:36,558
I believed that mutiny
was a very real possibility.

512
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,519
With that in mind, I began to
write a training program

513
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,272
for junior security officers

514
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,316
to prepare them
for such an eventuality.

515
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,775
But you never finished it.

516
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,945
No. As the two crews
began to work together,

517
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,072
I concluded that
the threat of an insurrection

518
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,450
was increasingly unlikely.

519
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,701
I realized the program itself
might exacerbate

520
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,662
the very conflict
I sought to avoid.

521
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,580
Therefore,
I deleted the scenario.

522
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,291
Or so I believed.

523
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,335
Apparently,
you didn't account for

524
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,378
B'Elanna's exceptional
computer skills.

525
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,546
Nor her somewhat
excessive curiosity.

526
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,882
I apologize for
my carelessness, Captain.

527
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,634
Forget your
carelessness.

528
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,261
What you should be
apologizing for

529
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,887
is leaving us all
hanging by a thread.

530
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,056
You've got to finish
the story.

531
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,684
On the contrary, Mr. Paris,
the program has the potential

532
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,227
to incite animosity
among the crew

533
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,687
and must be
permanently deleted.

534
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,273
I have no doubt
the Captain concurs.

535
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,901
With all due respect,
Mr. Tuvok, loosen up.

536
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,363
You may have intended
this program

537
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,323
to be
a tactical training tool,

538
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,907
but it looks to me

539
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,951
like it's turned into
a bit of harmless fun.

540
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,995
As the Captain of this ship,
surely you must--

541
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,621
I'm more than just
a Captain.

542
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,915
I'm the leader of a community,
and communities need

543
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,460
entertainment, culture,
creative outlets.

544
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,504
Since we're not exactly privy
to every new piece

545
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,131
of music or holonovel
that's written back home,

546
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,632
I think it's only natural

547
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,301
that we should start
creating our own.

548
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,512
Besides, Tuvok, if the crew
doesn't get an ending,

549
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,347
you may have a real mutiny
on your hands.

550
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,931
( both laughing )

551
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,933
If Tuvok doesn't want
to finish the story,

552
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,102
I volunteer.
Oh?

553
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,522
I've always wanted to
write a holonovel.

554
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,482
I think I could make
it pretty exciting.

555
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,068
Good. Then it's settled.

556
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,237
I, for one, can't wait to see
if Captain Janeway

557
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,490
manages to outwit
the conspirators.

558
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,716
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Anonymous.

559
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,427
Come to check up
on your replacement?

560
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,594
Since the Captain
insists on allowing you

561
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,931
to proceed with this
frivolous exercise,

562
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,433
I thought you
might benefit

563
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,184
from the original
probability studies

564
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,811
I conducted before
beginning the scenario.

565
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,146
Well, thanks, Tuvok,

566
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,399
but I don't need
any probability studies.

567
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,193
I'm just sort of making it up
as I go along.

568
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,819
Indeed.

569
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,323
I'd be curious to know
what you've "made up" thus far.

570
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,784
Well, I was thinking,

571
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,370
Paris and Janeway
retake the ship,

572
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,789
and then she decides to execute
all the conspirators.

573
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,167
That is an entirely implausible
plot development.

574
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,835
Captain Janeway
would never behave

575
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,421
in such an inhumane manner.

576
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,215
This isn't real life, Tuvok,
it's fiction.

577
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,134
Don't get so caught up
in logic.

578
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,345
Logic is an integral part
of narrative structure.

579
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,139
According to the
"Dictates of Poetics,"

580
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,639
by T'Hain of Vulcan,

581
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,143
a character's actions
must flow inexorably

582
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,186
from his or her
established traits.

583
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,064
Well, I don't know anything
about T'Hain,

584
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,358
but I do know what makes
an interesting story,

585
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,277
and that's
unexpected plot twists.

586
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,028
If you think
I will allow you

587
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,697
to turn this program into a
parody, you are sorely mistaken.

588
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,033
Are you saying that you're going
to finish it yourself?

589
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,743
Artistic
differences?

590
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,997
I would hardly call
Mr. Paris's ideas... artistic.

591
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,665
Apparently,
my instincts don't comply

592
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,793
with the Vulcan
"Dictates of Poetics."

593
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,338
Well, I've got a couple
of suggestions that might help.

594
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,048
Now, up until now, the story's
been nothing but action,

595
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,550
which is fine,
but what it needs

596
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,802
is a little heart,
a little emotion.

597
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,971
We are not writing
a romance novel, Lieutenant.

598
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,722
"We"?

599
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,350
I've decided that your efforts

600
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,185
would benefit
from my collaboration.

601
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,936
Oh, really?

602
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,356
Listen, I don't care which one
of you is writing this thing.

603
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,483
All I'm saying is that there
is room in every good story

604
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,984
for a little bit of passion.

605
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,487
You know,
maybe you're on to something.

606
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,447
I could add a steamy love scene

607
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,407
between the Starfleet
conn officer

608
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,699
and the Maquis engineer.

609
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,951
Oh, that's realistic.

610
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,744
How about a fresh pot
of coffee

611
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,872
to keep those
creative juices flowing, huh?

612
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,790
Thanks, Neelix.

613
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,584
Uh, while I'm here...

614
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,171
Uh, let me guess.
You have a suggestion to make.

615
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,631
Of course not.
I would never presume

616
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,841
to interfere
in the creative process.

617
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,678
More of a comment, really,
about the Neelix character--

618
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,347
How surprising.

619
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,432
He would never betray
the Captain

620
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,933
the way he does in that story.

621
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,436
No offense, Mr. Vulcan,
but I don't think

622
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,146
you understand
my character very well.

623
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,273
Tuvok, did you
forget to follow

624
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,858
the "Dictates of Poetics"?

625
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,237
Perhaps we should find someplace
quieter to work.

626
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,322
Now, that's the first
intelligent suggestion

627
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,700
I've heard all evening.

628
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,577
I believe our
first step should be

629
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,370
to create a carefully
constructed outline

630
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,455
of the remaining chapters.
I told you, Tuvok.

631
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,165
I'm just making
it up as I go.

632
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,918
We cannot proceed without
a carefully constructed outline.

633
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,836
There you go with
that "we" stuff again.

634
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,963
I don't remember agreeing
to let you help me.

635
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,593
Need I remind you that it was
I who first began the scenario.

636
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:23,053
And you think
I'm compromising

637
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,805
your creative vision?
In so many words, yes.

638
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,475
And it is my duty to insure
that ship security

639
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,977
is not compromised
by your creative vision.

640
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,896
You had your chance
to finish this story

641
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,356
and you wanted
to delete it.

642
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,525
True, but since that is
no longer an option,

643
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,318
I am now exercising
my prerogative

644
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,154
as the original author.
Look, Tuvok...

645
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,700
for the last time,
I don't need any help.

646
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,997
DOCTOR:
Ah, there you are.

647
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,999
I have several
brilliant ideas

648
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,918
for upcoming chapters
of your holonovel,

649
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,296
as well as a list of revisions
and dialogue changes

650
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,673
that I believe will improve
the earlier installments.

651
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,759
I don't believe this.
No thanks are necessary.

652
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,843
In addition, I'm prepared
to offer my expertise

653
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,012
in the creation
of holographic mise-en-scène.

654
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,974
Computer, override
the EMH program's

655
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,602
autonomous controls, and
transfer him back to Sick Bay.

656
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,103
Now, wait just a minute...

657
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,438
( sighs )

658
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,731
Thanks, Tuvok.

659
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,274
Now that I think
about it...

660
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,234
I'll take it from here.

661
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,945
You may find that difficult,
since I'm the only one

662
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,197
who can make additions
to the program.

663
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,117
( chuckling )

664
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,286
All right,
Tuvok, you win.

665
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,163
We'll finish the
story together.

666
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,791
That is a very rational
decision, Mr. Paris.

667
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,585
Computer, reinitiate
the holographic program

668
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,337
entitled "Insurrection Alpha."

669
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,964
Security clearance:
Tuvok-four-seven-seven-four.

670
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,175
COMPUTER:
<i>The program</i>
<i>has been reinitiated.</i>

671
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,761
The first thing we're going
to change is that title.

672
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,513
Reformat the holo-matrix

673
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,015
for the addition of new
interactive algorithms.

674
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,518
<i>The holo-matrix</i>
<i>has been formatted.</i>

675
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,270
Reopen the narrative
parameters file.

676
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,193
Captain, we just lost power
in both transporter rooms.

677
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,820
The com went down,

678
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,824
and the holodeck systems
are completely scrambled.

679
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,743
What are we doing in the brig?
I have no idea.

680
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,662
We haven't given the
computer instructions

681
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,039
to create a location yet.
SESKA: Hello, Tuvok.

682
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,333
I've been expecting you.

683
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,168
If you can see me,

684
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,879
you've obviously reopened
the narrative parameters file

685
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,173
of the tactical scenario
you've been working on.

686
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,509
How do you know that? You're a
hologram.

687
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,885
SESKA:
That's right.

688
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,471
A holographic representation
of Seska,

689
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,890
one of the Maquis
shipmates you betrayed.

690
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,142
I would've thought all
that time you spent

691
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,644
spying on us
might've given you

692
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,479
a little more insight
into the Maquis,

693
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,315
but after looking over
what you've already written,

694
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,526
I can see you need
a little help.

695
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,404
So I've created
this representation of myself

696
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,865
to guide you through the rest
of the program.

697
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,658
There is no more program.

698
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,951
There is now.

699
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,205
I finished writing it for you
with a few revisions of my own.

700
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,040
Revisions?

701
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,001
To start with,
the holodeck is now sealed.

702
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,003
Your friends will find it
very difficult

703
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,963
to get you
out of here.

704
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,965
And the safety protocols
are off,

705
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:10,387
which means if I shoot you,
and I am going to shoot you,

706
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,890
you'll die.

707
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,308
But not just yet.

708
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,896
( console beeping )

709
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,357
You've got ten seconds to run.

710
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,408
Nine, eight...

711
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,076
Computer, end program.

712
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,871
...seven, six...
Holodeck 1 to Bridge.

713
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,497
...five...
Emergency transport.

714
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,124
Oh, did I forget to tell you?

715
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,042
The moment you restarted
the program,

716
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,961
the com system went down.

717
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,004
Four... three...

718
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,715
I guess we better do
what she says.

719
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,761
...two, one...

720
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,221
You should never have
crossed her, Tuvok.

721
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,223
"She" has been dead
for over a year now.

722
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,726
There would've been no way to
predict this turn of events.

723
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,394
We should've known
Seska wouldn't let

724
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,354
a thing like death
stop her from getting even.

725
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,273
JANEWAY:
Tuvok, Tom.

726
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,942
In here.

727
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,485
Captain.

728
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,487
We're going to have
to transport to the Cargo Bay

729
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,029
to free the rest
of the prisoners.

730
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,032
It's safer than trying
to make it on foot.

731
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,660
She's a hologram too.

732
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,286
Apparently, she believes
we're here

733
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,371
to help her retake the ship
from the mutineers.

734
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,499
I say we play along.

735
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,793
We could use all the help
we can get against Seska.

736
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,378
You're forgetting it was Seska
who rewrote the scenario.

737
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,839
For all we know,
she's programmed

738
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,173
Captain Janeway
to betray us.

739
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,842
I suppose you have
a better idea?

740
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,760
The safest course of action
is to avoid

741
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,345
participation of any kind.

742
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,014
Eventually, the real Captain
will discover our predicament,

743
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,891
and shut down the program
from the outside.

744
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,810
Let's move.

745
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,687
CHAKOTAY:
Hold it right there.

746
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,605
Back off.

747
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,065
Or what? You'll shoot us?
Go right ahead.

748
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,943
Whatever you say.

749
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,528
( gasping )

750
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,366
SESKA:
Poor Kathryn.

751
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,326
I guess nobody told her
the phaser rifles

752
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,371
from Storage Locker 3
have been malfunctioning.

753
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,583
You're an incredible
woman, Seska.

754
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,049
You see who's in charge
now, don't you?

755
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,510
So if I were you,
I'd get moving again.

756
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,178
The program's not over.

757
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,889
We have no intention
of participating

758
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,473
in this exercise.

759
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,976
You don't want to end up
like your Captain, do you?

760
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,770
You programmed all this.
The malfunctioning phaser,

761
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,981
a version of Chakotay
who's attracted to you...

762
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,107
None of it's real.
You hear that?

763
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,985
He thinks this is a game.

764
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,737
Show him he's wrong.

765
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,240
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

766
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,075
( groans )

767
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,451
Next time,
you'll believe me

768
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,453
when I tell you
the safety protocols are off.

769
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,080
Now, you've got
five seconds

770
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,790
to start running again,
or you'll end up

771
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,001
with more than
a flesh wound.

772
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,423
So much for not playing
along with Seska's program.

773
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,633
Are you able to continue?
I'll keep up.

774
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,343
The question is:
Where are we going?

775
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,012
I have an idea.

776
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,723
What's the point? This isn't the
real Sick Bay.

777
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,058
I may be able to use
some of this

778
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,976
holographic equipment
to treat your wound.

779
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,228
Besides, it's as good a place
as any to hide from Seska.

780
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,439
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

781
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,233
No emergency, Doc. I'm fine.
Nonsense. You have second-degree

782
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,235
phaser burns. Please have a seat
on bio-bed one.

783
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,529
That's all right, Doc. I'm
telling you, I feel fine.

784
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,240
You require treatment.
20 cc's nitric acid.

785
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,617
( screams )

786
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,286
A little proverbial
salt in the wound.

787
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,710
You're looking well.
Go!

788
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,503
I'm not going
to leave you.

789
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,717
It was a pleasure treating you.

790
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,510
Don't hesitate to call again.

791
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,391
Are you all right,
Mr. Paris?

792
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,643
Oh, just great.

793
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,686
Maybe we can go to
the Mess Hall now,

794
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,689
and let the holographic Neelix
burn my arm with a frying pan.

795
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,109
Your feeble attempt at wit
notwithstanding,

796
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,111
it does appear that Seska
has reprogrammed

797
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,237
the holographic crew
to torture us.

798
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,490
I suggest we avoid
meeting any more of them.

799
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,617
<i>Seska to Tuvok.</i>

800
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,702
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

801
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,287
Oh, terrific.

802
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,831
<i>I just wanted to remind you</i>

803
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,668
<i>that wherever you go,</i>
<i>I'll find you.</i>

804
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,711
I say we try
the Jefferies tubes.

805
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,672
I concur.

806
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,013
Captain, you're not
going to believe this,

807
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,473
but Seska caused these
cascade failures.

808
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,266
Seska? How?

809
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,353
What she lacked in loyalty,
she made up for in ingenuity.

810
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,480
According to the backup
computer logs,

811
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,859
she got into Tuvok's scenario
on stardate 48671,

812
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,694
about a month before
she left the ship.

813
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,863
She programmed it to cause
all of these shutdowns

814
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,615
the next time Tuvok reopened
the narrative parameters file,

815
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,201
which he didn't do
until today.

816
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,619
Can we get them out?

817
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,373
Seska laid booby-trapped
subroutines everywhere.

818
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,249
If we try to open
the holodeck doors,

819
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,669
the power grid
is rigged to explode.

820
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,713
And the transporters
are still off-line.

821
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,841
You said the narrative
parameters file is open now.

822
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,845
Seska's revised program
is playing out as we speak.

823
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,641
If Seska can rewrite Tuvok...

824
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,021
maybe I can rewrite Seska.

825
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:16,735
So, Tuvok, anything
in the "Dictates of Poetics"

826
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,070
about how to escape

827
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,197
from a ship full
of insane holograms?

828
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,531
Your attempts at humor

829
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,992
are hardly constructive,
Mr. Paris.

830
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,709
( beeping denial )

831
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,502
The controls are jammed.

832
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,380
I cannot close
the hatch.

833
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,049
Tuvok!

834
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,565
Where do you suppose
this came from?

835
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,234
That is an intriguing question.

836
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,402
You think Seska's
toying with us?

837
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,738
Taking us to the brink
of death again,

838
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,073
then letting us live,

839
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:04,449
so she can keep
torturing us?

840
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,826
I prefer a more optimistic
interpretation.

841
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,495
It is possible our shipmates
outside the holodeck

842
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,997
have learned
of our predicament

843
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,331
and have found
a way to help us

844
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,917
by making additions
to the program,

845
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,627
such as
that plasma extinguisher.

846
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,670
If you want to look
on the bright side,

847
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,257
I'm certainly not going
to argue with you.

848
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,682
If they do know
what's going on,

849
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,726
why just hand us
a plasma extinguisher?

850
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,812
Why not shut down
the hologrid

851
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,605
or change the scenario?

852
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,191
I would imagine Seska
has made it very difficult

853
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:41,194
for anyone to implement
more than minor changes.

854
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,654
Take a look at this.

855
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:46,532
( alarm buzzing )

856
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,912
You were right.

857
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,372
We must follow
their instructions.

858
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,296
Hello, boys.

859
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:02,299
What do you say we go
for a little walk?

860
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,470
Where did they come from?

861
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,808
Seska's program is
adding new algorithms

862
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,643
to counteract the
changes we're making.

863
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,854
I need more access
to the narrative subroutines.

864
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,356
I can't get in.
You better find a way.

865
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,399
Otherwise, Tom and Tuvok
aren't going to make it

866
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,194
out of there alive.

867
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,492
It looks like
Chakotay's taking them

868
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,203
to the holographic cargo bay.

869
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,705
Torres to Kim. How are you
coming with those transporters?

870
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:37,334
Seska's program has completely
disabled the relay access ports.

871
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,961
<i>It's going to take a while to</i>
<i>get Tom and Tuvok out of there.</i>

872
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,215
I guess that means
I keep writing.

873
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:46,051
As you can see, the last of your
comrades have been captured.

874
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,803
In case anybody had any doubts,
it should be obvious by now

875
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,889
that this is no longer
a Starfleet vessel.

876
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,392
Bring Paris and Tuvok
over here.

877
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,728
You and you,
bring your weapons.

878
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,942
CHAKOTAY:<i> What are you doing?</i> 
<i>What do you think I'm doing?</i>

879
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,111
<i>I'm going to execute them</i>
<i>right here, right now.</i>

880
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,530
I need access to
the character algorithms now.

881
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,158
I'm on it.
Fire on my order.

882
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,368
Belay that.

883
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:14,246
What are you doing?
We planned this.

884
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,455
I'm not sure
it's necessary to kill them.

885
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,000
If I'm not mistaken,
the Chakotay hologram

886
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,253
is undergoing some sort
of character change.

887
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,088
Do you think they're trying
to help us again?

888
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,382
These two rodents betrayed us.
They deserve to die.

889
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,926
Don't listen to her, Commander.
You've taken the ship.

890
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,678
There is no need to add murder
to your list of offenses.

891
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:34,057
Quiet!
Lower your weapons.

892
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,976
It's working.
Now, if I can just keep

893
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,271
modifying the Chakotay
hologram...

894
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:42,232
SESKA:
<i>You're not going</i>
<i>to lose your nerve, are you?</i>

895
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,816
We have what we want.

896
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,693
There's no reason
to kill them.

897
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,862
Prepare to fire on my order!

898
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,824
CHAKOTAY:
Seska, I'm in command
of this operation.

899
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,327
<i>Not anymore!</i>

900
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,956
I don't believe it.

901
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,666
The program is reconfiguring
the sub-processors

902
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,752
to counter every change we make.

903
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,630
No matter what we do,
it rewrites itself

904
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,924
so that Tom and Tuvok
will die.

905
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,843
I'm not out of ideas yet.

906
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,180
Is there anyone else who
wants to challenge my authority?

907
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,145
Isn't their loyalty inspiring?

908
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,855
Set your phasers
to "kill."

909
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,190
Don't listen to her.

910
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,359
Fire on my order.

911
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,322
What the hell was that?

912
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,207
Don't move, Seska.

913
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,667
FEMALE:
<i>Bridge to Seska.</i>

914
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,710
<i>We're under attack</i>
<i>by the Rukani.</i>

915
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,629
The Rukani?

916
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,423
The people the Captain
and I were visiting

917
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,091
while you were busy
taking over the ship.

918
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,593
When we realized there was
a mutiny in progress,

919
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,595
we called them
for a little assistance.

920
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,722
Harry, have you got
transporters yet?

921
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,724
KIM:
<i>Still working on it, Captain.</i>

922
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,685
You're not getting
this ship back.

923
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,313
That is a rather bold statement
for someone in your position.

924
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:06,607
Computer, initiate 60-second
self-destruct sequence.

925
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,318
Authorization: zeta-one.

926
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,987
COMPUTER:
<i>This ship will self-destruct</i>
<i>in 60 seconds.</i>

927
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,489
Computer,
belay that order.

928
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,740
Authorization: Tuvok-
four-seven-seven-four.

929
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,409
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

930
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,910
<i>Voiceprint not recognized.</i>

931
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,912
If you don't hand over
that phaser rifle,

932
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,914
everyone on this ship
is going to be dead in--

933
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,917
<i>Self-destruct in 45 seconds.</i>

934
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,627
I don't know how
she rigged it, Captain,

935
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,546
but when she ordered
the self-destruct,

936
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,341
it initiated an overload
in the holodeck power relays.

937
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:34,386
The whole grid is going to blow.

938
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,054
<i>Self-destruct in 30 seconds.</i>

939
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,555
Hand over the weapon,

940
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,351
or the ship
is going to be destroyed.

941
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,602
I have set this phaser
to kill.

942
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,771
If you do not deactivate
the self-destruct sequence,

943
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,399
I will fire.

944
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,985
I'm surprised at you, Tuvok.
That's not very logical.

945
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,113
If I'm dead, who'll turn off
the self-destruct?

946
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,741
<i>Fifteen seconds</i>
<i>to self-destruct.</i>

947
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:00,578
<i>Thirteen... 12... 11...</i>

948
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,038
<i>ten... nine...</i>

949
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,707
Computer, terminate
self-destruct sequence.

950
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,918
Authorization: zeta-one.

951
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,921
<i>Self-destruct sequence</i>
<i>has been terminated.</i>

952
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,173
Now call off
your Rukani friends.

953
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,758
Do what she says.

954
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,926
Tuvok--

955
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,678
That's an order,
Mr. Paris.

956
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,476
Paris to the Rukani vessel.

957
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,562
Thank you for your assistance,

958
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,855
but everything's
under control now.

959
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,815
It is, isn't it?

960
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,901
I guess, if you
want something done right,

961
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,153
you've got to do it yourself.

962
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,491
( screaming )

963
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,412
Not bad.

964
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:43,955
Seska's not
the only one

965
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:47,125
who knows how to cause
a phaser malfunction.

966
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,547
COMPUTER:
<i>The holographic simulation</i>
<i>has ended.</i>

967
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,092
It's over.
<i>Kim to Engineering.</i>

968
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,970
<i>I think I can give you</i>
<i>transporters now, Captain.</i>

969
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,723
That's all right, Harry.
No rush.

970
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,776
Here's to stories
with happy endings.

971
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,404
( light laughter )

972
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,822
I must say, Captain,

973
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,782
causing the alien ship
to come to our aid

974
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,826
was a very effective
plot development.

975
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:25,037
Who says deus ex machina
is an outdated literary device?

976
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,789
I'm just glad you didn't
come down with

977
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,291
a case of writer's block.

978
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,627
So, you two are going to
have to come up with

979
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:34,380
a new idea for your next
literary collaboration.

980
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,048
What about doing a Western?

981
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,634
Or a detective story.

982
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,260
I don't care
what kind of story it is,

983
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,095
as long as I'm not
the bad guy this time.

984
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,389
( laughter )

985
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,724
I've got a great idea
for a holonovel

986
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,644
about a daring trader

987
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,854
who becomes a cook
on a starship.

988
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,398
Eventually, he rises--
Mr. Neelix...

989
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,568
if Mr. Paris and I do create
another work of holofiction,

990
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,069
I assure you,

991
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,696
we will choose a subject
much less close to home.

992
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:02,783
( laughter )
