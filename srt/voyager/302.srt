1
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,472
NEELIX:
Anthraxic citrus
peel orange juice

2
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,892
with just a hint of
<i>papalla</i> seed extract--

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,268
an experimental blend.

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,480
The success rate
of your culinary experiments

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,982
has not been high.

6
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:25,651
Ensign Golwat tried
some yesterday

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,152
and she thought
it was delicious.

8
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,779
In fact, she had
a second glass

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,865
and she never has seconds.

10
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,700
Ensign Golwat is Bolian.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,827
Her tongue has
a cartilaginous lining.

12
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,119
It would protect her

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,205
against even the most
corrosive acid.

14
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,543
All I ask is that you
try it, Mr. Vulcan.

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,347
Impressive.

16
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,974
Ah.

17
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,060
I'll start squeezing
that second glass.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,854
Breakfast is coming
right up.

19
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,647
Porakan eggs.

20
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,857
Porakan?

21
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,527
The most flavorful eggs
in the sector.

22
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,405
Scrambled
with a little dill weed,

23
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,699
a touch of<i> rengazo--</i>

24
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,617
a galactic favorite.

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,203
Now, these eggs
were not easy

26
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,454
to prepare.

27
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,540
After we picked them up
on Porakas IV,

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,917
I had to sterilize them

29
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,502
in a cryostatic chamber
for three days.

30
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,796
Then each and every one

31
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,756
had to be parboiled...

32
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,131
Mr. Neelix, I would prefer

33
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,927
not to hear the life history
of my breakfast.

34
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,847
On Talax, it's a tradition
to share the history of a meal

35
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,766
before you begin eating.

36
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,936
It's a way of enhancing
the culinary experience.

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,731
My mother was brilliant.

38
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,901
She could make every course,
every garnish come alive

39
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,194
by making it a character
in a story.

40
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,864
My favorite was the one
about the crustacean who...

41
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,579
What happened?

42
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,082
Um, some sort
of power overload.

43
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,797
I'm afraid it decimated
your breakfast.

44
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,298
This is what my mother

45
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,925
would have called
a tragic ending.

46
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,259
Engineering has been

47
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,428
making adjustments
to the plasma conduits

48
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,305
to accommodate a
new energy source.

49
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,890
It may have created
a thermal surge

50
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,849
in the galley systems.

51
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,059
<i>Janeway to Tuvok.</i>

52
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,602
<i>Please report to the Bridge.</i>

53
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,604
<i>Mr. Neelix, I'd like you</i>
<i>to join us as well.</i>

54
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,897
Aye, Captain.

55
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,737
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 50126.4.</i>

56
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,363
<i>We have detected</i>
<i>a gaseous anomaly</i>

57
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,991
<i>that contains sirillium--</i>

58
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:40,160
<i>a highly combustible</i>
<i>and versatile energy source.</i>

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,412
<i>We've altered course</i>
<i>to investigate.</i>

60
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,290
Sirillium?

61
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,626
Yes, and possibly
large amounts of it.

62
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,377
If so, we're going
to need to stockpile

63
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,796
as much as we can.

64
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,673
I'd like to convert
Storage Bay 3

65
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,215
into a containment
chamber.

66
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,259
My pantry.
I'm sorry, Neelix.

67
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,386
You're going to have to
make other arrangements.

68
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,388
Of course, Captain.

69
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,182
You know,
if I injected sirillium

70
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,894
into my thermal array,
it might improve cooking time.

71
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,938
Yes, and blow up half your
kitchen in the process.

72
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,483
Sirillium is far more useful
as a warp plasma catalyst.

73
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,985
The gas can also be used

74
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,653
to boost
deflector shield efficiency.

75
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,237
The vultures
are circling.

76
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,615
Well, there's certainly
no shortage of good ideas.

77
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,950
Have all department heads

78
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,702
submit proposals
for sirillium usage.

79
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,120
Aye, Captain.

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,246
TUVOK:
The anomaly is
within visual range.

81
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,581
On screen.

82
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,543
Analysis, Mr. Kim.

83
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,252
It's a class-17 nebula.

84
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,713
I'm detecting
standard amounts

85
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,255
of hydrogen and helium

86
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,550
and 7,000 parts per
million of sirillium.

87
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,177
TORRES:
Captain, I
recommend we use

88
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,261
the Bussard collectors
to gather the sirillium.

89
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,556
They'll cut through that
nebula like ice cream scoops.

90
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,932
PARIS:
I'm picking up

91
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,726
a lot of plasmatic
turbulence in there.

92
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,435
It might be a bumpy ride.

93
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,023
JANEWAY:
Tuvok, can you modify the
shields to compensate?

94
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,652
Tuvok...

95
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,030
Are you all right,
Lieutenant?

96
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,908
I don't know.

97
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,660
I'm experiencing dizziness
and...

98
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,579
disorientation.

99
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,372
Permission to go to Sick Bay.

100
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,208
Granted.

101
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,044
(<i> door opening</i> )

102
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,462
Deck 5.

103
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,799
GIRL:
<i>Help me!</i>

104
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,556
<i>Tuvok!</i>

105
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,599
Help me, Tuvok!

106
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,111
GIRL:
Please, don't let go!

107
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,206
Tuvok!
Don't let me fall!

108
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,962
(<i> panting</i> )

109
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,466
No!

110
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,680
(<i> door opens</i> )

111
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,183
(<i> panting heavily</i> )

112
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,424
I was holding a young girl
by the hand,

113
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,220
trying to prevent her
from falling from a precipice.

114
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,766
I was unable to keep my grip,
and she fell to her death.

115
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,143
And there is more.

116
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,520
I had an emotional response--

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,148
anxiety, fear--

118
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,442
an almost irrational
anger at myself

119
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,568
for letting her fall.

120
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,112
When did that happen?

121
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,821
It never happened.

122
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,241
The girl was unfamiliar

123
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,992
and I've never been
in that situation.

124
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,954
It was me as a child

125
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,581
and it did seem
like a memory,

126
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,126
but I don't recall
the incident.

127
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,544
Well, it was definitely
a traumatic episode.

128
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,713
Your heart rate
accelerated

129
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,382
to 300 beats per minute

130
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,385
your adrenaline levels
rose by 113 percent

131
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,470
and your neuroelectrical
readings

132
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,264
nearly jumped off the scale.

133
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,975
If you were human, I'd say
you had a severe panic attack.

134
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,976
I am not human.

135
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,269
No kidding.

136
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,520
I don't know
what happened to you,

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,773
but there can be any number
of explanations--

138
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,235
hallucination, telepathic
communication from another race,

139
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,694
repressed memory,

140
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,030
momentary contact
with a parallel reality.

141
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,240
Take your pick.

142
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,200
The universe is
such a strange place.

143
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,453
JANEWAY:
I'll have Mr. Kim
examine the sensor logs.

144
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,121
Maybe our proximity
to the nebula

145
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,747
is affecting you somehow.

146
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,708
In the meantime, Lieutenant,
you are free to go.

147
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,669
All of your vital signs
have returned to normal

148
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,963
and I don't see any
residual systemic damage.

149
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:29,509
But I want you to wear
this neurocortical monitor.

150
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,386
In case you have
another episode,

151
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,639
it'll record a complete
encephalographic profile

152
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,516
and alert Sick Bay
at the same time.

153
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,101
A wise precaution,
Doctor.

154
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,269
Thank you.

155
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,779
TUVOK:
Structure.

156
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,614
Logic.

157
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,741
Function.

158
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,494
Control.

159
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:59,247
A structure cannot stand
without a foundation.

160
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,001
Logic is the foundation
of function.

161
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,253
Function...

162
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,423
is the essence of control.

163
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:12,135
I am in control.

164
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,140
I am in control.

165
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,687
(<i> door chimes</i> )

166
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,274
Enter.

167
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,028
Kes.

168
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,364
What is it?

169
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,115
The Doctor wanted
me to adjust your

170
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,452
neurocortical monitor to pick
up additional peptide readings.

171
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,204
I can come back later

172
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,164
if this is a bad time.

173
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,124
No.

174
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,584
You may proceed.

175
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,216
What are you
working on?

176
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,176
It is called a<i> keethara.</i>

177
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,053
<i>Keethara?</i>

178
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,972
What does that mean?

179
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,476
The approximate translation
is "structure of harmony."

180
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,687
It is used as a mediational aid.

181
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,191
Building it
requires precise balance

182
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,817
and spatial acuity.

183
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,862
It helps to focus thought
and refine

184
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,197
mental control.

185
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,493
At the moment, it doesn't
look very harmonious.

186
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,580
No. It does not.

187
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,917
I'm curious.

188
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,462
What does a<i> keethara</i>
look like when it's done?

189
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,880
The form is not predefined.

190
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,050
It is a reflection
of the builder's state of mind.

191
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,596
Thus, it is
different each time.

192
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,722
I'd like to see it
when it's finished.

193
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,979
Well, good night.

194
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,065
Kes...

195
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,236
It's all right.

196
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,447
I understand.

197
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,998
Structure.

198
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,000
Logic.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,127
Function.

200
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,546
Control.

201
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,757
A structure cannot stand

202
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,302
without a foundation.

203
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,639
Logic is the foundation...

204
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,308
of function.

205
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,769
Function is the essence
of control.

206
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,815
I am in control.

207
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,695
I am in... control.

208
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,865
CHAKOTAY:
So how are you feeling
this morning?

209
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,825
If you are referring
to yesterday's incident,

210
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,869
I haven't experienced
any further problems.

211
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,995
I am fit for duty.

212
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,455
I didn't ask
because I'm concerned

213
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,789
about your ability
to perform.

214
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,915
I'm concerned
about you.

215
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,584
There is no need
for concern.

216
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,545
Sorry I asked.

217
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,797
My apologies, Commander.

218
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,633
I am distracted.

219
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,510
I spent 14 hours
last night

220
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,595
in deep meditation
trying to determine

221
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,598
the source of my aberrant
behavior. I could not.

222
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,724
Maybe you should try to forget
about it for a while.

223
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,019
I've found that when you
don't think about a problem,

224
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,563
sometimes the solution
comes to you.

225
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,064
It is difficult
to forget

226
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,066
when you're wearing a
neurocortical monitor

227
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,484
on your parietal bone.

228
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,735
Good point.
Mr. Kim?

229
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,030
I checked all the sensor logs.

230
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,575
There's no sign of anything
emanating from the nebula

231
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,868
that would have
affected Tuvok or<i> Voyager.</i>

232
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,246
Anything unusual
about the nebula itself?

233
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,831
No. It's a standard
class-17.

234
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,500
I suggest we conduct

235
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,126
a tachyon sweep
of the nebula.

236
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,337
It would reveal the presence
of any cloaked ships.

237
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,131
Cloaked ships?

238
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,342
Yes. We should be
extremely cautious

239
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,219
this close to Klingon space.

240
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,388
Tuvok, the Klingon Empire

241
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,473
is on the other side
of the galaxy.

242
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,020
Yes. Yes, you are
right, of course.

243
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm uncertain why I would
make such an obvious error.

244
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,193
Maybe you should go
back to Sick Bay.

245
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,199
Tuvok?

246
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,576
Help me, Tuvok!

247
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,868
Please, don't let go!

248
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,870
No!

249
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,310
I think we may be dealing
with a repressed memory.

250
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,061
The memory engrams
in the dorsal region

251
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,397
of the hippocampus
are being disrupted.

252
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,565
It's causing physical

253
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,567
damage to the
surrounding tissue.

254
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,817
In Vulcan medicine,

255
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,654
this is known
as<i> t'lokan</i> schism.

256
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,071
It means that
the subject

257
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,698
is inhibiting
a traumatic memory,

258
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,992
which is beginning
to resurface.

259
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,952
And that's causing
brain damage?

260
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,454
Strange, I know.

261
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,247
In human subjects,
repressed memories

262
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,374
are nothing more than
psychological traumas,

263
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,959
which can be dealt
with with standard

264
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,795
therapeutic techniques,
but in Vulcans,

265
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,339
there is a physical reaction
to the battle between

266
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,923
the conscious and
the unconscious.

267
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,050
In extreme cases,
the mind of the patient

268
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,428
can literally...
lobotomize itself.

269
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,054
What's the treatment?

270
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,766
There is no medical treatment
for this condition.

271
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,686
Vulcan psychocognitive
research suggests

272
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,563
that the patient initiate
a mind-meld with a family member

273
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,357
and the two of them
attempt to bring

274
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,360
the repressed memory
into the conscious mind.

275
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,695
I'm the closest thing

276
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,697
Tuvok has to a family
member on this ship.

277
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,198
That's why I've
asked you to come.

278
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,616
He has a request
to make of you.

279
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,499
Did the Doctor explain
the situation to you?

280
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,875
Yes.

281
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,295
Tuvok, are you sure it's
the right thing to do?

282
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,006
I don't know
how else to proceed.

283
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,259
The Doctor tells me
that this is a memory.

284
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,262
And yet, no matter
how hard I try,

285
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,681
I cannot remember.

286
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,477
If the Doctor is correct,
if this is an experience

287
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,188
I pushed into
my unconscious mind,

288
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,024
it could be
very dangerous to me,

289
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,318
even life-threatening.

290
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,947
I realize it's asking
a great deal of you, Captain,

291
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,700
and I did consider turning

292
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,744
to one of the Vulcans
on the ship,

293
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,372
but this meld would be
more intimate than most.

294
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,041
A family member
is normally chosen

295
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,837
because of the implicit trust
that usually exists.

296
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,506
On this ship...

297
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,717
I trust you
more than anyone else.

298
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,723
Whatever happens,

299
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,725
I'll be there
for you, Tuvok.

300
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,393
I'll help you
get through this.

301
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,938
I will initiate the meld

302
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,650
and attempt to access
the memory fragment.

303
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,068
Once that has been
accomplished,

304
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,986
you will act
as my<i> pyllora.</i>

305
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,822
Your<i> pyllora.</i>

306
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,784
My guide.
My counselor.

307
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,244
You will help me reconstruct
the memory in its entirety.

308
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,037
And as I am reliving it,

309
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,916
you will help me to
objectify the experience.

310
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,294
By processing the experience
rather than repressing it,

311
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,631
I can begin to overcome
my fear, anger

312
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,132
and the other
emotional responses

313
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,592
and to reintegrate
the memory

314
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,886
into my conscious mind.

315
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,596
When I'm in your memory,

316
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,890
will I actually be
reliving it with you?

317
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,683
No.

318
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,852
I will be the only one
who notices your presence.

319
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,271
You will be an observer
in the memory

320
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,064
but not a participant.

321
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,483
This will give
you the freedom

322
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,067
to guide me
objectively.

323
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,530
When do we start?

324
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,533
I will need time to prepare.

325
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,702
Please return in one hour.

326
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,801
We're ready when
you are, Captain.

327
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,519
Your mind to my mind.

328
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,982
Your thoughts...
to my thoughts.

329
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,818
I am taking us back...

330
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,070
back to the boy
that I was...

331
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,532
the boy lying
on the precipice.

332
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,074
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

333
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,618
MAN:
Return fire!

334
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,871
MAN 2:
They've knocked out
our targeting scanners.

335
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,580
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

336
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,081
TUVOK:
Mr. Valtane...

337
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,209
(<i> alarm continues</i> )

338
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,460
Get away
from that station!

339
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,545
VALTANE:
One more second.

340
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,587
(<i> explosion</i> )

341
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,714
MAN:
Damage report!

342
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,305
Seal that conduit!

343
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,058
Hull breach on Deck 12,
Section 47.

344
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,143
We've lost power
on Decks 5, 6 and 10.

345
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,812
Casualty reports coming in.

346
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,104
19 wounded.

347
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,690
Tuvok, can you see me?

348
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,691
Yes.

349
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,942
Where are we?

350
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,402
My first deep
space assignment

351
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,528
aboard the<i> Excelsior.</i>

352
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,571
Why did you bring us here?

353
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,780
I did not intend to.

354
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,823
Can you take us

355
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,324
to the precipice?
The girl?

356
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,785
That is precisely
what I attempted to do.

357
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,914
There must be some reason
why your mind brought us here.

358
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,373
Maybe this memory
is connected

359
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,708
to the girl in some way.

360
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,459
How long ago is this?

361
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,461
Stardate 9521.

362
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,796
Approximately 80 years ago.

363
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,590
Who are you fighting?

364
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,674
The Klingons.

365
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,133
Klingons?

366
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,802
Before you collapsed
in Engineering,

367
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,971
you thought we were
approaching Klingon space.

368
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,016
Why are you fighting
the Klingons?

369
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,559
This battle was precipitated

370
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,854
by an incident that took
place three days earlier.

371
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,522
All right, Gamma Shift

372
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,899
time to defend
the Federation

373
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,901
against gaseous anomalies.

374
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,569
Gaseous anomalies?

375
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,280
We were charting
a gaseous anomaly on<i> Voyager.</i>

376
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,990
And that's when
my problem began.

377
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,408
That's more than a coincidence.

378
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,785
How are you this
morning, Ensign?

379
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,327
I am well, Commander.
Thank you.

380
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,662
I thought you
might like to see

381
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,330
some of this morning's
com traffic

382
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,832
before you went on duty.

383
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,667
There's a message
from the<i> Yorktown</i>

384
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,461
I think you might
be interested in.

385
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,629
It's from your father.

386
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,213
Thank you.

387
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,841
You're not going to have
time to drink that, you know.

388
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,176
You're due on the
Bridge in five minutes.

389
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,429
It's not for me.
It's for the Captain.

390
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,014
I've observed
that Captain Sulu

391
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,724
drinks a cup of tea
each morning.

392
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,517
I thought he might enjoy
a Vulcan blend.

393
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,394
Oh, I see.

394
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,772
Trying to make Lieutenant
in your first month?

395
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,690
I wish I'd have
thought of that

396
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,109
when I was your age.

397
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,486
Took me three years
just to make Ensign.

398
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,696
I assure you I have
no ulterior motive.

399
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,907
Whatever you
say, Ensign.

400
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,241
See you on the Bridge.

401
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,996
You've never
brought me tea.

402
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,049
Outstanding.

403
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,217
I may have to give
you a promotion.

404
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,303
That was not my
motivation, Captain.

405
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,888
I am not attempting
to curry favor

406
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,348
with you in any way.

407
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,893
Mr. Tuvok, if you're going
to remain on my ship,

408
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,561
you're going
to have to learn

409
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,147
how to appreciate a joke.

410
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,899
And don't tell me Vulcans
don't have a sense of humor

411
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,110
because I know better.

412
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,196
I will... work
on it, sir.

413
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,907
Very good.
And... thanks again.

414
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,370
He doesn't
look anything

415
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,412
like his portrait

416
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,747
at Starfleet
Headquarters.

417
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,415
In the 23rd century,

418
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,335
holographic imaging resolution
was less accurate.

419
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,797
This is a science
station, isn't it?

420
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,550
Yes. I am one of several
junior science officers.

421
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,302
Tuvok, why doesn't
your service record

422
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,345
reflect any of this?

423
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,763
I thought your
first assignment

424
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,306
was aboard the<i> Wyoming.</i>

425
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,851
It's a long story, Captain,
but suffice it to say,

426
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,978
this was my first
Starfleet career.

427
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,604
I was 29 years old.

428
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,939
So, what's happening?

429
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,774
Are we about to encounter
the Klingons?

430
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,109
Not exactly.

431
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,111
The Klingon moon Praxis
is about to explode.

432
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,571
Praxis.

433
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,865
During this period, it was
a primary source of energy

434
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:41,991
for the Klingon Homeworld.

435
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,243
Praxis... yes.

436
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,537
Its destruction would
have lasting repercussions

437
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,082
throughout the Quadrant,
and it led to the first

438
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,000
Federation-Klingon
peace treaty.

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,168
That is correct.

440
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,460
But what does all
this have to do

441
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,962
with the girl
on the precipice?

442
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,928
(<i> beeping</i> )

443
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,103
I have an energy wave at 240
degrees, mark 6 port, sir.

444
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,437
Visual.

445
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,066
My... God!

446
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,947
Shields! Shields!

447
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,535
(<i> yelling</i> )

448
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,290
MAN:
She is not
answering the helm.

449
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,208
Starboard thrusters.

450
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,333
Turn her<i> into</i> the wave.

451
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,044
Aye, sir.

452
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,841
Quarter impulse power.

453
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,135
Damage report.

454
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,137
MAN:
Checking all
systems, Captain.

455
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,980
Don't tell me
that was any meteor shower.

456
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,106
Negative, sir.

457
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,274
The subspace shock wave

458
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,526
originated
at bearing 323 mark 75.

459
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,070
Location...

460
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,362
It's Praxis, sir.

461
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,322
It's a Klingon moon.

462
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,324
Praxis...

463
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,743
is their key energy
production facility.

464
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,163
So, what happened?
Did you go to Praxis?

465
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,372
No. We were warned off
by the Klingons

466
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,167
and resumed
our survey mission.

467
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,375
However, two days later,

468
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,128
we learned that two
Starfleet officers

469
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,421
were accused of murdering
the Klingon Chancellor.

470
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,631
They were brought back

471
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,549
to the Klingon Homeworld
to stand trial.

472
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,801
Captain Sulu had served

473
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,594
under both officers
for many years,

474
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,596
and he felt
an intense loyalty to them.

475
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,978
Helm, set a course
for Kronos, maximum warp.

476
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,855
Take us through
the Azure Nebula.

477
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,731
That should conceal
our approach.

478
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,774
Aye, sir.

479
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,775
I don't get it.

480
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,860
What's going on?

481
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,153
He's about to
attempt a rescue

482
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,697
of Captain Kirk
and Dr. McCoy.

483
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,282
As you can see,

484
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,825
everyone seemed
perfectly willing

485
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,493
to go along with this
breach of orders.

486
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,829
However, I felt
differently.

487
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,082
Captain, am I correct
in assuming

488
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,335
that you have decided to embark
on a rescue mission?

489
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,669
That's right.

490
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,504
Do you have a problem
with that, Ensign?

491
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,755
I do.

492
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,549
It is a direct violation
of our orders

493
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,634
from Starfleet Command,
and it could precipitate

494
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,887
an armed conflict
between the Klingon Empire

495
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,096
and the Federation.

496
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,890
Objection noted.

497
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,390
Resume your station.

498
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,809
Sir, as a Starfleet officer,

499
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,062
it is my duty
to formally protest.

500
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,521
Tuvok...

501
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,649
A pretty bold statement
for an Ensign

502
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,528
with only... two months
space duty under his belt?

503
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,864
I am aware
of my limited experience,

504
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,616
but I am also very much aware
of Starfleet regulations

505
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,744
and my obligation
to carry them out.

506
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,579
That's enough.

507
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,331
Ensign, you're relieved.

508
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,415
I'm sorry about
this, Captain.

509
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,336
I assure you it will
not happen again.

510
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,339
Ensign,
you're absolutely right,

511
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,799
but you're also...

512
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,634
absolutely wrong.

513
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,511
You'll find
that more happens

514
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,097
on the Bridge
of a starship than just

515
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:54,725
carrying out orders
and observing regulations.

516
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,602
There's a sense of loyalty

517
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,437
to the men and women
you serve with...

518
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,607
a sense of family.

519
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,068
Those two men
on trial--

520
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:07,280
I served with them
for a long time.

521
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,741
I owe them my life
a dozen times over,

522
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,285
and right now,
they're in trouble

523
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,328
and I'm going to help them.

524
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,039
Let the regulations be damned.

525
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,418
Sir, that is a most illogical
line of reasoning.

526
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,586
You better believe it.

527
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,589
Helm, engage.

528
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,469
You know, you did
the right thing.

529
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,264
Perhaps.

530
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,818
CREWMAN:
Captain, we're approaching
the Azure Nebula.

531
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,986
SULU:
On screen.

532
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,077
Tuvok...

533
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,623
that nebula...

534
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,417
it looks very similar
to the one

535
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,169
we observed on<i> Voyager.</i>

536
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,546
Help me, Tuvok!

537
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,925
Please, don't let go!

538
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,884
No!

539
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,052
(<i> Tuvok gasps</i> )

540
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,180
(<i> instrument beeping</i> )

541
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,555
50 milligrams cordrazine.

542
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,358
DOCTOR:
There was a sudden disruption
in his hippocampus.

543
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,608
Luckily,
he was in Sick Bay

544
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,444
or he'd be in a
coma right now.

545
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,029
That's the good news.

546
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,989
The bad news is that
his synaptic pathways

547
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,615
are continuing to degrade.

548
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,951
If the repressed memory
keeps resurfacing on its own,

549
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,744
it's going to
cause more and more damage.

550
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,579
His entire neural structure will
collapse,

551
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,914
resulting in brain death.

552
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,875
We were just starting
to make some progress.

553
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,461
We finally accessed
the repressed memory.

554
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:49,798
I saw Tuvok as a boy...

555
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,342
and the girl
on the precipice.

556
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,010
Can I talk to him?

557
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,136
Not yet.

558
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,138
He suffered a severe
neural trauma,

559
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,224
so I'm keeping him sedated
for the next few hours.

560
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,309
I'll let you know when
it's safe to revive him.

561
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,906
(<i> door chimes</i> )

562
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,533
Come in.

563
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,992
Ah, Ensign, what
have you found?

564
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,911
I don't see any connection
between this nebula

565
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,414
and the one the<i> Excelsior</i>
saw 80 years ago.

566
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:25,418
This one's a class-17,
while theirs was an 11.

567
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,669
Both contained trace
amounts of sirillium,

568
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,046
but that's about all.

569
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,630
But they do<i> look</i> similar.

570
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,342
To the naked eye,
but not to sensors.

571
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,553
Technically, they're
very different.

572
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,305
You know, I've been
talking to the Doctor,

573
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,641
and he tells me it's not
unusual for a repressed memory

574
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,229
to resurface because
of a smell or a visual detail.

575
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,023
Maybe the visual similarities
between the two nebulas

576
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,276
simply triggered Tuvok's
memory of the<i> Excelsior.</i>

577
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,404
Well, what about the
memory of the little girl?

578
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,573
What does she have to do
with Tuvok's experiences

579
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,283
on board Sulu's ship?

580
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,867
The<i> Excelsior</i> seemed

581
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,370
so far removed from
that childhood incident.

582
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,039
Who knows what goes on
in a Vulcan's mind?

583
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,791
Maybe there is no connection

584
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,876
and going back to the memory
of the<i> Excelsior</i>

585
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,670
was just an accident, a stray
thought Tuvok was having

586
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,006
because of the similarities
between the two nebulas.

587
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,674
You may be right.

588
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,470
Nevertheless, I've been
studying the<i> Excelsior</i> logs.

589
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,555
What do they say?

590
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,014
Unfortunately,
they don't say

591
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,266
anything at all.

592
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,476
Nothing?

593
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,769
It would seem that
Captain Sulu decided

594
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,564
not to enter that journey
into his official log.

595
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,441
The day's entry makes
some cryptic remark

596
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,485
about the ship being damaged
in a gaseous anomaly

597
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,446
and needing repairs
but nothing else.

598
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,615
You mean,
he falsified his logs.

599
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,201
It was a very different
time, Mr. Kim.

600
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,037
Captain Sulu, Captain
Kirk, Dr. McCoy--

601
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,747
they all belonged
to a different breed

602
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,458
of Starfleet officer.

603
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,293
Imagine the era they lived in--

604
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,588
the Alpha Quadrant
still largely unexplored,

605
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,881
humanity on verge
of war with Klingons,

606
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,259
Romulans hiding
behind every nebula.

607
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,011
Even the technology
we take for granted

608
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,180
was still in its
early stages.

609
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,349
No plasma weapons,
no multiphasic shields.

610
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,767
Their ships were
half as fast.

611
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,228
No replicators,
no holodecks.

612
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,729
You know, ever since I took

613
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,857
Starfleet history
at the Academy,

614
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,567
I always wondered
what it would be like

615
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,693
to live in those days.

616
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:19,198
Space must have seemed a
whole lot bigger back then.

617
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,661
It's not surprising they had
to bend the rules a little.

618
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:27,164
They were a little slower
to invoke the Prime Directive

619
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,542
and a little quicker
to pull their phasers.

620
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,043
Of course,
the whole bunch of them

621
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,253
would be booted
out of Starfleet today,

622
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,713
but I have to admit--

623
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,300
I would have loved to ride
shotgun at least once

624
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,093
with a group of officers
like that.

625
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,803
DOCTOR:
<i>Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.</i>

626
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,055
Go ahead, Doctor.

627
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,806
<i>I'm ready to revive Mr. Tuvok.</i>

628
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,807
Acknowledged.

629
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,975
I'm on my way.

630
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,444
Several hours
after we entered the nebula,

631
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,405
we were ambushed by Klingons.

632
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,448
A battle ensued,
and we were forced

633
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,242
to abort our rescue mission.

634
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,910
Do any of those events

635
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,496
seem related to the girl
in any way?

636
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,831
No. If there is
a connection,

637
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,375
I am not aware of it.

638
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,253
I suggest we attempt
another mind-meld

639
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,714
and try again to access
my memory of the girl.

640
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:17,715
Agreed.

641
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:18,757
Doctor.

642
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:33,188
Your mind to my mind.

643
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,734
Your thoughts
to my thoughts.

644
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:39,278
I am taking us back--

645
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,406
back to the boy
that I was...

646
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,118
the boy lying
on the precipice.

647
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,870
RAND:
Hull breach on Deck 12,
Section 47.

648
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,290
Tuvok, we're back
in the battle

649
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,709
with the Klingons again,
80 years ago.

650
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,711
I am at a loss to
explain, Captain.

651
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,837
But it's hard to accept
this as a coincidence.

652
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,089
Agreed.

653
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,882
I want to go back
to the moment

654
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,593
when you first saw
the nebula.

655
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:03,927
What happened?

656
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,804
Captain Sulu estimated

657
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,640
it would take
approximately five hours

658
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,016
to traverse the nebula
and enter Klingon space.

659
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,686
He decided my shift
needed some rest,

660
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,271
so we returned to
the crew quarters.

661
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,148
I attempted to
get some sleep.

662
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,025
However, my bunkmate
Dmitri Valtane,

663
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,778
felt the need to discuss
our situation.

664
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,738
Hey.

665
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,615
Tuvok.

666
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,408
Are you asleep?

667
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,618
No.

668
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:28,910
Me neither.

669
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,788
I can't believe
we're going to do this.

670
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,081
I didn't think the Captain
had it in him.

671
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,416
Had what in him?

672
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,960
You know--
the guts to defy an order

673
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,504
and run off
on some rescue mission

674
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,255
to save old friends.

675
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,424
I take it from the tone
of your voice,

676
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,801
that you admire this trait.

677
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,469
Well, yeah.

678
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,053
It's courageous.

679
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,597
It is illogical
and reckless,

680
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,766
which I attempted to point
out to him on the Bridge.

681
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,892
Oh, come on, Tuvok.

682
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,438
Isn't it more fun than
charting gaseous anomalies?

683
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,775
The human fascination with
fun has led to many tragedies

684
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,610
in your short
but violent history.

685
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,362
One wonders how
your race has survived

686
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,405
having so much fun.

687
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:09,743
Ooh. Vulcans--
you guys need to relax.

688
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,454
No. I will not relax.

689
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,414
Ever since I entered
the Academy,

690
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,125
I've had to endure the
egocentric nature of humanity.

691
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,379
You believe that everyone in
the galaxy should be like you,

692
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,589
that we should all share
your sense of humor

693
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,132
and your human values.

694
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,676
Well, if you hate
it here so much,

695
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,595
why'd you join Starfleet
in the first place?

696
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,597
I joined under pressure
from my parents,

697
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,058
but I've already decided
to resign my commission

698
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,852
once this assignment
is complete.

699
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,186
(<i> sighs</i> )

700
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,522
Well, your loss.

701
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:46,446
Tuvok, did you
really mean that?

702
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,037
At this point
in my life, yes.

703
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,122
My experiences
at the Academy

704
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,542
and on board the<i> Excelsior</i>
were not pleasant.

705
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,918
I knew you
left Starfleet

706
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,128
for over 50 years,
but I never knew why.

707
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,005
I didn't realize
it was because

708
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,549
of a conflict
with humans.

709
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,594
My perceptions of humanity
and Starfleet

710
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,303
were undoubtedly
colored by the fact

711
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,222
that I did not want to be
here in the first place.

712
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,892
Your parents really forced
you to go to the Academy?

713
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,727
It was their wish

714
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,104
and I felt an obligation
to fulfill it.

715
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,315
What did you do
during those 50 years?

716
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,150
I'd returned to Vulcan

717
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,278
where I spent several
years in seclusion,

718
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,405
immersing myself
in the<i> Kolinahr--</i>

719
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:32,242
a rigorous discipline
intended to purge all emotions.

720
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,953
I wanted to attain a state
of pure and total logic.

721
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,538
What happened?

722
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,665
Unfortunately,
six years into my studies,

723
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,751
I began the<i> Pon farr.</i>

724
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,043
I took a mate.

725
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,336
T'Pel.
Yes. 

726
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,298
We decided to raise
a family together.

727
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,759
So I chose to
postpone my studies.

728
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,344
And what brought you
back to Starfleet?

729
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,222
Raising children of my own
made me appreciate

730
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,309
what my parents
experienced raising me,

731
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,894
and I came to realize

732
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,771
that the decisions
I made as a young man

733
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,231
were not always
in my best interest.

734
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,485
I understood their decision
to send me to the Academy

735
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,528
and that there
were many things

736
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,156
I could learn from humans
and other species.

737
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,284
So I decided to expand
my knowledge of the galaxy.

738
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,579
Starfleet provided
that opportunity.

739
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,582
Well, I'm glad you
had a change of heart.

740
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,208
As am I, Captain.

741
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,253
Although, "heart" had
very little to do with it.

742
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,213
It was a logical decision.

743
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,590
I'm sure it was.

744
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,800
MALE:
<i>Red Alert.</i>

745
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,885
<i>All hands to battle stations.</i>

746
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,428
What's going on?

747
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,722
I thought we were still five
hours from Klingon space.

748
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,183
A Klingon battle cruiser
de-cloaked inside the nebula.

749
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,768
At this moment,
they were firing

750
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,728
concussive charges
across our bow.

751
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,786
RAND:
We're being
hailed, Captain.

752
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,662
On screen.

753
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,622
KANG:
<i>Mr. Sulu,</i>

754
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:04,584
<i>I see they have finally given</i>
<i>you the Captaincy you deserve.</i>

755
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,211
SULU:
Thank you, Kang.

756
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,381
<i>Do not let it end prematurely.</i>

757
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,634
Kang, we've been
on a survey mission

758
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,344
studying this nebula.

759
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,430
Our navigation system
malfunctioned

760
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,225
and I'm afraid we got lost.

761
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,520
As soon as we've completed
repairs, we'll be on our way.

762
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,315
<i>We'd be happy to escort you</i>
<i>back to Federation space.</i>

763
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,067
Very generous of you.

764
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,694
But we can manage.

765
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,946
<i>I insist.</i>

766
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:36,658
Actually, an escort
would be welcome.

767
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,911
We'd hate to lose our way again.

768
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:43,289
<i>Bring your ship about,</i>
<i>bearing 181 mark 2.</i>

769
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,500
Nice to see you again, Kang.

770
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,756
VALTANE:
Captain Sulu?

771
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,049
Man your station, Lieutenant.

772
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,217
We're not giving up just yet.

773
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,011
Helm, come about.

774
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:06,855
Tactical status.

775
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,481
They have their
forward disruptors

776
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,524
trained on us, sir.

777
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,278
Ensign Tuvok,

778
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,906
what is the composition
of this nebula?

779
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,657
Primarily oxygen and argon

780
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,787
with traces of theta-xenon,
fluorine and sirillium gas.

781
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,455
Sirillium?

782
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,749
That's a highly combustible
substance, isn't it?

783
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,875
Affirmative.

784
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,001
Is there any
way we could

785
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,044
ignite the sirillium?

786
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,253
If we modulated

787
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,380
a positron beam
to a subspace frequency,

788
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,340
it would trigger
a thermochemical reaction

789
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,759
in the sirillium.

790
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,804
Like tossing a match
into a pool of gasoline.

791
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,388
Would their shields

792
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,015
withstand
the blast?

793
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,183
Yes. But their sensors
and tactical systems

794
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,227
would be disrupted
for several seconds.

795
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,063
That's all
the time we need.

796
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,357
Tuvok, modulate a positron beam
and stand by.

797
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,861
We'll ignite the sirillium
the instant we clear the nebula.

798
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,906
Helm, prepare to engage
maximum warp on my command.

799
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,532
Aye, sir.

800
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,367
All hands, this is the Captain.

801
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,162
Secure stations
and batten down the hatches.

802
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,790
The positron beam
is charged and ready.

803
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,126
On my mark, Ensign.

804
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,003
We're clearing
the nebula.

805
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,505
Mr. Tuvok, light the match.

806
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,975
The Klingon ship's
been disabled.

807
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,351
They're not
pursuing, sir.

808
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,894
Helm, set a course

809
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,105
for Kronos.
Engage.

810
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,234
Commander Rand,
I want you...

811
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,945
Sir, long-range sensors
are detecting

812
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,280
three Klingon battle cruisers
on an intercept course.

813
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,949
They're arming
torpedoes.

814
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,743
Heading, sir?

815
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,328
Maintain course.

816
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,919
Return fire!

817
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,921
They've knocked out
our targeting scanners.

818
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,631
Switch to manual!

819
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,177
Mr. Valtane, there's a rupture

820
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,137
in the plasma conduit
behind your console.

821
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,471
Get away from that station.

822
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,890
One more second.

823
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,807
Dmitri, you must...

824
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,100
(<i> yelling</i> )

825
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,522
Bridge to Sick Bay,
medical emergency!

826
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,360
Tuvok...

827
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,492
Tuvok!

828
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,285
Help!

829
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,997
Don't let me fall!

830
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,750
No!

831
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,543
KES:
Doctor,

832
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,878
what's happening?

833
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,005
Their memory engrams
are destabilizing.

834
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,174
Something must be going
wrong with the mind-meld.

835
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,634
I'm going to bring
them out of it.

836
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,099
KES:
It's not working.

837
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,141
Their neural patterns

838
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,601
appear to be
locked together.

839
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,019
I can't break the meld.

840
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,608
The damage to his synaptic
patterns is accelerating.

841
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,568
At this rate, he'll be
brain dead in 20 minutes.

842
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,278
Get me a cortical
stimulator!

843
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,654
I saw her again, Tuvok--

844
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,697
the girl.

845
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,366
When Valtane
died just now,

846
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,619
it seemed to cause
the memory to resurface.

847
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,205
What is it?

848
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,249
Something's gone wrong
with the mind-meld.

849
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:14,834
Who the hell are you?

850
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,175
Intruder alert!

851
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,426
Get security up here!

852
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,137
What's happening?
Why can he see me?

853
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,013
SULU:
I asked you a question.
Who are you

854
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,431
and what are you
doing on my ship?

855
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,475
It's an indication
the rate of deterioration

856
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,768
in my brain has increased.

857
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,812
At advanced stages
of a<i> t'lokan</i> schism,

858
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,023
memories and thought processes
become distorted and confused.

859
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,566
Ensign, do you know this woman?

860
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,943
I will break the meld,
Captain.

861
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,319
No, don't.

862
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,155
I think we're getting
close to something.

863
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,698
Everything seems to be centered
around the death of Valtane.

864
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,533
(<i> rumbling</i> )

865
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,620
Direct hit on the port bow.
Shields down to 20 percent.

866
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,497
Losing atmosphere
on Decks 5, 6 and 7.

867
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,874
I'll reroute auxiliary power
to structural integrity.

868
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,209
(<i> rumbling</i> )

869
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,044
Maybe something happened
in that moment

870
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,254
between the two of you--

871
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,006
some detail you
aren't remembering.

872
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,757
I want you to try
and replay those events

873
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,925
one more time.

874
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,969
I will try,
but I must point out

875
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,305
that if my neural structures
collapse during the meld,

876
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,056
you will suffer
brain damage as well.

877
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,516
I understand.

878
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,600
(<i> rumbling</i> )

879
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,269
Take those two to the brig.

880
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,355
Captain, if we replay those
events and they see you,

881
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,857
it will disrupt
the memory again.

882
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,441
Then we've got
to find a way

883
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,235
to make me
inconspicuous.

884
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,490
All right, Gamma Shift,

885
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,952
time to defend the Federation
against gaseous anomalies.

886
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,078
(<i> crew chuckling</i> )

887
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,121
How are you, Ensign?

888
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,498
Who are you?

889
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,503
We could have
just asked her.

890
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,339
Asking female officers
for their clothing

891
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,923
could lead
to misunderstanding.

892
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,969
DOCTOR:
I've programmed
a cortical stimulator

893
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,055
to emit thoron radiation.

894
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,224
We'll bombard his
telepathic cortex.

895
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,809
That should be enough
to terminate the meld.

896
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,435
We'll begin with
a 20-kilodyne burst

897
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,355
of five-second
duration on my mark.

898
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,190
Now.

899
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,567
It's working.

900
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,777
Their neural patterns
are starting to separate.

901
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,779
(<i> console beeps</i> )

902
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,989
My god.

903
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,115
What is it?

904
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,992
That's Tuvok's
memory engram.

905
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,493
That's the Captain's.

906
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,871
But this red pattern
seems to be another engram.

907
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,873
A third memory engram.
How's that possible?

908
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,166
It's not--

909
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,043
which means it can't
really be an engram.

910
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,463
From the neurochemical
modulation,

911
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,591
I'd say it's something
masquerading as an engram.

912
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,009
The way viruses
sometimes mimic

913
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,468
certain blood
factors to avoid

914
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,012
being destroyed
by antibodies?

915
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,347
So you're saying
it's a virus.

916
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,681
I think so.

917
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,183
The thoron radiation

918
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,602
must have caused it
to manifest itself.

919
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,939
Increasing the radiation level
should destroy it.

920
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,857
Go to 40 kilodynes,
ten second burst.

921
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,109
Now!

922
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,652
The Klingon ship's
been disabled, sir.

923
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,779
They're no longer pursuing.

924
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,282
Helm, set a course
for Kronos.

925
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,490
Engage.

926
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,203
Who's at communications?

927
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,247
Commander Rand is supposed
to be on duty, sir.

928
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,415
Where is she?

929
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,749
Sir, long-range sensors

930
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,793
are detecting three
Klingon battle cruisers

931
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,628
on an intercept course.

932
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,004
They're arming torpedoes.

933
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,047
Maintain course.

934
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,967
Return fire!

935
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,594
VALTANE:
They've knocked out
our targeting scanners, sir.

936
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,929
SULU:
Switch to manual.

937
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,225
Mr. Valtane,
there's a rupture

938
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,352
in the plasma conduit
behind your console.

939
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,561
Get away from that station.

940
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,646
One more second.

941
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,563
Dmitri, you must...

942
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,856
(<i> yelling</i> )

943
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,070
It's about to happen.

944
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,863
Try to remember
every detail

945
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,907
about the next few seconds.

946
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,992
<i>Concentrate.</i>

947
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,744
Tuvok...

948
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,832
GIRL:
<i>Help me!</i>

949
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:41,833
Help me, Tuvok!

950
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,251
I saw her, Tuvok.

951
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,961
I saw the girl.

952
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:45,920
Stay with it.

953
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,088
(<i> sighs</i> )

954
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,298
I am trying.

955
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,925
But my mind is weakening.

956
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,011
This is our last chance.

957
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,096
Take us to the precipice.

958
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,473
Concentrate.

959
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,266
Take us to the girl.

960
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,271
DOCTOR:
It's working.

961
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,856
The mind-meld
is almost broken

962
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,066
and the radiation appears
to be killing the virus.

963
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,401
Increase thoron
levels to...

964
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,445
(<i> console beeping</i> )

965
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,405
The virus
is migrating.

966
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,573
It's embedding itself
in the Captain's brain.

967
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,658
Cortical stimulator.

968
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,245
GIRL:
<i>Kathryn!</i>

969
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,206
Help me, Kathryn, please!

970
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,207
Don't let go.

971
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,875
Don't let me fall!

972
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,378
No!

973
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,837
Program a 50-kilodyne burst

974
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,131
five-second duration
on my mark. Now.

975
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,429
Help me, Tuvok!

976
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,597
The virus protein structures
are breaking down.

977
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,640
It's dying.

978
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,226
Increase thoron radiation

979
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,602
to 80 kilodynes
15 seconds. Now.

980
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,022
GIRL:
Help me, Dmitri!

981
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,065
Please, don't let go!

982
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,316
Don't let me fall!

983
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,442
DOCTOR:
Again!

984
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,443
Don't let me fall!

985
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,987
No!

986
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,531
No!

987
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,741
No!

988
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:57,867
No!

989
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,914
No!

990
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,264
DOCTOR:
It's clearly a viral
parasite of some kind,

991
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,558
but its origin and
genome classification

992
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,975
are not on record.

993
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:23,976
We were able to kill it

994
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,353
using thoron radiation.

995
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,729
What<i> do</i> you know
about it?

996
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,773
The virus thrives
on peptides

997
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,316
generated in the brain.

998
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,776
It evades the body's
immune system

999
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,446
by disguising itself
as a memory engram.

1000
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,072
Apparently,
the parasite used

1001
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,865
the childhood memory
of the falling girl

1002
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,075
as camouflage.

1003
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,244
Creating a false
memory so traumatic

1004
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,620
that the mind
would repress it

1005
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,871
and that's where

1006
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,873
it would live, in
person after person,

1007
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,375
hiding in a part
of the brain

1008
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,626
that the conscious mind

1009
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,211
would want to avoid
at all costs.

1010
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,422
When it sensed
the death of the host,

1011
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:54,090
it would leave
to find another.

1012
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,551
That's why it migrated
from Valtane to me.

1013
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,927
KES:
What about the girl?

1014
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,554
Did she ever really exist

1015
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,639
or did the organism
invent the memory?

1016
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,058
Memory is a tricky thing.

1017
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,103
If it was a real event,
it's been buried and copied

1018
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,605
and twisted so many times

1019
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,731
there's no way to tell
what really happened.

1020
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,650
Thank you, Doctor.

1021
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,741
I'm curious.

1022
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,910
Did the<i> Excelsior</i> ever
save Kirk and McCoy?

1023
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,370
Not directly.

1024
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,081
We were forced to retreat
back to Federation space.

1025
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,960
As usual, Captain Kirk provided
his own means of escape.

1026
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,837
But we did play
a pivotal role

1027
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,464
at the subsequent battle
at Khitomer.

1028
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,258
Mr. Tuvok, if I didn't
know you better,

1029
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,552
I'd say you miss those
days on the<i> Excelsior.</i>

1030
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,012
On the contrary.

1031
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,556
I do not experience
feelings of nostalgia.

1032
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,807
But there are times

1033
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,643
when I think back
to those days

1034
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:49,854
of meeting Kirk, Spock,
and the others,

1035
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,106
and I am pleased
that I was part of it.

1036
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,608
In a funny way,

1037
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,152
I feel like I was
a part of it, too.

1038
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,531
Then perhaps you can be
nostalgic for both of us.
