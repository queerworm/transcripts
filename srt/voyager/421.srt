00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:17,601
COMPUTER:
<i>0600 hours.</i>
<i>Regeneration cycle complete.</i>

2
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:23,816
Daily log, Seven of Nine,
Stardate 15781.2.

3
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,443
Today, Ensign Kim and I

4
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,362
will conduct
a comprehensive diagnostic

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,113
of the aft sensor array.

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,534
I have allocated three hours,
20 minutes for the task,

7
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,410
and an additional 17 minutes

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,455
for Ensign Kim's usual
conversational digressions.

9
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,499
I am scheduled to take
a nutritional supplement

10
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,336
at 1500 hours, engage in one
hour of cardiovascular activity.

11
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,838
Then, I intend to review a text

12
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:49,758
the doctor recommended entitled,
<i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

13
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,177
He believes it will have
educational value.

14
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,721
End log.

15
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,270
I'll get this.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,314
Don't give me
any hints.

17
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,483
I have no intention
of doing so.

18
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,151
Ensign.

19
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,528
Hi, Seven.

20
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,990
Are you ready to begin
our sensor diagnostic?

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,533
Is it 0600 already?

22
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,618
We've been playing
all night.

23
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,286
Vulcan Kal-Toh.

24
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,830
For a game of logic,

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,582
you'd be surprised at
how addictive it is.

26
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,751
Give me a few more minutes
to figure this out.

27
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,669
You should attend
to your duties, Ensign.

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,171
I'll accept
your forfeit.

29
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,757
No way.

30
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,300
This is the closest
I've ever come to beating you,

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,928
and I'm not giving up now.

32
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,901
Impressive.

33
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,569
Elementary
spatial harmonics.

34
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,071
Are you ready now?

35
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,865
Yeah. Sure.

36
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,292
I would have
gotten that.

37
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,839
Is there anything
you don't know?

38
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,091
I was Borg.

39
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,383
"I was Borg."

40
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,635
That's what you always say.

41
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,428
But what does it mean?

42
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,764
You have the knowledge
of 10,000 species in your head?

43
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,181
Not exactly.

44
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,433
Each drone's experiences

45
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,018
are processed by the collective.

46
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,312
Only useful information
is retained.

47
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,730
Still, that
probably makes you

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,732
the most intelligent
human being alive.

49
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,984
Probably.

50
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,903
So what do you need
the rest of us for?

51
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,948
Forget I asked.

52
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,324
What was that?

53
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,909
We just dropped out of warp.

54
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,494
CHAKOTAY:
What's the problem?

55
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,496
We were hit
by some kind of shock wave.

56
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,747
Source?

57
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,791
Checking.

58
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,001
Hold on.

59
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,711
I just lost all
my sensor readings.

60
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,880
The computer is bringing up
some kind of message,

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,172
but I can't access it.

62
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,675
You'd better take a
look at this.

63
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,926
I can see it.

64
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,176
What is it?

65
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,304
I have no idea.

66
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,932
My command codes aren't working.

67
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,392
The computer says
I have insufficient clearance

68
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,355
to access the message.

69
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,982
We can't function like this.

70
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:12,191
I'm going to get Harry up here
to trace the source.

71
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,443
Don't do anything.

72
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,736
I'll take care of this.

73
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,496
Send all sensor data about the
particle wave to my ready room.

74
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,748
Tom, disengage engines
and hold position here.

75
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,291
CHAKOTAY:
Captain...

76
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,668
what's going on?

77
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,922
I can't explain right now.

78
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,800
Don't discuss any of this
with the rest of the crew.

79
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,178
I'll have further instructions
for you soon.

80
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,317
( title theme playing )

81
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,753
Computer, seal the doors
to this room.

82
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,047
No entry
without my authorization.

83
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,926
COMPUTER:
<i>Doors are sealed.</i>

84
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,344
Access secured data file
Omega One.

85
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,639
COMPUTER:
<i>Voiceprint confirmed.</i>

86
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,808
<i>State clearance code.</i>

87
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:55,647
Janeway-1153-red,
Clearance Level Ten.

88
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,107
<i>Confirmed.</i>

89
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,484
<i>Sensors have detected</i>
<i>the Omega phenomenon</i>

90
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,362
<i>within 1.2 lightyears</i>
<i>of this vessel.</i>

91
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,490
<i>Implement the Omega Directive</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

92
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,950
( Sighing )

93
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,452
<i>All other priorities</i>
<i>have been rescinded.</i>

94
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,252
Display sensor data.

95
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,175
I've been informed this
is a highly classified mission.

96
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,802
Information will be provided on
a need-to-know basis,

97
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,012
Captain's orders.

98
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,014
Classified? By who?

99
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,974
We're 60,000 light years
from Starfleet.

100
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,267
Like I said,
need-to-know.

101
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,727
B'Elanna, she wants
you to install

102
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,938
multiphasic shielding
around the warp core.

103
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,899
I've never seen this shield
configuration.

104
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,942
I'd like to run a couple
of computer simulations

105
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,236
to make sure
it's stable.

106
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,444
No time.

107
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,030
She needs this
done by 1100 hours.

108
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,032
1100? I don't think
that's possible.

109
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,367
Make it possible.

110
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,993
Are we attempting to
protect the core

111
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,786
from some form
of subspace radiation?

112
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,580
I don't know
any more than you do.

113
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,124
It will be difficult to complete
the task without more data.

114
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,667
The data you've got
will have to do.

115
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,961
Tom, start modifying
a shuttlecraft to withstand

116
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,881
extreme thermal stress,
12,000 kelvins at least.

117
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,258
Aye, Sir.

118
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,009
Does all this have
anything to to do with

119
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,095
that secret message that
the captain received?

120
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,430
What have you heard?
Rumors, mostly.

121
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,182
Janeway's been locked
in her ready room

122
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,600
for the last 16 hours.

123
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,853
Something about
an Omega Directive.

124
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,188
Omega?

125
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,439
Ring a bell?

126
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,691
Look, the speculation
ends right here.

127
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,693
Now, I expect you
to carry out your assignments

128
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,570
with a minimum of gossip,
understood?

129
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,821
I know it's hard
not to wonder.

130
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,282
Frankly, I'm
curious myself,

131
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,242
but the Captain was
very adamant about this.

132
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,410
Get going.

133
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,703
The Captain
wants to see you.

134
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,789
I thought she might.

135
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,968
( door beeping )

136
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,386
Come in.

137
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,475
What do you know about
the Omega Directive?

138
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,852
Everything you do,
most likely.

139
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,147
I thought as much.

140
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,691
If the Borg assimilated
Starfleet Captains,

141
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,153
you would possess
all of their knowledge.

142
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,071
That's correct.

143
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,324
Do you intend to
carry out the directive?

144
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,159
Yes.

145
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,786
Then sensors have
detected the molecule.

146
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,538
So it would appear,
but we have to confirm it.

147
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,999
"We"?

148
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,627
You're going to help me
carry out the directive.

149
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,963
Protocol forbids me
from discussing this mission

150
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,090
with any of my crew,

151
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,550
but since you already
know about it,

152
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,094
my choice is to
either work with you,

153
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,722
or...confine you
to quarters.

154
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,392
Perhaps you should
do the latter.

155
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,893
I will not help
you destroy Omega.

156
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,437
It should be harnessed.

157
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,604
That's impossible.

158
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,024
The Borg believe
otherwise.

159
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,317
Explain.

160
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,277
On one occasion
we were able to

161
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,112
create a single
Omega molecule.

162
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,322
We kept it stable

163
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,948
for one-trillionth
of a nanosecond

164
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,493
before it destabilized.

165
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,286
We didn't have enough
boronite ore left

166
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,662
to synthesize more,

167
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,955
but the knowledge
we gained

168
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,959
allowed us to...
refine our theories.

169
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,882
The Borg have
been waiting

170
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,884
for the chance
to test them out.

171
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,677
Yes.

172
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,138
But we never found
another source of the ore...

173
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,182
until now.

174
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,730
Sorry...

175
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,023
but if someone
out there is

176
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,274
experimenting
with Omega

177
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,693
I'm under orders
to stop them.

178
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,446
Otherwise, this entire
Quadrant would be at risk.

179
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:36,284
Those orders are the result of
Starfleet's ignorance and fear.

180
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,785
I can alleviate your ignorance.

181
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,329
As for your fear--

182
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,500
sometimes fear should be
respected, Seven. Tell me...

183
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,629
how many Borg were sacrificed
during this experiment?

184
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,300
Twenty nine vessels, 600,000
drones, but that is irrelevant.

185
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,843
Not to me, not to my crew,

186
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,845
and not to the people
who live in this Quadrant.

187
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,764
I'm going to neutralize
this threat, Seven,

188
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,933
with or without
your help.

189
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,398
I will assist you.
You will?

190
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,607
I have waited many years

191
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,776
to observe this
molecule firsthand.

192
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,279
I will not deny myself
that experience.

193
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,659
All right.

194
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,874
Go back to your cargo bay.

195
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,627
Assemble all the data
you have about Omega.

196
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:32,215
I'll expect a report
within the hour.

197
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,425
I didn't realize you had

198
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,302
such a strong
scientific curiosity.

199
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,305
Not curiosity...

200
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,847
desire.

201
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,849
Desire?

202
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:46,104
Omega is infinitely complex,
yet harmonious.

203
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,440
To the Borg
it represents perfection.

204
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,986
I wish to understand
that perfection.

205
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,863
The Borg's Holy Grail.

206
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,324
Captain?

207
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,908
Never mind.

208
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,201
I'll see you in an hour.

209
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,260
Arithrazine? What for?

210
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,637
I'm going
on an away mission.

211
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,929
What are you
planning to do,

212
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,222
stroll through
a supernova?

213
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,766
Something like that...
20 milligrams,

214
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,268
when can you
have it ready?

215
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,061
Captain, arithrazine is used

216
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,897
for the most severe cases
of theta radiation poisoning.

217
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,442
A physician must be present
to monitor the treatment.

218
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,860
That won't be possible.

219
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,654
Then I'm afraid
I can't accommodate you.

220
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,281
I'd be in violation
of Starfleet medical protocols.

221
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,408
Well, I'm overriding
those protocols.

222
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,160
Don't tell me,

223
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,955
"The Omega Directive",
Whatever that might be.

224
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,582
The arithrazine, Doctor.

225
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,293
It'll be ready in the morning.

226
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,086
Have it sent to
the shuttle bay.

227
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,382
Captain, I don't know what's
going on here, but I'd hate

228
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,925
this to be the last time
I ever see you.

229
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,845
Please be careful.
I will.

230
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,642
( beeping )

231
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,644
SEVEN OF NINE:
I've analyzed the sensor logs

232
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,437
using Borg algorithms.

233
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,440
The shock wave we detected
indicates not one,

234
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,609
but possibly hundreds
of Omega molecules.

235
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,153
Location?

236
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,863
Within ten lightyears.

237
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,031
I'm having difficulty

238
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,492
isolating the
exact star system.

239
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,868
Hundreds of molecules.

240
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,328
That changes everything.

241
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,455
A shuttle mission
may be insufficient.

242
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,250
We require the resources of this
entire crew.

243
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,171
We're going to need
more firepower,

244
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,590
more protection.

245
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,177
Transfer your data
to the astrometrics lab.

246
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,721
I'll work on it there.

247
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,932
TUVOK:
Calibration complete.

248
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,642
Phase modulator.

249
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,522
Detonator circuits?

250
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,691
On standby.

251
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,485
We're ready to load
the gravimetric charge.

252
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,867
This looks like enough
for a 50-isoton explosion.

253
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,287
Fifty four, to be exact.

254
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,915
What are we planning to do,
blow up a small planet?

255
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,376
I don't know.

256
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,169
This warhead isn't
standard issue.

257
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,588
Who designed it, the Captain?

258
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,340
JANEWAY:
Mr. Kim, you ask too
many questions.

259
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,550
Change of plans, gentlemen.

260
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,677
Increase the charge
to 80 isotons.

261
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,928
Aye, Captain.

262
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,305
Harry, when you're done here,

263
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,223
give B'Elanna a hand
with the shuttlecraft.

264
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,643
She's reinforcing the hull.
Right.

265
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,401
Ensign Hickman thinks
it's species 8472.

266
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,570
Pardon me?

267
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,780
That's his theory.

268
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,615
There's an opening
in fluidic space,

269
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,200
and Captain Janeway
has to shut it down.

270
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,452
Want to know what I think?

271
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,787
No.

272
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,167
I think there's a type-six
protostar out there,

273
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,127
and the Captain's planning
on detonating it,

274
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,171
and opening up a wormhole
to the Alpha Quadrant.

275
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,714
In theory,
it's possible.

276
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,840
And because she doesn't want
to get her hopes up,

277
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,635
she's not telling anybody.

278
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,179
Then I wouldn't suggest
getting your hopes up.

279
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,473
Then what do you think it is?

280
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,725
I do not engage in
idle speculation.

281
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,018
Oh, come on, Tuvok.

282
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,311
Aren't you curious?

283
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,147
Yes, but we have a task at hand.

284
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,149
The phase modulator.

285
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,160
( door beeping )

286
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,495
Come in.

287
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,831
Status report.

288
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,791
Everything's going
according to schedule.

289
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,168
Good.

290
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,253
The Omega directive doesn't
allow me to say much,

291
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,422
but I want you to
know what to expect.

292
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,508
At 0600 hours,
I'll be leaving

293
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,968
in a shuttle with
Seven of Nine.

294
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,055
Would it be out of line
to ask where you're going?

295
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,515
I can tell you this,

296
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,684
one of two things
is going to happen.

297
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,228
Either Seven and I will
succeed on our mission,

298
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,480
and return within
a few days,

299
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,190
or your long-range
sensors will detect

300
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,651
a large explosion
in subspace.

301
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,028
If that occurs, you'll have
less than ten seconds to jump

302
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,655
to warp and get the
hell out of here.

303
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,114
Head for the
alpha quadrant,

304
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,742
and don't look
back. Understood?

305
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,579
I always thought that
Starfleet was run by

306
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,497
duty-crazed bureaucrats,

307
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,290
but I find it hard to believe
that even they

308
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,168
would order a Captain
to go on a suicide mission.

309
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,546
This shuttle excursion
is your idea, isn't it?

310
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,425
Let's just say
I've had to...

311
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,095
amend the Directive
given the circumstances.

312
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,431
But you have your orders
and I expect you to follow them.

313
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,140
That's expecting a lot.

314
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,352
You're asking me to abandon
my Captain and closest friend,

315
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,521
without even telling me why.

316
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,106
If it were a simple
matter of trust,

317
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,108
I wouldn't hesitate to
tell you...

318
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,944
but we've encountered situations

319
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,947
where information was
taken from us by force.

320
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,991
I can't allow knowledge of Omega
to go beyond<i> Voyager.</i>

321
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,827
That's a reasonable argument,

322
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,704
but you're not always
a reasonable woman.

323
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,791
You're determined
to protect this crew,

324
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,959
and this time you've
taken it too far.

325
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,420
A dangerous mission,
fine, I'll acknowledge that,

326
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,464
but isn't it more
likely to succeed

327
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,466
with everyone behind you,
working together?

328
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,217
Ordinarily, I'd agree,

329
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,679
but this Directive was issued
many years ago.

330
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,308
Starfleet didn't exactly have
our predicament in mind, did it?

331
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:19,437
Lost in the Delta Quadrant
with no backup.

332
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,063
I can't ignore the orders,

333
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,942
but I won't ask the crew
to risk their lives

334
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,443
because of my obligation.

335
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,194
My obligation.

336
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,738
That's where you're wrong.

337
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,699
<i>Voyager</i> may be alone out here,
but you're not.

338
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,200
Let us help you.

339
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,495
We'll keep
classified information

340
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,746
limited to the senior staff.

341
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,958
We'll take
every security precaution.

342
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,293
Just don't try to do this alone.

343
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,345
Assemble the troops.

344
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,810
If we were in the
Alpha Quadrant right now,

345
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,895
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

346
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,856
I'd be in contact
with Starfleet Command,

347
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,607
and they'd send in
a specialized team

348
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,484
to deal with the crisis.

349
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,444
In their absence, we're
going to have to make do

350
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,404
with the training
I've received,

351
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,700
and the knowledge Seven of Nine
has retained from the Borg.

352
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,370
You've all seen
this symbol.

353
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,791
Omega...the last letter
of the Greek alphabet,

354
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,668
chosen by Starfleet to
represent a threat

355
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,961
not only to the federation,

356
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,963
but to the entire galaxy.

357
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,132
Only Starship Captains
and Federation Flag Officers

358
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,093
have been briefed
on the nature of this threat.

359
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,888
What you're about to hear

360
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,974
will not go beyond these
bulkheads. Is that clear?

361
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,020
Good.

362
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,657
This is Omega.

363
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,243
A molecule?

364
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,161
Not just any molecule...

365
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,331
the most powerful substance
known to exist.

366
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,291
A single Omega molecule

367
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,253
contains the same energy
as a warp core.

368
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:12,258
In theory, a small chain of them
could sustain a civilization.

369
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,885
The molecule was
first synthesized

370
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,511
over a hundred years ago

371
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,931
by a Starfleet physicist
named Ketteract.

372
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,267
I think he was hoping to develop
an inexhaustible power source.

373
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,894
Or a weapon.

374
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,939
Ketteract managed to synthesize

375
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,358
a single molecule
particle of Omega.

376
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,194
But it only existed
for a fraction of a second

377
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,988
before it destabilized.

378
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:43,039
This was a classified research
center in the Lantaru sector.

379
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,917
Ketteract and 126
of the federation's

380
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,336
leading scientists were
lost in the accident.

381
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,048
Rescue teams
attempting to reach the site

382
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,841
discovered an unexpected

383
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,885
secondary effect.

384
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,721
There were
subspace ruptures

385
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,390
extending out
several lightyears.

386
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,310
The Lantaru sector...

387
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,604
it's impossible to create
a stable warp field there.

388
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,983
You can only fly through
it at sublight speeds.

389
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,234
I was always told that
it was a natural phenomenon.

390
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,655
You're saying it was caused by
a single molecule of this stuff?

391
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,116
Omega destroys subspace.

392
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:21,702
A chain reaction
involving a handful of molecules

393
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,414
could devastate subspace
throughout an entire quadrant.

394
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,207
If that were to happen...

395
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,585
warp travel would
become impossible.

396
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,879
Space-faring civilization
as we know it

397
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,423
would cease to exist.

398
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,175
When Starfleet realized
Omega's power,

399
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,760
they suppressed
all knowledge of it.

400
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,637
DOCTOR:
Have you detected
Omega here,

401
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,555
in the Delta Quadrant?

402
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,517
I'm afraid so.

403
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,060
I've been authorized

404
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,980
to use whatever means
necessary to destroy it.

405
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,649
Tom, I've calculated

406
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,317
the location of the molecules.

407
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,778
I'll transfer the coordinates
to the helm.

408
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,279
Take us there at full impulse.

409
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,990
Aye, Captain.

410
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,284
I don't have to tell you
what's at stake.

411
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,539
If a large-scale
Omega explosion occurs,

412
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,916
we will lose the ability
to go to warp forever.

413
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,920
We've got our work
cut out for us.

414
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,019
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>
<i>Encrypt log entry.</i>

415
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,854
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>the star system</i>

416
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,857
<i>where we believe</i>
<i>we'll find Omega.</i>

417
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,567
<i>I have to admit,</i>
<i>I've never been</i>

418
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,111
<i>this apprehensive</i>
<i>about a mission.</i>

419
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,073
<i>I know how Einstein must have</i>
<i>felt about the atom bomb,</i>

420
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,658
<i>or Marcus when she developed</i>
<i>the Genesis Device.</i>

421
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,993
<i>They watched helplessly</i>

422
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,786
<i>as science took</i>
<i>a destructive course.</i>

423
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,915
<i>But I have the chance</i>
<i>to prevent that from happening.</i>

424
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,791
<i>I just hope it's not too late.</i>

425
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,669
Status report?

426
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,295
This is a harmonic
resonance chamber.

427
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:59,133
The Borg designed it to contain
and stabilize Omega.

428
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,095
I thought I asked you to
work on the photon torpedo.

429
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,304
The torpedo
may be insufficient.

430
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,516
I can modify this chamber
to emit an inverse frequency.

431
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,062
It will be enough to dissolve
Omega's interatomic bonds.

432
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,484
Here's to Borg ingenuity.

433
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,570
This is excellent
work, Seven.

434
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,407
We may need this.
The modifications require

435
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,244
several complex calculations.
Assist me.

436
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,371
I guess I will.

437
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,207
I'm curious...

438
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,834
when did the Borg
discover Omega?

439
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,129
Two hundred
twenty nine years ago.

440
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,797
Assimilation?
Yes.

441
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,381
Of 13 different species.

442
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,674
Thirteen?

443
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,552
It began with species 262.

444
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,846
They were primitive,
but their oral history

445
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,347
referred to
a powerful substance

446
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,516
which could burn the sky.

447
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,519
And the Borg were intrigued...
which led them to species 263.

448
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,105
They too, were primitive,

449
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,191
and believed it was a drop
of blood from their creator.

450
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,692
Fascinating!

451
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,402
Yes, but irrelevant.

452
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,362
We followed this trail of myth
for many years,

453
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,448
until finally
assimilating a species

454
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,575
with useful scientific data.

455
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,662
We then created
the molecule ourselves.

456
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,124
Omega caused quite a stir among
my own species.

457
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,669
Federation cosmologists
had a theory...

458
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,588
that the molecule
once existed in nature...

459
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,175
for an infinitesimal
period of time

460
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,760
at the exact moment
of the Big Bang.

461
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,222
Some claimed Omega
was the primal source of energy

462
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:31,184
for the explosion
that began our universe.

463
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,977
A creation myth, like any other.

464
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,728
Perhaps.

465
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,647
What is it the Borg say?

466
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,524
That Omega is perfect?

467
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,942
Yes.

468
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,279
Is that a theory or a belief?

469
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,697
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

470
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,865
Go ahead.

471
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,533
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>the coordinates.</i>

472
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,868
I'm on my way.

473
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,744
I'm leaving this project
in your hands.

474
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,331
Use whatever resources
and personnel you need.

475
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,333
Understood.

476
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,632
We've entered a
planetary system.

477
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,758
Inhabited?

478
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,344
There's a pre-warp
civilization

479
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,012
on the outermost planet.

480
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,388
The source of Omega
seems to be further in.

481
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,808
The damage to subspace
in this region is extreme.

482
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,102
We won't be able
to go to warp.

483
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,189
We are encountering distortions.

484
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,523
Track their origin.

485
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,317
An M-class moon.

486
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,027
We're in visual range.

487
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,528
On screen.

488
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,157
TUVOK:
There is a subnucleonic reaction

489
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,825
occurring in the upper
atmosphere,

490
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,827
it is apparently
emanating from a structure

491
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,162
on the moon's surface.

492
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,081
Can your sensors
penetrate the atmosphere?

493
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,500
PARIS: Stand by.
My God.

494
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,838
Over 300,000 square
kilometers...destroyed.

495
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,757
Scan the structure.

496
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,843
Are there any
Omega molecules remaining?

497
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,427
I can't tell.

498
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,972
Several sections of the outpost
are still shielded.

499
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,224
I'm detecting life signs.

500
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,767
How many?

501
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,270
A few dozen, maybe. It's hard
to get a clear reading.

502
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,521
Harry, can we transport
to the surface?

503
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,981
I can get you there...

504
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,900
but conditions in the structure
aren't good,

505
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,568
there are high levels
of radiation.

506
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,486
Tuvok...

507
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,697
assemble a rescue team,

508
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,658
and have them report to Sick Bay
for arithrazine inoculations.

509
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,078
Tell the Doctor to
prepare for casualties.

510
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,205
Tom, move<i> Voyager</i>
into a high orbit,

511
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,497
and then join
the away team.

512
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,707
We'll need a field medic.

513
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,959
Yes, Ma'am.

514
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,459
You're going with them?

515
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,921
If Omega's still down there,
I have to find it.

516
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,048
I'll keep an open comlink
with the ship.

517
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,633
You have the bridge.

518
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,946
JANEWAY:
I'm picking up
Omega's resonance frequency.

519
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,283
It's here,
but I can't pinpoint a location.

520
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,331
I need to ask you questions

521
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:01,250
about the experiments
you've been conducting here.

522
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,837
There was...an accident.

523
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,925
We lost containment.

524
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,052
The substance you were
trying to create,

525
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,638
did any of it survive
the explosion?

526
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,350
Yes.
Where?

527
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:23,814
Inside the primary
test chamber.

528
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,861
Who are you?

529
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,737
Captain Janeway
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

530
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,323
We're here to help you.

531
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,742
Away team to<i> Voyager,</i> two to
beam directly to Sick Bay.

532
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,703
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

533
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,248
This door is solid duritanium,

534
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,500
13 centimeters thick.

535
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,959
Can we get it open?

536
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,004
The duritanium has melted
into the door frame.

537
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,215
We will need to cut
through the metal with phasers.

538
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,924
Do it.
Captain...

539
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,801
I'd be negligent
if I didn't point out

540
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,012
that we are about to violate
the Prime Directive.

541
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,847
For the duration of this mission

542
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,724
the Prime Directive
is rescinded.

543
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,267
Let's get this over with.

544
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,864
SEVEN OF NINE:
Crewman Dell,

545
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,032
I'm assigning you a task

546
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,992
more suited
to your abilities.

547
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,329
Calibrate the ionic-pressure
seals on the observation ports.

548
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,540
Your new designation
is Three of Ten.

549
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,874
Yes, Ma'am.

550
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,970
I've got more isolinear
processors for you to install.

551
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,848
Thanks, but I need to get the
power relays online first.

552
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,475
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

553
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,643
Ensign Wildman
was assigned to that.

554
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,895
This is ridiculous.

555
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,313
I'm not going to waste time

556
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,107
just because Seven
wants to turn this team

557
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,067
into her own
private collective.

558
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,569
She says
it's more efficient.

559
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,487
Maybe for a
bunch of drones.

560
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,118
Six of Ten, this is not your
assignment.

561
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,661
Please, stop
calling me that.

562
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,747
You are compromising
our productivity.

563
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,170
I am reassigning you
to chamber maintenance.

564
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,298
Your new designation
is Two of Ten.

565
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,925
( laughing )

566
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,635
Wait a minute.
You're demoting me?

567
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,597
Since when do the Borg
pull rank?

568
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,890
A Starfleet protocol I adapted.

569
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,226
I find it most useful.

570
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,603
I'm glad you're not the Captain.

571
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,772
How's it coming?

572
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,983
SEVEN OF NINE:
The crew can be
quite efficient

573
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,568
when properly organized.

574
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,112
The harmonic chamber will be
completed within the hour.

575
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,530
Good, I'll let the Captain know.

576
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,616
Has she retrieved any new data
from the surface?

577
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,577
Not yet. They're still trying to
access the primary test chamber.

578
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,329
Were there survivors?
A few.

579
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,539
The Doctor's treating them
in Sick Bay.

580
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,750
Commander...

581
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,130
Seven's taking this
"Hive mentality"

582
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,548
Just a little too far.

583
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,550
Designated functions,
numbered drones...

584
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,843
I wouldn't be surprised

585
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,179
if she started plugging
us into alcoves.

586
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,556
When in the collective,
Harry...adapt.

587
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,158
Which of them is the
senior researcher?

588
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,369
This gentleman.
Why do you ask?

589
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,911
He has knowledge I require.

590
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,664
He also happens to be
barely conscious.

591
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,249
Come back in an hour.
Unacceptable.

592
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,626
Unavoidable.

593
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,710
This is my Sick Bay.
The man needs to recover.

594
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,464
The captain left me in charge
of our efforts on<i> Voyager.</i>

595
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,756
I would be negligent

596
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,051
if I ignored a new
source of information.

597
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,432
( sighs )

598
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,518
Our next social skills
seminar is entitled,

599
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:52,064
"Adding diplomatic flair
to future negotiations."

600
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:58,195
How are you feeling, Sir?

601
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,656
Better, thank you.

602
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:05,077
Are you comfortable enough
to speak with this individual?

603
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,248
Keep it brief.

604
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:18,173
How many of the molecules were
you able to synthesize?

605
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,760
Two hundred million?
I'm not certain.

606
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,513
What is the iso-frequency
of your containment field?

607
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,057
1.68 terrahertz.

608
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,601
We used the molecules
on resonance

609
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,686
to calculate the field.

610
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,896
That should've been enough
to stabilize them.

611
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,691
( scoffs )
Obviously it wasn't.

612
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,943
Obviously.

613
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,571
But your approach is innovative.

614
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,699
Perhaps I can adapt your
technique and improve upon it.

615
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,033
You will assist me.

616
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,331
Our equipment was destroyed.

617
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:57,879
If you can transfer the
molecules to your ship...

618
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,506
maybe they can be saved.

619
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,175
I have no intention of
saving them.

620
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,552
What?

621
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,179
My orders are to destroy
the Omega molecules.

622
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,558
This is my life's work...
the salvation of my people.

623
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,185
Will you assist me or not?

624
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,439
Our resources are nearly gone.

625
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,358
The future of my people
depends on this discovery.

626
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,235
Then your answer is no.

627
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,616
Small-minded creatures!

628
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,826
You destroy whatever
you don't understand!

629
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:33,873
Rescue ships are on the way.
They won't let you do it.

630
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,918
Please, try to be calm.

631
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,462
Seven, you'll
have to leave.

632
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,343
You don't realize
what you're doing.

633
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:48,930
You don't know what this is...
what this means.

634
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,933
On the contrary...

635
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,478
I understand perfectly.

636
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,417
We've disabled
the locking mechanism.

637
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,837
Narrow your phaser beams to
cut through the inner seal.

638
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,254
Inadvisable.

639
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,423
We'd risk penetrating
the containment field.

640
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,803
Then we'll have to use
some elbow grease.

641
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,137
Give me a hand.

642
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,015
Oh.

643
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,521
Right.

644
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,416
There's enough here
to wipe out subspace

645
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,585
across half the Quadrant.

646
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,420
I'll order the away
teams back to<i> Voyager,</i>

647
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,881
and target this facility
with the gravimetric charge.

648
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,090
It won't be enough.

649
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,217
We'll have to go
with our Borg option.

650
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,385
Ensign.

651
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,803
ENSIGN:
Yes, Captain.

652
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,430
Return to the ship.

653
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,890
Tell Commander Chakotay

654
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,933
to help Seven complete
the harmonic chamber.

655
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,688
We'll have to transport Omega
directly to the ship.

656
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,147
That means finding a way

657
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,982
to shut down
this containment field.

658
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,818
It's unfortunate we
can't study this

659
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,152
phenomenon
in more detail.

660
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,987
We may not have the
opportunity again.

661
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,741
Let's hope we never do.

662
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,368
A curious statement
from a woman of science.

663
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,079
I'm also a woman who
occasionally knows when to quit.

664
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,083
Take another look
at your tricorder.

665
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,546
Omega's too dangerous.

666
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:48,717
I won't risk half the quadrant
to satisfy our curiosity.

667
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,719
It's arrogant
and it's irresponsible.

668
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,226
The final frontier
has some boundaries

669
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,730
that shouldn't be crossed...

670
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,733
and we're looking at one.

671
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,359
We don't need to destroy
the molecules.

672
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,070
I believe I've found a way
to stabilize them.

673
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,697
The alien in sick bay calibrated

674
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,283
his containment field
using Omega's own resonance,

675
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,452
an approach unknown
to the Borg.

676
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,745
I've modified
the chamber...

677
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,330
Those weren't
your orders.

678
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,081
The Captain wants
Omega eliminated.

679
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,543
That is still an option

680
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:27,840
if she insists on
yielding to her fear.

681
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,257
Show me what you've done.

682
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,846
This simulation
shows the molecules

683
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,307
in their free state,
highly unstable.

684
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,601
I've modified the chamber
to emit a harmonic wave form

685
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,937
that will dampen
the molecules.

686
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:45,440
Looks great in theory,
but this is only a simulation.

687
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,984
How are you going to test it?

688
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:53,031
On Omega.
( scoffs ): Bad idea.

689
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,366
One mistake,

690
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,117
and no one will be around
for a second try.

691
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,369
It will work.

692
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,662
Someday, maybe.

693
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,372
Hang on to your research.

694
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,999
For now, we stick to the plan.

695
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,668
Stand by to transport the
molecules into this chamber,

696
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,212
and neutralize them as ordered.

697
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,631
I have been a member
of this crew for nine months.

698
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,924
In all of that time

699
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,635
I have never made
a personal request.

700
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,637
I am making one now.

701
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,473
Allow me to proceed...

702
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,892
please.

703
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,269
Why is this so important to you?

704
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,773
( sighs )

705
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,942
Particle zero-one-zero...

706
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:32,278
the Borg designation
for what you call Omega.

707
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,947
Every drone is aware
of its existence.

708
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:38,410
We were instructed
to assimilate it at all costs.

709
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,372
It is...perfection.

710
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,752
The molecules exist
in a flawless state.

711
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,922
Infinite parts
functioning as one.

712
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,506
Like the Borg.

713
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,469
Precisely.

714
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,056
I am no longer Borg,

715
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:03,309
but I still need to understand
that perfection.

716
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:07,105
Without it, my existence
will never be complete.

717
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,695
Commander,
you are a spiritual man.

718
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,447
That's right.

719
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,658
If you had the chance to see
your God,

720
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,955
your great spirit...
what would you do?

721
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,834
I'd pursue it...
with all my heart.

722
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,462
Then you understand.

723
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:34,591
I think I do.

724
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,593
I'll inform the Captain
of your discovery.

725
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,930
For now, her orders stand.

726
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,308
Thank you.

727
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:54,987
( mellow theme playing )

728
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,994
Set the confinement beam
to its narrowest dispersion.

729
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,787
Understood.

730
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,873
Then we'll target this facility
with the gravimetric torpedo.

731
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,750
If anything goes wrong
during transport,

732
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,293
that'll be our only hope.

733
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,920
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Bridge to Janeway.</i>

734
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,464
<i>We've detected two ships</i>
<i>on an intercept course.</i>

735
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,466
<i>They're not responding</i>
<i>to hails.</i>

736
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,634
How long until they get here?

737
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,094
Less than
four minutes, Captain.

738
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,595
JANEWAY:
<i>Stand by to transport</i>

739
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,931
the molecules directly
to the harmonic chamber.

740
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,641
Understood. Bridge to Cargo Bay.

741
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,059
Yes, Commander.

742
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,435
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Seven, get ready.</i>

743
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,728
We'll have to do this quickly.

744
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,022
That's not advisable.

745
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,272
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

746
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,858
The alien ships are
on their way.

747
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,109
Then I recommend moving the ship

748
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,861
within 5,000 kilometers
of the surface.

749
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,237
PARIS:
<i>That'll take us right</i>
<i>into the atmosphere.</i>

750
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,448
With our shields down,
we won't be able to withstand

751
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,076
the thermal reaction
for more than a few seconds.

752
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,661
Then we'll only get
one shot at this.

753
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,245
Take us in.

754
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,455
Aye, Sir.

755
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,790
Transporter status?

756
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,375
Targeting scanners are locked.

757
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,335
Captain, are you ready?

758
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,171
Pattern enhancers
are active.

759
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,505
Do it.

760
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,133
We're 11,000 kilometers
from the surface.

761
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,968
If we get much closer,
we'll incinerate.

762
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,636
We're losing structural
integrity.

763
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,262
PARIS:
<i>Nine thousand kilometers.</i>

764
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,556
We're close enough.

765
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,849
Energize.

766
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,266
Initiating transport.

767
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,857
The Omega molecules are stable.

768
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,317
SEVEN OF NINE:
<i>Transport was successful.</i>

769
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,444
I've got the away team
in Transporter Room 2.

770
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,030
Get us out of here,
maximum impulse.

771
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,198
Already on it.

772
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,241
How far are away are
those ships?

773
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,160
They're right on our tail.

774
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,297
CHAKOTAY:
We're heading into
an area of open space,

775
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,550
no indications of life
or any kind of technology.

776
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,801
We can carry out
the procedure

777
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,178
with no risk
to anyone else.

778
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,513
Except those two ships
behind us.

779
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,058
Can we stay ahead of them?
Not for long.

780
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,393
When can we clear the subspace
ruptures and go to warp?

781
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,187
Ten, maybe 15 minutes?

782
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,397
But those ships will
catch up to us before then.

783
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,234
Well, we have one advantage.
We've got Omega.

784
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,693
They won't risk
firing at us...

785
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,653
at least not until
they've run out of options.

786
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,031
That should give us a chance
to neutralize the molecules.

787
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,908
Captain, we might have
another problem.

788
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,159
Seven of Nine?

789
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,911
She's convinced she
can stabilize Omega.

790
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,662
I thought we'd
settled that question.

791
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,081
While you were on the surface,

792
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,125
she showed me a pretty
convincing simulation

793
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,584
of how it could be done.

794
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,753
I should've known she
wouldn't just let this go.

795
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,337
I'll be in Cargo Bay 2.

796
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,182
Seven, the procedure?

797
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,226
It's working.
Eleven percent of the molecules

798
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,769
have already been neutralized.

799
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,896
Let's see if we can
speed up the process a little.

800
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,982
Did commander Chakotay
tell you about my idea?

801
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,233
Yes.

802
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,442
Then you will allow me

803
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,194
to stabilize the
remaining molecules?

804
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,613
You know I can't do that.

805
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,740
Your Starfleet Directive is
no longer relevant,

806
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,408
I have found a way
to control Omega.

807
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,452
I don't care if you can
make it sing and dance,

808
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,163
we're getting rid of it.

809
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,538
A foolish decision.

810
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,458
Yes, but it's mine to make.
Now, step aside.

811
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,506
I could have done this
without your permission,

812
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,134
but I chose to follow
your command structure.

813
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,680
I should've made the attempt.

814
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,099
I still can.
But you won't.

815
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,312
You know I'm not
trying to stop you

816
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:18,564
from finding perfection...

817
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,151
but I can't risk the
safety of this Quadrant.

818
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,321
Omega must end here.
We both know that.

819
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,712
Status?

820
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,921
Eighteen percent.

821
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,422
This could take hours.

822
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,217
Can you increase the
harmonic resonance?

823
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,510
Yes, but it would
rupture the chamber.

824
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,931
How many molecules would we
neutralize?

825
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,892
Forty, 50 percent
at best.

826
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,354
That's good enough.

827
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,564
Our torpedo can take
care of the rest.

828
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,732
Janeway to Bridge.

829
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,275
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Chakotay here.</i>

830
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,277
Chakotay, I want you
to clear Deck 4,

831
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,155
and put emergency forcefields
around this section.

832
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,699
Prepare to decompress
Cargo Bay 2 on my command.

833
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,159
<i>Understood.</i>

834
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,536
Tuvok,
load the gravimetric torpedo.

835
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,122
Once we've jettisoned
the chamber...fire.

836
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,415
TUVOK:
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

837
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,709
Harmonic resonance
to maximum.

838
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,217
Commander, they're
closing on us.

839
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,468
They're attempting to stop us
with a tractor beam.

840
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,762
Adjust shields to compensate.

841
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,013
They're hailing us.

842
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,639
On screen.

843
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,102
<i>Disengage your engines,</i>
<i>and prepare to be boarded.</i>

844
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,686
I can't do that.

845
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,315
<i>You've stolen our technology,</i>
<i>abducted our people.</i>

846
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,692
Your people are safe. They're
receiving medical care.

847
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,986
I'll be glad to get them
back to you when this is over,

848
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,696
but we're keeping the molecules.

849
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,199
<i>I won't allow this substance</i>
<i>to fall into enemy hands,</i>

850
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,867
<i>I'll destroy it first!</i>

851
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,119
They're charging weapons.

852
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,703
You'll destabilize
the molecules.

853
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,038
We'll both
be destroyed.

854
00:40:57,038 --> 00:41:00,166
<i>Then return</i>
<i>our technology...now!</i>

855
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,877
I'm sorry.
That's not possible.

856
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,053
Direct hit.
Shields down ten percent.

857
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,097
Evasive maneuvers.
Try to shake them off.

858
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,059
Harmonic resonance
at maximum, Captain.

859
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,436
The molecules?

860
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:20,561
Eighty percent remaining.

861
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,272
We need to get that
down to 60.

862
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,567
Any damage to our power grid
could overload the chamber.

863
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,777
Omega would chain react.

864
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,862
The same thought
crossed my mind.

865
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,781
Where are we now?

866
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,074
Seventy two percent.

867
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,492
That's close enough!

868
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,411
Bridge, start
the decompression sequence.

869
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,829
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

870
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,915
What's wrong?
What's happening?

871
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,460
The molecules are stabilizing.
What?

872
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,877
I've done nothing.

873
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,797
It's occurring spontaneously.
That's impossible.

874
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,551
COMPUTER:
<i>Decompression in 30 seconds.</i>

875
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,723

00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,948
CHAKOTAY:
Tom, are we clear
of the subspace ruptures?

882
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,283
Almost.

883
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,035
I need maximum warp
within ten seconds,

884
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,619
or we'll be stuck
at ground zero.

885
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,996
Yes, Sir.

886
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,706
Decompression is complete.

887
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,042
The harmonic chamber
has been jettisoned.

888
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,377
Fire!

889
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,718
( sighs )

890
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,388
We made it. We're at Warp 1.

891
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,140
The alien ships?

892
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,475
CHAKOTAY:
Out of range.

893
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,018
Tuvok?

894
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:45,021
TUVOK:
Sensors show no traces
of Omega molecules.

895
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,491
Mission accomplished.

896
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,998
( sighs )

897
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:17,095
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51793.4.</i>

898
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,097
<i>We've arranged</i>
<i>for our guests in Sick Bay</i>

899
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,433
<i>to be taken back</i>
<i>to their home world,</i>

900
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:24,018
<i>and we can finally</i>
<i>put this mission behind us.</i>

901
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,229
<i>This will be</i>
<i>my last encrypted log</i>

902
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,064
<i>concerning the Omega Directive.</i>

903
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,109
<i>The classified data files</i>
<i>will now be destroyed.</i>

904
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:37,449
I wondered who
was running my program.

905
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,200
Master Da Vinci
doesn't like visitors

906
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,035
after midnight.

907
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,080
He protested.
I deactivated him.

908
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,873
What're you
doing here, Seven?

909
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:50,669
This simulation contains
many religious components.

910
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,880
I was studying them...

911
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,925
to help me understand what
I saw in Cargo Bay 2.

912
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,385
The data wasn't clear

913
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,555
on why Omega stabilized
in the last few seconds.

914
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:04,183
But chances are it
was simply a chaotic anomaly,

915
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,227
nothing more.

916
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,522
For 3.2 seconds...

917
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,732
I saw perfection.

918
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:20,533
When Omega stabilized,
I felt a curious sensation.

919
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:25,121
As I was watching it,
it seemed to be watching me.

920
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,968
The Borg have assimilated
many species

921
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:44,098
with mythologies to explain
such moments of clarity.

922
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,351
I've always dismissed
them as trivial.

923
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,313
Perhaps I was wrong.

924
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,529
If I didn't
know you better...

925
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:03,242
I'd say you just had your
first spiritual experience.

926
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:16,755
