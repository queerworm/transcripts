00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,343
(<i> door chimes</i> )

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,261
Come in.

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,308
You wished to see me.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,812
We've known each
other for how long?

5
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,147
Approximately 20 years.

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,150
We've served on three
starships together.

7
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,654
I was present at your
daughter's<i> Kolinahr.</i>

8
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,949
I consider you one
of my closest friends.

9
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,160
And I regard you
with the same esteem.

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,789
I've always been
honest with<i> you,</i>

11
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:43,293
but you've been keeping
something from me.

12
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,547
I don't know
what you mean.
Don't you?

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,009
It took exhaustive research,

14
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,261
sifting through
teraquads of data,

15
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,849
separating fact from rumor...

16
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,852
but eventually,
I arrived at the truth.

17
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,396
Captain...

18
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,658
Happy Birthday.

19
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,038
Thank you.
So, it's not long

20
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,582
before you hit the big
three digits, hmm?

21
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,584
Indeed.

22
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,046
Have you informed
anyone else of
your discovery?

23
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,590
Don't worry, Tuvok,
my lips are sealed.

24
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,259
Well, you're supposed
to blow out the candle.

25
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,012
That is not a Vulcan custom.

26
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,513
Humor me.

27
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,306
CHAKOTAY:
Captain to the Bridge.

28
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,520
Well?

29
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,485
It was a fire hazard.

30
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,868
We're receiving
a distress call--

31
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,412
a small vessel on
an intercept course.

32
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,414
Life signs?
KIM: One.

33
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,083
It's Ocampan.

34
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,876
We're being hailed.

35
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,881
Kes?

36
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,841
KES:
Captain Janeway...

37
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,509
I need your help.

38
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,344
(<i> sighs</i> )

39
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,264
Will you please give me
permission to come aboard?

40
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,016
Of course. What's happened?

41
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,311
Please, let me come aboard.

42
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,274
Prepare the docking port.
Tell the Doctor to stand by.

43
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,527
Her ship is accelerating.
It's on a collision course.

44
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,155
Janeway to Kes.
Cut your engines.

45
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,573
You're coming in too fast.

46
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,283
Five seconds
till impact.

47
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,411
Lock on a tractor beam.
Evasive maneuvers.

48
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,290
Hull breach on Deck 9!
Emergency force fields.

49
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,710
Captain, a transporter
was activated
just before impact.

50
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,295
She's beamed aboard.

51
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,007
(<i> explosions</i> )

52
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,869
KIM:
I'm reading
bulkhead ruptures--

53
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,539
Deck 11, Section 17...
18... 19.

54
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,625
Cause?
Unknown.

55
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,045
I have located Kes.
She's moving through
those sections.

56
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,839
She's giving off high levels
of neurogenic energy.

57
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,634
Janeway to Kes.
Kes, respond.

58
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,010
(<i> rumbling</i> )

59
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,929
Hull breach, Section 20.

60
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,432
Force fields.
Security to Deck 11.

61
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,149
Force fields are not holding.

62
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,276
She's approaching
Main Engineering.

63
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,195
Bridge to Engineering.
Intruder alert.

64
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,698
Stop where you are.

65
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,496
(<i> grunting</i> )

66
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,629
(<i> groaning</i> )

67
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,389
Kes?

68
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,600
(<i> quiet sigh</i> )

69
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,393
State your intentions.

70
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,275
Evacuate
Engineering.

71
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,544
(<i> loud pulsating whir</i> )

72
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,633
Warp power is fluctuating.

73
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,135
Torres to Bridge.

74
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,722
Kes is in direct contact
with the warp core.

75
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,765
She's drawing power
from it somehow.

76
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,184
Shut it down.

77
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,332
Warp power is
returning to normal.

78
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,833
B'Elanna, report.

79
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,835
SEVEN:
Lieutenant Torres is dead.

80
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,462
Kes has vanished.

81
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,813
TORRES:
And send Mulcahy.

82
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,481
He's in deflector
control.

83
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,567
We'll need more power
to Junction 12-J,

84
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,278
and tell Harry I
want to talk to him

85
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,571
about building
a new energy grid.

86
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,240
Lost?

87
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,867
No, just looking.
Captain Janeway suggested

88
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,078
that I get more familiar
with the ship.

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,663
Well, if you have any
questions, let me know.

90
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,998
Thanks.

91
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,333
We're about to
run a diagnostic

92
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,751
on the warp
core assembly.

93
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,711
You can watch
if you want.

94
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,214
Thanks, but I really should
be getting back to Sick Bay.

95
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,974
Computer, how long
has<i> Voyager</i>  been
in the Delta Quadrant?

96
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,060
56 days, 17 hours.

97
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,281
Back so soon?
I thought you went
to the Airponics Bay

98
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,407
to collect herbs.

99
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,699
I forgot something.

100
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,076
Ah.

101
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,080
Pyong Ko.
Excuse me?

102
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,624
You encouraged me
to choose a name,
remember?

103
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,627
Pyong Ko was a 21st-century
surgeon who discovered

104
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,255
the genetic sequence for
inhibiting cancer cells.

105
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,049
It heralded a new chapter
in Earth's medical history.

106
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,885
That's a perfect
name, Doctor.
Hmm.

107
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,181
Then again, I'm also
considering Schweitzer,

108
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,141
Jarvik, Pasteur.

109
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,851
There are so
many options,

110
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,020
each with
its own merits.

111
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,813
Why don't you give it
some more thought?

112
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,107
You don't have
to decide right away.

113
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,277
Of course, it's not
that I require one
for reasons of vanity.

114
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,488
I'm just a hologram,
after all,

115
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,283
but if I had a name
other than "Doctor"

116
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,535
or "Hey, you,"
it might encourage the crew

117
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,620
to treat me
with a little more respect.

118
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,750
Kes?

119
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,019
(<i> door opens</i> )

120
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,479
Hello?

121
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,733
Neelix?

122
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,080
(<i> sighs</i> )

123
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,342
You know, Neelix, if you want
to put your own stamp on it,

124
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,052
maybe you should give it
your own name,

125
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,513
like "the Greasy Neelix,"

126
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,224
or the, uh,
"Double Talaxian with Cheese."

127
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,060
Ah. It has
a nice ring to it.
Thank you, Lieutenant.

128
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,354
I'll keep that in mind.

129
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,856
Sweeting, what'll
it be? The usual?

130
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,608
I'm not hungry.

131
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,611
I thought that I'd bring
Captain Janeway some coffee.

132
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,114
That's very thoughtful.

133
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,536
I'm looking forward
to tonight.

134
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,123
Actually, I have
a lot of work to do
in Sick Bay.

135
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,625
But I already reserved
the holodeck.

136
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,044
I thought we could take
a moonlit stroll

137
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,130
through the marshlands
of Oshionian Prime.

138
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,132
Another time.
I promise.

139
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,968
Something wrong?
Bad morning.

140
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,429
Anything I can do?

141
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,972
I'll be fine.

142
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,309
I'm not having
a great day, either.

143
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,644
Nobody seems to like
today's menu.

144
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,105
I tried blaming it
on a replicator malfunction,

145
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,815
but no one
believed me.

146
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,027
Wait. I... I think
I see something.

147
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,071
Neelix to Security.

148
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,658
Kes's frown is losing
its structural integrity.

149
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,202
Red Alert.
I'm detecting a smile.

150
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,955
That's my Kes.

151
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,082
The coffee?

152
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,011
That last attack
nearly cost us
our impulse drives.

153
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,846
Fortunately,
B'Elanna found a way

154
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,015
to reroute power
from the deflector.

155
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,477
A good choice
for Chief Engineer,
if I do say so myself.

156
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,562
Getting to know
your enemy.

157
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,147
JANEWAY:
I feel like I already do.

158
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,024
Remember the old story?

159
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,901
A man goes to Risa,
where he meets a beautiful woman

160
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,154
who invites him
for an evening of passion.

161
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,199
He wakes up in the morning
feeling wonderful,

162
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,326
until he discovers
he's missing a kidney.

163
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,287
Every cadet about to go
on his first shore leave

164
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,997
hears that cautionary tale.

165
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,667
Doesn't seem so outrageous
anymore, does it?

166
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,002
No, but the Vidiians are more

167
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,672
than just
your garden-variety monsters.

168
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,923
I've been studying
their culture.

169
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,677
They were a lot like us
before the phage.

170
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,929
Do I detect a note of sympathy?

171
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,559
Makes you wonder what we'd do
under the same circumstances.

172
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,768
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

173
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,398
Oh, you read my mind.

174
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,608
Vidiians?
I'm afraid so.

175
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,444
We've picked up two more ships
on long-range sensors.

176
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,155
I've gone to full
tactical alert. We're
taking every precaution.

177
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,739
I'm sure you'll get us
through it safely.

178
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,868
Thanks for
the vote of confidence.

179
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,664
Tuvok thinks he's found a way
to penetrate their shields.

180
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,709
The next time they attack us,
it won't be so easy.

181
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,126
That's good to hear.

182
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,003
TUVOK:
Captain to the Bridge.

183
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,380
On my way. Oops.

184
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,091
I... I'm so clumsy.
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,800
Don't worry about it.

186
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,429
This desk has seen
its share of coffee spills,

187
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,762
believe me.

188
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,191
Ensign Wildman has
an intriguing proposal.

189
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,361
We've been analyzing
the Vidiian bio-readings
from the last attack.

190
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,531
Their immune systems
have been compromised
by the phage.

191
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,158
We could synthesize
a neural agent

192
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,745
that would incapacitate
them without affecting us.

193
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,829
Might come in handy
if we're ever boarded.

194
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,040
Exactly.
Work with the Doctor.

195
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,042
When you've got something,
find a way to deploy it

196
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,586
through
the environmental systems.

197
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,878
WILDMAN:
Aye, Captain.

198
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,468
(<i> sighs</i> )

199
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,352
The ships we detected
earlier have disappeared
from our sensors.

200
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,855
Maybe we outran them.
They wouldn't give
up that easily.

201
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:39,026
Why would they?<i> Voyager's</i>
<i>the only organ bank</i>
<i>within half a parsec.</i>

202
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,028
We fought off
their first attacks.

203
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,323
Now they seem content
to show up on sensors

204
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,492
just long enough
for us to change course.

205
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,201
It's like
we're being herded somewhere.

206
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,203
If we maintain
our present course,

207
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,539
we're gonna enter a region
filled with subspace vacuoles.

208
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,291
We'd have to drop
to impulse to get through.

209
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,084
Sounds like a good place
for an ambush.

210
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,461
The Maquis used to lure

211
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,129
the Cardassians
into the Badlands.

212
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,632
Those Galor-class cruisers
had nowhere to run.

213
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:04,135
Neither will we, unless...

214
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,596
Tom, how dense
are those vacuoles?

215
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,974
They cover about 70
percent of the region.

216
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,643
Excuse me, Doctor.

217
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,894
Tom, what's the first thing
they teach you

218
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,522
about maneuvering
at warp?

219
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,358
"Faster than light,
no left or right."

220
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,486
When possible,
maintain a linear trajectory.

221
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,655
Course corrections
could fracture the hull.

222
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,073
Exactly. We'd have
to drop to impulse

223
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,242
every time we made
a course change,

224
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,829
<i>but</i> what if we let
<i>Voyager</i> do the driving?

225
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,123
Ma'am?
We could preprogram
every kilometer.

226
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,209
That way we'd only spend
a second or two at impulse

227
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,378
every time the computer
executed a turn.

228
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,547
Auto-navigation
the entire way?

229
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,465
No offense,
but the neural gel packs

230
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,301
can calculate vectors
a little faster than you can.

231
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,556
B'Elanna?
We'd need a more accurate
scan of the region.

232
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,766
If we even graze
one of those vacuoles...

233
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,476
We could send
a shuttle ahead.

234
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,769
The<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

235
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,772
Its sensors
are more advanced.

236
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,860
The<i> Delta</i> what?

237
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,488
Forgive me.

238
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,366
I... must have been thinking
of another starship.

239
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,202
Prepare a shuttle.

240
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,037
I want all
of<i> Voyager's</i> systems

241
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,915
operating at peak efficiency
by the time Tom gets back.

242
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,584
If we're going
to pull this off,

243
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,002
there's no margin
for error. Dismissed.

244
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,520
Computer, display an image
of the Ocampan homeworld.

245
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,984
Plot a course from
<i>Voyager's</i> current position.

246
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,283
Homesick?

247
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,326
Lieutenant.

248
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,537
Tom.

249
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,165
It's okay. A lot
of people on board
feel the same way.

250
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,043
I spent my entire life trying
to get away from Ocampa.

251
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,880
Why would I want
to go back?

252
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,590
Because it's home.

253
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,802
Home for me means
a penal colony.

254
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,179
Out here, I get to fly
a state-of-the-art ship,

255
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,682
and there's no admirals
in sight.

256
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,394
What are you doing?
Getting ready for
a scouting mission.

257
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,609
You planning on going somewhere?

258
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,778
Uh, no, of course not.

259
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,323
I was just studying
the helm configurations.

260
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,409
I didn't know
you could pilot a shuttle.

261
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,703
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
I can't...

262
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,664
but I'd like to learn.

263
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,916
Well, then,
why not learn from the best?

264
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,709
I could start you off
on the holodeck

265
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,670
on an old class-1.

266
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,005
That's the kind of shuttle
my father used to take me up in.

267
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,716
That would be very nice,
Lieutenant.

268
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,928
Tom.

269
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,775
Identify yourself.

270
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,985
It's me, Tuvok.

271
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,778
Naomi Wildman.

272
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,768
MAN:

you, sir?

273
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,437

something wrong?

Hello, sweeting.

of preparing one of your

I know you're receiving

and I also know that
your attempt to capture
this ship will fail.

00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,044
If you want
to harvest<i> Voyager's</i> crew,

291
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,838
I suggest you answer me now.

292
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,383
Explain.

293
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,971
Captain Janeway is aware
of your ambush.

294
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,847
She's found a way
to evade your vessels,

295
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,140
but I can help you.

296
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,726
I'm listening.

297
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,646
I can send you tactical data
on their shields, weapons--

298
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,773
everything you need
to take this ship.

299
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,984
This is a deception.

300
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,402
Do you want this crew or not?

301
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,155
In return?

302
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,949
Safe passage to Ocampa

303
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,951
for myself and one other.

304
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,454
Why would you sentence
your own crew to death?

305
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,539
They're not my crew.

306
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,459
They abandoned me
a long time ago.

She appeared to be
half Ktarian.

313
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,685
Ensign Wildman's
husband is Ktarian.

314
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,188
I met him once on
Deep Space 9.

315
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,816
There's more. I followed her
to Cargo Bay 2,

316
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,944
where I saw a woman
and two children,

317
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,279
all with cybernetic implants.

318
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,157
Borg?

319
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,659
I can't explain it,
Captain.

320
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,205
I've had hallucinations
before, but only while

321
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,916
in a state of
deep meditation.

322
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,085
These were specific,

323
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,504
and they evoked a sense
of anticipation.

324
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,340
It almost sounds like you're
describing a premonition.

325
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,719
Indeed.
I didn't think
Vulcans had premonitions.

326
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,806
They don't.
That's what concerns me.

327
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:12,312
Computer, maintain
a continuous proximity scan
of Lieutenant Tuvok,

all sensor parameters.

329
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,818
In case you have
any more "visions."

330
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,362
A logical plan.

We're approaching the vacuoles.

00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,451
On my way.

334
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,467
Last chance to take
the long way around.

335
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,677
It does feel like
we're sneaking through
a graveyard at midnight.

336
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,345
Any sign of the Vidiians?

337
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,182
Not yet, but it's a safe
bet they're in there.

Well, let's get started.

343
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,613
Engaging at warp 8.

00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,217
One down, 215 to go.

352
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,678
I'll be in Sick Bay.

353
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,056
PARIS:
Dropping
to impulse.

354
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,226
New heading:
O-31 mark 2.

355
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,270
(<i> console beeping</i> )

356
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,147
There's a ship approaching.

357
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,065
It's on
a collision course.

358
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm not reading any ship.

359
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,071
Lieutenant?

360
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:54,665
Permission to be relieved, sir.

361
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,043
I am not well.

362
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,295
Of course.

363
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,099
DOCTOR:
The molecular structures
appear to be stable. Good.

364
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,770
Report.
We've devised
a neural agent

365
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,605
that should inhibit the
Vidiians' motor functions

366
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,733
without causing any
permanent damage.

367
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,236
Good. I don't want to add
to their health problems.

368
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,445
I just want to keep them
from adding to ours.

369
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,073
I'll get to work.

370
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,249
Doctor, when was the
last time you examined
Ensign Wildman?

371
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,877
I performed her annual physical
six weeks ago.

372
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,462
Did you find
anything unusual?

373
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,341
She's in
perfect health.

374
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,509
This may seem
like a strange question,

375
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,346
but I need to know
if she's pregnant.

376
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,307
I'm not at liberty to
disclose that information.

377
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,517
Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

378
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,435
What about
"Captain's orders?"

379
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,605
Sorry. Medical
protocol supersede

380
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,357
your authority
in these matters.

381
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,568
The security of this ship
could be at stake.

382
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,157
She planned on
telling you herself.
Boy or girl?

383
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,326
Female...
half Ktarian,
as a matter of fact,

384
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,536
which should nearly
double the infant's
gestation period.

385
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,580
How did you know?

386
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,669
And they say<i> I'm</i> rude.

387
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,838
CHAKOTAY:
<i>We're receiving</i>
<i>a distress call.</i>

388
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,924
JANEWAY:
<i>Life signs?</i>

389
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,259
KIM:
<i>It's Ocampan.</i>

390
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,718
JANEWAY:
<i>Kes?</i>

391
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,345
KES:
<i>Let me come on board.</i>

392
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,930
TUVOK:
<i>Her ship is accelerating.</i>

393
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,514
<i>It's on a collision course.</i>

394
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,016
KIM:
<i>Hull breach on Deck 9!</i>

395
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,935
JANEWAY:
<i>Emergency force fields.</i>

396
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,686
TUVOK:
<i>She's approaching</i>
<i>Main Engineering.</i>

397
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,147
SEVEN:
<i>State your intentions.</i>

398
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,856
KES:
<i>Let me come on board.</i>

399
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,691
TUVOK:
<i>It's on a collision course.</i>

400
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,110
CHAKOTAY: <i> We're receiving</i>
<i>a distress call.</i>

401
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,028
(<i> overlapping chatter</i> )

402
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,080
Problem?

403
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,172
(<i> grunting</i> )

404
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,635
(<i> groaning</i> )

405
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,095
Hey.

406
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,391
Torres to Sick Bay.

407
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,143
Medical emergency.

408
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,188
20 milligrams lectrazine.

409
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,650
Cortical stimulator.

410
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,777
(<i> groaning</i> )

411
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,699
We'll start at 20 millijoules.

412
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,867
Ready.
Now!

413
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,743
(<i> beeping</i> )

414
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,830
He's gone into
synaptic shock.

415
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,581
I don't understand.

416
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,509
Can I speak with him?

417
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,886
I think it's
best to keep him
sedated for now.

418
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,553
When did this begin?

419
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,473
Earlier this afternoon
in Engineering.

420
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,309
Time... I need
the exact time.

421
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:04,397
Lieutenant Torres called
Sick Bay at 1422 hours.

422
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,361
Computer, display proximity scan
of Lieutenant Tuvok

423
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,197
at 1422 hours.

424
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,869
Oh...
Captain?

425
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,662
Tachyons.

426
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,456
I beg your
pardon?

427
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,417
There was a surge
of tachyon particles

428
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,210
just before Tuvok collapsed.

429
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,212
That could have
triggered this,

430
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,005
but where did
they come from?

431
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,008
They're normally caused
by temporal distortions.

432
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,552
Time travel?

433
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,845
Let me know
if his condition changes.

434
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,475
Kes...

435
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,812
you have telepathic
abilities.

436
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,232
Have you experienced
anything unusual

437
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,942
during the past
couple of days?

438
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,361
Hallucinations,
premonitions?

439
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,697
No, nothing.

440
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,866
If you do, you'll
let me know?

441
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,910
Of course, Captain.

442
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,047
We're low
on neuro-stabilizers.

443
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,757
I'll go replicate some more.

444
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,803
Hurry back.

445
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,763
Where's the tactical data
you promised us?

446
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,390
I'm downloading it now.

447
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,350
I'll transmit it to you
once you've arrived.

448
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,269
I need it now!

449
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,979
Janeway's already suspicious.

450
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,440
If I transmit it now,
I'll be discovered.

451
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,983
That's your problem.

452
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,193
Apparently it's yours, too.

453
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,410
Gentlemen, scan for
tachyon particles deck by deck.

454
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,078
Tachyons?
Do it.

455
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,164
Looking for
something specific?

456
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,748
I'm not sure.

457
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,001
(<i> loud rumbling</i> )

458
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,919
Report!
We're under attack.

459
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,213
A Vidiian ship is closing
on our position.

460
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,965
Battle stations.

461
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,817
We've lost warp drive
and weapons.

462
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,736
They're cutting
through our shields.
Remodulate.

463
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,406
KIM: I'm trying.
They keep matching
the frequencies.

464
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,949
We've still got impulse.

465
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,160
They've taken
out navigation.

466
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,371
I can't plot a course.

467
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,517
They're cutting an access route
through the hull.

468
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,019
Evacuate Deck 3
and seal it off.

469
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,021
Bridge to Sick Bay.
Are you ready with
that neural agent?

470
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,523
DOCTOR:
Aye, Captain.

471
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,982
Stand by to release it
on Deck 3.

472
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,317
Acknowledged.

473
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,027
50 milliliters
should suffice.

474
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,487
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

475
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,988
Doctor!

476
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,615
Doctor to the Bridge.

477
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,534
Environmental controls
aren't responding!

478
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,578
Harry, what's going on?

479
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,079
We've been locked out
of that system.

480
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,872
What do you mean,
"locked out?"

481
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,333
The command relays
have been fused.

482
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,043
They knew
where to find us.

483
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,878
They knew our
shield frequencies,

484
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,047
which systems
to target...

485
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,591
We're being boarded!

486
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,884
CHAKOTAY:
I'm reading
an EM fluctuation.

487
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,428
It could be a transmission.

488
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,431
Location?
Airponics Bay.

489
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,767
Who's down there?
I'm picking up
two bio-readings.

490
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,353
The sensors must
be malfunctioning.

491
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,272
They're both reading as Kes.

492
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,442
Security to Airponics Bay.

493
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,569
Shut down control functions
to that section.

494
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,237
I'm going down there.

495
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,988
Something tells me
we've got more

496
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,907
than one battle
on our hands.

497
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,212
Computer, initiate
site-to-site transport.

498
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,880
Program Kes beta-6.

499
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,758
COMPUTER:
Unable to comply.

500
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,968
Control functions
have been disabled.

501
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,720
(<i> sighs</i> )

502
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,393
(<i> groans</i> )

503
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,978
Shh! Shh!

504
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,147
Shh. I'm taking you home.

505
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,750
We've got weapons back.

506
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,001
Can you target those hooks?

507
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,377
Not at this range.

508
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,837
We'd breach
the upper hull.

509
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,798
It's better than
being dissected.

510
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,510
Reverse the hull polarity.

511
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,886
Maybe we can
shake them loose.

512
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,021
Now, one of you
doesn't belong here,

513
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,941
and I'm guessing
it's you.

514
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,653
Tuvok's premonitions
were real.

515
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,823
You're from
the future.

516
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,826
A future I'm about to change.

517
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,497
You're helping
the Vidiians, Kes. Why?

518
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,543
(<i> groaning</i> )

519
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,216
MAN:
...Security

520
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,806
(<i> panting</i> )

521
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,726
Tell me why you're doing this.

522
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,268
I won't let you hurt her again.

523
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,020
I haven't done anything
to harm her.

524
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,106
You took her from Ocampa--
her home.

525
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,859
She's a prisoner on this ship.

526
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,486
No one's a prisoner here, Kes.

527
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,863
I was a child.

528
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,614
You corrupted me
with your ideas.

529
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:48,990
What ideas?

530
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,701
Exploration, discovery.

531
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,244
I believed you!

532
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,371
(<i> loud explosive rumbling</i> )

533
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,082
Hull polarity
loosened their hold,
but not by much.

534
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,001
It's a start.
Reroute the deflector.

535
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,672
Have it discharge
antigraviton pulses
along the hull.

536
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:07,217
Engage the inertial dampers.
Get a controlled pitch going.

537
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,015
In three years,
I'm going to
leave<i> Voyager</i>

538
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,517
in search of higher things,

539
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,352
because you encouraged me
to do it.

540
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,854
You encouraged me

541
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,647
to develop my
mental abilities.

542
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,107
I wasn't ready.

543
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,025
But what I found...

544
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,236
I couldn't control it.

545
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,238
It scared me.

546
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,031
I had nowhere to go.

547
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,452
I thought
of returning
home to Ocampa,

548
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,288
but I had changed too much.

549
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,582
I knew
they'd be frightened of me.

550
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,461
I knew they wouldn't accept me,
but they'll accept her.

551
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,504
You don't have
to destroy this ship, Kes.

552
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,964
We can help you.

553
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,425
No. I trusted you.

554
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,343
Kes...
No!

555
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,930
(<i> groaning</i> )

556
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,228
We're breaking free!

557
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,439
They're trying to lock on us
with a tractor beam.

558
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,942
Reverse thrusters.
Full power.

559
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,485
That could tear
the hull apart.

560
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,153
Then tear it apart!

561
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,459
Photon torpedoes--
full spread.

562
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,504
Ready!

563
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,005
Fire!

564
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,719
(<i> groaning</i> )

565
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,310
(<i> groaning</i> )

566
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,274
(<i> groaning</i> )

567
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,320
It's set to kill, Kes.

568
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,492
(<i> groans</i> )

569
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,809
Janeway to Bridge.
Status?

570
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,395
CHAKOTAY:
The Vidiians are in retreat.

571
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,188
Everything all right down there?

572
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,525
For now.

573
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,340
She was here...

574
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,217
in my last premonition.

575
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,387
She appeared older.

576
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,849
Her face was tired.

577
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,976
What was she doing?

578
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,145
She had her hands
on the casing,

579
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,148
as if she was drawing
energy from it.

580
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,318
The tachyons
are concentrated here.

581
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,153
It's possible
she needed the core

582
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,322
to travel back in time.

583
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,660
If that's true, then
she'll need it again.

584
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,246
But we don't know
when that'll be.

585
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,041
We have to be ready.

586
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,293
Doctor to the Captain.
Go ahead.

587
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,378
Kes has regained consciousness.

588
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,715
TUVOK:
What do you remember?

589
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,133
I was in Airponics,

590
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,509
and then I felt dizzy,

591
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,095
and then I was
watching myself.

592
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,387
Yourself?

593
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,640
Computer,
deactivate EMH.

594
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,228
What I'm about
to tell you

595
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,855
stays between
the three of us.

596
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,231
Understood?

597
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,525
Yes, Captain.

598
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,778
Something terrible
has happened...

599
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,447
or more precisely,
<i>will</i>  happen.

600
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,991
We're going to need your help

601
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,993
to prevent it
from happening again.

602
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,842
It took exhaustive research,

603
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,012
sifting through
teraquads of data,

604
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,514
separating fact
from rumor...

605
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,810
but eventually,
I arrived at the truth.

606
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,896
Captain...

607
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,321
Happy Birthday.

608
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,991
Thank you.

609
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,869
So, it's not long
before you hit the
big three digits, huh?

610
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,331
Indeed. Have you informed
anyone else of your discovery?

611
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,583
Don't worry, Tuvok,
my lips are sealed.

612
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,378
Well, you're supposed
to blow out the candle.

613
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,380
That is not a Vulcan custom.

614
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,049
Humor me.

615
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,633
CHAKOTAY:
Captain to the Bridge.

616
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,259
On my way.

617
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,471
Well?

618
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,269
It was a fire hazard.

619
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,572
We're receiving
a distress call--

620
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,323
a small vessel on
an intercept course.

621
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,743
Life signs?
One.

622
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,661
It's Ocampan.

623
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,253
I'd almost forgotten.

624
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,590
We're being hailed.

625
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,219
Red Alert.
Raise shields.

626
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,762
Captain?

627
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,388
All hands, this is the Bridge.

628
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,141
Begin emergency
evacuation of Deck 11.

629
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,352
Repeat:
All hands evacuate Deck 11.

630
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,312
You heard her.
Get moving!

631
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,442
Now!

632
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,445
Open a channel.

633
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,743
Kes.

634
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,494
Captain Janeway...

635
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,164
I need your help.

636
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,210
Will you please give me
permission to come aboard?

637
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,003
Of course. What's happened?

638
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,422
Please, let me come aboard.

639
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,803
Her ship is accelerating.

640
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,429
It's on a collision course.

641
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,347
Five seconds to impact.

642
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,058
Tuvok.

643
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,312
Lock on a tractor beam.
Evasive maneuvers.

644
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,774
Shields are holding.
Her ship is intact.

645
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,318
Captain, a transporter was
activated just before impact.

646
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,861
She's beamed aboard.

647
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,451
I'm reading bulkhead ruptures
on Deck 11,

648
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,496
Section 17... 18, 19.

649
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,040
How did you know?

650
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,085
Ready?

651
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,255
Shut down the warp core.

652
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,465
You have the Bridge.

653
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,811
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

654
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,735
(<i> warp core powering down</i> )

655
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,240
KES:
Remember me?

656
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,951
The innocent child
you're here to save?

657
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,912
You blame
Captain Janeway,

658
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,956
but the choice
was yours.

659
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,792
You made the decision
to leave Ocampa,

660
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,338
and you made the decision
to leave<i> Voyager.</i>

661
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,382
If you're watching me now,
you've come back to take revenge

662
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,010
on the people
who cared about you.

663
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,428
That's not who you are,
and that's not who I am.

664
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,640
Don't do this.
Find another way home.

665
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:56,102
Captain Janeway will help you
if you give her a chance.

666
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,897
Try to remember
who you were.

667
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,773
Try to remember me.

668
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,279
Don't you remember?

669
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,406
You made that holo-recording,

670
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,616
because you didn't want
this to happen again.

671
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:16,248
Three years ago,
you traveled back in time.

672
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,876
Kes, you wanted to take
that woman with you,

673
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:24,381
and you were willing
to hand the rest of us over
to the Vidiians to do it.

674
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,091
It didn't work.

675
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,551
You forced me
to kill you, Kes.

676
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:32,222
If you go back now,
it'll all happen again.

677
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,601
Just before this
terrible thing happened,

678
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,104
you told me
you had nowhere to go.

679
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,813
That's not true.

680
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,315
Stay here with us.

681
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,943
I can't.
I don't belong here.

682
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,486
I need to be with
my own people.

683
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,531
You told me you had
the ability to get home,

684
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,452
but you were afraid the Ocampans
wouldn't accept you. Why?

685
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,956
(<i> sighs</i> )

686
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,668
I remember...

687
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,755
What? What do
you remember?

688
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,966
The holo-recording--
I remember making it.

689
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,969
You asked me to help you,
to help myself.

690
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,307
(<i> laughs</i> )

691
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,893
You wanted me to
remember who I was.

692
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,645
(<i> sighs</i> )

693
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:24,316
These years were so
filled with confusion...

694
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,612
and anger. I...

695
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,075
I buried the memory.

696
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,661
I'd almost forgotten.

697
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,878
Does it really matter
which Kes goes home?

698
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:55,221
A few snacks
for the journey home.

699
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,683
You do still
like<i> leola</i> root?

700
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,893
Thank you.

701
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:05,648
What?

702
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,485
Just looking.

703
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,820
See anyone you know?

704
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,823
Only you.

705
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,833
Good-bye, Kes.

706
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,626
Captain.

707
