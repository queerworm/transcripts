Oh, you look like a man
who could use more coffee.

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,592
Keep it coming.

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,219
I'm working on
my monthly ops report.

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,514
So much has happened in
the last few weeks on this ship,

6
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,182
I'm going to be up
all night.

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,810
This firenut blend
should keep your eyes open.

8
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:23,022
Potent stuff. Thanks.

9
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,441
Neelix.
Yes.

10
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,234
I know you have your hands
full this evening,

11
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,444
but I could use your help.

12
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,737
At your service,
Commander.

13
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,405
We're approaching
a class-1 nebula.

14
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,533
Sensors are picking up traces
of protomatter inside.

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,159
I understand you've
dealt with it before.

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,203
Absolutely, when I was
making my living as a trader.

17
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,497
Protomatter's one of the most
sought-after commodities.

18
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,207
It's the best energy source
in the Quadrant.

19
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,709
Well, we could use
your expertise

20
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,669
in collecting a sample.
We're leaving at 1400.

21
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,920
See you in the shuttle bay?

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,964
I'll be there, sir.

23
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,887
These nutritional supplements
are unacceptable.

24
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,095
What's wrong?

25
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,973
They are pungent.

26
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,099
That's the whole idea.

27
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,561
I've been adding
Talaxian spices

28
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,062
to broaden your palate.

29
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,523
My palate is
sufficiently broad.

30
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,483
Why settle for
"sufficient"?

31
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,735
The doctor tells me

32
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,570
you have a full complement
of taste buds.

33
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,030
You've hardly begun
to use them.

34
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,407
Come by the Mess Hall
Thursday night.

35
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,909
It's the first day of Prixin.

36
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,327
We'll have an impressive array
of exotic cuisine.

37
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,495
Prixin?

38
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,497
The Talaxian celebration
of family.

39
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,332
We observe it every year
on<i> Voyager.</i>

40
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,834
Now that you're
part of the family...

41
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,878
What should I do
to prepare?

42
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,170
Nothing.

43
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,672
It's not a mission, Seven.

44
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,925
It's a party.

No bother at all.

"Naomi"... I don't recall
that designation

00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,524
on the crew manifest.

53
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,443
That's because she's not
a member of the crew.

54
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,779
Naomi was the first child
born on<i> Voyager.</i>

55
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm her godfather,

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,741

get her to sleep lately.

No monsters here.

60
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,627
Good.

61
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:10,255
Check the replicator.

62
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,718
Ah. Nothing.

63
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,220
Naomi, maybe Neelix
should check your room

64
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,513
so you can go to bed.

65
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,307
Okay.

Nobody here.

68
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,026
There.

69
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,867
Ah, there's not
a monster in sight.

70
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,577
Can you stay longer?

71
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,579
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

Honey, Neelix has
to go to work.

73
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,041
Oh, it's all right.

74
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,209
You know what I think about
when I'm afraid to go to sleep?

75
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,253
NAOMI:
No. What?

76
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,590
The Great Forest.

77
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,216
What's that?

78
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,927
It's a place my people believe

79
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,679
we're all going to go to
someday.

80
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,724
It's a beautiful, beautiful
forest filled with sunlight,

81
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,477
and all the people who ever
loved me are gathered there

82
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,896
to watch over me as I sleep,
to protect me.

83
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,731
NAOMI:
Really?

84
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,360
Mm-hmm, and when I think about
that forest and those people,

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,487
I'm not afraid to sleep anymore.

86
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,907
Do you think those people
watch over me too?

87
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,826
I know they do.

88
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,872
Now, I'm going to be away
for the next couple of days,

89
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,374
so if you're afraid to sleep,

90
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,877
I want you to think
of that Great Forest.

91
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,170
All right.

92
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,462
Pleasant dreams.

Oh!

Sorry.

99
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,402
I didn't realize you were home.

didn't just roll

all by yourself.

111
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,010

I'm sorry.

00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,599
I'm talking to myself. It's
my way of remembering things.

You are a peculiar creature,
Neelix.

Last time I used
this little wonder,

122
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,865

technological distinctiveness

130
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,465
They were unworthy
of assimilation.

131
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,051
I didn't realize the Borg
were so discriminating.

132
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,302
Why assimilate a species

133
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,345
that would detract
from perfection?

00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:11,551
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51449.2.</i>

183
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,513
<i>After receiving a distress call</i>
from Commander Chakotay,

184
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,473
<i>we've sent a beacon</i>
<i>into the nebula</i>

185
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,809
<i>and we're in the process of</i>
<i>tracking down the away team.</i>

186
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,936
Captain, I'm detecting
a shuttle.

187
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,522
JANEWAY:
Hail them.

188
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,023
No response.

189
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,150
TUVOK:
The shuttle's primary
systems are off-line.

190
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,319
Life signs, only two.

191
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,778
Are they within
transporter range?

192
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,739
Affirmative.
Beam them
directly to Sickbay.

193
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,282
Harry, put a tractor
on the shuttlecraft.

194
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,867
Tuvok, you've got
the Bridge.

195
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,289
I ran a complete
postmortem analysis.

196
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,292
There was nothing
you could have done.

197
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,045
I knew we were too close
to the protomatter.

198
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,422
I should have
said something.

199
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,924
Nobody could have
predicted this, Tom.

200
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,633
How shall I...

201
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,220
proceed?

202
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,973
The Talaxians mourn
their dead for a full week

203
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,768
in a specific
burial ceremony.

204
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,314
And that's just what
we're going to do.

205
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,982
I'll inform the crew.

206
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,612
I'll check Neelix's
personal database,

207
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,781
see what I can find out
about the ceremony.

208
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,367
We'll have it
in the Mess Hall.

209
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,578
Somehow that feels
appropriate.

210
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,496
Neelix is dead.

211
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,039
I'm afraid so.

212
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,542
His neural pathways--
are they intact?

213
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,751
DOCTOR:
Yes,

214
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,545
but there's
no metabolic activity.

215
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,712
How long has he been dead?

216
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,172
Seven, I understand--
How long?

217
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,091
PARIS:
It's been 18 hours.

218
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,009
Then it's not too late
to reactivate him.

219
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,261
What are you saying--

220
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,929
that you can bring
Neelix back to life?

221
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,432
That's precisely
what I'm saying.

222
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,142
The Borg have
assimilated species

223
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,311
with far greater medical
knowledge than your own.

224
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,354
We are capable of
reactivating drones

225
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,357
as much as 73 hours after
what you would call "death."

226
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,192
Neelix wasn't a Borg drone.

227
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,693
We will adapt.

228
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,695
What does this procedure
involve?

229
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,197
Nanoprobes are used

230
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,824
to reverse
cellular necrosis,

231
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,742
while the cerebral cortex
is stimulated

232
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,328
with a neuroelectric
iso-pulse.

233
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,870
But there's nothing
left to stimulate.

234
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,498
His brain functions
are gone.

235
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,292
By your narrow definition
perhaps, but not by mine.

236
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,170
You will extract
70 micrograms of nanoprobes

237
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,339
from my bloodstream.
I will modify them

238
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,799
to match
his Talaxian physiology.

239
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,512
His function in this crew
is diverse.

240
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,389
If you wish to salvage him,
we must proceed immediately.

241
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,807
I say we let her try.

242
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,059
Hold on a minute, Tom,
please.

243
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,316
No one's ever been resuscitated
after being dead for 18 hours.

244
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,194
If this procedure does work,

245
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:38,156
what are the chances that Neelix
would come out of it unaffected?

246
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,533
She's right.

247
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,409
The damage to his cerebral
cortex was severe.

248
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,872
The nanoprobes will compensate
for any cellular degradation.

249
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,917
Captain, a decision
has to be made, quickly.

250
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,003
Doctor, give Seven
whatever assistance she needs.

251
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,171
Proceed.

252
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,589
Captain...
JANEWAY: Do it.

253
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,715
If there's a chance
we can revive Neelix,

254
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,134
we've got to take it.

255
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,512
Keep me informed.

256
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,681
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

257
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,435
( console beeping )

258
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,188
The nanoprobes are ready.
We should begin.

259
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,358
Hold on, I want to check
his blood viscosity.

260
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,485
The cadaver has been
sufficiently prepared.

261
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,112
And they say I have
a lousy bedside manner.

262
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,036
Set neuroelectric iso-pulses
for one-second intervals.

263
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,622
( doctor sighing )

264
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,916
( beeping )

265
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,792
Ready.

266
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,127
Now.

267
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,923
( bio-bed beeping )

268
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,217
Neural activity
at nine percent...

269
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,759
10 percent...

270
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,471
12 percent.
This is incredible!

271
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,972
His intracerebral
blood pressure,

272
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,140
his synaptic responses--

273
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,851
they're all returning
to normal.

274
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,187
The alveoli in his lung
are regenerating.

275
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,564
They should be functional...

276
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,691
( Neelix gasping deeply )
...now.

277
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,487
Neural activity at
52 percent and rising.

278
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,699
( grunting softly )

279
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,660
His neurotransmitter
levels

280
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,994
are rising too fast.

281
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,663
We must stabilize
his motor neurons.

282
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,707
I'm going to try reducing
his acetylcholine levels.

283
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,376
It might be enough to--
NEELIX: Doctor...

284
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,714
Neelix.

285
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,382
What...happened?

286
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,799
What happened?

287
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,302
Why am...

288
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,802
Why am I here?

289
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,939
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

290
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,359
Dead.

291
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,860
For 18 hours,

292
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,113
49 minutes,
13 seconds.

293
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,740
Congratulations,
Mr. Neelix.

294
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,824
You've just set
a new world record.

295
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,705
That's impossible.

296
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,499
You mean,
I lost consciousness.

297
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,958
I-I was--
I was in a coma.

298
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,377
No. You were dead.

299
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,883
I'm stunned.
I'm amazed.

300
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,013
I-I'm grateful.
Thank you, doctor.

301
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,889
Actually, you can
thank Seven of Nine.

302
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,725
The procedure
was her idea.

303
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,268
Yours?

304
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,188
The Borg assimilated
the technique from species 149.

305
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,439
I simply modified it.

306
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,359
But you are welcome.

307
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,905
Am I good as new?

308
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,407
That remains to be seen.

309
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,992
There's no way to tell
if your body

310
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,744
will successfully
take over the functions

311
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,245
the nanoprobes
are serving.

312
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,414
Nanoprobes?
It was necessary

313
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,667
to repair
the necrotized tissue.

314
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,460
Until I'm certain
the damaged tissue

315
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,671
can function independently,
you'll have to be injected

316
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,840
with nanoprobes
on a daily basis.

317
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,511
Well, as long as I don't start,
uh, assimilating the crew

318
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,970
or sprouting Borg implants...

319
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,097
I'm sure
I can live with it.

320
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,766
I'm releasing you
to your quarters.

321
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,434
Your body's
been through quite a shock,

322
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,686
so try to get
some rest.

323
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,103
Report to Sickbay
tomorrow morning

324
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,190
at 0800 hours for
your next injection.

325
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,651
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

326
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,069
( door opens, closes )

327
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,283
The shuttle mission,
was it a success?

328
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,577
Did we get
the protomatter?

329
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,870
I'm afraid not.

330
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,621
The sample you collected
destabilized

331
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,415
before it got back
to<i> Voyager.</i>

332
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,668
Ugh. The containment field needs
to be reinforced next time.

333
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,044
If there<i> is</i> a next time.

334
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,838
I've asked Chakotay
to find out exactly

335
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,297
what caused the accident,

336
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,216
and unless we can take
additional precautions,

337
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,009
I'm not sending another team
into that nebula.

338
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,511
I could help with
that investigation.

339
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,929
No. You are taking
some time off,

340
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,598
and that's an order.
No, Captain, please,

341
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,474
I don't need
any special treatment.

342
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,895
Neelix, you've just
returned from the dead.

343
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,063
Go easy on yourself.

344
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,148
I suppose you're right.

345
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:45,152
But you can't ask me to cancel
the first night of Prixin.

346

is in three days.

00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,700
I've been aging fruit compote
in<i> moolt</i> nectar for weeks now.

349
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,159
I-I can't just let it
go to waste.

350
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,245
Only if you feel up to it.
Oh...

351
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,706
But could you not ferment those
compotes so long this time?

352
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,833
Because last year,
I got a little lightheaded.

353

the necessary adjustments.

00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,535
Alixia?

358
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,832
Why weren't you there?

359
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,047
Human attitudes toward death
are perplexing.

360
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,842
How so?

361
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,844
Too much importance
is placed on it.

362
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,680
There seem to be countless
rituals and cultural beliefs

363
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,475
designed to alleviate their fear
of a simple, biological truth.

364
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,978
All organisms
eventually perish.

365
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,857
I take it the Borg have no fear
of that biological truth.

366
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,234
None. When a drone is damaged
beyond repair, it is discarded,

367
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,612
but its memories continue
to exist

368
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,155
in the
collective consciousness.

369
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:16,369
To use a human term,
the Borg are "immortal."

370
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,538
You are no longer
part of the collective.

371
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,081
You are mortal now,
like the rest of us.

372
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,458
Does that disturb you?

373
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,588
My connection to the Borg
has been severed,

374
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,300
but the collective still
possesses my recollections,

375
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,802
my experiences.

376
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:36,055
In a sense,
I will always exist.

377
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,598
Fascinating.

378
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,433
That must be a great relief.

379
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,435
Yes.

380
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,062
It is.

381
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,608
I've sealed the fractures
in the shuttle nacelle.

382
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,694
The rest of the repairs
should be completed by morning.

383
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,070
Good.
How are you coming?

384
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,363
I found a small
phase variance

385
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,656
in the
transporter logs.

386
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,908
I think it was
responsible

387
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,492
for igniting
the protomatter.

388
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,619
I've remodulated the transporter
beam to compensate.

389
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,039
( beeps )
Good work.

390
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,623
I'll be in Holodeck 2.

391
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,542
I've created a simulation
of the shuttle accident

392
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,961
to see if there's anything
we've overlooked.

393
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,296
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

394
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,799
Commander. Commander,
I thought you might need

395
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,259
some assistance on
the holodeck.

396
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,468
If you're feeling up to it.

397
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,012
Well, I'm up to anything
at this point.

398
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,889
I've been resting
for two days straight,

399
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,974
and resting makes me
feel, well, restless.

400
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,308
( chuckles )

401
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,606
I've programmed
the simulation

402
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,482
to start when we found
the protomatter.

403
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,735
Why don't you monitor
the containment field readings?

404
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,445
( console beeping)
Gladly.

405
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,572
Computer, display
shuttle crew,

406
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,783
excluding myself,
and begin program.

407
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,496
There's a concentration
of protomatter directly ahead.

408
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,999
Set the transporter
for 10,000 AMUs.

409
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,292
Not a particle more.

410
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,795
The containment field
is standing by.

411
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,755
We're in range.

412
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,632
( rumble )

413
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,509
The transporter beam
ignited the protomatter.

414
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,011
Computer,
freeze program.

415
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,387
It looks like there
was a problem

416
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,639
with the pattern buffer.

417
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,307
It might have created
a feedback loop

418
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,642
along the
transporter beam.

419
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,810
Sounds right.

420
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,352
Let's keep
an eye on it.

421
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,229
See what happened
at the moment of impact.

422
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,023
Computer,
resume program.

423
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,567
( rumble )

424
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,111
Shields are weakening.

425
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,613
Shields are down!

426
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,324
I've got the sample, Commander,
and it's stable.

427
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,659
Let's get out of--

428
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,912
( groaning )

429
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,164
Computer,
freeze program.

430
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,668
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

431
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,052
Nothing.

432
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,888
What?

433
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:45,810
I died,
and there was nothing.

434
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,896
There was no one there.

435
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,898
No forest.

436
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,942
Forest?

437
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,236
The Great Forest.

438
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,656
The afterlife.

439
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:02,284
I was taught
that when I died,

440
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,328
my ancestors would be there

441
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,956
waiting for me
by the Guiding Tree.

442
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:13,379
My sisters, my mother
and father, my cousins...

443
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,423
everyone who was killed
in the war.

444
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,842
( shudders )

445
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,802
I took great comfort

446
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:24,140
in knowing that we'd all
be together again one day,

447
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,893
but it's not true.

448
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,019
Maybe we pulled you back

449
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,520
before any of that
could happen.

450
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,022
No.

451
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,025
I was dead for 18 hours.
I should have...

452
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,861
...experienced something.
I should remember<i> something!</i>

453
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,909
It's just a story.

454
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,243
A myth.

455
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,288
There is no Guiding Tree.

456
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,125
No gathering
of the ancestors.

457
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,211
You can't be certain
of that.

458
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,921
Don't throw away
a lifetime of faith

459
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,505
because of one
anomalous incident.

460
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,342
Death is still the greatest
mystery there is.

461
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,011
I was there.

462
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,263
I experienced it.

463
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,890
There was nothing.

464
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,978
Computer, delete characters.
( computer beeps )

465
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,607
That's what's going to happen
to all of us.

466
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,402
Like a hologram, we just...
disappear into nothing.

Attention.

everyone's attention.

You might wanna try the old
"glass and spoon" approach.

474
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,183
"Glass and spoon"?

475
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,187
Excuse me.

Thank you.

Welcome to the first night
of Prixin,

00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,411
the Talaxian observance
of familial allegiance.

480
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,497
This year,
Mr. Neelix has requested

481
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,499
that I
commence the celebration

482
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,459
with the traditional
salutation.

a member of our family.

I don't know how
the rest of you feel,

503

but it scared
the hell out of me.

how to make a pizza...

Fine, Commander, fine.

523
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,897
I apologize for the other day
on the holodeck.

524
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,524
I guess this whole "back
from the dead" thing

525
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,901
is hard to get used to.

you know where to find me.

No.

That's probably

531

because you've been
standing here by yourself.

the rules and procedures

for this type of...
social occasion.

534
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,592
The rules are simple.

535
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,095
Choose a group
of people.

536
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,513
Listen to
their conversation.

537
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,015
Then when you feel

00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,810
like you have something
to contribute, chime in.

539
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,519
"Chime in"?

540
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,479
You say something.

541
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,065
Join the discussion.

542
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,403
( sighs ):
I will try, Captain.

543
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,409
The early stages of Ktarian
development are astounding.

544
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,162
Naomi has grown five centimeters
since her last physical

545
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,495
and that was only
three weeks ago.

546
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,123
It seems like every time
I turn around,

547
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,792
I'm recycling her clothes
back into the replicator.

548
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,210
Children assimilated
by the Borg

549
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,753
are placed
in maturation chambers

550
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,464
for 17 cycles.

551
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,634
Interesting.

552
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,552
Well, if you'll excuse me,

553
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,596
I need to go talk to Neelix.

554
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,933
In these
maturation chambers,

555
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,935
the development of
conversational skills

556
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,272
is, I suppose,
a low priority?

557
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,606
SAMANTHA: Neelix.
Oh!

558
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,817
( tray clangs )
SAMANTHA: I'm sorry.

559
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,277
No, no, no,
it's all right.

560
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,988
We haven't seen you
in a few days.

561
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,741
I've been
a little preoccupied.

562
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,160
I understand.

563
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,870
Naomi's been asking
about you.

564
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,537
Really?

565
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,915
She misses you,
and, frankly, so do I.

566
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,210
She's had trouble sleeping
every night this week.

567
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,711
"Only Neelix
can tuck me in."

568
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,962
"I want Neelix."

569
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,547
Heh, it sounds familiar.

570
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,800
Maybe you could stop by
later just to say hello.

571
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,719
Why don't--

572
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,054
Why don't I go now?

573
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,515
It's close to
Naomi's bedtime.

574
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:58,724
Are you sure?

575
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,558
Prixin's
your favorite holiday.

576
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,644
Yes, but duty calls.

577
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,692
Attention,
all monsters.

578
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,486
Get out of this room!

579
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,279
My bed!

580
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,990
Oh, there's
no monsters here.

581
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,743
Aah! It's a monster!

582
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,537
Hee-hee!
Scared you!

583
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,579
Heh, heh.
You certainly did.

584
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,832
Pleasant dreams,
sweeting.

585
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,377
Can you stay longer?

586
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,422
I want to hear about
the Great Forest again.

587
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,341
The Great Forest?
NAOMI: The special place.

588
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,094
The place you think about
when you can't sleep.

589
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,014
Are you sure you want
to hear about that?

590
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,266
It's just a silly old story.

591
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,808
Please.

592
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,895
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

593
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,230
Well...

594
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,984
it's a beautiful place,

595
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,028
filled with sunlight...

596
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,282
And all the people
who ever loved me.

597
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,702
Yes. They've all
gathered there...

598
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,164
to watch over you,

599
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,665
to protect you
while you sleep.

600
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:09,587
I had a dream about
the Great Forest last night.

601
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,838
You did?

602
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,300
There was trees,

603
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,551
and grass,

604
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,177
and animals.

605
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,554
And I saw you and Mommy,

606
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,473
and we were all happy.

607
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,934
Sounds like a nice dream.

608
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,353
NAOMI:
It was beautiful.

609
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,531
( door opens )

610
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,452
The doctor asked me
to run a hematological scan.

611
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,953
Why?

612
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,662
To regulate the dosage
of nanoprobes

613
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,123
for your next injection.

614
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,379
( beeping )

615
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,839
Go ahead.

616
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,676
How much longer will I
be needing these injections?

617
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:02,055
Until your damaged cells
can function on their own.

618
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,352
I don't really like
the idea of Borg technology

619
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,562
swimming around inside me.

620
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,938
That is irrelevant.

621
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,565
You need the nanoprobes
to live.

622
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,983
"Live"?

623
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,902
Oh, is that what I am doing
right now, living?

624
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,322
I'm beginning to wonder.

625
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,324
By most definitions,
you are alive.

626
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,742
Well, part of me
isn't alive.

627
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,495
Which part
are you referring to?

628
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,455
I don't know,
but something is missing.

629
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,790
I don't feel
like Neelix anymore.

630
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,544
Maybe Neelix is gone.

631
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,547
Maybe he died,
and I'm all that's left.

632
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,507
Stop moving, and allow me
to complete the scan.

633
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:39,677
I-I didn't ask
to be brought back!

634
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,094
You were dead at the time.

635
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,263
Well, what right did you have
to violate me?

636
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,806
You Borg think
you can fix anything,

637
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,392
but you didn't fix me!

638
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,976
There was no alternative.

639
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,228
Just get out.

640
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,230
Just leave me alone!

641
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,648
I said get out!

642
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,983
I would be negligent in
my duties if I did that.

643
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,318
I don't care about
your duties!

644
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,653
I don't care--

645
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,364
( gasping )

646
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,866
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

647
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,410
( groaning )

648
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,413
( instruments beeping )

649
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,039
( gasps )

650
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,292
What's...
What's happening to me?

651
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,711
( choking )

652
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,046
Your cells are reverting
to a necrotic state.

653
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,381
We must get you to Sickbay.

654
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,179
His tissue began
rejecting the nanoprobes,

655
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,890
causing spontaneous necrosis
throughout his body.

656
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,017
We modified the nanoprobes
to compensate

657
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,477
and it appears to be working.

658
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,605
Neelix is stable...
for now.

659
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,231
How do we know
this won't happen again?

660
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,109
We don't. I've designed
a monitor for Neelix to wear

661
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,278
that will alert us
at the first sign of necrosis,

662
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,280
and we'll continue
with the daily injections.

663
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,366
Beyond that,
I'm afraid it's a...

664
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,743
matter of maintenance.

665
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,286
He may have to live with
this condition

666
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,537
for the rest of his life.

667
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,539
He wants to speak
with you, Commander.

668
00:29:55,961 --> 00:30:00,466
Commander...you said
if I ever needed anything.

669
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,594
You once told me
your people had technology

670
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,763
that can induce
a deep meditation,

671
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,556
an altered state of
consciousness.

672
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,141
The<i> akoonah.</i>

673
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:13,812
That this device allows you
to look inside yourself,

674
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,441
ask questions that you might
otherwise be afraid to ask.

675
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,777
That's right.
That's what I need.

676
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,861
I need to look inside
myself...

677
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,530
figure out
what's happening to me.

678
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,365
I need answers.

679
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,951
Will you help me, Commander?

680
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,413
All right...

681
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,582
but I want you to understand

682
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,875
the vision quest isn't
a quick fix.

683
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,378
It'll take time
to interpret the images,

684
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,588
and there's no guarantee

685
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,131
you'll find
what you're looking for.

686
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,091
I understand.

687
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,302
What should I do to prepare?

688
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,596
You'll need a medicine bundle.

689
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:51,725
Items that define you,
things that will ground you,

690
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,977
allow you to take the journey
into yourself.

691
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,105
I'll get ready.

692
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,610
This belonged to
my sister, Alixia.

693
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,403
She made it during
our expedition

694
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,946
to
the Dunes of Talmouth.

695
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,410
A flower from Kes' garden.

696
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:16,792
And last, but not least,
the Guiding Tree.

697
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,045
It stands at the center of
Talaxian afterlife,

698
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,548
deep inside
the Great Forest.

699
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,883
It's there to help us
find our way

700
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,301
when we first arrive.

701
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,429
At least, that's what
I used to believe.

702
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,184
Not a very impressive
medicine bundle, is it?

703
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,602
It'll do fine.

704
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,814
Now, place your hand
on the<i> akoonah.</i>

705
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,610
( beeping )
Am I doing this right?

706
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,404
Try to relax.

707
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,241
Clear your mind of everything
but the objects before you.

708
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,535
Focus on them.
Nothing else exists.

709
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:01,294
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

710
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,672
<i>Ah-koo-chee-moya.</i>

711
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,049
We are far
from the sacred places

of our grandfathers.

713

We are far
from the bones of our people.

00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,223
We come here
seeking guidance.

715
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,518
It's time, Neelix.

716
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,937
Try to leave this room,
this ship...

717
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,397
and go to a place
where you were

718
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:23,191
the most peaceful and content
you have ever been.

719
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,611
That's where your journey
will begin.

720
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,655
( people chatting indistinctly )

721
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,581
Neelix...good
to have you back.

722
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,583
It's-it's good to be
back, Lieutenant.

723
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,089
Alixia?

724
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,596
Alixia, it's me, Neelix!

725
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,931
Over here.

726
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,105
Captain!
My sister--

727
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,274
She was just standing here
talking to you.

728
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,734
The dead girl.

729
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,444
Oh, yes. Very charming.

730
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,363
I can see
the family resemblance.

731
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,907
Alixia!

732
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,536
You will be
assimilated.

733
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,789
No time for that now.
Maybe later.

734
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,791
Potent stuff.

735
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,304
It's... It's beautiful.

736
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:38,141
Yes. It's just like you
always imagined it would be.

737
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,185
The trees, the sunlight,

738
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,395
and all the people
who ever loved you.

739
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:48,193
When I died, I looked for you,
but you weren't there.

740
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,236
Why weren't you there?

741
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,947
Because it's all a lie.

742
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,365
What do you mean?

743
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,702
You've wasted your entire life
believing lies.

744
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,244
The Great Forest.

745
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,540
The afterlife.

746
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,125
It's all created
out of your fear of death.

747
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,627
None of it's real.

748
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,714
If that's true,
what's the point of living?

749
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,008
There isn't any.
That's what

750
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:15,094
you're finally
starting to realize.

751
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,305
( in Naomi's voice ):
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

752
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,516
Tell me about the Great Forest,
Neelix.

753
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,685
Tell me about the trees
and the grass

754
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,062
and all the people
who loved you.

755
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,273
Why are you saying
these things?

756
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,692
( Naomi's voice ):
Scared you!

757
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,450
( gasping )

758
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,206
( thunder rumbles )

759
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,958
( eerie animal calls )

760
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,941
You died on that
shuttlecraft, Neelix.

761
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,234
They never should have
brought you back.

762
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,738
It was a mistake,
and you know it.

763
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,656
Now accept it.

764
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,325
You know what you have to do.

765
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,287
No.

766
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,750
It's all a lie.
They lied to you.

767
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,877
You know what you have to do.

768
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,047
We gather on this day
to tell Neelix what he must do.

769
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,299
You stand alone.

770
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,592
Life is irrelevant.

771
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,010
Let go.

772
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,219
It's pointless.

773
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,388
It's a lie.

774
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,182
You know what you have to do.

775
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,852
( screaming ):
No!

776
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,938
( shudders )

777
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,406
SEVEN:
Neelix.

778
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,700
Oh, there you are.
I didn't see you.

779
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,327
Are you looking
for me?

780
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,203
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I am.

781
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,872
I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

782
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,499
You are not.

783
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,626
I...

784
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:14,047
I want to apologize for
my outburst the other day

785
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,591
in the Mess Hall.
No apology is necessary.

786
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,928
No. No, please,
my behavior was uncalled for.

787
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,554
I didn't mean
the things I said.

788
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,890
I wasn't myself.

789
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,934
But I feel much better now.

790
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,894
Commander Chakotay
has helped me to...

791
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,855
understand a few things.

792
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:33,108
I want you to know
that I don't blame you

793
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,317
for bringing me back.

794
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,194
To life, I mean.

795
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,738
In fact, what you did
was very thoughtful.

796
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,033
I would have done the same
for any member of this crew.

797
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,242
Yes. I'm sure
you would have.

798
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,040
Is there
something else?

799
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,916
No.

800
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,420
Yes.

801
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,881
Seven, I think you've made

802
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,008
a wonderful addition
to this crew.

803
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,509
I know it's been
difficult for you

804
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,221
making the transition
from Borg back to human.

805
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,430
Or half human.

806
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,765
Or whatever it is
you've become.

807
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,809
Actually, you're
just plain Seven to me.

808
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,769
Your point, Mr. Neelix.

809
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,857
I guess I just want to say...

810
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,152
you're surrounded
by people

811
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,319
who care about you.

812
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,946
And whether you
know it or not,

813
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,323
<i>Voyager</i> is going to be
a very good home to you.

814
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,825
It certainly was to me.

815
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,118
Was?

816
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,578
Do you intend to leave?

817
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,707
Leave?
No. I'll be around.

818
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,919
Well...

819
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,130
...good-bye.

820
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,423
Good-bye.

( door opens, closes )

823
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,685
What happened to you
this morning?

824
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,772
I'm sorry I had to cancel
our little chat,

825
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,315
but I was needed
in the Mess Hall.

826
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,151
I've been so busy
the last few days,

827
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,486
I let things slip
around here.

828
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,655
You're not holding up
your end of the bargain.

829
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,532
What do you mean?

830
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,452
When you asked me to guide you
on a vision quest, I agreed,

831
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,455
but I also told you it was part
of an ongoing process.

832
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,540
We're supposed to be
discussing your progress.

833
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,834
What's left to say?

834
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,086
I've told you--

835
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,922
I saw my sister,
the Great Forest.

836
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,174
I feel a sense of peace

837
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,426
I've never felt
in my entire life.

838
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,011
It worked.

839
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,512
You've only lived
with the visions

840
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,889
for a couple of days.

841
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,058
That's not enough time
to draw any conclusions.

842
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,978
You've got to reflect
on the images, examine them.

843
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,272
Allow them to stay alive
in your mind.

844
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,023
A vision quest isn't just
a dream you dismiss

845
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,067
after your first
cup of coffee.

846
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,194
I understand.

847
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,528
Good.

848
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,614
I get off duty
at 1400 hours.

849
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,658
Meet me in my quarters
and we'll begin.

850
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,034
That's an order.

851
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,327

856
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:27,032
I'm grateful for the opportunity
I had to win your respect.

857
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,618
Your strength and your wisdom
were an inspiration to me,

858
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,371
and I can only hope
that your memory of me

859
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,792
will serve to inspire you
in some way.

860
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:42,130
It was an honor to spend my last
years on<i> Voyager</i> with this crew.

861

I want to thank all of you

862

an unauthorized

871
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,413
It's Neelix.

872
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,789
Where's he going?

873
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,084
Looks like he's trying
to beam into the nebula.

874
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,336
Stop him.

00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:25,215

Neelix, respond.

You belong here, Neelix.

886
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,209
Not anymore.
I<i> died</i> in that nebula!

00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,473
What really happened
in your vision quest?

894
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,309
What did you see?

895
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:24,857
My sister, the crew, myself.

896
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,568
They all told me
the same thing--

897
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,571
There's no point in living.
And I agree with them.

898
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,573
I'm sure
those were powerful images,

899
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,533
but there are many ways
to interpret them.

900
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,454
You may be coming face-to-face
with your own fear of death.

901
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,039
Or the manifestation
of your emotional crisis.

902
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,583
Your deepest beliefs
have been thrown into doubt.

903
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,295
It's only natural the vision
quest would reflect that.

904
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:50,508
Eleven years ago,
I saw my world in ruins...

905
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,096
...my family murdered.

906
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,806
All that's kept me going

907
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,517
is knowing that one day
we'd be together again.

908
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,687
That I'd see them again.

909
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,650
But it's not true.

910
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,320
And I can't...live
without that hope.

911
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,570
I understand how this

912
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,656
can change
the way you look at things,

913
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,575
but it can also
lead to an even stronger faith.

914
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,244
You don't know.

915
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,704
You're not there yet.

916

SAMANTHA:
<i>Ensign Wildman to Neelix.</i>

917
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,459
Answer her!

918
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,212
<i>Neelix, please respond.</i>

919
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,674
No.

920
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,135
You're being called
back to your life again, Neelix.

921
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,095
Don't turn
your back on it.

922
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,390
We're your family now.

923
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,518
It's not enough.

924
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:42,768
It is for us.

925
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,063
"His function on this crew
is diverse."

926
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,898
That's what Seven of Nine
said about you.

927
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,192
Even our Borg understands
how important

928
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,027
you are on this ship.

929
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,029
It's not just the duties
you perform.

930
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,907
It's the way you make people
feel when you're around.

931
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,411
That Neelix is gone.

932
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,913
I don't think he is.

933
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,873
Why didn't you
answer me?

934
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:06,543
I had to have the computer
track you down.

935
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:09,504
Naomi thought she saw
a monster in the replicator.

936
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,966
Neelix, what's going on?

937
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,349
I'm trying to decide
some things.

938
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,518
That little girl
needs you, Neelix.

939
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,188
Monsters in the replicator?

940
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,648
Who else on this ship
can handle that?

941
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:42,412
( gulps )

942
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,545
( dramatic theme playing )

943
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,969
Duty calls.

944
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,402
Good night, sir.
He says good night.

945
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,240
Good night, Naomi.

946
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,575
Good night.

947
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,037
What's the matter?

948
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,332
Mommy says
you were sick.

949
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,585
I was, but I'm okay now.

950
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,545
Did a monster
get you?

951
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,550
Yes, I suppose so.

952
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,219
But I chased him away.

953
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,431
Pleasant dreams.

954
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,644
