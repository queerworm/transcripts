1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,589
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,759
Hello?

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,055
(<i> sighs</i> )

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,474
Computer, who activated

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,518
the emergency medical
holographic program?

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,145
COMPUTER:
<i>Auto-initiation</i>
<i>of the EMH program</i>

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,899
<i>occurred when a shipwide</i>
<i>Red Alert was initiated.</i>

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,234
Emergency?

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,445
Sick Bay to Bridge.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,824
Captain Janeway, please respond.

11
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,409
<i>Captain Janeway</i>
<i>is not on board the ship.</i>

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,328
Well, then, who's in command?

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>Internal scans indicate</i>
<i>no crew members are on board.</i>

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,127
You mean, the ship's empty?

15
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,045
<i>Affirmative.</i>

16
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,825
What is
the crew's current location?

17
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,076
<i>Unknown.</i>

18
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,452
Did they go on shore leave?

19
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,204
Are they dead? What?

20
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,625
<i>That information</i>
<i>is not available.</i>

21
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,335
Can you give me
a ship's status report?

22
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,253
<i>Affirmative.</i>

23
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,880
<i>Warp core is off-line.</i>

24
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,299
<i>The ship is restricted</i>
<i>to emergency power</i>

25
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,217
<i>and auxiliary systems only.</i>

26
00:02:56,217 --> 00:03:00,764
<i>Structural integrity breach</i>
<i>on Deck 6, Deck 7 and Deck 12.</i>

27
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,850
<i>Deflector shields inoperative.</i>

28
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,768
<i>Weapons array off-line.</i>

29
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,979
<i>Communications off-line.</i>

30
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,897
<i>Sewage and waste reclamation...</i>

31
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,983
All right, I get the idea.

32
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,609
What caused this damage?

33
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,820
<i>That information</i>
<i>is not available.</i>

34
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,739
Of course it isn't.

35
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,036
Computer, transfer all
Bridge logs to this station.

36
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,453
<i>Accessing Bridge logs.</i>

37
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,956
Replay last log entry.

38
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,415
<i>Heavy casualties...</i>

39
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,834
<i>the warp core's going critical</i>

40
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,045
<i>and the ejection system</i>
<i>is off-line.</i>

41
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,630
<i>I've ordered all personnel</i>
<i>to abandon ship.</i>

42
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,091
<i>Lieutenant Torres and I...</i>

43
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,515
Computer, have any escape pods
been ejected?

44
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:47,519
<i>All escape pods</i>
<i>were launched at 2100 hours.</i>

45
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,064
Scan the ship
for any humanoid life-forms.

46
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:54,484
<i>There are no humanoid</i>
<i>life-forms aboard this vessel.</i>

47
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,780
Well, I'm glad everyone bothered
to say good-bye.

48
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:15,797
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
Stardate 48892.1.

49
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:20,177
It appears that<i> Voyager</i>
has suffered a... disaster.

50
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,138
What kind I don't know,
but one thing is clear.

51
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,724
The crew was forced
to abandon ship.

52
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,685
It would therefore seem

53
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,896
that my usefulness
has come to an end.

54
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,648
I am terminating my program.

55
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,777
If anyone finds this Log,
I can be reactivated by...

56
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,947
(<i> thumping</i> )

57
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,322
Hello?!

58
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,283
(<i> thumping, clattering</i> )

59
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,707
(<i> pounding</i> )

60
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,422
Hello?!

61
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,679
(<i> panting</i> )

62
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,566
Doctor!
What are you doing?!

63
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,569
Sorry. I wasn't expecting
a member of the crew.

64
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,197
The computer said
everyone had left.

65
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,866
The internal sensors
were damaged during the attack.

66
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,077
They must not be reading
every life sign on the ship.

67
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,537
Attack?
The Kazon.

68
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:33,250
Two of their Predator-class
warships took us by surprise,

69
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,836
hit us with a volley
of plasma torpedoes.

70
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,546
It started a core breach,
and we had to abandon ship.

71
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,881
The Captain and I
stayed behind

72
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,382
to see if we could
stop the breach.

73
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,218
At the last second, we did.

74
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,846
Why didn't the crew
return to the ship?

75
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,056
Because they couldn't.

76
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,975
The Kazon tractored
all the life pods

77
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,518
onto their ships.

78
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,729
They went into warp
before we could stop them.

79
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,273
What's wrong?

80
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,276
This tricorder isn't
registering your life signs.

81
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,195
This one isn't working either.

82
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,071
( groans )

83
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,073
You've got to help
the Captain.

84
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,201
She was hit
by a falling support beam.

85
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,618
I didn't want
to risk moving her,

86
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,369
so I had to leave her
on the Bridge.

87
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,872
Can't we beam her
to Sick Bay?

88
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,874
Transporters are down,
so are the turbolifts.

89
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,625
I had to crawl through
31 Jefferies tubes

90
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,836
on five decks to get here.
Then you're going to have to

91
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,546
go back
with a medical kit.

92
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,756
I'll instruct you on how--
You don't understand.

93
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm not going.
You are.

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,635
I'm sending you
to the Bridge.

95
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,637
That would be ideal
if it were possible,

96
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,223
but my projection
system is limited

97
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,765
to the Sick Bay
and the holodecks.

98
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,391
Not anymore.

99
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,393
For the past few weeks,
we've been setting up

100
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,604
holographic emitters
on critical decks.

101
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,566
We were hoping to set up
a remote holo-projection system,

102
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,276
give you access
to other parts of the ship.

103
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,903
Why wasn't I told
about this?

104
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,696
We hadn't even tested
the system yet.

105
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,614
There was no guarantee
it was going to work.

106
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,950
I guess the Captain didn't want
to get your hopes up.

107
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,036
Her compassion
is heartwarming.

108
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,412
But next time, I'd rather
be kept informed.

109
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,498
Where are these
remote projectors?

110
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,251
Decks 1 through 5.

111
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,670
We also put them in Engineering,
the Mess Hall and the Cargo Bay.

112
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,964
All the projectors
are in place,

113
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,717
but the problem is, we're
going to have to interface

114
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,426
with the Sick Bay
imaging system.

115
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,347
That's going to take a lot
of power and computer memory.

116
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,516
I don't know if we have
enough reserve power to spare.

117
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,018
Most of the crew is gone.

118
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,063
Could we divert power
from life support systems?

119
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,981
Good idea.

120
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,482
I can drop
life support down

121
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,193
to minimum levels
on the lower decks.

122
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,404
That should give us
enough power.

123
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,572
All right, I'll need
another 20 minutes

124
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,657
to get the projectors
on line.

125
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,253
All right.

126
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,756
The remote projectors are
charged and ready to go.

127
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,218
Imaging interface... stable.

128
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,304
Are you ready to try this?

129
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,764
I assume there's still
an emergency medical kit

130
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,182
behind the Tactical console?

131
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,226
That's right.
Then I'm ready.

132
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,603
There are a couple of things
you should know.

133
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,980
In order to do this,

134
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,107
I had to recalibrate
your containment field,

135
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,526
so your holo-matrix will be
very sensitive to disruption.

136
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,071
Try to stay away
from energy discharges--

137
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,865
phaser fire, force fields,
that sort of thing.

138
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,742
I'll try.
Make sure you do,

139
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,744
because if your containment
field collapses,

140
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,456
it'll take hours
to reinitialize your program.

141
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,458
Understood.

142
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,126
I'm going to head down
to Engineering

143
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,337
and try to get some of
the critical systems working.

144
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,256
You'll hear from me when I get
the com system back on line.

145
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,425
Unless, of course,
this doesn't work,

146
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,845
in which case, I'll see you
in about five seconds.

147
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,349
Good luck, Doctor.

148
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,933
Thank you.

149
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,102
I have a feeling I'll need it.

150
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,192
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

151
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,486
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

152
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:54,617
Well... it's bigger
than I thought.

153
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,875
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

154
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,757
Captain?

155
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,686
(<i> sighs in frustration</i> )

156
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,785
(<i> moans</i> )

157
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,208
(<i> groaning</i> )

158
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,003
Hello, Captain.

159
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,381
You're going to be fine.
Oh, Doctor.

160
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,133
I see the new holo-projectors
are working.

161
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,594
Lieutenant Torres was able
to get them on line.

162
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,139
Are you feeling any pain,
dizziness, nausea?

163
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,682
I'm a little disoriented

164
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,851
and I have
one hell of a headache.

165
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,645
For some reason, none of
the tricorders are working,

166
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,689
but from what I can tell,
you have a concussion.

167
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,234
I'd like to get you to Sick Bay
as soon as possible.

168
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,320
The last thing I remember is
launching the escape pods.

169
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,572
Lieutenant Torres and I

170
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,323
were trying to stop
the core breach,

171
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,117
and then I blacked out.

172
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,702
You were successful in
preventing the breach.

173
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,122
And the crew?

174
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,749
They were taken prisoner
by the Kazon.

175
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,709
<i>Torres to Bridge.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

176
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,921
Yes, Lieutenant, we hear you.
Go ahead.

177
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,339
<i>Are you all right, Captain?</i>

178
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,633
Fine. I'm glad you
convinced the Doctor

179
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,009
to make a house call.

180
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,386
What's our status?

181
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,388
<i>I've got communications</i>
<i>back on line,</i>

182
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,475
<i>and I think I can reactivate</i>
<i>the warp core, but it'll mean</i>

183
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:46,104
<i>recrystallizing</i>
<i>the entire dilithium matrix.</i>

184
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,315
Keep on it.
In the meantime,

185
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,317
I'll see if I can restore
the Bridge controls

186
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,068
and start scanning
for the Kazon ships.

187
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,861
Aye, Captain.
Torres out.

188
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,948
Doctor, do you know anything
about bypassing a power relay?

189
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,367
Is it anything like
a coronary bypass?

190
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,119
Actually, it is.

191
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,121
Give me a hand.

192
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,040
See this conduit? It's a power
relay.

193
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,417
Its circuits are burnt out.

194
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,085
What we need to do
is reconfigure...

195
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,172
<i>Neelix to Bridge.</i>
<i>Is anyone there? Emergency.</i>

196
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,548
Neelix, this
is the Captain.

197
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,509
What's wrong?
<i>Help, I need help!</i>

198
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,010
<i>I'm in the Mess Hall.</i>
<i>There's a--</i>

199
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,513
(<i> weapon blast</i> )
Neelix, are you there?

200
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,389
Neelix!

201
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,890
With the turbolifts down,

202
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,976
it'll take me a half
hour to get there.

203
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,978
Doctor...

204
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,396
it's up to you.

205
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
I'll use the
remote projectors

206
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,274
to send you
to the Mess Hall.

207
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,109
Stand by for transfer.

208
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,405
(<i> Neelix grunting</i> )

209
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,823
I hope that crushed
your skull,

210
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,699
Kazon pus hog!

211
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,161
Kazon?

212
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:47,457
NEELIX:
What's it like to stare
death in the face, Kazon?

213
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,836
(<i> clattering</i> )

214
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,256
(<i> grunting, mumbling</i> )

215
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,561
Missed me.

216
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,438
(<i> Kazon growling</i> )

217
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,607

(<i> grunting</i> )

219
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,532
NEELIX:
I suggest you surrender now,
Kazon!

220
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,075
The Captain's
on her way.

221
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,786

00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,962
(<i> growling</i> )

226
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,925
(<i> groaning</i> )

227
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,305
(<i> groans</i> )

228
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,558
(<i> sighs</i> )

229
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,101
My best sauté pan.

230
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,769
Good work, Doctor.

231
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,230
You're injured.

232
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,691
(<i> yells</i> )

233
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,192
What's wrong?
Is it serious?

234
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,776
Don't panic, Mr. Neelix.

235
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,237
It looks superficial.

236
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,572
Am I going to die?

237
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,283
Not unless you're
allergic to tomatoes.

238
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,326
That isn't blood.
It's some kind of sauce.

239
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,206
Nondoran tomato paste.

240
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,084
Ooh! That'll leave
a nasty stain.

241
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,919
What are you
doing here, Doctor?

242
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,213
I could ask you
the same thing.

243
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,424
Kes and I were on our
way to the escape pod

244
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,842
when this Kazon fungus

245
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,720
came crawling
out an access hatch.

246
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,930
I kept him occupied long
enough for Kes to get away,

247
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,599
but he didn't
give up so easily.

248
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,807
So I took off running,

249
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,184
he chased me,
and I led him here.

250
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,354
No one gets the best
of me in my kitchen!

251
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,399
I'm fine now.

252
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,443
The question is, are you?

253
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,736
Me?

254
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,279
You're bleeding.

255
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,531
Bleeding?

256
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,366
That's impossible.

257
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,828
Don't panic, Doctor.

258
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,581
It looks superficial.

259
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,042
I'm not programmed to bleed.

260
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,962
Maybe you should
check your program.

261
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,343
Emergency Medical Hologram
to Captain Janeway.

262
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,928
<i>Go ahead, Doctor.</i> 
Captain, we've captured a Kazon.

263
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,474
He's been rendered unconscious
and Mr. Neelix is fine.

264
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,601
But I believe my program
is malfunctioning.

265
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,728
I request that you return me
to Sick Bay immediately.

266
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,396
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Mr. Neelix,</i>

267
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,273
<i>keep an eye on the Kazon</i>
<i>until I get there.</i>

268
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,650
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

269
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,234
No problem, Captain.

270
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,364
(<i> sighs</i> )

271
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,083
Pain?

272
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,670
I'm not programmed to feel pain.

273
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,345
Heart rate?

274
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,013
Blood pressure?

275
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,057
Brain patterns?

276
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,227
(<i> sighs</i> )

277
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,356
Computer, analyze emergency
medical holographic program.

278
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,068
Has it been altered in any way
to include... life signs?

279
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,737
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

280
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,988
<i>Requested program</i>
<i>is not on file.</i>

281
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,866
Not on file?

282
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,201
The program's running right now.

283
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,123
Display schematics for all
Sick Bay holographic systems.

284
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,252
<i>No holographic systems</i>
<i>exist in Sick Bay.</i>

285
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,421

EMH Program AK-1

287
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,760
Diagnostic and Surgical
Subroutine Omega 323.

288
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,762
Check the database
and you'll find it.

289
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,765
<i>Specified program</i>
<i>does not exist.</i>

290
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,101
Well, then, who is

291
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,395
the Chief Medical Officer
on board this ship?

292
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,440
The Chief Medical Officer
of USS<i> Voyager</i>

293
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,525
is Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

294
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,236
Lewis Zimmerman?

295
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:49,031
Yes. He was the engineer
who created my program.

296
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,410
I understand he resembles me,
but he's not on<i> Voyager.</i>

297
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,496
He's at the Jupiter Station
Holo-programming Center.

298
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:01,001
Computer, how long
has Doctor Zimmerman

299
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,712
served on<i> Voyager?</i>

300
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:08,301
<i>Dr. Zimmerman commenced duty</i>
<i>on stardate 48308.2.</i>

301
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,179
48308...

302
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,142
That's the date I was activated.

303
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:21,773
Computer, display all Starfleet
records on Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

304
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,318
He looks a lot like me.

305
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,987
In fact,
he looks exactly like me.

306
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,573
Computer, is this me?

307
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,826
<i>Affirmative.</i>
<i>Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.</i>

308
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,577
(<i> door opens</i> )

309
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,037
Doctor, we've almost got
the warp core back on line,

310
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,039
but we need to know
where the crew was taken.

311
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,041
I want you
to perform an ARA scan

312
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,336
on the Kazon
while we question him.

313
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,630
Is something wrong?

314
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,633
Something's very wrong.

315
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,010
These tricorders
aren't picking up

316
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,179
any of your life signs.

317
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,724
At first, I thought
they were malfunctioning,

318
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,601
but now I find they show me

319
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,355
to be a living, breathing,
bleeding human being.

320
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,606
What?

321
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,149
And that's not all.

322
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,318
According to the computer,
I'm not a hologram.

323
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,363
I'm a real person
named "Zimmerman."

324
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,156
I've been trying
to analyze my program,

325
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,742
but the computer
says it doesn't exist.

326
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,370
This could be a problem
with the remote projectors.

327
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,913
The multiple
holographic signals

328
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,915
may be confusing
the computer.

329
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,667
I'm going to deactivate you

330
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,461
and then reinitialize
your program parameters.

331
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,757
Computer, discontinue emergency
medical holographic system.

332
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,885
See what I mean?

333
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,387
You're right.

334
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,057
Your program's
not anywhere on file.

335
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,227
Computer, shut down
all holographic systems

336
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,812
throughout the ship.

337
00:17:56,283 --> 00:18:00,246
Computer, what happened
to Captain Janeway,

338
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,957
Lieutenant Torres, Mr. Neelix
and the Kazon?

339
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,377
<i>All holographic simulations</i>
<i>were discontinued.</i>

340
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,129
Simulations?

341
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,259
Computer, I'm talking
about real people.

342
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,219
Locate Captain Janeway.

343
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:20,558
<i>Captain Janeway is stored</i>
<i>in memory block 47-alpha.</i>

344
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,978
List all other programs
stored in that memory block.

345
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,192
This is
the entire<i> Voyager</i> crew.

346
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,486
Computer, are you saying
that the crew is nothing more

347
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,447
than a collection
of holographic programs?

348
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,198
<i>Affirmative.</i>

349
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,619
This is ridiculous.

350
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,955
There must be something wrong.

351
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,415
Doctor, am I glad
to see you.

352
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,792
Can you see me?

353
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,252
Of course I can see you.
Who are you?

354
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,588
Sir, it-it's me.

355
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,881
It's Lieutenant Barclay.

356
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,340
Reg... your assistant.

357
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,176
My assistant's name is Kes. Who
are you?

358
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,554
Uh-oh.
What?

359
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,848
Oh, no.

360
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,182
This is bad.

361
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,811
This is...
this is very bad.

362
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,734
Don't panic.

363
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:18,324
Uh... let's just try
to think our way through this.

364
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,909
I'm not familiar with you.

365
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,911
Are you a member of
the<i> Voyager</i> crew,

366
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,080
or have we encountered
another Federation ship?

367
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,082
Oh, boy!

368
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,667
The<i> Voyager.</i>

369
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,170
Oh, boy!

370
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,422
This is going to sound
a little crazy

371
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,384
from your perspective,
but you've got to trust me.

372
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,765
None of this is happening.

373
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,019
This is all
a holographic simulation

374
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,561
that you've been running.

375
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,147
What are you
talking about?

376
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,774
You're in the holodeck
at the Jupiter Station.

377
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,527
Your name
is Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

378
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,530
You're a holo-engineer
and you've been running

379
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,533
a program that's malfunctioning
and we've been trying

380
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,160
to reach you.

381
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,453
What are you saying?

382
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,373
That I'm a... real person?

383
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,959
Well, I always used
to think of you that way

384
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,086
and I-I know your wife
tends to think...

385
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,462
My wife?

386
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,423
We'd, uh...

387
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,176
we'd better take this
one step at a time.

388
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,468
Please do.

389
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,222
Well, uh, you see,
this, uh, starship,

390
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,349
it's not really
a starship.

391
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,977
It was a program
that you wrote

392
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,646
to study
the psychological impact

393
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,775
of long-term isolation
on a crew

394
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,778
made up of Starfleet
and Maquis crew members.

395
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,321
A program I wrote?

396
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,448
That's preposterous.
<i>I'm</i> the program.

397
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,451
<i>Voyager</i> is a real ship,
manned by real people.

398
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,662
I'm afraid not.

399
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,374
This must have something to do
with the radiation surge.

400
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,625
What was that?

401
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,211
Well, we've been
having problems

402
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,754
shutting the program down

403
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,632
because of a kinoplasmic
radiation surge on the station.

404
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,593
It's affected all
of the computer systems,

405
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,096
including the holodecks.

406
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,723
The radiation must be affecting

407
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,017
the memory centers
of your brain.

408
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,104
How did you get in here?

409
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,231
Oh, I'm not really here.

410
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,900
Clearly, I'm here
because we're talking.

411
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,277
You see, what I mean is,

412
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,488
I'm in a control booth
outside of the holodeck.

413
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:25,701
What you see
is a projection of my body,

414
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,411
so that we can communicate.

415
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,663
We've been trying to get in here
or send a com signal in

416
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,998
for nearly six hours.

417
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,917
You expect me to believe

418
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,335
that the past six months
I've spent on this ship

419
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,879
have been nothing
but a simulation?

420
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,589
You haven't been here
six months.

421
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,841
You've only been here six hours.

422
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,593
That's impossible.

423
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,263
I have very clear memories of
my first appearance on<i> Voyager,</i>

424
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,140
meeting Captain Janeway
for the first time.

425
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,308
I've had numerous experiences
aboard this ship.

426
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,977
That's all part
of the simulation.

427
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,562
How do I know you're
not some type of alien

428
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,648
impersonating
a Starfleet officer?

429
00:21:55,648 --> 00:22:00,069
Look, Doctor,
it's very important

430
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,654
that you believe me.

431
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,614
You're losing your
sense of identity.

432
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,782
You're starting to think

433
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,200
that you're part
of the program

434
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,120
and that's...
that's not good.

435
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,164
It's called HTDS--

436
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,707
holo-transference
dementia syndrome.

437
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,584
So now I'm having
a psychotic episode.

438
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,797
No. Yes! I mean,
maybe the radiation...

439
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,842
Doctor, I'm sorry
I have to do this.

440
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,551
How dare you?

441
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,304
It hurt, right?

442
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,140
If you were a program,
it wouldn't hurt.

443
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,475
I-I could be programmed
to think it hurt.

444
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,269
Doctor!

445
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,772
I'll be back.

446
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,858
I've got to discuss this
with the others.

447
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,486
Don't... don't go anywhere.

448
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,200
Pain.

449
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,911
Pain.
Why would I have pain?

450
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,875
I think I'm hungry.

451
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,503
I'm not sure what for,
but I'm definitely hungry.

452
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,714
This is impossible.

453
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,176
The problem is worse

454
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,760
than we thought.

455
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,472
The, uh, radiation is
disrupting the command protocol,

456
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,390
so we can't shut
the program down

457
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,434
and while the program
is running,

458
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,562
we can't access
the holodeck grid.

459
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,689
Why don't you
beam me out of here?

460
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,025
We tried, but the radiation

461
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,860
is interfering
with the transporters

462
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,570
and we can't get a lock on you.

463
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,532
I've consulted with our
neurologist, Dr. Kaplan,

464
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,910
and he said that if we
can't get you out of here

465
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,870
within the next hour,
that the radiation

466
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,874
would completely oxidize
your neuro-cellular structures.

467
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,920
So, what do you suggest?

468
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,547
There's only one way left
to terminate the program

469
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,507
and that's to play it out.

470
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,426
Bring it to its conclusion,
and once the simulation ends,

471
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:52,056
it'll release the access locks
on the holodeck arch,

472
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,599
and we can get you out of here.

473
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,561
How does it conclude?

474
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,480
You programmed
two possible outcomes.

475
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,650
Either<i> Voyager</i> finds its way
back to Federation space

476
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,028
or it's destroyed
in the process.

477
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,573
But the simulation
was designed to run for weeks

478
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,743
before either happens.

479
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,787
But I know of a way

480
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,290
that you can bring it
to an end right now.

481
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,749
Destroy the ship.

482
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,751
Destroy the ship?

483
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,753
Destroy<i> Voyager?</i>

484
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,756
This is just a
simulation, Lewis.

485
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,175
None of this is real

486
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,303
and unless you
destroy this ship

487
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,180
that you think you're on,

488
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,974
you're going to die.

489
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,153
No. No, absolutely not.

490
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,405
Doctor, it's the only way.

491
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,240
First of all,
I don't even know

492
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,783
how to destroy the ship.

493
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,701
Second of all, I wouldn't
do it even if I could.

494
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,246
And third, how do I know
you're not an alien intruder

495
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,497
trying to trick me
into killing everyone?

496
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,835
Well... those are
good questions.

497
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,840
First, I can tell you
how to destroy the<i> Voyager.</i>

498
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,550
Second, if you don't do it,
you're going to die.

499
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,180
And third... well,
I'm just not an alien

500
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,349
and I don't know how else
to convince you of that.

501
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:20,144
If what you're saying is true,
why don't you destroy the ship?

502
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,395
Why do I have to do it?

503
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,230
You're the one running
the simulation.

504
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,732
It's coded to respond
to your input,

505
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,151
not mine.

506
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,526
I'm sorry, Mr. Barclay--

507
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,237
if that's what your
name really is--

508
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,281
but you're not
very convincing.

509
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,450
Here. Use this tricorder.

510
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,953
Scan the room out
to a distance of 15 meters.

511
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,750
This appears to show
a wall 15 meters away

512
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,836
and it does have a holodeck
grid configuration.

513
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,671
You see?
But you could be manipulating

514
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,423
these readings.
Scan me!

515
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,717
You'll see I'm
a holographic projection

516
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,593
originating
from beyond that wall.

517
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,597
Yes. All right.

518
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,933
But it could still be
an elaborate deception.

519
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,559
I can't take that risk.

520
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,854
There has to be some way
to convince you.

521
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,776
Oh, I know.
I'll be right back.

522
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,905
(<i> concerned voices</i> )
MALE:<i> Orderly! Here.</i>

523
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,323
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

524
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,283
Are you the Emergency
Medical Hologram?

525
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,953
Yes, of course I am.
Well, we've got wounded here.

526
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,543
I've seen this patient before.

527
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,253
He has multiple
percussive injuries.

528
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,963
Tricorder.

529
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,590
Medical tricorder.

530
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,803
I've been in this moment
in time before.

531
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,889
What? What are you talking
about? Help this man.

532
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,891
Have we just been catapulted
across the galaxy

533
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,726
to an unknown area
of the Delta Quadrant?

534
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,478
Yes.
And you are developing

535
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,729
tumorous growths on your chest.

536
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,106
What?
Ah, so...

537
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,648
that hasn't happened yet.

538
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,192
Is this stardate 48308?

539
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,194
Look, are you going
to help this man or not?

540
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,238
I'm not. Mr. Barclay.

541
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,906
The program must
be malfunctioning.

542
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,700
Let me see if I can reset
the holographic projector.

543
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,786
Mr. Barclay, will
you please return?

544
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,079
Now do you believe me?

545
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,915
This is the beginning
of the simulation.

546
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,292
We can't shut down
the program,

547
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,586
but we can restart it.

548
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,921
This is my
first memory

549
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,299
of being activated on<i> Voyager.</i>

550
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,967
Who the hell
are you?!

551
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,345
Did I program Mr. Paris
to be so annoying?

552
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,721
Actually, I programmed him.

553
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,848
I modeled him
after my cousin Frank.

554
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,852
Hmm...
Computer, delete Paris.

555
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,687
What are you...?

556
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,608
What did you do to him?

557
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,650
Computer, delete Kim.

558
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,987
Hmm.

559
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,572
Are you convinced yet?

560
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:40,159
Let's just say that your
credibility level is rising,

561
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,953
but I'm still not prepared
to destroy<i> Voyager.</i>

562
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,913
So what are you
going to do now?

563
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,584
I need to confirm
my true nature,

564
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,588
whether or not I am
in fact a real person.

565
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,715
Let's just say
that I'm right

566
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,135
and this is a real ship,
and I'm a hologram.

567
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,513
If I were to destroy the
holographic memory core,

568
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,598
then I should disappear.

569
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,643
Yes, but if you destroy it
and you're still here...

570
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,394
Then I'm not a hologram.

571
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,980
And you'll know
that I'm telling you the truth.

572
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,525
The holo-memory core is
located in Engineering.

573
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,900
Let's go.

574
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,986
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

575
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,656
What's wrong?

576
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,367
The remote holo-projectors
were taken off line.

577
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,785
I shouldn't be able
to exist outside Sick Bay.

578
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,371
That's because you're a...

579
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,582
A real person. Yes.

580
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,460
I'm getting the idea.

581
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,464
Magnetic constrictors
are on line.

582
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,049
The warp core is stable.

583
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,593
Let's get started
on those plasma relays.

584
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:40,927
You. Who are you?

585
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,804
I'm the Emergency
Medical Hologram.

586
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,098
I didn't know you could be
projected into Engineering.

587
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,600
I can't,
but it's a long story.

588
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,310
I'd rather not get
into it right now.

589
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,854
Fine. We have three wounded
crew members over here.

590
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,523
I'm afraid I have
a more pressing matter

591
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,358
to attend to, Captain.
What do you mean,

592
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,610
you have a more pressing
matter to attend to?

593
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,737
And who are you? I don't
recognize you.

594
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,407
Oh, don't mind me. I'm just
assisting the Doctor.

595
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,908
Doctor, I am ordering you

596
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,868
to take care
of these wounded crew members.

597
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,038
Computer, delete Janeway.

598
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,082
The program's not responding
to vocal commands.

599
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,917
The protocols are
starting to freeze up.

600
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,294
We don't have much time.
Jarvis, Parsons,

601
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,214
put these men under arrest.

602
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,258
Don't worry.
Those phasers aren't real.

603
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,301
They're just holograms.
I wouldn't be so sure.

604
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,637
I was injured earlier.

605
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,514
That means
the holodeck safeties are off.

606
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,307
Now just a moment.

607
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,975
Let's not do
anything hasty.

608
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,436
Who are you?

609
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,979
Are you two responsible
for bringing us here?

610
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,441
Actually, no.

611
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,485
The Array you discovered
is controlled by an entity

612
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,279
you will come to know
as the Caretaker

613
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,197
or banjo-man.

614
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,742
He's actually an alien life-form
who is caring for a species

615
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,368
known as the Ocampa,
who live nearby.

616
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,953
Enough.

617
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,747
I don't know what
this is all about,

618
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,040
but clearly, you're involved.

619
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,542
Take them to the brig.

620
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,711
I'll question them later.
DOCTOR: Mm, no,

621
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,380
I don't think so.
You're in no position to argue.

622
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,132
I'm not arguing. I'm simply
pointing out

623
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,384
that in several seconds, the
entire crew of<i> Voyager</i>

624
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,927
will be transported
to the Array,

625
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,262
where you will be tortured

626
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,972
and probed for
medical information.

627
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,015
It will be quite painful,
but not fatal.

628
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,517
<i>Bridge to Janeway.</i>

629
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,478
<i>We're being scanned</i>
<i>by the Array, Captain.</i>

630
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,812
<i>It's penetrated our shields.</i>

631
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,565
What kind of scan?
Bridge?

632
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,192
Janeway to Bridge.
Respond.

633
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,197
What are you--?

634
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,367
Time is running out, Doctor.
The oxidation levels

635
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,911
in your neural tissues
are rising.

636
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,538
You've got
to destroy this ship

637
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,165
and bring this program
to an end.

638
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,667
First things first.

639
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,877
I have to make absolutely
sure what I am.

640
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,599
This is the central
memory nexus

641
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,768
for all holographic
systems on board.

642
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,311
If I destroy this,

643
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,605
there won't be a single
hologram left on<i> Voyager.</i>

644
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,064
Well, except for me.

645
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,567
I'm being projected from
outside the simulation.

646
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,197
Go ahead.

647
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,740
Give it a try.

648
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,216
Convinced?

649
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,345
DOCTOR:
Computer, what is the status

650
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,764
of the holographic
imaging system on<i> Voyager?</i>

651
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,851
The holographic imaging system
has been destroyed.

652
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,602
Are there any
holographic programs

653
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,771
running anywhere on the ship?
<i>Negative.</i>

654
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,774
Then why is the ship still
here and not a holo-grid?

655
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,984
<i>Please restate the question.</i>

656
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,487
You said all holo-systems
were destroyed.

657
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,614
Why is the ship simulation
still running?!

658
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,659
<i>All holo-simulations</i>
<i>have been terminated.</i>

659
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,246
Doctor, I-I know this
is a little confusing,

660
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,540
but try to remember
that you just destroyed

661
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,543
the holographic imaging system
on a holographic ship--

662
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,670
A hologram
in a hologram.

663
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,255
If you want
to bring this to an end,

664
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,632
you've got to destroy
the entire simulation,

665
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,426
the ship itself.

666
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,222
Then it's true.

667
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:16,226
I am... a real person.

668
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,354
And you're a person
in great danger.

669
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,941
Destroy the ship
now, before it's too late.

670
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,068
(<i> sighs</i> )

671
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,028
But if I'm wrong...

672
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,697
Doctor, you've got
to believe me.

673
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,866
What else can I do
to prove it to you?

674
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,535
I know, I know,
but it's just so...

675
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,789
(<i> groans</i> )
There.

676
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,040
You see what's
happening?

677
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,543
Holograms don't
feel pain.

678
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,714
Your brain is being flooded
with kinoplasmic radiation.

679
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,966
You're dying.

680
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,928
I... I guess you're right.

681
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,471
Oh...!

682
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,266
What should I do?

683
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,351
The warp core.

684
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,523
Even set on full power,

685
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,525
it's going to take
a sustained phaser burst

686
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,569
to punch through
the outer duranium shielding.

687
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,614
Set your phaser
to maximum.

688
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,241
Aim for the magnetic
constrictors.

689
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,663
Ready?
Ready.

690
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,539
CHAKOTAY:
Stop!

691
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,291
Doctor,
don't listen to him.

692
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,835
He's lying.

693
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,801
Step away from the warp core,
Doctor.

694
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,594
Don't do anything
that man tells you.

695
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,847
You're in danger if you do. None
of this is real.

696
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,056
So I've been told.

697
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,142
It's all
a holographic simulation.

698
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,729
That's right, but it's not
the simulation you think it is.

699
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,440
Everything around you is part
of a holographic projection

700
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,233
that's being created
by your program.

701
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,653
My program?
You're on the holodeck

702
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,070
on<i> Voyager.</i>

703
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,823
The Captain suggested
you take a day off,

704
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,783
try a holo-novel,
so you did.

705
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,827
But while you were running
the holo-novel,

706
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,871
there was a kinoplasmic
radiation surge

707
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,121
in the imaging system.

708
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,207
It created a feedback
loop between

709
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,543
the holodeck computer
and your program.

710
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,713
All of this,
including Mr. Barclay,

711
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,882
is a holographic simulation

712
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,967
generated by your codes,
subroutines

713
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,677
and memory
circuits.

714
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,095
Don't be distracted by these
holographic characters.

715
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,765
Stay focused on
what you need to do,

716
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,685
destroy the warp core.

717
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,355
Wait a minute.

718
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,316
The entire crew of<i> Voyager</i> 
was just taken by the Array.

719
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,151
They won't be back
for three days.

720
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,486
So what's he doing here?

721
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,072
The program is
malfunctioning.

722
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,575
Are you the real
Commander Chakotay

723
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,745
or a holographic projection
like Mr. Barclay?

724
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,580
I'm a projection.

725
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,416
I'm really at the holographic
control station in Engineering.

726
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,125
You're trapped on the holodeck.

727
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,086
We've been monitoring
the program from here

728
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,005
and we've been trying
to reach you for hours.

729
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,925
Sounds familiar.
He told me the same thing.

730
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,969
Doctor, do you remember
coming into the holodeck

731
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,931
and running a holo-novel
within the last six hours?

732
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,849
No.

733
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,267
No, I don't.

734
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,810
That's because your memory
circuits

735
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,687
are being eradicated
by the feedback loop.

736
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,689
We have to get you
off the holodeck.

737
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,275
Transfer you back
to Sick Bay.

738
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,151
You don't have
memory circuits.

739
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,863
You have a mind, and
it's being damaged.

740
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,657
Destroy the<i> Voyager,</i> 
the program will end

741
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,077
and we can get you
off the holodeck.

742
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,870
That's not true, Doctor.

743
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,789
Because of the feedback loop,

744
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,917
if you destroy the simulation,
you will be destroyed as well.

745
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,710
Me?

746
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,503
If you shut down
this simulation,

747
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,214
your program will be wiped out
right along with it.

748
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,884
There'll be no way
to retrieve the lost data.

749
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,302
You'll be gone.

750
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,431
Oh...

751
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,558
(<i> moans</i> )

752
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,560
Only real people
experience pain.

753
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,353
You've got to believe me.

754
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,982
What you're perceiving as pain
is really the feedback loop

755
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,191
eradicating your
memory circuits.

756
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,364
What...

757
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,199
what is it you
want me to do?

758
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,576
Don't do anything.

759
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,328
We're working on the
problem right now.

760
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,246
We're close to a solution.

761
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,834
Do nothing
and you'll die.

762
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,461
(<i> groans</i> )

763
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,964
Doctor... trust me.

764
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,716
KES:
Trust me, Lewis.

765
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,301
Kes?

766
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,261
Yes, you know me.

767
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,763
You remember me.

768
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,849
Yes.

769
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,517
You're my assistant.

770
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,893
BARCLAY:
I told you.

771
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,436
His brain is being damaged.

772
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,772
He's losing his memory.

773
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,233
This is Kes Zimmerman,
your wife.

774
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,195
CHAKOTAY:
This is all
a holographic delusion

775
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,822
drawn from people
and experiences

776
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,449
in your own memory circuits. You
are malfunctioning.

777
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,994
Lewis, please, listen to Reg.

778
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,662
He's trying to help you.

779
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,497
Destroy this program.

780
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:51,001
If you listen to her, you'll
end up destroying yourself.

781
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:53,753
KES:
Believe in yourself.

782
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,421
You're not a program.

783
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:59,342
You're a real,
flesh-and-blood human being...

784
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,053
and you're my husband.

785
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,471
I don't want to lose you.

786
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,476
Lewis...

787
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,104
how would you rather
think of yourself,

788
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:14,149
as a real person
with a real life,

789
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,609
with a family that loves you,

790
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:22,782
or as some<i> hologram</i>
that exists in a Sick Bay

791
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:27,328
on a starship
lost in deep space?

792
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,206
This isn't about what you want.

793
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:32,125
This is about what you are.

794
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,544
Just because you're made
of projected light and energy

795
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,004
doesn't mean
you're any less real

796
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,589
than someone made
of flesh and blood.

797
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,008
It doesn't matter
what you're made of.

798
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:43,386
What matters is who you are.

799
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,388
You're our friend.

800
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,724
And we want you back.

801
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,559
Lewis, please.

802
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,186
Pick up the phaser.

803
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,230
Destroy the warp core.

804
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,065
It's your only hope.

805
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,028
Doctor...

806
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,488
we're close
to getting you out of here.

807
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,407
Try to hold on.

808
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,456
Whatever happens,

809
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,127
I just want you
to know I love you.

810
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,131
I...

811
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:20,506
I always wanted

812
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,425
to tell you, Kes...

813
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,723
that you're beautiful.

814
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,227
Thank you.

815
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,112
What's going on?

816
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,405
We were able to shut down
the holodeck simulation

817
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,116
that your program
was generating.

818
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,700
Commander Chakotay
transferred you

819
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,119
back to Sick Bay.

820
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,121
You seem to have
suffered no damage.

821
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,916
What really happened?

822
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,169
<i>Voyager</i> encountered
a subspace anomaly,

823
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,254
which created
a kinoplasmic radiation surge

824
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,964
throughout
most of our computers.

825
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,548
Unfortunately,
it happened

826
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,467
while you were
using the holodeck.

827
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,262
We've been working
for the past six hours

828
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,931
to get you out of there.

829
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,975
So there was never
a Kazon attack.

830
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,392
KES:
That's right.

831
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,145
And the crew didn't really
abandon ship.

832
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:18,190
No. In fact, except
for the computer problems,

833
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,066
it has been an uneventful day.

834
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:25,322
And who is this Lieutenant
Barclay I imagined?

835
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,573
Barclay was part
of the original engineering team

836
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,284
that designed your program.

837
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,370
He was in charge of testing
your interpersonal skills.

838
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,292
Oh.

839
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,460
This should make
an interesting paper.

840
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,753
<i>Chakotay to Sick Bay.</i>

841
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,380
<i>Is the Doctor all right?</i>

842
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,631
Yes, Commander.

843
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,300
His program is
functioning normally.

844
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,426
<i>Good work. As soon as you're</i>
<i>finished there,</i>

845
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,347
<i>I want all senior officers</i>
<i>to report to the Bridge.</i>

846
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,390
Acknowledged.

847
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,352
It's good to have you back,
Doctor.

848
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:58,188
Well... I suppose
I should begin cataloguing

849
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,440
the niotrinate samples
I was working on this morning.

850
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:11,076
So you really think
I'm beautiful.

851
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:14,412
I was under a great deal
of stress, you understand.

852
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,788
I may have said things

853
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,375
that are not necessarily
my true feelings.

854
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,127
Oh.

855
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,296
Then you don't think
I'm beautiful.

856
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,464
I didn't say that, exactly.

857
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,967
I... I consider you very...

858
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:32,138
very attractive...
in a platonic sense.

859
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:36,142
I see.

860
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,311
Then you don't really love me?

861
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,980
I'm afraid not.

862
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,069
(<i> sighs</i> )

863
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,241
Then I guess
our marriage is over.

864
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,410
Our marriage?

865
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,995
Are you making a joke?

866
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,039
It isn't a joke
to me, Lewis.

867
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,791
I know we
have problems,

868
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,043
but I think we
can solve them.

869
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,212
No.

870
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,173
No... this-this can't be right.

871
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,716
Something's wrong here.

872
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,385
It's not too late, Lewis.

873
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,887
You can still save yourself
by destroying the warp core.

874
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,180
No...

875
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,848
(<i> groans</i> )

876
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,184
No, I don't believe you.
None of this is real.

877
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,145
It's all a delusion.
Somebody help me!

878
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,562
I am helping you.

879
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,274
Listen to him, Lewis.
No!

880
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,489
Doctor, are you
listening to me?!

881
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,450
That man needs help!

882
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,623
JANEWAY'S VOICE:
Try to calm down, Doctor.

883
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,667
Everything's going to be fine.

884
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,754
Doctor?

885
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,258
Do you know who I am?

886
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,927
Do you know
where you are?

887
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,764
I appear to be on
the holodeck grid.

888
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,475
That's right.

889
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:02,187
And do you know
what you are?

890
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,605
Yes. I'm...

891
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,817
I'm the emergency
medical holographic program.

892
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,694
Right?

893
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,654
Right.

894
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,450
Well, I assume
everything that's happened

895
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,285
took place here
on the holodeck?

896
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,079
CHAKOTAY:
That's right. We encountered
a subspace anomaly

897
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,041
and there was a radiation
surge in the computer system.

898
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,127
And Kes is my assistant...

899
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,753
not my wife?

900
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,130
Your wife?

901
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,841
Never mind.

902
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,385
Captain, if it's okay,

903
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,553
I'd like to return
to Sick Bay now.

904
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,096
Of course.

905
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,307
It's good to have you back,
Doctor.

906
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,726
It's good to be back.

907
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:45,063
Computer, transfer
EMH program to Sick Bay.

908
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,779
We were married?

909
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,325
It was a delusion, of course.

910
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,161
I understand...
but I'd still prefer it

911
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,414
if you didn't tell
Neelix about this.

912
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,333
He tends to get
a little jealous.

913
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,168
It'll be our secret.

914
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:12,840
I am curious about one thing.
What's that?

915
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,426
The radiation surge

916
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:16,344
caused my program to malfunction

917
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,264
and my codes and circuits
began to degrade,

918
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:23,601
and yet, instead of detecting
that threat to my program,

919
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,644
I experienced
an elaborate delusion

920
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,022
concerning the nature
of my existence,

921
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,400
human or hologram.

922
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,945
Person... or projection.

923
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,905
Why?

924
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:39,700
Why would my program focus
on such an esoteric dilemma?

925
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,412
Well...

926
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,873
I sometimes ask
those kind of questions.

927
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,875
Who am I?

928
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,420
What am I doing here?

929
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,713
What's my purpose in life?

930
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,549
Doesn't everybody?

931
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,092
Not me.

932
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,011
I know exactly who I am
and what my purpose is.

933
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,763
I am
the Emergency Medical Hologram

934
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,640
aboard the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

935
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,936
Are you sure about that?

936
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:16,613
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

937
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,892
Hmm.
