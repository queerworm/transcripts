1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,921
CHAKOTAY:
Its trajectory is erratic.

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,423
And our sensors aren't detecting
any stellar or planetary

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,884
gravitational fields that could
account for its motion.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,928
Then you're saying
it isn't a comet.

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,388
And yet, it looks,
feels and tastes

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,265
just like a comet.

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,142
Well, there's a slight chance

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,645
there are magnetodynamic forces
acting on the comet

9
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,691
that are too subtle
for our sensors to detect.

10
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,777
Or it might be something
we've never encountered before.

11
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,570
B'Elanna, go down
to Transporter Room 2.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,990
Let's beam aboard a sample
for examination.

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,491
Aye, Captain.

14
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,077
Harry, see if you
can lock onto a core fragment.

15
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,873
Having no trouble penetrating
the crust, Captain.

16
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,916
<i>Janeway to Torres.</i>

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,960
<i>We're ready when you are,</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,504
Setting up a class-3
containment field, Captain.

19
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,964
Field in place.

20
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,008
<i>Commence transport.</i>

21
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,300
Energizing.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,773
Hello.

23
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,775
My name is Q.

24
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,594
Torres to Janeway.

25
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,387
You'd better get down here,
Captain.

26
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,806
<i>Problem, Lieutenant?</i>

27
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,141
Yes, ma'am.

28
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,851
That transport from the comet--

29
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,019
it brought a man aboard.

30
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,355
He says his
name is Q.

31
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,816
Red Alert.
I'll be right down.

32
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,653
Oh, please don't
bother, Captain.

33
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,404
Let me take you
to lunch instead.

34
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,120
What a pleasure
it is to meet you.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,538
Oh, am I doing
this right?

36
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,123
It's been so long
since I've had

37
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,749
the opportunity
to greet anyone.

38
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,669
Oh, uh... here.
Take a seat.

39
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,671
Allow me to make the
setting more appropriate.

40
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:33,755
(<i> crew gasp</i> )

41
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,717
My name is Kathryn Janeway

42
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,926
Captain of
the Federation--

43
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,636
Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

44
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,513
Yes, yes.
I know all that.

45
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,974
Look-- Welsh rabbit

46
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,893
like your grandfather
used to make.

47
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,312
Rabbit? She never told me
she likes rabbits.

48
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,356
What is a rabbit, anyway?

49
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,150
Is this some new chef
she's interviewing?

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,693
Q2:
Please, eat.

51
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,196
It's the least I can do
to express my appreciation.

52
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,697
Appreciation for what?

53
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,699
For letting me out
of my captivity.

54
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,619
You were being held
against your will

55
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,704
inside the comet?

56
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,497
In a manner of speaking.

57
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,042
And you...

58
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,335
all of you...

59
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,881
you're mortals,
aren't you?

60
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,883
Who was holding you prisoner?

61
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,678
And you...

62
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,057
only live for nine years.

63
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,225
That's right.

64
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,268
Oh, how I envy you.

65
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,895
Why is that?

66
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,899
Because the one thing
I want more than any other

67
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,235
is to die.

68
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,654
Look... I don't know
what you want here,

69
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,033
but I know who you are.
Every Captain in Starfleet

70
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,743
has been briefed about
your appearances

71
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,578
on the<i> Enterprise,</i>
and I'm warning...

72
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,747
My... my appearances?

73
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,500
Oh, you've
mistaken me for...

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,420
Oh, well, no matter.

75
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,338
I really must get on
with my business

76
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,507
before the others
realize I'm here.

77
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,927
(<i> clears throat</i> )

78
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,512
When someone
asks you about me,

79
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,975
and they will,
would you tell them I said...

80
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,392
You know, I've had 300 years

81
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,436
to think of appropriate
last words.

82
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,189
I wanted something... memorable,

83
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,983
you know?
Quotable.

84
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,234
(<i> chuckles</i> )

85
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,318
(<i> clears throat</i> )

86
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,695
Would you tell them I said,

87
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,698
"I die not for myself

88
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,408
but for you."

89
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,537
I know.

90
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,123
I... I know.

91
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,083
Enigmatic, provocative.

92
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,502
They'll understand.

93
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,505
Well... good-bye to you all.

94
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,674
Many thanks.

95
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,510
Here's the end of me.

96
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,517
Oh... dear.
That's not right.

97
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,019
<i>Torres to Janeway.</i>

98
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,561
<i>All the men have disappeared.</i>

99
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,855
I'm aware of it,
Lieutenant.

100
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,439
Report to the Bridge.
Janeway out.

101
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,774
Bring them back now.

102
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,277
Oh, oh. Of course,
of course.

103
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,991
I'm... a little
out of practice.

104
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,375
Well... that's that,
I'm afraid-- they're gone.

105
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,128
Gone? Where?

106
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,839
Just... gone.

107
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,507
Oh, I apologize

108
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,842
for the inconvenience.

109
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,140
Well, good luck
to you all.

110
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,725
I really have
to be going now.

111
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,977
Return my crew.

112
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,770
I...

113
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,981
I'm not sure how.

114
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,484
Humans...

115
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,029
humans...

116
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,406
Who would have more recent
experience with humans?

117
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,620
What have you done now, Q?

118
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,591
Well, now, isn't this just fine.

119
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,551
Humans aren't supposed
to be in this Quadrant

120
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,053
for another hundred years.

121
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,889
I didn't bring them here.
Nothing to do with me.

122
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,640
How did you get out, Q?

123
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,393
I'm afraid
we're responsible for that.

124
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,728
Oh, well, I guess that's what
we get for having a woman

125
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,854
in the Captain's seat.

126
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,439
You know, I was betting

127
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,524
that Riker would
get this command.

128
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,527
May I assume you're the Q
I've heard so much about?

129
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,654
Have you heard
about little me?

130
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,906
Oh, do tell.

131
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,657
Has Jean-Luc been
whispering about me

132
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,868
behind my back?

133
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,123
Say, is this a ship
of the Valkyries

134
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,540
or have you human women

135
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,211
finally done away with
your men altogether?

136
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,421
There was a slight accident.

137
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,797
A<i> slight</i> accident?

138
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,506
Oh, let me guess.

139
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,134
You were trying
to commit suicide.

140
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,804
Now you see why
we've locked him up

141
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,222
for the last 300 years.

142
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,149
Facial art!

143
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,152
Ooh, how very wilderness of you.

144
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,278
Captain?

145
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,905
All right, Q,
we should be going.

146
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,198
I'm not leaving.

147
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,076
Captain Janeway,
I demand asylum.

148
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:13,994
This is a joke.

149
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,745
Q2:
No, it isn't.

150
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,123
I am officially asking you,
Captain, to grant me asylum

151
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,709
and give me protection
from my enemies, which is him.

152
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,295
You would ask
these puny humans

153
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,255
to protect you
from me?

154
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,381
Fat chance.

155
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,009
What did you
do to him?

156
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,635
Nothing.

157
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,595
He's still there
in the 24th century.

158
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,930
I just took
the rest of us

159
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,849
to an old hiding
place of mine.

160
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:36,975
(<i> rumbling</i> )

161
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,643
Report.

162
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,813
Captain, there are
no stars outside.

163
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,606
Well, that's partially accurate.

164
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,566
Actually, there's no
universe outside.

165
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,902
On screen.

166
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,404
Commander?

167
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,781
CHAKOTAY:
I'm showing a large buildup

168
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,616
of baryonic particles.

169
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,244
Perfectly normal.

170
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,620
Captain, based on our readings,

171
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,664
it appears we've been
transported back in time

172
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,041
to the birth of the universe.

173
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,338
Very old hiding place.

174
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,382
Oh, I know all
the hiding places, Q.

175
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:12,677
I hid here from
the Continuum myself once.

176
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,305
This ship will not survive
the formation of the cosmos.

177
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,765
Yes, but just think of the honor
of having your DNA spread

178
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,726
from one corner of
the universe to the other.

179
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,188
Why, you could be the origin
of the humanoid form.

180
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,982
Q-- either Q--
get us out of here.

181
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,527
You heard the lady, Q--
back to your cell.

182
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,490
PARIS:
We're under attack.

183
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,533
By a ship?

184
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,202
By... by...

185
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,912
I'm not sure
what they are.

186
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,665
KIM:
Captain, I don't believe this,

187
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,794
but according to my readings,
we're being attacked by protons.

188
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,963
We've been reduced
to subatomic proportions.

189
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,340
He'll never find us here.

190
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,552
Mr. Tuvok, see if
you can release

191
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,720
a positive ion charge
to repel them.

192
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,973
Ready or not, here I am.

193
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,060
Now what?

194
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,770
Checking.

195
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,399
We seem to be tethered
to some kind of large...

196
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,608
plant.

197
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,570
Let's see it.

198
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,825
Computer, I need a wider angle.

199
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,881
<i>You can't hide from me, Q.</i>

200
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,925
And you can't take me by force.

201
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,303
I'll stalemate you for eternity
if I have to.

202
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,012
The hell you will.

203
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,056
The vaunted Q Continuum--

204
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,559
self-anointed guardians
of the universe.

205
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,185
How dare you come
aboard this ship

206
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,147
and endanger this crew
with your personal tug-of-war?

207
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,191
<i>Did anyone ever tell you you're</i>
<i>angry when you're beautiful?</i>

208
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,154
PARIS:
We're back where we
started from, Captain.

209
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,280
Doesn't matter.

210
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,697
I'm not going back
into that cell.

211
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,325
How would you like
to spend eternity

212
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,201
as a Gorokian midwife toad?

213
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,870
Oh, just try it.

214
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,248
Stop.

215
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,958
You want asylum?

216
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,793
Fine.
We'll have a hearing.

217
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,420
A hearing!

218
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,713
You would have me
put his future

219
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,257
into your delicate
little hands?

220
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,385
Oh, so touchably soft.

221
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,053
What is your
secret, dear?

222
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,599
When the Captain
of a Starfleet vessel receives

223
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,059
an official request for
asylum, there is a clear

224
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,603
procedure to follow.

225
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,981
I suggest, to end your deadlock
and to save my ship,

226
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,359
that we follow it to the letter.

227
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,778
Well, this could go on for
a millennium or two, I suppose.

228
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,281
All right, I accept
on behalf of the Continuum

229
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,158
on one condition--

230
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,618
if you rule in our favor,

231
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,078
Q agrees to return
to his confinement.

232
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,913
Q2:
I have a condition
of my own.

233
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,832
If you rule in my favor,

234
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,294
then the Continuum
must grant me mortality.

235
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,879
Why?
So you can kill yourself?

236
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,838
Exactly.

237
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,216
Accepted.

238
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,677
Q:
Well, this is going to make
for an amusing diversion.

239
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,929
Will you send him to prison
for eternity

240
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,433
or will you assist
in his suicide plan?

241
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,060
That's a toughie,

242
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,563
but then again, that's why
they made you Captain, isn't it?

243
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,023
To handle
the real tough ones.

244
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,068
My, my. Now I guess
we get to find out

245
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,445
whether the pants...

246
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,406
really fit.

247
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,790
Am I interrupting
anything?

248
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,209
I am curious.

249
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,628
Have the Q always had
an absence of manners,

250
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,921
or is it the result

251
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,881
of some natural
evolutionary process

252
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,883
that comes
with omnipotence?

253
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,427
What?

254
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,971
Oh, you mean just popping
in whenever we feel like it?

255
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,016
That is one
relevant example.

256
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,269
I apologize.
At some point along the way,

257
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,811
I guess we just
stopped thinking

258
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,689
about the little niceties.

259
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,107
So it seems.

260
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,610
But you mustn't
think of us as omnipotent,

261
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,362
no matter what the Continuum
would like you to believe.

262
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,239
You and your ship seem
incredibly powerful

263
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,491
to life-forms without
your technical expertise.

264
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,535
It's no different
with us.

265
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,287
We may appear omnipotent to you,

266
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,331
but believe me,
we're not.

267
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,666
Intriguing.

268
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,836
Just what vulnerabilities
do the Q have?

269
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,506
Always looking for the tactical
advantage, Mr. Tuvok.

270
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,425
Very good.

271
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:24,053
As a matter of fact,
that's why I've come to see you.

272
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,514
In a way,
our vulnerability

273
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,974
is what this is all about.

274
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,392
As the Q have evolved,

275
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,478
we've sacrificed many things
along the way--

276
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,314
not just manners,
but mortality,

277
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,190
and a sense of purpose,

278
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,611
and a desire for change,
and a capacity to grow.

279
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,615
Each loss is a new
vulnerability...

280
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,784
wouldn't you say?

281
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,452
Why are you
telling me this?

282
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,955
Because I want you
to represent me at the hearing.

283
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,831
Me?

284
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,917
I have no legal expertise.

285
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,503
But I need someone
who understands

286
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,505
Federation asylum practices.

287
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,423
Besides...

288
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,509
Vulcans approve of suicide.

289
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,178
It is true that Vulcans

290
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,013
who reach a certain
infirmity with age

291
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,931
do practice ritual suicides.

292
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,767
Nevertheless, I fail to see

293
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,268
how that fact would
be meaningful

294
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,353
in this circumstance.

295
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,065
I have the right to counsel,
Mr. Tuvok.

296
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,900
Will you assist me?

297
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,079
Let me begin by stating clearly

298
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,415
that I expect all parties
to act appropriately

299
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,751
and with respect
for these proceedings.

300
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,086
I will not have this hearing
turned into a circus.

301
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,171
Is that clear?

302
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,386
Is that clear, Q?

303
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:50,557
Madam Captain,
we are dealing here

304
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,142
with an issue of the greatest
importance to the Q Continuum.

305
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,270
I can assure you, we take
this matter<i> very</i> seriously.

306
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,522
Thank you.

307
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,399
And please don't call me
"Madam Captain."

308
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,903
Since you've made it clear

309
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,489
that your asylum
would lead to suicide,

310
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,616
you place me
in a difficult position.

311
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,827
I understand, Captain.

312
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,371
May I ask you why
you want to commit suicide?

313
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,332
As difficult as it is
for you to imagine,

314
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,084
for me,
immortality is impossible

315
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,711
to endure
any longer.

316
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,961
In the Continuum,

317
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,756
an individual
has an obligation

318
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,466
to be responsible to the path
his life will follow.

319
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,093
Q:
"His life
will follow."

320
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,636
Emphasize life.

321
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,638
Q2:
I never yielded

322
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,139
that obligation
to the Continuum.

323
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,726
If the path I choose
leads to death,

324
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,644
what right have they
to interfere?

325
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,937
He's putting his selfish wishes

326
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,898
above the welfare
of everyone else.

327
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,566
And if I don't agree
with the majority,

328
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,068
I'm to be locked up
for eternity.

329
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,445
You would not be confined

330
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,988
if you were not intent
on harming yourself.

331
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,699
With your permission, Captain,

332
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,160
I would like to call
an expert on the Continuum

333
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,623
to discuss the implications
of the decision to be made.

334
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,665
Proceed.

335
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,919
I call myself to the stand.

336
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,588
Ta-da!

337
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,839
Thank you
for coming.

338
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,633
It's a rare honor
to have someone

339
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,427
of your reputation
and accomplishment

340
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,305
with us today.
Thank you.

341
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,515
Tell me, what
would be the impact

342
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,975
of a Q suicide?

343
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,478
Oh, it would be an interruption
to the Continuum.

344
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,980
It would change
the very nature of Q.

345
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,857
Can you be more specific?

346
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,569
No, because we're not even sure
what the end result would be.

347
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,614
His suicide could have all sorts
of unknown consequences

348
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,573
for the Continuum.

349
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,575
Q2:
Precisely!

350
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,161
It would force the Q
to deal with the unknown

351
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,497
for the first time
since the new era began.

352
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,790
They're afraid of me

353
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,460
because they're afraid
of the unknown.

354
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,713
How would you characterize
his remarks?

355
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,675
No Q has ever tried
to commit suicide.

356
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,887
Immortality is one of the
defining qualities of being a Q.

357
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,348
By every measure
of the Continuum,

358
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,058
his remarks would have
to be considered as...

359
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,019
mentally unbalanced.

360
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,355
Q LAWYER:
Mentally unbalanced.

361
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,149
And no civilized people
in the universe,

362
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,360
including the primitive
Federation societies,

363
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,446
would condone
the suicide

364
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,573
of a mentally
unbalanced person.

365
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,284
TUVOK:
Tell me, Q,

366
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,037
can you offer any other evidence
of mental instability

367
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,539
on the part of my client?

368
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,999
What more do I need?

369
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,917
He wants to kill himself.

370
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,004
In fact, until this issue arose,
he was known in the Continuum

371
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,588
as one of your great
philosophers.

372
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,423
Is that not true?
Not anymore it isn't.

373
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,011
So your entire basis for
judging him mentally unbalanced

374
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,429
is his wish to commit suicide.

375
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,932
I submit
that is a faulty premise.

376
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,184
In many cultures,
suicide is acceptable

377
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,854
and in and of itself
cannot be used as evidence

378
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,439
of mental illness.

379
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,401
I tend to agree with Mr. Tuvok.

380
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,320
Oh... Vulcans!
Oh... Vulcans!

381
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,989
Isn't it true
that on occasion,

382
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,909
the Continuum has executed Qs
for certain crimes?

383
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,076
On rare occasions, yes.

384
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,327
Didn't their deaths

385
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,079
create an interruption
in the Continuum?

386
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,915
Their crimes created
the interruption.

387
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,500
Their deaths ended it. I know
where you're going with this.

388
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,710
Do you?

389
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,920
And it's not going to work.

390
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,504
Our society, like any other,

391
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,715
must control
its disruptive elements.

392
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,426
An execution may be undesirable,
I grant you that,

393
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,135
but on some rare occasions,

394
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,179
it is necessary
and warranted,

395
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,515
and a decision to proceed
is made only after

396
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,184
great deliberation
by the entire Continuum.

397
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,396
You cannot imagine the chaos
that would be created

398
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,398
if individuals like Q here

399
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,983
could choose between
life and death.

400
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,777
This is a matter
of social order

401
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,862
versus anarchy.

402
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,782
I understand.

403
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,325
And you find
nothing contradictory

404
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,870
in a society
that outlaws suicide

405
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,330
but practices
capital punishment?

406
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,960
No.

407
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,920
Any other questions, Lieutenant?

408
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,549
(<i> whispering</i> )

409
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,470
Just one other thing.

410
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,013
Isn't it true that you yourself

411
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,140
were once accused
of being mentally unstable

412
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,059
by the Continuum?
Were you not disciplined

413
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,685
for inappropriate behavior?

414
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,728
Objection.

415
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,688
I'll allow the question.

416
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,233
My record has been expunged.

417
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,111
I will take that as a yes.

418
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,236
Thank you.

419
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,905
That is all.

420
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,615
You're excused.

421
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,160
Q:
If I may beg
the court's indulgence,

422
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,745
I have other witnesses to call.

423
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,788
To what end?

424
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,205
Your Captain Honor,

425
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,834
I am here to argue
for the majesty of life--

426
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,044
what it means
for us to be alive.

427
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,129
A Q's life takes him

428
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,922
to all corners
of the universe.

429
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,842
This Q's life has
touched and affected

430
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,051
many, many others--

431
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,178
including some on
your own homeworld.

432
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,471
With your permission,

433
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,515
I would like to call
some of those people

434
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,059
whose lives have been
changed by this Q.

435
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,687
You want to bring people
here from Earth?

436
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,522
I promise
it won't impact the timeline,

437
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,940
and no one will remember

438
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,860
ever having been here
after I send them back.

439
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,403
This is most unusual.

440
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,280
Do you have any objection,
Mr. Tuvok?

441
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,241
I am as curious
as you are, Captain.

442
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,329
Very well.

443
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,665
Proceed.

444
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,752
Q!

445
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,171
What the hell is going on?

446
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,297
My apologies,
Commander...

447
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,883
To you all.

448
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,593
My name is
Kathryn Janeway.

449
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,014
Captain Janeway,
the USS<i> Voyager.</i>

450
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,641
That's correct,
Commander.

451
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,893
You're aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

452
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,310
We're lost

453
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,104
in the Delta Quadrant,
and as much as I wish

454
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,898
you could tell them
that when you get home,

455
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,151
your memories will be wiped
before you get back.

456
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,236
God, if you let me
live through this,

457
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,739
I promise I'll clean
up my act-- I swear.

458
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,323
I demand an
explanation!

459
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,784
Why are you dressed
like this, young man?

460
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,912
Man, have you looked
in a mirror lately?

461
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,747
Allow me to try to
explain, Mister...?

462
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,831
Ginsberg.

463
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,709
Maury Ginsberg.

464
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,253
Sir Isaac Newton.

465
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,337
William Riker.

466
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,296
Nice to meet you.

467
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,257
Consider for a moment

468
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,009
that it might
be possible

469
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,886
to travel
forward in time--

470
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,180
say, to the 24th century--

471
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,057
onto a starship...

472
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:10,352
75,000 light-years
from Earth.

473
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,277
You're having
a very strange dream

474
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,446
and in this dream,
you are seeing this man

475
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,074
whom you've
all met before.

476
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,243
Yes, I have seen
that man before.

477
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,203
You were sitting
under the tree the day...

478
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,580
The day the apple
fell on your head.

479
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,998
Yes, that's right.

480
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:31,958
Quite a day, wasn't it?

481
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,459
As a matter of fact,

482
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,378
this man jostled the tree
when he got up to leave.

483
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,714
Just before
the apple fell-- yes.

484
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,134
And a new era in human
science was born.

485
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,887
Wait a minute! Weren't you
the guy in the jeep?

486
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,349
The "guy in the jeep"

487
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,560
who picked you up after
your own vehicle broke down

488
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,561
that summer afternoon.

489
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,562
Isn't that right?

490
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,190
Oh, man, he was a lifesaver.

491
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,025
My van died,
and they dragged it off the road

492
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,193
because of all the traffic.

493
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,569
It was backed up for miles.

494
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,989
You were on your way to a job,
weren't you?

495
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,658
Yeah, I was supposed to be on
the follow spot up in Tower 3.

496
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,118
I never
would have made it in time

497
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,535
if it weren't for him.

498
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,663
Hey, whatever happened
with that groovy chick

499
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,832
with the long red beads
in the back seat?

500
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,916
I've been looking for her

501
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,168
ever since
you dropped me off.

502
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:18,254
You'll see her again,
don't worry.

503
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,547
To sum up, you were
a spotlight operator

504
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,258
at an outdoor concert
of some sort,

505
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,759
a concert
that was put in jeopardy

506
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,303
moments before it was to begin

507
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,638
because the entire
sound system failed.

508
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,015
Oh, it was no big deal.

509
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,017
Somebody must have snagged
an extension cord

510
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,810
with one of the trucks,
that's all.

511
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,229
I'm just lucky I noticed it.

512
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,523
Yes. Lucky you were at the right
place at the right time,

513
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,859
or it would have taken days
to track down the problem

514
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,485
and there would
have been no concert.

515
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,155
RIKER:
Well, I'm sorry to say

516
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,448
I have met him,
but I've never seen

517
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,825
this man
before in my life.

518
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,035
Are you sure?

519
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,536
Has it not been established

520
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,997
that my client has been
in captivity during all

521
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,456
of Commander
Riker's lifetime?

522
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,710
Have you seen
this photograph before?

523
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,714
Sure I have.

524
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,050
That is Colonel
Thaddeus Riker

525
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,010
after he was wounded
at Pine Mountain.

526
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,179
They used to call him
"Old Iron Boots."

527
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,639
He was in command
of the 102nd New York

528
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,309
during General Sherman's
march on Atlanta.

529
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,062
This picture was
taken in 1864,

530
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,980
just after they let him out

531
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,065
of the army
hospital.

532
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,358
And the soldier beside him?

533
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,197
I'll be damned.

534
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,490
It's him.

535
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,951
As a matter of fact,

536
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:35,497
he carried your wounded ancestor
back from the front line...

537
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,582
Didn't you?

538
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,002
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

539
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,963
My point is, Captain,

540
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,674
Q has had a profound influence
on these three lives.

541
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,218
Without Q,

542
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,220
Isaac Newton would
have died forgotten

543
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,222
in a Liverpool
debtor's prison--

544
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:54,767
a suspect in several
prostitute murders.

545
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,643
Without Q,

546
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,313
there would have been
no concert at, uh...

547
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,773
Woodstock.

548
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,191
Wherever.

549
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,609
More importantly,

550
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,028
Mr. Ginsberg would never
have met his future wife

551
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,614
"the groovy chick
with the long red beads"

552
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,117
and he would never have become
a successful orthodontist,

553
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,327
settled in Scarsdale
with four kids.

554
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,287
Far out.

555
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,996
Yes.

556
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,750
Without Q, there would have been
no William T. Riker at all,

557
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,085
and I would have lost

558
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,920
at least a dozen
really good opportunities

559
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,381
to insult him
over the years.

560
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,674
Oh, and lest I forget...

561
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:31,762
without Q, the Borg would
have assimilated the Federation.

562
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,471
Thank you.

563
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,848
Thank you.

564
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,725
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

565
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,353
This is the life that Q
treats without respect.

566
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,440
This is the life that he would
give up so easily.

567
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,234
May I remind this hearing
and my learned colleague,

568
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,986
that for the last
three centuries,

569
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,323
my client has not been
allowed contact with anyone.

570
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,325
At this time, we would
like to reproduce

571
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,368
the environment in which
he has been confined.

572
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,369
I object.

573
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,579
No...

574
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,248
I'll allow this.

575
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,466
TUVOK:
These are the conditions

576
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,550
my client will be forced
to live in for eternity

577
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,761
if you deny him
asylum, Captain.

578
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,473
We just want to give him time
to reconsider his position.

579
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,350
I will never
change my mind!

580
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,600
This is your own doing.

581
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,311
You could live
a perfectly normal life

582
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,479
if you were simply willing

583
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,980
to live a perfectly
normal life.

584
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,190
I've seen enough.

585
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,400
Please return us
to the hearing room.

586
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,612
I would submit
that the quality of life

587
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,365
my client will have to endure

588
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,200
should be considered
in this proceeding.

589
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,993
I don't like
those conditions

590
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,120
any more than you do,
Mr. Tuvok,

591
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,706
and I wouldn't want
to spend another day there

592
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,082
if I were you, Q...

593
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,586
but I'm here to rule
on a request for asylum,

594
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,214
not to judge the penal system

595
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,049
of the Q Continuum.

596
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,592
And he does have a point--

597
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,303
you were confined to prevent you

598
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,514
from doing harm
to yourself.

599
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,641
I've been doing
a great deal of research,

600
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,686
studying a variety of
cultural attitudes on suicide

601
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,855
to help me frame the basis
of a decision.

602
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,524
Mr. Tuvok, are you familiar

603
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,942
with the "double effect"
principle on assisted suicide

604
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,694
that dates back to
the Bolian middle ages?

605
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,821
I believe it relates
to the relief of suffering,

606
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,407
does it not, Captain?

607
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:19,161
It states, "an action
that has the principle effect

608
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,122
"of relieving suffering
may be ethically justified

609
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,042
"even though the same action
has the secondary effect

610
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,461
of possibly causing death."

611
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,923
This principle is the only thing
I can find

612
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,883
that could possibly convince me
to decide

613
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,134
in your favor, Q.

614
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,635
And yet,
as I look at you,

615
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,430
you don't seem,
by our standards,

616
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,559
aged, infirm or in any pain.

617
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,727
Can you show this hearing
that you suffer

618
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,479
in any manner
other than that caused

619
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,190
by the conditions
of your incarceration?

620
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,443
Any suffering that would justify

621
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,361
a decision to
grant you asylum?

622
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,658
May I request a recess

623
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,703
to consider
our response, Captain?

624
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,292
Granted.

625
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,877
We're going to
lose, aren't we?

626
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,170
I would say
we have not yet

627
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,256
convinced Captain Janeway

628
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,508
of the validity
of our argument.

629
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,303
You're doing a fine
job, Mr. Tuvok.

630
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,888
It's nice to know
someone believes in me.

631
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,307
I am representing
your position

632
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,267
to the best
of my ability.

633
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,312
It is most definitely
not my own.

634
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,939
I see no persuasive evidence

635
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,690
that a life like yours
should be wasted

636
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,818
simply because
you are disgruntled.

637
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,528
Frankly, I see no logic

638
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,946
to your position.

639
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,198
You...

640
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,284
you surprise me, Mr. Tuvok,

641
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,497
which is a rare and special gift
to a Q. Thank you.

642
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:49,667
But may I say, if only you knew
what life as a Q were like,

643
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,919
you would see the logic.

644
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,254
Then perhaps

645
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,299
what we should do next
is take this hearing

646
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,884
to see life
in the Continuum itself.

647
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,892
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

648
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,894
<i>I'm determined</i>
<i>to find a better alternative</i>

649
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,938
<i>to suicide or endless prison,</i>

650
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,859
<i>so I've summoned the advocate Q</i>
<i>to make him a proposal.</i>

651
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,152
Yes, what is it,
Captain?

652
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,820
Come to the next
session of the hearing

653
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,572
and announce that
the Continuum is ready

654
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,907
to reintegrate Q
into your society--

655
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:24,244
that you won't condemn him
to that cell for eternity.

656
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,622
And you will rule
in our favor?

657
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,291
I would consider it
a very meaningful gesture

658
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,668
by the Continuum.

659
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,002
How would you know

660
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,962
if I intended
to keep my word?

661
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,215
Based on my research,

662
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,300
you have been
many things--

663
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,177
a rude, interfering,

664
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,595
inconsiderate,
sadistic...

665
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,596
You've made your point.

666
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,972
...pest!

667
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,140
And, oh, yes...

668
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,476
you introduced us
to the Borg--

669
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,768
thank you very much--

670
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,479
but one thing you
have never been

671
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,523
is a liar.

672
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:57,110
I think you've uncovered
my one redeeming virtue.

673
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,405
Am I blushing?

674
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:03,283
I wish I could help you,
Kathy, I just can't.

675
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,578
We're dealing here
with the most dangerous man

676
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,620
in the Continuum.

677
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,622
Now, I didn't tell you this,

678
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:12,209
but one of his
self-destructive stunts

679
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,335
created a misunderstanding

680
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,754
which ignited
the 100-year war

681
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,048
between the Romulans
and the Vulcans.

682
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:22,636
No. This man goes back
into his confinement,

683
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,264
<i>but...</i> I would like to make it

684
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,391
easier for you.

685
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:31,729
The Continuum is prepared
to do you a little favor...

686
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,899
if we approve
of your ruling.

687
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:39,278
Look out the window.

688
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,835
Now you see it,
now you don't.

689
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,421
(<i> puffs</i> )

690
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,554
(<i> sighs</i> )

691
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,516
We are prepared
to illustrate the nature

692
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,934
of Q's suffering, Captain,

693
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,479
but in order to do so,
we must show this hearing

694
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,105
what life is like
in the Continuum.

695
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,982
And how do you
intend to do that?

696
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,152
By going to
the Continuum itself.

697
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,028
Is this possible?

698
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,196
No, it's a
ridiculous idea.

699
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,448
You would
never understand.

700
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,865
My client has
the right to ask

701
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,660
for an inspection
of the living conditions

702
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,453
that lead to his
suffering, Captain.

703
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,746
I would agree with that.

704
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,750
I suppose you have
some crazy idea

705
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,875
how to pull this off?

706
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,918
Yes.

707
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,631
Only if...

708
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,133
Fine, fine.

709
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,553
We've agreed on a format
for this little sojourn,

710
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,764
but I still believe
it's ill-advised.

711
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,141
I'll be the judge of that.

712
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,978
Whenever you're ready.

713
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,397
No, no.

714
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,655
This is
the Q Continuum--

715
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,365
a road in a desert?

716
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,658
I told you so.

717
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,285
This is a manifestation
of the Continuum

718
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,330
that we hope falls within
your level of comprehension.

719
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,332
This way.

720
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,024
(<i> pinball clattering</i>
<i>and clanking</i> )

721
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:56,956
Good afternoon.

722
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,088
Q2:
I apologize for their lack

723
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,297
of hospitality, Captain.

724
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,716
We're not used
to visitors here.

725
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,927
In fact, you're the only
ones who've ever come.

726
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,970
Then what is the
purpose of the road?

727
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,305
The road...

728
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,349
takes us to the rest
of the universe,

729
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,435
then it leads back here...

730
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,645
an endless circle.

731
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,105
This was your
existence

732
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,398
before your
confinement?

733
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,902
I traveled the road
many times...

734
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,070
sat on the porch,
played the games...

735
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,782
been the dog... everything.

736
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,366
I was even the scarecrow
for a while.

737
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,992
Why?

738
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,454
Because I hadn't done it.

739
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,290
Oh, we've all done
the scarecrow. Big deal!

740
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,750
JANEWAY:
I can't say I

741
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,627
entirely understand
what I'm seeing here,

742
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,503
but these people
don't seem to be suffering.

743
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,589
Q:
Well, of course not.
They're happy people!

744
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,132
Happy people!

745
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,092
What's there to
feel sad about?

746
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,761
Look at them.

747
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,222
They don't dare feel sad.

748
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,850
If only they could,
that would be progress.

749
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,811
Oh. The philosopher speaks.

750
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,688
When I was
a respected philosopher,

751
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:07,152
I celebrated the continuity,
the undeviation of Q life.

752
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,363
I argued that our civilization
had achieved a purity

753
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,283
that no other culture
had ever approached

754
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,494
and it was wonderful...

755
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,329
for a while.

756
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,038
At the beginning of the new era,

757
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,584
life as a Q was
a constant dialogue of discovery

758
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,963
and issues and humor
from all over the universe,

759
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,339
but look at them now.

760
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,299
Listen to their
dialogue now.

761
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,092
I am afraid I cannot hear any.

762
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,720
Because it has all been said.

763
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,098
Everyone has heard everything,
seen everything.

764
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,352
They haven't had to speak
to each other in ten millennia.

765
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,980
There's nothing left to say.

766
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,774
Well, I don't know about you,
but I appreciate a little peace

767
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,526
and quiet
now and again.

768
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,862
It's ironic, isn't it, Q?

769
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,279
I don't know what you mean.

770
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,656
Of course you do.

771
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,657
That you, of all people,

772
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,993
should be arguing their case.

773
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:59,454
I believe in the ultimate
purity of the Q.

774
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,374
You, who were banned
from the Continuum

775
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,084
and made mortal
to pay for your crimes?

776
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,378
My penance has ended.

777
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,963
I'm a born-again Q.

778
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,132
That life is behind me.

779
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,718
What a shame...

780
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,595
because, in many ways,
that life inspired me.

781
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,556
It did? I did?

782
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,099
Oh, yes. You never knew that,
did you?

783
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,060
You see, Captain,

784
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,688
Q rebelled against
this existence

785
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,148
by refusing
to behave himself.

786
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,358
He was out of control.

787
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,402
He used his powers
irresponsibly

788
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,029
and all for
his own amusement,

789
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,155
and he desperately
needed amusement

790
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,992
because he could find
none here at home.

791
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,244
And I paid the price
for my inappropriate behavior.

792
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,081
No, no, we paid the price
by forcing you to stop,

793
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,374
but for a moment there,

794
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,251
you really had
our attention...

795
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,211
my attention.

796
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,006
You gave us something
to talk about,

797
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:55,010
but then you surrendered
to the will of the Continuum

798
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,763
like a good little Q,
and may I say you've become

799
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,306
a fine, upstanding member
of the Continuum

800
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:04,519
but I miss
the irrepressible Q...

801
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,647
the one who forced me
to think.

802
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,072
May I borrow this?

803
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,035
This was the beginning
of my fall from grace.

804
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,454
This was the last edition,
by the way.

805
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,456
They shut down
the presses

806
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,958
after I wrote that,

807
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,876
but they couldn't
keep me silent.

808
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,754
I continued to speak out
in favor of self-termination.

809
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,297
That's when he lost his mind

810
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,507
and started trying
to destroy himself.

811
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,051
We had no choice
but to confine him

812
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,761
but for his own safety.

813
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,597
Not for my safety, for theirs.

814
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,058
I was the greatest threat
the Continuum had ever known.

815
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,435
They feared me so much,

816
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:48,814
they had to lock me away
for eternity,

817
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,232
and when they did that,
they were saying

818
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,986
that the individual's rights
will be protected

819
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:58,865
only so long as they don't
conflict with the state.

820
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:03,286
Nothing is so dangerous
to a society.

821
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:08,207
My life's work is complete,
but they force

822
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,085
immortality on me,

823
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,129
and when
they do that,

824
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,756
they cheapen
and denigrate my life

825
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:18,802
and all life in the Continuum,
all life.

826
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:22,388
Captain, you're
an explorer.

827
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,558
What if you had
nothing left to explore?

828
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,228
Would you want to live forever
under those circumstances?

829
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,522
You want me to prove to you

830
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,899
that I suffer in terms
that you can equate

831
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,110
with pain or disease.

832
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,612
Look at us.

833
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:42,617
When life has become futile,
meaningless, unendurable,

834
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,745
it must be allowed to end.

835
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,665
Can't you see,
Captain?

836
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:52,961
For us,
the disease is immortality.

837
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,344
We rest our case, Captain.

838
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,015
Very well.

839
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,559
I'll make my ruling
in the morning.

840
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,937
We'll be in recess until then.

841
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,180
Trouble sleeping?

842
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,305
(<i> gasps</i> )

843
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,269
Did you ever try warm
Kylerian goat's milk?

844
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,939
Get out!

845
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,815
Did you think
about our offer?

846
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,650
You mean your bribe.

847
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,779
Merely an incentive to
make the proper decision.

848
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,823
It'll play no part
in my deliberations.

849
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,119
No.
I told them it wouldn't.

850
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,913
That's why I talked them into
giving you what you asked for.

851
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,123
You have my word.

852
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,999
He won't go back to the cell.

853
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,752
We'll assign someone
to look after him,

854
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,670
whatever it takes.

855
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,839
It's what you
wanted, isn't it?

856
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,968
That's what I wanted.

857
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,720
So, you've won.

858
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,889
Let's celebrate.

859
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,182
Just you and me--

860
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,809
the two of us.

861
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,518
What?

862
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,895
I'll take you home.

863
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,188
Before you know it,

864
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,982
you'll be scampering
across the meadow

865
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,191
with your little puppies,

866
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,526
the grass beneath
your bare feet.

867
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,403
A man coming over the hill,

868
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,322
way in the distance,
waves to you.

869
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,574
You run to be in his arms,
and as you get closer,

870
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,869
you see that it's... me.

871
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,288
You?!

872
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:53,873
Forget Mark.

873
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,375
I know how to show a girl
a good time.

874
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,128
How would you like
a ticker tape parade

875
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,504
down Sri Lanka Boulevard?

876
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,548
The Captain
who brought<i> Voyager</i> back--

877
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,425
a celebrated hero.

878
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,511
I never did anything like that
for Jean-Luc,

879
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,639
but I feel very close to you.

880
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,350
I'm not sure why.

881
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,186
Maybe it's because
you have such authority

882
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:18,064
and yet manage to preserve
your femininity so well.

883
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,156
Leave.

884
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,536
We'll talk about this
after the hearing tomorrow.

885
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,922
I've tried to find
some way to reconcile

886
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,343
all the conflicting emotions
I've felt during this hearing.

887
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,427
My own aversion

888
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,013
to suicide.

889
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,056
My compassion

890
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,266
for your situation, Q.

891
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,519
It hasn't been easy.

892
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,729
I've tried to tell myself

893
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,232
that this is
not about suicide,

894
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,400
but about granting asylum,

895
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,402
that I am not
personally being asked

896
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,778
to perform euthanasia,

897
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,365
and as technically true
as that may be,

898
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,992
I cannot escape

899
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,246
the moral implications
of my choices.

900
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:17,123
I've also had to consider
that a decision to grant asylum,

901
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,377
and the subsequent suicide
of a Q,

902
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,669
might have a significant impact

903
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,255
on the Continuum.

904
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,506
That such a decision

905
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,551
could change
the nature of an entire society,

906
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,679
whether it be a favorable
or unfavorable change,

907
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,765
disturbs me greatly.

908
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,020
But then there are
the rights of the individual

909
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,855
in this matter.

910
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,733
I don't believe that you are
mentally unbalanced,

911
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,444
and I do believe

912
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,780
that you are suffering
intolerably.

913
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,076
Under these conditions,

914
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,413
I find it impossible
to support immortality forced

915
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,956
on an individual
by the state.

916
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,749
The unforeseen
disruption

917
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:04,712
that may occur in the Continuum
is not enough, in my opinion,

918
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:09,008
to justify any additional
suffering by this individual.

919
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,431
So... I hereby grant you asylum.

920
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,768
May I see you in your chambers,
Captain?

921
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,104
You've been in my chambers
enough for one visit, sir.

922
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,355
A sidebar, Your Honor.

923
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,689
Only for a moment.

924
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,108
She ruled in my favor.

925
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,859
You made a promise.

926
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,871
Nothing happened... nothing!

927
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,749
My powers are gone!

928
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,252
I'm mortal.

929
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,592
Well, so much
for ticker tape parades.

930
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,760
I'm not finished.

931
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,263
Q...

932
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,223
now that you're mortal,

933
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,435
you have a new existence
to explore,

934
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,979
an entirely new state of being

935
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,690
filled with the mysteries
of mortal life,

936
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,318
pleasures
you've never felt before.

937
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,113
I like this life, Q.

938
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,282
You might, too.

939
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:19,454
Think hard
before you give it up.

940
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,837
This hearing is adjourned.

941
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,590
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 49301.2.</i>

942
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,302
<i>We have assigned quarters</i>
<i>to our new passenger,</i>

943
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,680
<i>who has entered his name on</i>
<i>our crew manifest as "Quinn."</i>

944
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,767
<i>I'm anxious to engage him</i>
<i>in ship activities</i>

945
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,061
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

946
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,603
How about Stellar Cartography?

947
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,231
We could shut down
Stellar Cartography

948
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,191
with all the knowledge
he'd bring to the job.

949
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,692
Well, that's going
to be a problem

950
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,610
with just about everything
we assign him to.

951
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,612
There's got to be something on
board that...

952
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,281
DOCTOR:
<i>Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.</i>

953
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,908
Go ahead.

954
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,993
<i>Captain, I think you should</i>
<i>come down to Sick Bay.</i>

955
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,330
<i>Mr. Quinn is here.</i>
<i>I'm afraid he's dying.</i>

956
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,129
There's nothing
you can do?

957
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,506
He's ingested
a rare form

958
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,091
of Nogatch hemlock.

959
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,800
There is
no known cure.

960
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,805
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Captain,

961
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,058
but I would only
have been pretending

962
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:25,811
to fit in
to this mortal existence.

963
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:29,274
This is my final gift
to my people.

964
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:33,319
Oh, tell them those were

965
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,905
my last words.

966
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:40,410
I dearly thank you
for making this poss...

967
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,879
TUVOK:
Doctor,

968
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,466
do you generally keep samples
of fatal poisons in storage?

969
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,259
No.

970
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,886
The replicators
will not produce them either.

971
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:03,475
So how did he get his hands
on Nogatch hemlock?

972
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,852
<i>I</i> got it for him.

973
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,566
You assisted his suicide?

974
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,525
Illogical, Tuvok?

975
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,319
I don't think so.

976
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,028
By demanding to end his life,

977
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,364
he taught me a little something
about my own.

978
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,116
He was right when he said

979
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,494
the Continuum scared me
back in line.

980
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:25,622
I didn't have his courage
or his convictions.

981
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:29,375
He called me "irrepressible."

982
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:33,212
This was a man
who was truly irrepressible.

983
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,923
I only hope
I make a worthy student.

984
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,052
I imagine the Continuum
won't be very happy

985
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,638
with you, Q.

986
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:44,641
I certainly hope not.

987
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:47,602
<i>Au revoir,</i> Madam Captain.

988
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,728
We will meet again.
