00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:03,545
CHAKOTAY:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,422
<i>Stardate 50614.2.</i>

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,800
<i>Ensign Kaplan and I</i>
<i>are returning to</i> Voyager

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,804
<i>after completing a scouting</i>
<i>mission in the Nekrit Expanse.</i>

5
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,264
The nebula's
completely scrambling

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,850
our navigational readings.

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,560
I still can't get a fix
on our position.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,188
Are you saying we're lost,
Ensign?

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,692
That... depends what you mean
by "lost," sir.

10
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,779
"Lost," as in you still
can't get a fix on our position.

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,781
I'm sorry, sir.

12
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,034
Try hailing
<i>Voyager</i> again.

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,078
No response. We must still
be out of com range.

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,080
Then we'll just
have to navigate

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,750
the old-fashioned way--
engage optical scanners.

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,418
Aye, sir.

17
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,965
I'm picking up
an asteroid field

18
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,676
at coordinates 113 mark 7.

19
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,929
Record it.

20
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,055
Uh, sir?

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,473
That asteroid field?

22
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,895
It's the same one
we passed two hours ago.

23
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,313
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Great.

24
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,691
We're not only lost,
we're flying in circles.

25
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,150
(<i> console beeping</i> )

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,904
It's a Federation
hailing beacon--

27
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,823
originating bearing
309 mark 4.

28
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,366
It's<i> Voyager.</i>

29
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,078
Well... at least someone
knows where we are.

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,205
Setting a course.

31
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,005
The signal's coming
from the planet's surface.

32
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,631
Is it possible<i> Voyager's</i> landed?

33
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,132
Sensor readings are sketchy.

34
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,135
I'm detecting
about 80,000 humanoid life signs

35
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,721
on the western continent,

36
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,223
some rudimentary structures
and technology,

37
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,268
but no energy signature
big enough to be a starship.

38
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,020
(<i> console beeping</i> )

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,271
I'm getting another hail.

40
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,981
The signal's very weak...

41
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,859
and it's definitely not
being sent by<i> Voyager.</i>

42
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,736
Try adjusting
the bandwidth.

43
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,113
FEMALE (<i> distorted):</i>
<i>...Colony to Federation vessel.</i>

44
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,823
<i>We need your help, urgently.</i>

45
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,825
This is Commander Chakotay
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

46
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,243
Please identify yourself.

47
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,161
(<i> distorted</i> ):
<i>I'm not reading you.</i>

48
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,414
<i>Federation vessel,</i>
<i>please respond to this...</i>

49
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,041
We lost them, sir.

50
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,418
They've identified us
as a Federation ship.

51
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,003
Who would know that?

52
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,880
Whoever they are, they're
asking for our help.

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,173
Launch a message buoy
letting<i> Voyager</i> know

54
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,051
we've landed in response
to a distress call.

55
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,261
(<i> buoy whooshing</i> )

56
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,606
This place looks like
a war zone.

57
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,570
I can't pinpoint the source
of the transmission.

58
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,992
Commander.

59
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,273
I'm Commander Chakotay
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

60
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,234
We're responding
to a distress call.

61
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,611
We're looking
for whoever it was

62
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,654
that asked
for our help.

63
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,782
Commander!

64
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,670
(<i> grunts</i> )

65
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,846
(<i> grunting</i> )

66
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,563
(<i> grunting</i> )

67
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,524
(<i> weapon powering up</i> )

68
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,821
(<i> gasping groan</i> )

69
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,242
(<i> both grunting</i> )

70
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,203
Come on!

71
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,040
Take him inside.

72
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,505
(<i> groaning quietly</i> )

73
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,555
(<i> groans</i> )

74
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,725
FEMALE:
I'd lie still
if I were you.

75
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,270
You've got a nasty
head injury.

76
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,647
You're human.

77
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,025
My name's Riley Frazier.

78
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,318
What's yours, Commander?

79
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,694
Why did you attack us?

80
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,071
Those weren't my people.

81
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,074
I'm the one
who sent the distress call.

82
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,159
We rescued you.

83
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,410
What did you do with Kaplan?

84
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,662
Your Ensign.

85
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,291
She didn't make it.

86
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,168
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,297
I've got to get
back to my shuttle.

88
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,092
Your shuttle isn't there
anymore.

89
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:29,306
The people who attacked you
have already pulled it apart.

90
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,308
Relax, Commander.

91
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,768
I'm here to help you.

92
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,437
How did...?

93
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,273
How did I get here?

94
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,650
I could ask you
the same question.

95
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,027
I was pretty surprised

96
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,239
when I picked up
a Federation ship out there--

97
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,241
not that I wasn't happy
about it.

98
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,076
It's a long story.

99
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,661
Why don't you go first?

100
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,789
Seven or eight years ago...

101
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,541
I was working
as a Science Officer

102
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,210
on a vessel
in the Bolian sector.

103
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,837
We were attacked without warning
by aliens.

104
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,383
They overpowered us in minutes,
and those of us who survived

105
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,468
were put in some kind
of stasis.

106
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,389
The next thing we knew,
we were here on this planet.

107
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,891
It didn't take too many hours
of stargazing

108
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,685
to realize we weren't in
the Alpha Quadrant any longer.

109
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,354
There are other humans here?

110
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,314
Three that I know
of besides me,

111
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,024
what was left of my crew,

112
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:25,279
along with some Klingons,
Cardassians, Romulans,

113
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,864
and dozens of other species
I'd never seen before.

114
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,117
And the ones
that put you in stasis?

115
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,910
I don't know.

116
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,289
They must have had some kind
of colony here at some time

117
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,333
because of the ruined buildings
and equipment

118
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,460
they left scattered around.

119
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,003
We've never seen them again.

120
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,672
Everyone here has pretty much
the same story.

121
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,051
They were just grabbed from
wherever they happened to be

122
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,803
and dumped.

123
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,013
Why did those people
kill Kaplan?

124
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,349
We were no threat to them.

125
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,601
There are dozens of different
races on this planet,

126
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,728
all of whom were brought here
against their will.

127
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,107
Many of them are suspicious
of other species.

128
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,734
It's not exactly
a United Federation

129
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,861
around here,
if you know what I mean.

130
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,740
So those kind of attacks--
they go on all the time.

131
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,700
Resources are pretty limited.

132
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,329
It didn't take long
for the fighting to start.

133
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,833
First, a group of Klingons
attacked the Cardassians.

134
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,002
Then the Farn raided the Parein;

135
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,712
eventually things
just got out of hand,

136
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,964
and now it's anarchy.

137
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,049
But some of us,
a few hundred or so,

138
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,802
we've tried to make
the best of it.

139
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,220
We've established
a cooperative--

140
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,807
sharing work and whatever
provisions we have.

141
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,060
I've got to contact my ship.

142
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,728
The raiders
destroyed

143
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,689
the communications
array.

144
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,858
It'll take days
to fix it.

145
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,901
I can help you.

146
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,821
(<i> grunts</i> )

147
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,906
Our medic
examined you.

148
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,950
You suffered serious
neural trauma.

149
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,913
You're staying put.
And that's an order, Commander.

150
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,587
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50622.4.</i>

151
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,507
<i>While Commander Chakotay</i>

152
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,591
<i>scouts for a faster route</i>
<i>through the Nekrit Expanse,</i>

153
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,760
<i>we are continuing</i>
<i>our month-long journey</i>

154
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,347
<i>through the sparsely</i>
<i>populated region.</i>

155
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,973
You know, they
ought to rename

156
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,975
this place the
"negative expanse."

157
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,227
We haven't run across

158
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,978
anything interesting
for days.

159
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,438
If you're bored, Mr. Paris,

160
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,940
I'm sure I can find
something else for you to do.

161
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,984
The warp plasma
filters are due

162
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,194
for a thorough cleaning.

163
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,612
Now that you mention it,
Captain,

164
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:36,368
I find this region of space
a real navigational challenge.

165
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,036
(<i> console beeping</i> )

166
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,620
I believe I may have found
something else

167
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,331
to pique
Mr. Paris's interest, Captain.

168
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,833
It's an unidentified ship
on long-range sensors.

169
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,001
What sort of ship?

170
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,878
Sensor readings
are very limited,

171
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,171
but the vessel
appears to be stopped

172
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,923
directly in our current
flight path.

173
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,008
Harry, send
a standard greeting.

174
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:52,967
Aye, Captain.

175
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,386
(<i> console beeping</i> )

176
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,096
They're not
responding.

177
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,932
Try retransmitting the hail
on wide-band subspace.

178
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,434
Still no response.

179
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,935
We are entering visual range.

180
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,853
On screen.

181
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,940
KIM:
The Borg.

182
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,359
Red Alert.

183
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,032
All stop. Shields to maximum.

184
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,200
Stand by all weapons.

185
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,993
Tuvok, are they scanning us?

186
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,454
Curious.

187
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,456
None of the Borg systems
appears to be operational.

188
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,624
KIM:
He's right.
They're adrift.

189
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,919
Maybe they're trying to lull us
into a false sense of security.

190
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,380
That would not be consistent
with typical Borg tactics.

191
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,382
I want to try
a multiphasic scan.

192
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,759
Tom, stand by to get us
out of here in case they react.

193
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,969
Aye, Captain.

194
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,512
Proceed, Mr. Kim.

195
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:41,057
I'm not picking up any
active energy signatures.

196
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,143
And no life signs.

197
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,811
Well, that's a relief.

198
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,439
Perhaps. However,
we should avoid complacency.

199
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,567
The Borg are known to retrieve
their damaged technology.

200
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,110
It is quite possible

201
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,445
we will encounter
additional Borg vessels

202
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,780
which are fully manned
and powered.

203
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,742
That's exactly why we're
going to board that ship.

204
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,119
Captain?

205
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,662
This is a rare opportunity

206
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,789
to learn as much as we can
about Borg technology.

207
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,501
I might be able to get one of
their data nodes running

208
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,960
and find out
what disabled their ship.

209
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,420
If we're lucky,

210
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,046
we may find a weakness
we can use against them,

211
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,174
in case we run into
one of their

212
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,009
fully manned
and powered ships.

213
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,052
Tuvok, assemble
an away team. Tom...

214
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,013
Yes, Captain.

215
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,807
Take us
into transporter range.

216
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,063
We grow all our own food
in a cooperative garden.

217
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,231
It's delicious.

218
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,191
Sorry there's no meat.

219
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,233
No problem.

220
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,692
I'm a vegetarian.

221
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,028
Really?

222
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,737
I have recurring dreams

223
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,200
about my mother's
famous Texas barbecue.

224
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,784
So, your journey home--

225
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,704
how much longer do you
expect it'll take you?

226
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,081
About 67 years,

227
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:51,127
provided we don't find
a wormhole

228
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,005
or some other faster way
of getting back.

229
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,382
Haven't you
ever thought about

230
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,258
finding some nice
M-Class planet

231
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,759
and putting down roots?

232
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,554
We'd be missing
an incredible opportunity

233
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,597
to explore unknown space.

234
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,225
Besides, we've made a good life
for ourselves on<i> Voyager.</i>

235
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,644
I'm sure Captain Janeway
would be amenable

236
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,272
to take as many of your people
with us as we can accommodate.

237
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,940
Take us with you?

238
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,941
I assumed that's why

239
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,109
you sent the distress call.

240
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,279
You misunderstood.
We want to stay.

241
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,574
But you were brought here
against your will.

242
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,450
You just said
how dangerous it is.

243
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,162
For better or worse,
this place has become our home.

244
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,289
The people
in the cooperative...

245
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,208
they're like my ancestors--

246
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,251
Texas homesteaders.

247
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,877
I can understand
that, but...

248
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,170
We have a deep connection

249
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,548
to one another
that I've never felt before,

250
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,092
not even with members
of my own family.

251
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,303
I guess it's because of what
we've all gone through together.

252
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,972
What about those unfriendly
neighbors of yours?

253
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,184
We've been able to bring
a few of them into our group.

254
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,978
But you're right,
they're a problem.

255
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,313
(<i> groaning quietly</i> )

256
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,691
That's why we
want your help.

257
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,402
Security upgrades,
medical supplies,

258
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,153
maybe some weapons.

259
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,573
We're creating
a society here--

260
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,117
one that's based on tolerance,
shared responsibility,

261
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,868
and mutual respect

262
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,996
that people like you and I
were raised to believe in.

263
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:13,876
We're not about to give it up
just because it's difficult.

264
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,547
I'd better get back to work
on the communications array.

265
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,673
I'll come with you.

266
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,799
No!

267
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,888
You're still in no shape
to fight, if we're attacked.

268
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,060
I'll be back
to check on you soon.

269

TORRES:
It's like a ghost ship.

TUVOK:
Allowing yourself
to become apprehensive

274
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,513
can only be counterproductive,
Lieutenant.

275
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,140
I'm not being
apprehensive, Tuvok.

276
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,601
I'm just nervous as hell.

277
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,485
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

278
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,368
(<i> beeping louder</i> )

279
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,162
This is one
of the access nodes.

280
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,955
If we can get it
operational,

281
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:38,169
I should be able to tap into
the main data systems.

282
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,796
Tuvok...

283
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,174
there should be a compatible
micro-power conduit

284
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,551
somewhere in that module.

285
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,345
Connect it to this generator.

286
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,614
Lieutenant.

287
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,243
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

288
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,454
It's dead.

289
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,708
TUVOK:
As far as we can tell,

290
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,335
all activity on the Borg ship
ceased abruptly five years ago.

291
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,171
Our scans have detected
1,100 corpses.

292
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,716
TUVOK:
We located a breached
section of the vessel

293
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,426
where the spatial
vacuum preserved

294
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,345
several of the bodies perfectly.
We brought one aboard.

295
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,013
We're hoping
that an autopsy

296
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,306
might give us some clue
as to what killed them.

297
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,600
The question is,

298
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,935
why have the Borg
left one of their ships

299
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,731
and all its technology adrift
in space for anyone to find?

300
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,941
It is possible that
the deactivation of the ship

301
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,735
and its systems

302
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,570
severed the link
with the rest of the collective.

303
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,530
But what caused the shutdown
in the first place?

304
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,241
It could've been some kind of
natural disaster...

305
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,702
or...

306
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,371
Or what?

307
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,750
Maybe the Borg
were defeated by an enemy

308
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,836
even more powerful
than they were.

309
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,507
Tuvok, continue scanning
for any Borg vessels

310
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,175
in the vicinity,

311
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,387
as well as any other ships
that might be more powerful.

312
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,597
B'Elanna, you
and the Doctor

313
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,265
get started
on that autopsy.

314
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,017
In the meantime,
I think it would be a good idea

315
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,353
to rendezvous
with Commander Chakotay

316
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,855
a little ahead of schedule,

317
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,901
and let him know we've
run into some old friends.

318
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,580

320
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,397
Hello? Anybody there?

321
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,737
Riley?

Riley?

(<i> gasps</i> )

331
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,568
What are you?

332
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,152
Are you Borg?

333
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,030
We<i> were</i> Borg.

334
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,990
You mean you weren't
just kidnapped,

335
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,618
you were assimilated
by the collective.

336
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,286
At Wolf 359.

337
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,789
I was a Science Officer
aboard the<i> Roosevelt.</i>

338
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,290
But five years ago,

339
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,667
our cube was damaged by
an electrokinetic storm.

340
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,002
The next thing we knew,

341
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,004
our link to the
collective was severed.

342
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,422
We were free.

343
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,715
We could think
for ourselves again,

344
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,800
remember our names,

345
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,217
where we'd come from.

346
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,970
It was like waking up
from a long nightmare.

347
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,512
We took what we
thought we could use,

348
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,431
and transported
ourselves here.

349
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,433
Everything was new again--
the sounds of our own voices,

350
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,144
forgotten memories,
the taste of food.

351
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,647
Our original skin pigmentation
began to come back.

352
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,816
Many of us were able to remove
our Borg appendages.

353
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,486
I was even lucky enough to get
a prosthetic arm Orum created,

354
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,488
using Borg replication
equipment.

355
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,864
In spite of how
little we had,

356
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,784
it was a joyous, hopeful time.
And then?

357
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,871
After the euphoria wore off,
people started looking around,

358
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,165
and found they were living
among other cultures

359
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,792
they didn't understand--

360
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,586
or worse, species
they'd been taught to hate.

361
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,838
They turned against one another.

362
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,422
Things became chaotic.

363
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,882
The fighting, the raids...

364
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,509
But we're not all like that.

365
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,594
Everything I told you about
forming a cooperative,

366
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,138
building a new society--
I meant it.

367
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,516
Riley's telling the truth,
Commander Chakotay.

368
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,143
Look at me-- I was Romulan.

369
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,561
I was taught to hate
humans, the Federation--

370
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,480
but Riley and I
are friends now.

371
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,107
I'm part of
the cooperative.

372
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,359
Orum's our medic.
He's the one who examined you.

373
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,569
Why didn't you tell me
all this in the first place?

374
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,531
I know how people feel
about the Borg,

375
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,782
and they're right.

376
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,617
We did terrible things.

377
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,952
You'd been assimilated.

378
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,996
You weren't in control
of your actions.

379
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,665
Then you'll still help us?

380
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,294
I think, right now,

381
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,964
it's Commander Chakotay
who needs<i> our</i> help.

382
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,633
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

383
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,968
<i>We've detected a message buoy</i>

384
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,179
<i>launched</i>
<i>from Chakotay's shuttle</i>

385
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,722
<i>and are heading toward it.</i>

386
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,017
<i>The autopsy of the Borg corpse</i>
<i>is underway.</i>

387
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,606
I must say, there's nothing
like the vacuum of space

388
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,818
for preserving
a handsome corpse.

389
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,115
Hmm...

390
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,077
Subject's abdominal organs
are unremarkable.

391
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,328
Pulmonary system
exhibits evidence

392
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,749
of extensive alveolar damage,
as well as a slight swelling

393
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,210
consistent with
exposure to space.

394
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,586
Ah...

395
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,588
In addition, there are signs

396
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,840
of severe
cardiac depolarization.

397
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,800
Sounds like
he was electrocuted.

398
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,927
Very good, Kes.

399
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,428
That would support our theory

400
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,304
about what happened
aboard their ship.

401
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,473
We think that their main power
conduits were overloaded

402
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,976
by a massive
electro-mechanical discharge.

403
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,063
Hmm...
this is intriguing.

404
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,023
What do you think that is?

405
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,609
It may be some sort of
axonal amplifier.

406
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,028
Kes, hand me
a cortical probe.

407
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,538
(<i> whirring</i> )

408
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,332
(<i> shouts</i> )

409
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,001
Shut it down!

410
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,634
(<i> whirring stops</i> )

411
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,638
What the hell happened?

412
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,347
Is it still alive?

413
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:51,269
Of course not. Apparently
I inadvertently activated

414
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,148
a backup neuroelectric
power cell.

415
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,816
The response
was purely autonomic.

416
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,692
There's no reason for concern.

417
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,694
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

418
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,446
What do you mean?

419
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,198
That "autonomic response"
caused this drone

420
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,409
to reset back to its
original programming.

421
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,164
If the rest of those corpses
somehow reactivate--

422
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,792
we'd have a major problem
on our hands.

423
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,674
I'm afraid he's
getting worse.

424
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,926
There must be something
we can do for him.

425
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,469
You know better
than anyone

426
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,429
how limited our
medical resources are.

427
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,475
As far as I'm concerned,
there is only one option.

428
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,436
Would it be safe?

429
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,397
Would... what be safe?

430
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,068
As I'm sure you're aware,

431
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,987
the Borg
collective consciousness

432
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,738
is extremely powerful.

433
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,825
It allowed us to transfer
information instantaneously--

434
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,160
to think with one mind.

435
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,787
But what you may not
be aware of

436
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,749
is the link also has
inherent medical applications.

437
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,128
M-m-medical applications?

438
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,630
We were connected
by a continuous

439
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,798
neuroelectric field

440
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,884
that was capable
of regenerating

441
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,427
the damaged components
of an injured Borg.

442
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,930
Think of it as
a subspace transfusion.

443
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,558
Only instead of one
person giving blood,

444
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,851
there are hundreds,

445
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,435
perhaps thousands,
of donors

446
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,855
simultaneously transmitting
neuroelectric energy

447
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,023
to whoever needed it.

448
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,817
This process
was often successful

449
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,279
in healing both organic
and inorganic body parts.

450
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,074
This is all... very fascinating,

451
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,576
but I don't see how it helps me.

452
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,162
We still have Borg
neural processors implanted

453
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,621
in our nervous systems.

454
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,166
Removing them
would've killed us.

455
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,751
I see.

456
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,586
Using a portable
neuro-transponder,

457
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,630
we have the ability
to relink our brain patterns.

458
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,133
I thought you said
the link was severed.

459
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,134
It was.

460
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,510
But we can reinitiate it

461
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,637
among a small group,
for a short time.

462
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,266
We could generate
a neuroelectric field

463
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,101
that could heal your injuries.

464
00:23:55,101 --> 00:24:00,189
You want to... hook up my mind
to some... Borg collective?

465
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,525
No, no, that's not it at all.
We'd be in complete control.

466
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,237
You'd simply be linked,
for a limited period of time,

467
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,447
to Riley, me, and a few
of the others in our group

468
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,783
willing to help you.

469
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,743
I'm not letting anyone implant

470
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,162
some neural processor
in my brain.

471
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,747
That wouldn't be necessary.

472
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,832
I'd simply attach
a small neuro-transceiver

473
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,542
to the base of your skull.

474
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,295
We'd initiate the link,
and the transceiver

475
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,256
could be removed as soon
as the procedure was over.

476
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,716
I assure you, other than
repairing neural tissue,

477
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,927
there would be
no lasting effects.

478
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,805
Thanks...

479
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,140
but I don't think so.

480
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,351
I-I can see
why you're skeptical.

481
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,019
I would be, too.

482
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,398
Look around you--
Orum and I, the others--

483
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,774
we're individuals.

484
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,318
We have distinct personalities.

485
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,069
We're not about to turn you

486
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,072
into some kind
of automaton.

487
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,992
I'll take my chances
and wait for<i> Voyager.</i>

488
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,661
I'm afraid that help
may come too late, Commander.

489
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,204
If we don't do something

490
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,583
to slow the neural degradation
immediately...

491
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,294
you will die.

492
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,971
Chakotay...

493
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,640
you have to make
a decision.

494
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,769
Any sign of<i> Voyager?</i> 
No.

495
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,855
I can't change
who we are.

496
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,191
I wasn't truthful with you
before, and I'm sorry,

497
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,318
but please believe me
when I tell you

498
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,236
we only want to help you.

499
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,947
Orum will take
every precaution.

500
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,157
Please?

501
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,951
At least let us
try and save you.

502
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,872
It's either that or the happy
hunting grounds, huh?

503
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:43,083
Okay, then?

00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,751
has shown marked
improvement.

534
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,588
(<i> groaning</i> )

535
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,632
It was incredible.

536
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,843
I know.

537
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:03,056
I heard all of you--

538
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,434
your thoughts
inside my head--

539
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,020
as if they were
<i>my</i> thoughts.

540
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,856
And I could see myself...

541
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,149
through your eyes.

542
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,402
Then you must have
caught me staring.

543
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,988
I saw...

544
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:22,993
faces... planets.
What were they?

545
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:27,373
Images from the minds of
the people who linked with you.

546
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,626
Members of their families,
their homes...

547
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:35,130
I know things
about all of them...

548
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,923
about you.

549
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,177
You like bluebonnets.

550
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,803
My favorite flower.

551
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,139
You used to pick them
back home in Texas

552
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,060
with a man who carried
a walking stick.

553
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,229
My grandfather.

554
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,105
I know so much about you.

555
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:56,276
We shared a very
rare experience.

556
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,785
I felt that.

557
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,625
What about<i> this?</i>

558
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,298
It's a residual effect
from the link.

559
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,261
How long will it last?

560
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,263
An hour.

561
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,265
Maybe two.

562
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,643
Long enough.

563
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,354
<i>Can you still hear</i>
<i>what I'm thinking?</i>

564
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,731
Yes.

565
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:37,735
<i>Then you know I want to be</i>
<i>closer to you.</i>

566
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:42,197
<i>I want us to know</i>
<i>everything about each other.</i>

567
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:46,785
<i>I want you to feel</i>
<i>everything I feel.</i>

568
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,427
According to the buoy,

569
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,886
Commander Chakotay
and Ensign Kaplan

570
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,513
landed on the surface
in response

571
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,056
to a distress call
three days ago.

572
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,015
Can you locate
the shuttle?

573
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,684
(<i> console beeping</i> )

574
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,186
There is no sign of it
anywhere on the planet.

575
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,230
What about their combadges?

576
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,607
I'm only picking
up one signal.

577
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,900
It's in a heavily
populated region.

578
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,277
Signal's very weak.

579
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,279
<i>Voyager</i> to Commander Chakotay.

580
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,573
Do you read?

581
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,158
Ensign Kaplan,
this is Captain Janeway.

582
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,660
Come in.

583
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,286
Electrodynamic turbulence
from the nebula

584
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,912
is interfering with
the transmission.

585
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,415
It's going to take me
a while to clear it up.

586
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,758
CHAKOTAY:
Hand me that
hyper-spanner.

587
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,222
There.
That should at least

588
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,266
get the short-range
transmitters operational.

589
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,311
Now, if we can get
the signal amplifiers online.

590
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,729
I never would've
figured you

591
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,273
to be quite so handy
with a circuitry panel.

592
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,067
I guess you haven't learned
everything about me, have you?

593
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,278
Commander,
I just wanted to say

594
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,280
how grateful to you
we all are.

595
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,741
You're the ones
who saved my life.

596
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,452
But you've added so much
to the cooperative--

597
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,413
a renewed sense of hope,
an infusion of energy.

598
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,124
You have no idea
how invigorating it was

599
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,626
to have a new mind
in the link,

600
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,795
even if it was only
for a short time.

601
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,632
There have been so few of us
for so long, I...

602
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,386
Well, I'll let you two
get back to work.

603
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,600
I was so resistant
to being linked.

604
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,228
Now I'm almost sorry
it's over.

605
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,937
I know.

606
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,400
Last night, when we
were still connected,

607
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,152
I realized what it is
you really want from us.

608
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:48,448
It's more than just supplies
and security upgrades.

609
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,200
That's right.

610
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,869
It's a pretty
radical concept.

611
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,663
Sometimes radical problems
require radical solutions.

612
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,374
ORUM:
Riley!
Commander Chakotay!

613
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,293
We've detected a ship in orbit.
It must be<i> Voyager.</i>

614
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,629
I hope you'll at least
discuss our idea

615
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,590
with your Captain.

616
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,385
Why don't you tell her
about it yourself?

617
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,932
We've given it
a great deal of thought,

618
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,393
and we believe the solution
to our problem

619
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,103
is to reestablish
the neural link

620
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,606
among all the former Borg
living on the planet.

621
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,482
You can't be serious.

622
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,610
I know it sounds
extreme, Captain,

623
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,486
but I think you
should hear her out.

624
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,239
All right.

625
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,990
If you'll think about it,
Captain,

626
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,368
when we were linked,
we had no ethnic conflict.

627
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:37,372
There was no crime, no hunger,
no health problems.

628
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,625
We lived
as one harmonious family.

629
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,168
With all due respect,
Dr. Frazier,

630
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,879
you were "one harmonious family"

631
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,299
bent on the violent assimilation
of innocent cultures.

632
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,010
But we're not Borg anymore,
and we've learned from our past.

633
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,013
All we want to do
is to take the one good thing

634
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:57,225
that existed in the midst
of all that horror--

635
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,353
our unique ability to cooperate
and problem-solve--

636
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:04,524
and use it to create a safe
and productive community.

637
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,611
Tell me how, exactly.

638
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,947
The neuro-transponder
we've built

639
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:13,199
is only powerful enough
to link a small group of people,

640
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,285
like the one that helped heal

641
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,829
Chakotay's wounds.

642
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,789
In any case,
the effect is only temporary.

643
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,083
In order to reconnect the
entire population permanently,

644
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,293
we'd need
a much bigger

645
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,128
neuroelectric
field generator.

646
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,756
I'm afraid we don't have
anything like that.

647
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,758
But the Borg cube does.

648
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,468
What they're asking us to do

649
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,346
is reactivate that ship's
neuroelectric generator

650
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,849
and redirect it
toward the planet.

651
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:43,689
They want us to reactivate...
a Borg ship?

652
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,858
Not the whole ship,
just the generator.

653
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,360
And it only needs to be
operational for a few minutes,

654
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,069
in order to reactivate
the link.

655
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,905
There's no telling
what would happen

656
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,907
if we turned on one of those
generators, even for an instant.

657
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,493
For all we know, it would
attract other Borg vessels.

658
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:02,374
Captain, I can assure you,
we'd take every precaution.

659
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,251
Dr. Frazier,
I admire your tenacity.

660
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,213
I respect your courage.

661
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,508
I'll give you medical supplies.

662
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,385
I'll assist you
with upgrading your security.

663
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,679
I'll even take some
of you with us,

664
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,263
if you want to come.

665
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,891
But as to what you're proposing,

666
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,852
I have to tell you,
I'm extremely skeptical.

667
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,730
In fairness, however,

668
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,440
I will give it
some further thought.

669
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,067
Thank you.

670
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,703
What do you think?

671
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,706
If you're asking me
whether or not she's sincere,

672
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,709
I have to say yes.

673
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,672
You got to know them very well?

674
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,131
That's an understatement.

675
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,594
I heard their thoughts,
felt their feelings,

676
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,513
saw through their eyes.

677
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,226
And, in all the time
you were linked,

678
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,020
you never sensed
anything negative--

679
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,940
no hidden agenda,
no destructive intent?

680
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,400
No.

681
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,611
Bottom line:

682
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:16,364
Do you think we should do
what they're asking?

683
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:24,623
I really care about
what happens to these people.

684
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,833
So, in my heart,
I'd like to do

685
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,544
everything we can to help them.

686
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,213
But, if I were sitting
in your chair,

687
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,884
I'd have to take other
considerations into account.

688
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,099
Not only would it mean
imposing a choice

689
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,685
on thousands of people who had
no voice in the decision,

690
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,480
but it would also be taking
a terrible risk.

691
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,608
Helping to create
a new collective?

692
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,153
Who knows what
the repercussions might be?

693
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,828
I'll let Riley know.

694
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,587
(<i> laughing</i> )

695
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,923
I'm afraid
her decision was final.

696
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,592
I wish it weren't,
but I expected as much.

697
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,260
What about the raiders?

698
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,097
How long do you think
you can hold out against them?

699
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,432
Well, we'll just have to do
the best we can.

700
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,602
Who knows? Maybe we'll find some
other way to get to the cube

701
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,062
and reinitiate the link.

702
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,481
Come with us.
Chakotay...

703
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,399
We could replicate
some Texas barbecue.

704
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,944
I'm sure it won't compare to
your mother's, but I think it--

705
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:39,614
Don't think it's not tempting,
but my place is here.

706
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,450
I know you understand.

You okay?

712
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,620

No. Why?

Must've been my imagination.

he needs to take a look at you
as soon as we're back.

814
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,093
<i>but it was necessary</i>
<i>for our survival.</i>

815
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:19,764
<i>His link with the cooperative</i>
<i>has now been severed.</i>

00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,682

(<i> transmission ends</i> )

818
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,943
His neuropeptide levels
have returned to normal.

819
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,112
And there are no
residual traces of the link?

820
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,696
None.

821
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,407
How were they able
to reestablish the connection?

822
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,576
My best guess is that
the residual neuropeptides

823
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,578
heightened his
telepathic receptivity.

824
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,621
I thought their limited
equipment made it impossible

825
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,125
for them to form the link
over great distances.

826
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,251
Apparently, once
they repaired

827
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,710
their communications
array,

828
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,212
they were able to use it
to amplify the signal

829
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,005
from their neural
transponder.

830
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,550
Would you two
please excuse us?

831
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,977
I don't know what to say,
except... I'm sorry.

832
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,229
Based on what
the Doctor's told us,

833
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,731
it's clear you were acting
against your will.

834
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,317
Maybe so,

835
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:15,027
but somehow that doesn't
make me feel any better.

836
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,197
I helped them repair
their communications array,

837
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,617
and I told you
they were sincere.

838
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:23,578
Helping others, Chakotay--
that's part of who you are.

839
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,330
Given everything
you believe in,

840
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,249
I don't see how you could've
behaved differently.

841
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:32,170
But I couldn't have been more
wrong about them, could I?

842
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,671
I don't know.

843
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,382
I'm not saying I'm happy
about what happened.

844
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:40,136
But so far, they haven't
acted like typical Borg.

845
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,348
They saved us from that cube,
and they let you go.

846
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,057
But they didn't hesitate

847
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,643
to impose their
collective will on me

848
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,853
when it served
their interests, did they?

849
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,813
No, they didn't.

850
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,232
I wonder how long
their ideals will last

851
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,734
in the face of
that kind of power?
