I'm no one's prey!

00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,551
Aah.

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,094
KLINGON 1:
She'll survive.

6
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,263
KLINGON 2:
What about her
neural interface?

7
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,556
Stable.

8
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,725
Shall I return her
to the Klingon simulation?

9
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,893
No.

10
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,061
Bring her to
Holodeck 1.

11
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,773
I've found another program
I want to try.

12
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:27,903

This way... ♪

13
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,154
I'm Katrine.

Le Coeur de Lion
is my establishment.

15
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,908
The commandant
would have us

16
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,910
continue this simulation
until we rot.

17
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,244
It's pointless.

18
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,746
We should begin
the hunt.

19
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,624
We've been able to expand
both holodeck grids

20
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,083
by 5,000 square meters.

21
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,418
More.

22
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,254
The colonel is
in a strange mood today.

24
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,678
( both grunt )

25
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,138
I have found a way
to disable the interface

26
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,057
by remodulating
one of your Borg implants

27
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,893
to emit a jamming signal.

28
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,061
You circumvented
our control!

29
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,354
How?

30
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,939
You're sending a message
to the Nazis.

31
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,065
No.

32
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,150
Step away
or I'll kill you.

00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,991
Captain Miller,
Fifth Armored Infantry.

Welcome to
Sainte Claire.

36
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,118
This building
is being targeted.

37
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,620
Let's get out of here.

38
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,581
( grunts )

39
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,123

you've got one.

Come on. Move up.

00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,735
Looks like the Hirogen
have been busy.

46
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,403
This entire section
has been equipped

47
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,654
with holo-emitters.

48
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,241
Let's get to Astrometrics.

49
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,910

00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,705

51
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,209
There are 85
Hirogen on board

52
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,754
concentrated
on Decks 2 through 9.

53
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,256
What about the Bridge?

54
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,093
Four Hirogen
and Ensign Kim.

55
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,594
At least he's alive.

56
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,929
The neural interfaces--

57
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,680
you said they're controlled
through Sickbay.

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,266
Yes. There's only one
Hirogen in Sickbay

59
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,184
with the doctor,
but the corridors

60
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,728
outside are
heavily guarded.

61
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,939
That's our first objective--
disable the interfaces--

62
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,482
but we'll need help.

63
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,776
We did have allies in the
World War II simulation--

64
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,069
the French Resistance.

65
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,154
It's time we mount
a resistance of our own.

66
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:39,076
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

67
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,084

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,646
KIM:
The battle is concentrated
here in Holodeck 1,

69
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,899
but the fighting has spilled
out onto Decks 5 and 6.

70
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,943
And it looks like a group
of holographic Americans

71
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,194
is invading Deck 7.

72
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,487
Show me the breach
in the hologrid.

73
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,948
( static )

74
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,657
I've lost the visual link.

75
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,992
It was the last active circuit

76
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,619
connecting the Bridge
to the holodecks.

77
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,329
There's only one way
to stop this.

78
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,041
I need to go to Engineering
and initiate a power surge

79
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,459
across the holo-emitter
network.

80
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,835
It'll blow out
the entire system.

81
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,921
No. That would destroy
both the holodecks.

82
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,882
Look, simulation or not,
if this battle keeps going

83
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,425
we could all be killed.

84
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,637
I want that technology
preserved.

85
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,388
Commander.

86
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,598
Status.

87
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,308
I was able
to reach Deck 5,

88
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,145
but holographic forces
are massing near the breach.

89
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,980
If I'm to get into the holodeck,
I'll need help.

90
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,232
Take the hunters
from the Klingon simulation.

91
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,526
When I find Captain Janeway,
should I kill her?

92
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,945
No.

93
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,529
Bring her to me.

94
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,865
This is no longer a game.

95
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,159
This hunt is real.

96
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,577
We should kill the prey.

97
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,248
The<i> Voyager</i> crew must
remain alive to make repairs

98
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,834
or we could lose everything--

99
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,170
this vessel, its technology.

100
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,630
You said that you understood
the importance

101
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,590
of what we're doing here.

102
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,885
I'll get the hunters.

103
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,434
( gunfire outside )

104
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,270
We think it's a secret
compound the Nazis built

105
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,105
after they took
over the city.

106
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,481
What I don't understand

107
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,233
is how they managed
to camouflage it so well.

108
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,651
Indeed.

109
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,653
We've been scrutinizing
German troop movements

110
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,904
since the occupation.

111
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,405
We knew nothing
of this installation.

112
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,657
Don't sweat it.

113
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,826
Our recon planes
missed it, too.

114
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,369
Any idea what they're
hiding in there, Captain?

115
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,581
We saw all sorts of scientific
equipment-- strange metals,

116
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,667
instruments we can't identify.

117
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,961
I've relayed the findings
to Military Intelligence.

118
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,171
They believe this

119
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,340
could be an advanced
munitions laboratory

120
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,966
designed to build
some kind of superweapon.

121
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,592
We've got to put it
out of business.

122
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,094
I've already sent
three squads in,

123
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,387
but the Nazis are putting up
one hell of a fight.

124
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,140
I've requested
additional troops.

125
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,725
Lieutenant,
this restaurant will serve

126
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,185
as our command post.

127
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,435
Set up the transmitter

128
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,979
and post guards
around the perimeter.

129
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,314
Yes, sir.

130
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,149
You've done
a bang-up job,

131
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,399
but we'll take it
from here.

132
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,860
Tell your people
to lie low

133
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,238
and that the Americans
said "thanks."

134
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,198
This is our city.

135
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,448
We have no intention

136
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,284
of lying low.

137
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,660
Listen, honey,
the time

138
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,495
for sneaking messages
back and forth is over.

139
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,748
This is war,
and you aren't soldiers.

140
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,583
He's right.

141
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,835
We have weapons hidden
throughout the city.

142
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,461
Brigette will tell
you where they are.

143
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,713
Sounds good.

144
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,590
Lieutenant, take care of it.

145
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,019
I can see you
haven't changed.

146
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,397
Bring me one
of those street maps.

147
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,198
Most of the guns, we stole
from the German army.

148
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,076
The explosives, we bought
from the black market.

149
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,535
We could use both.

150
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,330
Our biggest stockpile
is buried here--

151
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,915
two meters beneath
the last row of seats

152
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,292
of the Cinema Mystère.

153
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,835
You remember it,
don't you?

154
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,380
Hmm.

155
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,006
<i>I'm No Angel</i> 
with Mae West.

156
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,261
There's heavy fighting
in that area.

157
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,054
What's the best way in?

158
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,724
We dug a tunnel that leads
directly to the stockpile.

159
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,351
Here. I'll show you.

160
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,854
Incidentally...

161
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,690
we saw
<i>Death Takes a Holiday.</i>

162
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,819
It was the Mae West movie.
I'm sure of it.

163
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,905
She was singing...

164
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,992
"Sister Honky Tonk,"
and I put my arm around you.

165
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,536
And during
the courtroom scene...

166
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,205
I kissed you.

167
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,668
You know,
I think you're right.

168
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,213
I guess the experience wasn't
exactly burned into your memory.

169
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,299
Not the movie.

170
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,009
But I do remember the kiss.

171
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,266
So...

172
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,018
did you get my last letter?

173
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,812
You mean the one asking
me to leave France?

174
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,856
Germany was
about to invade.

175
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,859
I thought you'd be safer
back in the States...with me.

176
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,613
But...I guess
you found someone else

177
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,865
to take care of you.

178
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,326
There's never been
anybody else.

179
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,494
Then who...?

180
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,786
He's second
in command

181
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,955
of the Sainte Claire
occupation.

182
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,209
The first time he saw me,
he said I was pretty.

183
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,044
I took advantage
of his interest.

184
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,298
He doesn't know
I'm in the Resistance.

185
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,757
The child is his.

186
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,595
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,724
So am I.

188
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,476
( metallic clank )

189
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,937
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

190
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,236
Hold your fire.

191
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,737
Katrine...

192
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,322
you survived.

193
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,074
Are you surprised?

194
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,410
Very. Nazi headquarters
was destroyed.

195
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,119
We assumed you were killed
in the explosion.

196
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,287
What is that?

197
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,581
Some kind of
an escape tunnel?

198
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,418
That's precisely
what it is.

199
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,211
You're the leader of
the local Resistance.

200
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,462
That's right.

201
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,507
Captain Miller
Fifth Armored Infantry.

202
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,175
This is Lieutenant Davis.

203
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,344
I take it you've seen the
German bunker we uncovered.

204
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,054
I just came from there.

205
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,349
We suspect it's a munitions lab.
Can you confirm that?

206
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,642
Yes. A munitions lab.

207
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,810
Then this is it.

208
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,145
We're calling in
an air strike.

209
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,522
Contact the RAF.

210
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,773
Hold on, Captain.

211
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,149
There's an easier way
to do this

212
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,484
with a minimum
of casualties.

213
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,280
Let's hear it.

214
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,949
I've located the generator
that powers the entire complex.

215
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,951
It's heavily guarded,
but with your help,

216
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,911
I can get close enough
to set off some explosives.

217
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,205
My orders are to blow
the entire compound

218
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,915
before the Germans
send in reinforcements.

219
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,668
I saw technology in there
you can't begin to imagine--

220
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,505
warheads powerful enough
to destroy this entire valley

221
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,257
if they're
accidentally detonated.

222
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,550
Call for an air strike,

223
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,427
may be the last call you make.

224
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,347
How can you get close enough?

225
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,224
This tunnel.

226
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,976
I've been watching
this compound

227
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,061
for several months,
and I've got a man inside.

228
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,938
The place is crawling
with Krauts.

229
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,731
That's why I need your help.

230
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,776
If your men can clear
these two corridors,

231
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,987
it'll give us access
to this entryway.

232
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,573
Get me there,
and I can take care of the rest.

233
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,992
"C" Company--
what's their status?

234
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,120
They're holding position
about 200 yards from here.

235
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,417
Get them on the horn.

236
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,709
You'll lead us
into the compound,

237
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,086
but I'm coming
with you.

238
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,379
I work better alone.

239
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,047
This isn't a request.
It's an order.

240
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,300
Order? Do I look like I'm
wearing one of your uniforms?

241
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,468
I go alone.

242
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,718
I thought you
needed our help.

243
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,304
I'll be right
behind you.

244
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,805
PARIS ( outside ):
Lieutenant Blake.

245
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,474
There's been
a change of plans...

246
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,144
( voice continues
indistinctly )

247
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,938
Even if I manage to disrupt
the neural interfaces,

248
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,649
we've still got
a war to fight.

249
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,026
We're going to need something
a lot more effective

250
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,277
than these old firearms.

251
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,613
I believe I can enhance
these weapons

252
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,114
using Borg technology,
but I'll have

253
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,782
to access Cargo Bay 2.

254
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,743
If something goes wrong
and I don't succeed,

255
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,371
you'll be the only one left

256
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,788
who knows what's
really going on.

257
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,123
Understood.

258
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,750
( bombs exploding outside )

259
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,503
Have our suspicions
been confirmed?

260
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,795
Suspicions?

261
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,424
Is she a collaborator?

262
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,758
I think we
can trust her.

263
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,760
Are you certain?

264
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,304
Three hours ago,
you were prepared

265
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,556
to put a bullet in her head.

266
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,432
She's on our side.

267
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,184
In your absence,

268
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,395
I may be forced to make
that determination for myself.

269
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,313
I've already made it.

270
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,941
You're not to harm her.
Is that understood?

271
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,151
( German voices approaching )

272
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,779
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

273
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,032
German forces are advancing
on our position.

274
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,785
Let's give them
a warm welcome.

275
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,457
Mademoiselle, after you.

276
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,797
Punctured lung,
arterial rupture,

277
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,508
fracture of the 13th vertebrae.

278
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,800
He needs surgery.

279
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,472
First and second-degree burns
to the face and neck.

280
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,724
Treat him.

281
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,726
His injuries are minor.
He can wait.

282
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,310
I said treat him!

283
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,354
This man has
massive internal injuries.

284
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,980
If I don't operate now,
he'll die.

285
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,774
Treat the burns, or I'll
deactivate your program.

286
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,486
What kind
of physician are you?

287
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,820
The first rule of triage

288
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,656
states that critical injuries
take priority.

289
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,991
Your rules, not mine.

290
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,375
From now on, leave the wounded
prey where they fall.

291
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,001
Tend only to our own.

292
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:23,428
I'm as dry
as the crater at Tarpahk...

293
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,430
( chuckling )

294
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,767
...in the middle
of the dry season...

295
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,435
when it's<i> dry!</i>

296
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,853
( laughing hysterically )

297
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,273
( grunts )

298
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,441
I'm not done!

299
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,943
Share with your brothers.

300
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,654
It's the eve of battle.

301
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,155
( grunts )

302
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,325
( roars )

303
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,826
I may be drunk,

304
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,789
but I can still send your soul
to the next world

305
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,625
and leave your body here
to rot!

306
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,835
Though from the stench of it,
I'd say it's begun to already.

307
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,254
( chuckles )

308
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,589

309
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,302

Wrong guy.

316
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,819
You speak English?

317
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,612
Yeah.

318
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,863
I speak English.

319
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,657
American?

320
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,536
I didn't see him coming.
You saved my life.

321
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,911
Why are you
out of uniform?

322
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,246
What company are you with?

323
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,457
Um...

324
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,459
well, I'm a...I'm a civilian.

325
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,670
In the middle
of a battle zone in France?

326
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,838
The hell you are.

Go on.
I'm right behind you.

Look, I don't have time
for 20 questions.

330
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,305
You say you're an American?

331
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,767
All right then, if Betty Grable
came around that corner

332
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,394
what part of her
would you be staring at?

333
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,568
Sorry. Time's up.

334
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,819
Her legs!

335
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,654
I-I'd be staring at her legs.

336
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,948
( nervous chuckle )

337
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,535
Ha. Bull's-eye.

338
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,039
Lucky for you.

You're a gung ho kind
of gal, aren't ya?

341
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,297
Does that bother you?

342
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,133
Nope. Just not used
to it, that's all.

343
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,011
The girls back home
are a little different.

344
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,056
I guess when it comes
to my people's safety,

345
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:36,686
this girl tends to get
a little...gung ho.

346
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,020
Nothing to
apologize for.

347
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,022
I'm the same way
with my men.

348
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,357
There's not
a day goes by

349
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,359

think to myself,

"I'm going to get
'em back safely

even if I die trying."

352
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,115
I know the feeling.

353
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,494
We're about to enter some caves
that run under the town.

354
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,121
Caves?

355
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,832
We're going to meet our contact
there. I should warn you.

356
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,251
There are eccentric people
who live in the caves,

357
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,920
but don't be alarmed.

Good evening,
gentlemen.

365
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,286
Who are you?

366
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,414
How did you get past
our battle lines?

367
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,707
We're friends.

368
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,959
Allies.

369
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,627
Sent by what House?

370
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,962
The House of...

371
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,508
...of ToH-Maag.

372
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,552
ToH-Maag.

373
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,471
I never heard of it.

374
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,681
I'm not surprised.

375
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,265
It's a long
way from here.

376
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,059
This battle
doesn't concern you.

377
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,353
Maybe not...

378
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,482
but we'd be honored

379
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,276
to fight alongside
such great warriors.

380
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,447
If you prefer, we'll take
our weapons elsewhere.

381
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,240
Wait!

382
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,076
I'll consider your request...

383
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,747
but first, prove your fortitude.

384
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,040
Drink!

385
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,626

<i>t'patoH-cha!</i>

387
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,631
I guess my French
is a little rusty.

388
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,341
( quietly ):
Don't drink it.

389
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,051
It's twice as
strong as whiskey.

390
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,136
I'll be right back.

391
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,974
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

392
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,976
( chuckling ):
Eh?

393
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,730
( Neelix continues
indistinctly )

394
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,537
Captain. Is--
Is it you?

395
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,081
Yes. We've got to disable
the rest of those interfaces.

396
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,374
The controls are routed

397
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,084
through the surgical
console in Sickbay,

398
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,127
but it will take time
to disable all of them.

399
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,963
We don't have time.

400
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,841
I'll access the Jefferies tube
that runs under that deck plate,

401
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,467
set a few charges
and blow out the console.

402
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,512
Charges? The Hirogen
have seized the armories.

403
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,389
No problem.

404
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,266
I got all the ammo I need
right here.

405
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,809
Holographic explosives?

406
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,062
With the safety protocols
off-line,

407
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,773
they're as good
as the real thing.

408
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,649
Hmm.

409
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,985
( muttering )

410
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,906
Ah! Another
of your warriors?

411
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,323
Yes.

412
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,326
He's a frail-looking thing.

413
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,788
I'll contact you
when I've disabled

414
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,082
the rest of the interfaces.
In the meantime, stay here.

415
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,374
With the Klingons?

416
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,126
Believe me,
it's peaceful

417
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,544
compared to
Sainte Claire.

418
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,546
Captain.

419
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,717
( growls )

420
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,722
( yells )

421
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,265
Please, don't do that.

422
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,060
( sinister chuckle )

423
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,981
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

424
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,276
( explosion )

425
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,529
They've got us
outnumbered!

426
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,197
And outgunned.

427
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,742
They're setting up a machine gun
emplacement across the street.

428
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,843
Where have you been?

429
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,553
Obtaining supplies.

430
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,639
What is this?

431
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,309
German technology taken
from their compound.

432
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,354
I can use them to
enhance our weapons.

433
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,029
( automatic gunfire, yelling)

434
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,491
I've cornered several
<i>Voyager</i> crewmen,

435
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,535
but they've taken refuge
in a guarded building.

436
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,787
I need three nucleonic charges
to penetrate the structure.

437
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,916
Nucleonic charges could damage
the holodeck further.

438
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,584
Use your hand weapons.

439
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,087
Then I'll need
more hunters.

440
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,297
<i>They're on the way.</i>

441
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,013
Damn. There's
a level-9 force field

442
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,389
around the surgical
console.

443
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,891
We'll have to go in
and shut it down.

444
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,100
"Force field"?

445
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,351
I'll explain later.

446
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,312
Set the detonator
for five minutes.

447
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,483
( ticking )

448
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,570
Five hunters have been killed
in the last hour.

449
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,740
You must engage
the safety protocols.

450
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,324
<i>Those protocols</i>
<i>aren't functioning.</i>

451
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,326
Then I'll need
assistance to...

452
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,786
( hatch opens )

453
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,121
Stand by.

454
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,085
You.

455
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,545
Get him out of here.

456
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,256
There are ten pounds of
dynamite under the floor

457
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,466
set to blow in less
than three minutes.

458
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,760
Move.

459
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,824
Bridge to Sickbay.

460
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,994
Sickbay, respond.

461
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,706
Bridge to Deck 5.

462
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,500
Converge on the Sickbay.

463
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,593

464
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,851

469
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,422
( panting )

470
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,382
We're on the holodeck
under attack.

471
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,343
You must--

472
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,597
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

473
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,114
Bridge,
this is Holodeck 1.

474
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,033
I have seized the building

475
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,286
and I have found
another access to this holodeck.

476
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,288
Seal it. How many captives?

477
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,291
Four. Their neural interfaces
have been disabled.

478
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,293
I will make the kill.

479
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,796
No. They are not prey.
They are hostages.

480
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,966
I'll need them.
As you wish.

481
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,344
You. Help me seal this hatch.

482
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,475
So, what do you think?

483
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,187
A boy or a girl?

484
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,356
It's a holographic
projection.

485
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,774
Unfortunately,
it's a very good projection.

486
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,026
I feel 20 kilos heavier.

487
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,777
It even kicks.

488
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,571
I don't recognize
this program.

489
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,323
I do.

490
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,909
He's wearing a Nazi uniform.

491
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,911
We're on Earth
during the second world war.

492
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,330
"Nazi"?

493
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,414
Totalitarian fanatics
bent on world conquest--

494
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,959
the Borg of their day,
no offense.

495
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,294
None taken.

496
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,225
What are you staring at?

497
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,642
Get up.

498
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,441
You deceived me.

499
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,693
Really?

500
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,444
I should've seen through
your flirtations.

501
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,905
If you say so.

502
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:11,409
The thought of you
carrying my child disgusts me.

503
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,035
You're not the only one.

504
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,373
Look, I don't know
what went on

505
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,666
between the two of you,
but it's obviously over now.

506
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,837
I see you're acquainted.

507
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,173
Do you find her as attractive
as I once did?

508
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,719
I'll miss our nights together.

509
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,888
Pig!

510
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,557
Put the weapon away.

(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

512
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,019
Now.

513
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:53,075
Funny. He doesn't
seem like your type.

514
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,205
Doctor, trouble.

515
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,748
Now what?

516
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,042
The Klingons are starting
to wake up from their nap.

517
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,003
All right, hold on.
What are you doing?

518
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,297
I've established an interface
with Holodeck 1.

519
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,965
I want to monitor
what's going on over there

520
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,384
in case the crew
needs my help.

521
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,802
KLINGON:
<i>Qapla'!</i>

522
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,554
( quietly ):
Uh-oh. What should we do?

523
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,390
Not having a cure
for Klingon hangovers,

524
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,683
I couldn't tell you.

525
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,480
The battle has begun.

526
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,191
Our plan is to penetrate
the enemy's position,

527
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,442
cut his forces in half.

528
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,028
And a very good plan it is.

529
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,279
Best of luck with it.

530
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,490
You...

531
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,242
will lead us into
battle, great warrior.

532
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,995
Maybe I'll just watch
from here.

533
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,039
Try to offer up some pointers
as things develop.

534
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:45,169
<i>To'qaH!</i> Lead the attack
or die here by my hand.

535
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,546
You heard him. Don't argue
with the man. Run along.

536
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,174
I'll reattach any severed limbs.

537
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,218
Just don't misplace them.

538
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,304
<i>You!</i> Cover our flank.

539
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,725
<i>Qapla'!</i>

540
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,060
<i>Qapla'.</i>

541
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,229
Tallyho.

542
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,732
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

543
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,941
( door chimes )

544
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,276
Enter.

545
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,824
Leave her.

546
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,575
I see you've done
some redecorating.

547
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,785
Your attempt

548
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,704
to retake this vessel was...

549
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,331
inventive.

550
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,875
From the day I seized
<i>Voyager,</i> you put up

551
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,421
a dauntless fight,
but your fight is over now.

552
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,631
You're going to help me
shut down these simulations

553
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,133
and repair the holodecks.

554
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,760
No.

555
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,889
We'll destroy this ship
before we surrender it.

556
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,016
Don't threaten me,
Captain.

557
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,852
I've faced far more
intimidating prey than you.

558
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,273
If this fight continues,
I promise you,

559
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:52,027
I will hunt down and kill
every member of your crew.

560
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,572
Well, by then this ship
will be damaged beyond repair

561
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,199
and there won't be much
of a trophy left, will there?

562
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,825
Perhaps I should kill you

563
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,244
and find someone who
will cooperate.

564
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,288
Good luck.
You'll get the same response

565
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,915
from all of them.

566
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,375
You don't realize
what's at stake.

567
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,294
I know what's at stake--
your sick little game.

568
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,587
This is not a game!

569
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,338
Then what is it?

570
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,512
I'm trying to create a future
for my people.

571
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,972
Future?

572
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,640
I don't expect you
to understand.

573
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,059
You are prey.

574
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,811
You underestimate us.

575
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,108
Yes.

576
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,027
Perhaps I do.

577
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,406
I'm listening.

578
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:45,289
My people are hunting
themselves into extinction.

579
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:50,085
Your holodeck technology
might offer us

580
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,712
an alternative--
a new way of life.

581
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,466
Instead of scattering ourselves
across the Quadrant

582
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:59,428
in pursuit of prey,
we could simulate the hunt

583
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:04,475
and give ourselves a chance
to rebuild our civilization.

584
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,102
And confine your killing
to holograms.

585
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,814
With the safety protocols
off-line, the pursuit is just

586
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,525
as challenging.

587
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,194
Oh, I understand
what you're trying to do,

588
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:19,573
but then...why have
you been torturing us?

589
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,949
Why have you thrown my crew

590
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,660
into one brutal
simulation after another?

591
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,496
I've been studying
your behavior

592
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,831
as I do with all my prey,

593
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,043
but your holodecks
allowed me to go further--

594
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,921
to explore your culture,
your history.

595
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,926
I must admit
I've learned a great deal.

596
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,220
How so?

597
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,264
Your people have faced
extinction many times,

598
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,892
but you've always
managed to avoid it.

599
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:51,021
You seem to recognize
the need for change.

600
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,566
Yes. You've got one
of those moments

601
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,108
running right now
on the holodeck.

602
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,027
We called it World War II.

603
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,154
One of your
most difficult eras.

604
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,406
And yet you survived.

605
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,657
It wasn't easy.

606
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,743
You are a resilient species.

607
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,248
I admire your cunning.

608
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,833
Let's end this.

609
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,046
I'll call a cease-fire

610
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:19,091
and we can try
to contain the damage.

611
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:22,219
I want my ship back,
but in return, I will give you

612
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,138
what you need to create
the holodeck technology.

613
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,726
It would be cunning
for you to agree.

614
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,978
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

615
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,371
Synthetic.

616
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,624
And undrinkable.

617
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,667
I am tired of
this simulation.

618
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,669
<i>Mein Herr,</i>
a word with you.

619
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,672
And these holograms
are becoming annoying as well.

620
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,924
What are we waiting for?

621
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,636
Why don't we execute
these prisoners?

622
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,013
Orders from the commandant.

623
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,392
If I may speak freely?

624
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,607
The commandant has been acting
strangely the past few days.

625
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:20,860
He's been questioning
German superiority.

626
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,240
Perhaps we shouldn't follow
his orders so...

627
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,784
blindly.

628
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,703
You will do as he says...

629
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,498
as long as<i> I</i> tell you to.

630
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,957
I don't know how much longer

631
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,168
I can stand
being trapped in here.

632
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,629
Perhaps you would enjoy
some entertainment.

633
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,927
Sing.

634
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,055
I will not.

635
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,724
Sing...

636
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,893
or you will die.

637
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,941
Then I'll die.

638
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,444
Seven, you are
a valued member

639
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,154
of this crew.

640
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,280
The logical response

641
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,865
would be to grant
his request.

642
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,617
Logic is irrelevant.

643
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,911
One day the Borg
will assimilate your species

644
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,623
despite your arrogance.

645
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,293
When that moment arrives,
remember me.

646
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,962
ALPHA-HIROGEN ( on com ):
<i>Bridge to Holodeck 1.</i>

647
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,381
Yes.

648
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:26,343
I've come to an agreement
with Captain Janeway.

649
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,469
Call a cease-fire.

650
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,513
What?
Captain...?

651
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,972
JANEWAY ( on com ):
<i>It's true, Tuvok.</i>

652
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,349
Our first order
of business

653
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,600
is to call
off the troops.

654
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,934
I want you
to find Chakotay

655
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,145
<i>and have him</i>
<i>convince his soldiers</i>

656
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,523
<i>to pull out of the city.</i>

657
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:40,982
Aye, Captain.

658
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,444
Turanj, order our hunters
to end the fighting.

659
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,571
This is madness.

660
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,447
We're winning
this battle.

661
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:51,117
Our civilization depends
on this agreement.

662
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,495
Acknowledged.

663
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,080
You heard him.

664
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,331
Release the captives.

665
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll tell the others.

666
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,837
Order all units

667
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,464
to withdraw
to these positions.

668
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,676
I have always thought
highly of you.

669
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,261
Have you?

670
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,221
Yes.

671
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,433
But the commandant
is a fool.

672
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,476
He doesn't understand.

673
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:21,022
He's never embraced
the Fuhrer...or his vision.

674
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:25,611
One does not cooperate
with decadent forms of life.

675
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,153
One hunts them down

676
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,530
and eliminates them.

677
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,823
The commandant speaks

678
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,074
of civilization.

679
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,660
The ancient Romans
were civilized.

680
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,370
The Jews are civilized.

681
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,124
But in all its moral
decay, Rome fell

682
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,168
to the spears
of<i> our</i> ancestors...

683
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,005
as the Jews are falling now.

684
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,383
Look

685
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,844
at our destiny.

686
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,095
The field of red.

687
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,849
The purity of German blood.

688
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,811
The blazing white
circle of the sun

689
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:02,648
that sanctified
that blood.

690
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:06,819
No one can deny us,
no power on Earth or beyond--

691
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,947
not the Christian savior,
not the God of the Jews.

692
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:13,116
We are driven by the very force

693
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,034
that gives life
to the universe itself.

694
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,912
We must countermand
the commandant's orders.

695
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,789
Stay and fight.

696
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,751
We must be faithful
to who we are.

697
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:26,880

00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,864
Return to your
previous positions.

702
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,782
We're calling
a cease-fire.

703
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,994
Repeat. Cease-fire.

704
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,204
Well, the word is out.

705
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,289
Whether it will be acted upon
is another question.

706
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,958
Oh, they'll follow orders.

707
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,751
I'm their commanding officer,
remember?

708
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,593
Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!

I find that peculiar,

00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,997
and the fighting's
getting worse.

723
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,082
The crew is taking
heavy casualties.

724
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,959
How can we help?

725
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,794
I'll transfer my program
to Holodeck 1.

726
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,504
You take the Jefferies tube
and meet me there.

727
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,423
There's only
the two of us.

728
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:55,427
Nevertheless, we have to try--
( loud belch )

729
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,222
Even half drunk,

730
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,308
Klingons are among the best
warriors in the galaxy.

731
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,227
But they're already
in the middle of a war

732
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,689
with the House of...
mmm, uh, whatever it is.

733
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,315
Then you'll just have
to convince them

734
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,276
that there's a more important
battle to be waged.

735
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,569
What, me?

736
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,655
You<i> are</i> their "great
warrior." Lead them.

737
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,786
( clears throat )

738
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,079
Pardon me, gentlemen.

739
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,249
I wonder if I might
have a word with you?

740
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:30,629
They're Klingons,
not kittens.

741
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,673
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

742
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,258
You will listen!

743
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,263
JANEWAY:
These sensors
show you've placed

744
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,266
holo-emitters
on Decks 5 through 12?

745
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,726
No wonder the system breached.

746
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,770
You've turned<i> Voyager</i>
into one big holodeck.

747
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,271
Can you shut it down?

748
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,315
Yes, but I'm going to have
to initiate an overload.

749
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,942
We'll worry about
making repairs later.

750
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,069
Right now, we've got to put
an end to those simulations.

751
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,821
Janeway to Ensign Kim.

752
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,072
Yes, Captain.

753
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,573

<i>the holo-emitter network.</i>

755
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,328
I'm transferring optical
processor control to you now.

756
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,246
Start charging the
secondary power relays.

757
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,082
<i>We'll use them</i>
<i>to trigger the overload.</i>

758
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,333
I'm on it.

759
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,876
This is going
to take some time.

760
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,129
There are over 800 emitters
that we have to...

761
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,588
Move away from
the controls!

762
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:17,009
Why haven't you ordered
the cease-fire?

763
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,511
( grunting )

764
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,724
Move away from the controls.

765
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,601
Listen to me.

766
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,894
No!

What are you waiting for?

771
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,662
I am a hunter.

772
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,664
You are my prey.

773
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,212
Run.

774
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,483
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

775
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,944

( gunfire and explosions )

777
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,877
Acknowledged. Out.

778
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,129
Our holographic allies
are losing ground.

779
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,923
The German troops
are surrounding the city.

780
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,926
I don't know how much longer
we can hold them off.

781
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,260
These weapons
are pretty crude.

782
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,428
They're not much help.

783
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,013
Maybe we should
fall back.

784
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,182
Where to? They're coming in
from all sides.

785
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,641
Tuvok, any chance we can get

786
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,060
through that breach
in the hologrid?

787
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,811
Unlikely.
20 more Hirogen

788
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,479
have taken up position
near the opening.

789
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,815
We are outnumbered.

790
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,483
( gunfire continues )

791
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,693
How's it going?

792
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,237
I'm modifying this
explosive device

793
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:01,696
to emit a photonic burst.

794
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,198
It'll be harmless
to organic tissue,

795
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,117
but it should disrupt
all holographic activity

796
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,367
within 20 meters.

797
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,578
We'll try
to buy you some time.

I will spare
your life for now,
