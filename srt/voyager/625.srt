1
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,114
Computer,
deactivate Mess Hall lights.

2
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,996
(<i> gasping</i> ):
Oh! You scared me.

3
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,455
That wasn't my intention.

4
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,081
No, of course not.

5
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,501
I-I-I guess I'm-I'm just
a little jumpy--

6
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,586
especially after
what happened the last time.

7
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,213
That's why I'm here.
Oh?

8
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,173
We'll be shutting
down main power soon.

9
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,509
The children's
regeneration cycle
will be interrupted.

10
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,011
They'll require
supervision.

11
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,805
Well, I'm happy to help.

12
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,349
To tell you the truth,
I'd be grateful
for the distraction.

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,060
The procedure could
take several hours.

14
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,647
How much do they know
about what's happening?

15
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,691
Nothing.

16
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,109
The children have
overactive imaginations.

17
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,320
I don't want to alarm
them unnecessarily.

18
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,447
What if they start
asking questions?

19
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,115
I can't just lie to them.

20
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,785
You have considerable
child-care experience.

21
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,537
I'm sure you'll manage.

22
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,879
That's close enough.

23
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,048
Let our momentum
carry us in.

24
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,050
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Cutting engines.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,970
Now, there's
a creepy image.

26
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,806
Reminds me of something
out of Edgar Allan Poe.

27
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,433
Looks like a vampire bat.

28
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,686
You can make out the wings,
even the ears.

29
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,103
What do you see, Tuvok?

30
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,105
Two Starfleet officers

31
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,025
with juvenile imaginations.

32
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,611
Come on, Tuvok.
Haven't you ever looked
up at the clouds

33
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,654
and seen an animal?

34
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,823
I will never understand
the human need

35
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,994
to find imagery
in something as innocuous
as a cloud.

36
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,370
Harry, are we ready?

37
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,247
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,749
Then let's do it.

39
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,419
All hands... initiate
shutdown sequence.

40
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,439
Computer, deactivate EMH.

41
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,712
NEELIX:
Everything's all right.

42
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,882
We've just had to shut down
main power temporarily.

43
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,593
Nothing to be concerned about.

44
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,222
Three, two, one--

45
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,975
mark.

46
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,984
All decks report shutdown
complete, Captain.

47
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:15,737
Janeway to Seven of Nine.
We're ready.

48
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,364
Acknowledged.

49
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,691
Why did they shut down
main power?

50
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,318
It's simply a precaution.

51
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,570
We've entered a class-J nebula,

52
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,530
and the Captain wants
to make sure

53
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:27,577
that we don't attract any, uh,
residual EM radiation.

54
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,746
Our shields provide
sufficient protection

55
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,290
against nebula discharge.

56
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,958
Is that so?
(<i> chuckles</i> )

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,793
Well, I'm afraid
that gaseous anomalies

58
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,503
were never really my specialty.

59
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,589
Come on, gather 'round.
I brought toys

60
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,383
and stories and games,

61
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,637
and I thought that later
we might even have
a little sing-along.

62
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,306
I should go
to Astrometrics.

63
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,308
Seven may need my help.

64
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,351
I'm afraid that Astrometrics
is shut down, too.

65
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,479
If we're not
analyzing the nebula,

66
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,023
why did we enter it?

67
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,775
Oh, that is
a long and dull story

68
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,568
and not nearly as interesting

69
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,530
as "Flotter Meets
the Invincible Invertebrates."

70
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,324
Is<i> Voyager</i>
<i>in danger?</i>

71
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,534
Mezoti, there's really no need

72
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,037
to leap
to those kinds of conclusions.

73
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,913
Maybe if you explained
what's happening in more detail,

74
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,832
we wouldn't have to guess.

75
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,375
This has something
to do with Deck 12,
doesn't it?

76
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,712
Well, what makes you say that?

77
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,630
Deck 12, Section 42
is off limits

78
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,799
to everyone
but senior officers

79
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,801
with a level-6
security clearance.

80
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,928
That's because it's
haunted, isn't it?

81
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,722
Who told you that?

82
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,265
Naomi.

83
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,975
She was just trying
to frighten you.

84
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,436
I'll have to have
a talk with that girl.

85
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,440
Is it true?
Does a ghost live there?

86
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,194
You're really too old
to believe in such silly things.

87
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,445
If it's not a ghost,
what is it?

88
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,114
We deserve
an explanation.

89
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,284
I don't think that Seven
would be too happy

90
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,453
if you all started waking up
with nightmares.

91
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,539
Tell us.
Please?

92
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,791
All right.

93
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,417
Gather 'round.

94
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,006
But I'm warning you--

95
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,760
this is not a tale
for the faint of heart.

96
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,345
We're not faint of heart.

97
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,597
Our cardiopulmonary
systems are reinforced.

98
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,308
So don't leave anything out.

99
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,895
All right, but remember,
I warned you.

100
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:24,069
It all began several months ago,
before you joined<i> Voyager.</i>

101
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,822
We were exploring
a dark nebula,

102
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,574
<i>just gathering deuterium.</i>

103
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,369
<i>We had no idea</i>
<i>what was in store for us,</i>

104
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,913
<i>but when the turbulence</i>
<i>started getting rough,</i>

105
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,374
<i>we should have seen that</i>
<i>as an omen.</i>

106
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,335
How goes the particle
collecting, Commander?

107
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,213
We've gotten
enough deuterium
to power the warp engines

108
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,756
for another thousand
light-years.

109
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,549
Excellent.

110
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,802
Something wrong?

111
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,054
Uh, now that you mention it,
there<i> is</i> something

112
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,513
that I feel compelled
to share with you

113
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,434
in my capacity
as Morale Officer.

114
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,603
The crew seem
a little on edge.

115
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,688
Oh?

116
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,985
They don't appear
particularly
anxious to me.

117
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,654
Well, they're very good
at hiding their fears.

118
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,115
Starfleet training.

119
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,328
Um, I was wondering
how soon we might
be leaving this nebula.

120
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,621
Knowing could help
reassure them.

121
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,582
Well, it's
difficult to say.

122
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,377
The Bussard collectors
are running at maximum,

123
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,045
but it's a slow process.

124
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,214
We could be here for
several more days.

125
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,592
Days.

126
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:34,514
Mr. Neelix, are you certain
it's not you who is on edge?

127
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,227
You know me too well,
Mr. Vulcan.

128
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,482
I can assure you, a J-class
nebula is no cause for alarm.

129
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,650
I know it's illogical,

130
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,861
but staring
into this murky cloud

131
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,697
for hours on end
can be a little unsettling.

132
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,369
When I was a child,

133
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,122
an immense plasma drift passed
through the Talaxian system.

134
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,958
The stars and the moons
were blotted out for months.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,127
From horizon to horizon,
all you could see

136
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,755
was this... this enormous,
menacing cloud.

137
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,799
Ever since then, I've
found it a little disturbing

138
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,510
to be in nebulas.

139
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,761
Perhaps the Captain

140
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,306
might give you permission
to install curtains.

141
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,725
That's an excellent idea,

142
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,311
and I have
just the right material.

143
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,105
Report.

144
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,149
KIM:
The nebula's beginning
to destabilize.

145
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,402
Cause.
I'm not sure.

146
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,362
It could have something to do
with the nadion emissions

147
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,739
being produced
by the Bussard collectors.

148
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,075
You're not remembering
correctly.

149
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,493
I beg your pardon?

150
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,952
The Bussard collectors

151
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,787
don't produce
nadion emissions.

152
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,332
Well, the technical details
don't matter.

153
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,501
What's important is
that<i> Voyager's</i> presence

154
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,711
was destabilizing the nebula,

155
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,423
<i>and the crew</i>
<i>wasn't interested</i>
<i>in taking any chances.</i>

156
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,007
We've got 80 percent
of the deuterium we wanted.

157
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,800
Maybe we shouldn't
push our luck.

158
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,928
Agreed. Bridge to Engineering.
TORRES: Go ahead.

159
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,596
We're suspending
the dilithium intake.

160
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,848
Acknowledged.
Tom, take us out.

161
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,392
Aye.

162
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,809
NEELIX:
<i>But at that exact moment,</i>

163
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,520
<i>in the fraction of a second</i>

164
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,646
before Tom could
engage the engines, zap!

165
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,690
<i>We were hit.</i>

166
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,527
What was it?

167
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,611
The ghost?

168
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,447
Shh. Let him finish.

169
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,158
Whatever it was,
it shook the ship hard.

170
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,537
An EM discharge
penetrated the hull--

171
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,372
Deck 7,
Section 10.

172
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,541
Increasing power
to structural integrity.

173
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,836
We're clear.

174
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,798
Damage.
Power outages on three decks.

175
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,134
Auxiliary subprocessors
are off-line.

176
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,762
No injuries reported.
Assign repair teams.
Resume course.

177
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,765
NEELIX:
<i>We'd taken some</i>
<i>minor damage,</i>

178
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:45,312
<i>but for the most part,</i>
<i>everything was fine...</i>

179
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,439
<i>or so we thought.</i>

180
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,441
What none of us knew

181
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:53,278
was that a mysterious stowaway
had come aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

182
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,702
What kind of stowaway?

183
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,705
It was obviously
a space-dwelling
life-form.

184
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,668
Yes, but we didn't know that,
not at that point.

185
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,378
Was it non-corporeal?

186
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,046
In a manner of speaking.

187
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,257
Hostile?
Well, I'm getting to that.

188
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,636
Species 5973?
Who are they?

189
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,597
The Borg encountered them
in Galactic Cluster 8.

190
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,308
They're multispectrum
particle life-forms.

191
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,353
No, that's not what this was.

192
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,855
Maybe it was
an interphasic species.

193
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,566
We can either debate
comparative xenobiology,

194
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,485
or I can continue
with the story.

195
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,236
Now, it's up to you.

196
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,158
Continue the story.

197
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,537
Somehow I thought
you'd say that.

198
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,288
Now, where was I?

199
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,873
Oh, uh, yes...

200
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,707
<i>Life aboard</i> Voyager

201
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,751
<i>would have been more</i>
<i>or less back to normal,</i>

202
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,880
<i>if it weren't for a few</i>
<i>strange malfunctions.</i>

203
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,006
(<i> door chimes</i> )

204
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,799
JANEWAY:
Come in.

205
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,177
I've got reports
from repair teams.

206
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,719
It looks like
that EM discharge

207
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,430
did more damage
than we thought.

208
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,932
Transporter Room 1
is out of commission;

209
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,893
half the sonic showers
are off-line,

210
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,688
and we temporarily lost
artificial gravity on Deck5.

211
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,064
Any injuries?

212
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,399
Ensign Mulcahy

213
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,941
bumped his head
on the ceiling.

214
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,235
Ouch.

215
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,696
This is terrible.

216
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,865
Computer, another cup
of coffee, black.

217
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,543
You can add
replicators
to your list.

218
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:35,380
We're getting started
on the wrong foot
today, my friend.

219
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,548
Captain?

220
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,174
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,093
I was talking
to<i> Voyager.</i>

222
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,845
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

223
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,848
I used to have
long conversations
with my Maquis ship.

224
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,268
Really? What did you two
talk about?

225
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,813
Oh, I can't tell you that.
Captain-Starship
confidentiality.

226
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,232
Of course.

227
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,234
If the Doctor heard us,

228
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,111
he'd probably recommend
counseling.

229
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,697
I won't tell if you won't.

230
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,490
Deal.

231
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,783
Commander,
do you see that?

232
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,370
It's a meteorite cluster.

233
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,996
I doubt it's anything
to worry about.

234
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,749
I'd tend to agree...

235
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,627
if it weren't the same one
we passed an hour ago.

236
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,381
Ensign.
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,008
Are you conducting
a survey of
meteoroids, Tom?

238
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,469
Ma'am?
Check your sensors.

239
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,387
We're traveling
in circles.

240
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,180
Not according
to my readings.

241
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,724
Tuvok, run a level-4 diagnostic

242
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,769
on the navigational array.

243
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,438
There is a malfunction
in the subprocessors.

244
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,273
It appears we're heading
back the way we came.

245
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,984
All stop.
Reinitialize your sensors.

246
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,778
I'm telling you,
we rely too much

247
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,946
on 24th-century
technology, Captain.

248
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,782
You give me a window
and a sextant,

249
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,451
and I guarantee I'll get you
where you want to go.

250
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,371
We've jumped
to warp 6.
Tom?

251
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,790
Don't look at me.

252
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,416
Shut down
the warp engines.

253
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,668
I can't.

254
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,295
Manual override.

255
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,421
No response.

256
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,507
Bridge to Engineering.

257
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,011
I'm reading all stop.

258
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,555
Lieutenant Torres,
respond.

259
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,558
Computer, locate
B'Elanna Torres.

260
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,353
Lieutenant Torres
is in Engineering.

261
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,022
Ensign Trumari
is on Deck 4, Section 30.

262
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,525
Commander Tuvok
is on the Bridge...

263
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,318
Find out what's going on.

264
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,153
Harry, pull the speech
processors if you have to,

265
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,697
but shut that thing off.

266
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,782
Ensign Boreck is in Engineering,
Level 2.

267
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,450
NEELIX:<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Commander Chakotay</i>

268
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,327
<i>was headed</i>
<i>for Engineering...</i>

269
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,330
<i>or so he thought.</i>

270
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,914
(<i> sighs</i> )

271
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,834
Engineering.

272
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,754
Bet you wouldn't try
to pull this on the Captain.

273
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,590
Have it your way.
I'll walk.

274
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,009
NEELIX:
<i>The turbolift started</i>
<i>to fall faster</i>

275
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,177
and faster...

276
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,428
Anybody hungry?

277
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,971
Neelix!

278
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,931
You haven't touched
your snacks.

279
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,476
Snacks are irrelevant.
Continue the story.

280
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,311
What happened to
Commander Chakotay?

281
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:59,649
The turbolift plunged
11 decks at high speed.

282
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,360
The g-forces pinned
Commander Chakotay
to the ceiling.

283
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,153
He knew
that at any minute,

284
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,946
he was going to come
crashing down to the bottom

285
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,490
of the turbolift,
and there was nothing

286
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,492
that he could do about it,
but then...

287
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,246
the descent stabilizers
reactivated.

288
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,164
The way
B'Elanna tells it,

289
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,083
Commander Chakotay
was not very happy

290
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,959
<i>when he showed up in</i>
<i>Engineering that morning.</i>

291
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,461
If I didn't
know any better,

292
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,921
I'd say this ship is
trying to kill me.

293
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,631
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

294
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,550
I've traced the problem
to a series of gel-packs

295
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,926
on Deck 13.

296
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,344
It looks like
they were burned out

297
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,763
by am EM discharge
from the nebula.

298
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,264
And those gel-packs
interface

299
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,849
with all the
affected systems.

300
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,392
I'm on my way
to repair it right now.

301
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,976
Feel like giving
me a hand?

302
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,729
Only if we stay
out of the turbolifts.

303
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,064
I'll tell you
about it on the way.

304
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,734
NEELIX:
<i>While Chakotay and B'Elanna</i>
<i>headed for Deck 13,</i>

305
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,862
<i>new problems</i>
<i>were cropping up</i>
<i>all over the ship.</i>

306
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,617
Crewman Celes, step away
from the control panel.

307
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,285
Did I do
something wrong?

308
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,579
You caused a power
failure in Astrometrics.

309
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,205
I did? How?

310
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,041
That's what
I'm attempting
to find out.

311
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,001
I don't see how I could have
done anything...

312
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,503
I've located
the problem.

313
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,380
It appears you
inadvertently overloaded

314
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,882
a series of EPS conduits

315
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,550
while performing
your diagnostic.

316
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,969
But I haven't even started
the diagnostic.

317
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,763
Then what were you doing?

318
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,973
Nothing. I just got here.

319
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,187
I know<i> that</i> wasn't my fault.

320
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,902
These gel-packs
aren't burned out.

321
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,613
There's no trace
of any EM discharge.

322
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,573
Could it have dissipated
this quickly?

323
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,701
No, it moved.
Moved?

324
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,453
The discharge seems
to be traveling

325
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,079
through
the bio-neural circuitry...

326
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,540
jumping from system to system.

327
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,000
Can you isolate it?

328
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,462
It's in a series of gel-packs

329
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,173
that interface
with the environmental controls

330
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,800
outside Cargo Bay 2.

331
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,678
Let's try to get there
before it jumps again.

332
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,930
NEELIX:
<i>By then, Seven of Nine</i>

333
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,390
<i>was in Cargo Bay 2</i>
<i>to run diagnostics,</i>

334
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,601
<i>but, because the com system</i>
<i>was down,</i>

335
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,854
<i>they couldn't warn her,</i>
<i>and she had no idea</i>

336
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,564
<i>that something was</i>
<i>in the room with her.</i>

337
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,859
Here?
In this cargo bay?

338
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,486
Then what happened?

339
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,029
<i>The creature was clinging</i>

340
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,823
<i>to the circuits</i>
<i>and bulkheads,</i>

341
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,741
<i>using them to move</i>
<i>about the room.</i>

342
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,410
<i>It was getting</i>
<i>closer and closer.</i>

343
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,291
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

344
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,879
Bridge, acknowledge.

345
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,130
NEELIX:
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>there was no answer.</i>

346
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,508
Why didn't she remodulate
her neural transceiver,

347
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,301
send a message that way?

348
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,721
Uh, that's
an interesting question.

349
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,641
You'll have to ask her.
Stop interrupting.

350
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,601
Seven tried to get out,

351
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,979
<i>but she was trapped.</i>

352
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,444
(<i> beeping denial</i> )

353
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,254
(<i> coughing</i> )

354
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,266
What happened to Seven?

355
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,476
The entity must
have infiltrated her
cybernetic systems

356
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,854
and turned her against
the rest of the crew.

357
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,647
It most certainly did not.

358
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,608
You're letting your imagination
run away with you.

359
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,402
What happened?
Why did the light go out?

360
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,821
It's all right. I just have
to replace the power cell.

361
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,075
It'll only take a moment.
Nothing to be frightened about.

362
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,493
I'm not frightened,
but Azan is.

363
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,870
I am not.

364
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,580
There.
(<i> both gasp</i> )

365
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,915
Sorry.

366
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,000
I didn't mean to scare you.

367
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,880
Now, where was I?

368
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,840
Oh, yes.

369
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,969
Seven was trapped
by the force fields,

370
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,887
but fortunately for her,

371
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,889
<i>help was on the way.</i>

372
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,898
Computer, deactivate
this force field.

373
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,525
We'll have to cut power
to the field generators.

374
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,488
The computer's
not accepting
my command codes.

375
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,864
Stand back.

376
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,868
The force field's down.
Let's get her to Sick Bay.

377
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,455
NEELIX:
<i>Now, most of us were just</i>
<i>going about our business,</i>

378
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,124
<i>oblivious</i>
<i>to what was happening,</i>

379
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
<i>but that was</i>
<i>about to change.</i>

380
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,712
Kim to Engineering.

381
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,467
Neelix to the Bridge.

382
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,972
I want everyone to report
to their stations

383
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,016
until we figure out
what's going on.

384
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,684
Aye, sir.

385
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,603
Uh, Ensign, uh, maybe
I should come with you.

386
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,856
The Captain might need me.
This is your post.

387
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,565
You may be needed here.

388
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,192
Oh, of course.

389
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,946
If you need anything,
anything at all,

390
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,531
you know where to find me.

391
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,367
<i>So there I was.</i>

392
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,036
<i>The only thing I could do</i>
<i>was wait...</i>

393
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,038
<i>alone...</i>

394
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,123
<i>in the dark.</i>

395
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,668
Oh... uh...

396
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,131
Voyager<i> was dead in space.</i>

397
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,175
<i>System after system</i>
<i>was failing,</i>

398
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,385
<i>including</i>
<i>the environmental controls.</i>

399
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,679
<i>Ensign Paris told me</i>
<i>it was hotter</i>

400
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,098
<i>than the Tarkanian desert</i>
<i>on the Bridge.</i>

401
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,017
Don't you ever sweat?

402
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,728
Not unless the temperature
reaches 350 degrees Kelvin,

403
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,604
with a humidity factor
at approximately...

404
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,939
Forget I asked.

405
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,108
Very well.

406
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,361
I'll make you
a deal,<i> Voyager.</i>

407
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,115
The next M-Class planetoid
we find, we'll set down,

408
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,119
and I'll give you
a nice maintenance overhaul.

409
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,746
What do you say?

410
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,334
Tom, check the conn.

411
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,965
(<i> system powers up</i> )

412
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,341
(<i> chuckles</i> )

413
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,843
I don't know
what you did, Captain,

414
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,970
but I've got
helm control back.

415
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,932
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Thanks, my friend.

416
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,934
I'm going to try
to get thrusters

417
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,310
and impulse engines
back on line.

418
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,272
Tom, I'm reading an EM
surge in your console.
Get away from there.

419
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,150
(<i> screaming</i> )
Bridge to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency!

420
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,735
Can we transport him?

421
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,028
Transporters are off-line.

422
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,446
Why am I not surprised?

423
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,198
(<i> console bleeps</i> )
Now what?

424
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,742
Warning.
Oxygen depletion in progress.

425
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,702
Breathable air is being sucked
out of the Bridge.

426
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,080
Reroute emergency
power to environmental
control.

427
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,372
(<i> coughing</i> )

428
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,874
No effect.

429
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,835
Everyone out of here<i> now!</i>

430
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,963
(<i> coughing</i> )

431
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,757
NEELIX:
<i>In Sick Bay, the Doctor</i>
<i>had his hands full, too.</i>

432
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,219
You're fortunate.
Another few moments and
you'd have been asphyxiated.

433
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,971
Where do you think
you're going?

434
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,974
Lieutenant Torres needs
help with the repairs.

435
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,391
Doctor!

436
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,144
(<i> groaning and gasping</i> )

437
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,022
What happened?

438
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,775
An EM surge--
Seven had a similar experience.

439
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,487
The environmental system
converted Cargo Bay 2
into a micronebula.

440
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,531
When Gibson and
McMinn tried to vent
the gas from Deck 7,

441
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,118
they were struck
by a discharge, too.

442
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,287
Are we thinking
the same thing?

443
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,205
It could be
an intelligence
at work here.

444
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,082
Some kind of an
electromagnetic
life-form

445
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,875
that's using the
environmental controls

446
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,961
to make the ship more
hospitable for itself.

447
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,839
And attacking anyone
who tries to stop it.

448
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,008
My matrix is
destabilizing.

449
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,759
Transfer his program
to the mobile emitter.

450
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,678
Quickly.

451
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,596
COMPUTER:
Warning. Power failure.

452
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,266
Let's get the
injured out of here.

453
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,019
NEELIX:
<i>Deck by deck,</i>
<i>section by section,</i>

454
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,646
<i>the crew was losing</i>
<i>control of</i> Voyager.

455
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,564
<i>People were scattered</i>
<i>throughout the ship</i>

456
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,651
<i>with no idea</i>
<i>what was happening.</i>

457
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,416
(<i> grunts</i> )

458
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,878
What did you do that for?

459
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,462
Ensign, I'm so sorry.

460
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,048
I-I thought... I thought

461
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,050
you were a Hirogen,
or-or a Borg.

462
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,676
And what gave you that idea?

463
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,137
It's dark. Your shadow.

464
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:13,017
Trust me, there are
no aliens roaming
the corridors.

465
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,561
You mean we haven't
been boarded?

466
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,313
It's just a power failure.

467
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:20,358
Isn't that what
they sometimes do?
Cut the power?

468
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,736
What who sometimes does?
Hostile aliens.

469
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,072
They might be trying
to infiltrate the ship.

470
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,533
How long has it been
since you've run
into anyone else?

471
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,702
I don't know,
four or five hours.

472
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,247
I-I tried Sick Bay,
but it was deserted.

473
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,123
Decks 3 and 4 are empty.

474
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,791
I-I was on my way
to the Bridge.

475
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,543
You're the first person
I've seen.

476
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,380
Well, there's no one
on the Bridge either.

477
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,841
You see? Then maybe I was right?
Maybe the reason
we can't find anyone

478
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,303
is because they've
all been assimilated.
Slow down.

479
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,389
There was an environmental
failure on the Bridge.

480
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,307
That's why it's been evacuated.

481
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,809
I don't know what happened
in Sick Bay or on Decks 3 and 4,

482
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,645
but I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

483
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,607
Uh-uh. No one's
been assimilated.

484
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,567
Then where are they?

485
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,405
They've probably set up
a temporary command post--

486
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,991
most likely in Engineering.
That's where I'm going.

487
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,701
Can I come with you?

488
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,412
Of course.

489
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,209
Ensign?
What?

490
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,794
Do you think we
could stop by

491
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,921
a weapons locker
on the way?

492
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,048
NEELIX:
<i>I still had no idea</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

493
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,800
<i>I'd been waiting</i>
<i>in the Mess Hall</i>

494
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,843
<i>for more than four hours</i>
<i>in the dark,</i>

495
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,345
<i>cut off from the rest</i>
<i>of the crew.</i>

496
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,139
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

497
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,933
Is somebody there?

498
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,778
Hello?

499
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,786
Hello?

500
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,002
Hello?

501
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,136
Is somebody out there?

502
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,556
Tom, if that's you,
this isn't funny.

503
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,876
(<i> screaming</i> ):
Stay away!

504
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,462
Calm yourself, Mr. Neelix.

505
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:50,299
Y-you really shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

506
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:51,842
I could have shot you.

507
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,969
Your restraint
is commendable.

508
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,762
Is there a problem
with the air supply?

509
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,515
An alien life-form
has seized control

510
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,517
of<i> Voyager's</i>
<i>primary systems.</i>

511
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,935
It's flooded
numerous sections
with poisonous gas.

512
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,897
Are you saying
that this alien life-form
is trying to kill us?

513
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,524
Its intentions
aren't clear.

514
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,734
However, we
should evacuate.
Where to?

515
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,568
The Captain
has established

516
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,821
a secure command
post in Engineering.

517
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,198
Were you scared?

518
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,533
Well, considering that

519
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,992
Engineering was eight decks down

520
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,660
and the only way
to get there was

521
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,829
to crawl through pitch-black
Jefferies tubes...

522
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,456
it's fair to say

523
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,459
that I was never more frightened
in my life.

524
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,926
You shouldn't have allowed
yourself to be afraid.

525
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,469
Is that so?

526
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,929
Fear distracts people

527
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,596
from accomplishing their goals.

528
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,724
Well, that's true, I suppose.

529
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,268
On the other hand,

530
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,978
fear can sometimes
be very healthy.

531
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,355
Explain.

532
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,399
Well, it keeps you alert.

533
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:52,236
Keeps you from putting yourself
in unnecessary danger.

534
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,820
I was afraid once.

535
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,531
You've been afraid
many times.

536
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:56,949
Icheb.

537
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,286
Do you want to tell
us about it?

538
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,246
It was when we were
first disconnected

539
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,541
from the hive mind,
before Seven rescued us.

540
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,586
I couldn't hear anyone
else's thoughts anymore.

541
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,921
I felt alone.

542
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,631
I can understand
why that was frightening.

543
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,136
When you're scared,
it helps to have someone
to talk to, doesn't it?

544
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,263
Yes.
Of course, in my case,

545
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,807
the only one person I had
to talk to was Commander Tuvok.

546
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,643
<i>I tried passing the time</i>
<i>with a little conversation,</i>

547
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,438
<i>but, as you've</i>
<i>probably noticed,</i>

548
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,982
<i>he's not exactly</i>
<i>what you'd call chatty.</i>

549
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,985
I'll bet Starfleet has
specific, uh, procedures

550
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,154
to deal with these kinds
of situations.

551
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,698
You know, something like,
uh, Protocol 1005.

552
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,993
In the event your
starship is invaded

553
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,912
by a hostile electromagnetic
life-form...

554
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:47,541
What do you suppose
that, uh, that protocol
would be, exactly?

555
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,377
Rest assured, this crew
is doing everything possible

556
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,171
to regain control
of the ship.

557
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,798
You're right.
I'm just being silly.
I concur.

558
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,967
Of course, the crew
of the<i> Salvoxia</i>
<i>probably thought</i>

559
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,470
they were going
to regain control
of their ship, too.

560
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,514
Did I ever tell you
about the<i> Salvoxia?</i>

561
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,682
If I say yes,
will it prevent you
from telling the story?

562
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,560
It was a Talaxian
freighter.

563
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,978
Horrible tragedy.

564
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,938
Happened nearly
a century ago.

565
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,898
After suffering
a cascade failure,

566
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,486
it began to lose
life-support generators
one by one.

567
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,696
Pretty soon, there
wasn't enough air left

568
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,366
to sustain
the entire crew,

569
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,326
so they began
to draw lots.

570
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,912
Can you imagine?
Draw the short straw
and you suffocate?

571
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,123
Anyway, the air
continued to diminish,

572
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,958
and they kept
drawing lots.

573
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,044
The crew got
smaller and smaller

574
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,463
as they waited for
someone to rescue them.

575
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,632
But no one ever came.

576
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,551
The<i> Salvoxia</i>
<i>drifted through space</i>

577
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,302
for the next 80 years,

578
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,055
until somebody
finally found her.

579
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,641
Makes me short of breath
just thinking about it.

580
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,601
Perhaps you should
occupy your mind

581
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,312
with pleasant thoughts,
before you hyperventilate.

582
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,855
Right.

583
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,942
Pleasant thoughts.
Pleasant thoughts.

584
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,571
What did the bodies
look like?
I beg your pardon?

585
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,780
After 80 years--
were they decomposed?

586
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,617
They may have been preserved
by the vacuum of space.

587
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,828
Oh. I shouldn't have
told you that story.
It's too gruesome.

588
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,039
I wonder what the crew
of the<i> Salvoxia</i>

589
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,084
did for food after
their emergency
rations were gone.

590
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,960
Maybe they ate each other.

591
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,380
All right, uh, that's enough.

592
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,424
Now, where was I?

593
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,884
We'd made it more
than halfway to Engineering,

594
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,387
<i>when we ran into</i>
<i>an obstacle.</i>

595
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,273
Commander!

596
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,150
(<i> pants</i> )

597
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,777
What do we do now?

598
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,321
If I can access
environmental controls,

599
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,240
I may be able
to vent the gas.

600
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,704
Is there another
way around?

601
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:52,332
It would take several hours
to reach Engineering
by an alternate route.

602
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,753
There is no guarantee
we'd find a clear path.

603
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,088
Pleasant thoughts.

604
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,215
Pleasant thoughts. Ah.

605
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,342
<i>While we were</i>
<i>in the Jefferies tubes,</i>

606
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:06,012
<i>a good number of the crew</i>
<i>had gathered in Engineering.</i>

607
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,474
97 crewmen have been
accounted for.

608
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,476
They're in secure locations
throughout the ship.

609
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,852
Neelix?
No one's seen him.

610
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,854
I shouldn't have ordered him
to stay in the Mess Hall.

611
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,273
You were
following procedure.

612
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,816
TORRES:
Captain.

613
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,322
Bad news.
The life-form's infiltrated
the main computer matrix.

614
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,906
As long as it remained
in the gel-pack,

615
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,617
there was a chance
to contain it.

616
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,619
But we can't purge it
from the main computer

617
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,246
without crashing the few
systems we have left.

618
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,206
<i>Things were looking grim,</i>

619
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,501
<i>but the Captain was about</i>
<i>to make a breakthrough</i>

620
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,252
<i>that would change everything.</i>

621
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,920
COMPUTER:
Captain Janeway.

622
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,922
Captain Janeway.

623
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:45,218
Captain Janeway
is in Main Engineering.

624
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,138
Sorry, Captain.
I know it's irritating.
I'll try to shut it down.

625
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,433
Hold on a minute.
This is Captain Janeway.

626
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,059
Respond.

627
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,395
Authorization code required.

628
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,606
Janeway-pi-alpha.

629
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,191
Captain?

630
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,109
It's only a hunch...

631
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,945
but I think this life-form
may be trying to communicate.

632
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,740
Sounds like a com system
malfunction to me.
I'm not so sure.

633
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,950
The life-form's been moving
from system to system.

634
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,203
If it's intelligent
it may be learning

635
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,998
how to use those systems
in some rudimentary way.

636
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,543
Are you attempting
to communicate?

637
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,961
Unable to comply.

638
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,588
Even if it understands
what you're saying,

639
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,089
it may not know
how to respond.

640
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,675
B'Elanna, can you call up

641
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,677
the com system's
syntax subroutines?

642
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,136
I'll try.

643
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,596
We're attempting
to make it easier

644
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,891
for you to speak to us.

645
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,601
Try to access
the database

646
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,730
at Engineering
Station 3-1.

647
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,939
Database accessed.

648
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,946
Why have you come
aboard our ship?

649
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:51,076
Captain Janeway,
report to Astrometrics.

650
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,746
Why do you want me
to go there?

651
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,956
Captain Janeway,
report to Astrometrics.

652
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,042
I guess I'll find out
soon enough.

653
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:03,171
Captain, Astrometrics is
flooded with nebular gas.

654
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,842
Astrometrics life support
has been restored.

655
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,468
It could be some
kind of trap.

656
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,512
This life-form,
whatever it is,

657
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,139
has already injured
at least 11 crewmen.

658
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,350
I can try to establish
a dialogue,

659
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,853
or I can let it
take over my ship.

660
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,146
Seven, you're with me.

661
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,899
Yes, Captain.

662
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,443
<i>While Captain Janeway</i>
<i>and Seven of Nine</i>

663
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,778
headed to Astrometrics,

664
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,738
Tuvok was trying
to ease my fears

665
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,490
by guiding me
through a meditation.

666
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:35,287
Concentrate on the rhythm
of your breathing.

667
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,332
Envision your lungs
filled with light.

668
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,628
Follow it back in time

669
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,465
to a moment
when you felt no fear...

670
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,550
a moment of happiness...

671
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,302
serenity.

672
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,306
My birthday dinner.

673
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,933
Describe it.

674
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,603
<i>I was surrounded</i>
<i>by all my friends.</i>

675
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,314
<i>They'd gotten together</i>
<i>to cook me dinner.</i>

676
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,024
<i>They prepared</i>
<i>all my favorites--</i>

677
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:09,279
<i>steamed</i> chadre kab,
<i>terra nut soufflé...</i>

678
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:13,533
<i>I felt loved...</i>

679
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,369
<i>appreciated...</i>
<i>safe.</i>

680
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,290
(<i> screams</i> )

681
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,793
Captain Janeway
served you nebular gas?

682
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,544
No, of course not.

683
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,005
It was just my imagination
playing tricks on me

684
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,090
during the meditation.

685
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,636
My head was too full
of scary images for me to relax.

686
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:36,014
The Captain, on the other hand,
seemed to be getting things
under control.

687
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,645
(<i> panting</i> )

688
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,648
Review of navigational logs
in progress.

689
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,944
Are you searching
for something?

690
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,487
Affirmative.

691
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,492
The nebula...

692
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,831
Manual helm control enabled.

693
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,041
You're returning
control of the ship.

694
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,460
Affirmative.

695
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,296
You want me to take you
back to the nebula.

696
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,590
Affirmative.

697
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,343
Well, why didn't
you just say so
in the first place?

698
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,512
Returning to the nebula
is too dangerous.

699
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,806
We'd risk invasion
by other life-forms.

700
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,017
I'm beginning to think
this was all an accident--

701
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,685
not an invasion.

702
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,269
Captain?

703
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,146
Think about it.

704
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,149
The EM surge didn't hit us
until our Bussard collectors

705
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,527
destabilized the nebula,
and then what happened?

706
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:34,072
The ship began experiencing
random malfunctions.

707
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:37,075
I'm not so sure
they were random.

708
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,994
Navigational sensors
were fooling us

709
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,204
into heading back
toward the nebula,

710
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,958
and then, when Tom tried
to resume course,
he was attacked.

711
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,753
This life-form isn't
trying to hurt us.

712
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,296
It's trying to get home.

713
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,050
Can you give us access
to the Bridge?

714
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,053
Life support on the Bridge
has been restored.

715
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,764
Level-10 authorization required.

716
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,348
Level-10.

717
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,183
Captain's eyes only.

718
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,394
It wants me to go alone.

719
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,149
<i>The Captain</i>
<i>and the life-form had begun</i>

720
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,735
<i>to establish a rapport,</i>

721
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,529
<i>but the relationship</i>
<i>was fragile.</i>

722
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,416
Is the viewscreen
functioning normally?

723
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,167
Affirmative.

724
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,300
I'm sorry to tell you this...

725
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,176
but your nebula is gone.

726
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,137
Clarify.

727
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,682
The gasses must have continued
to dissipate after we left.

728
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,852
Warning. Life support failure
on all decks.

729
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,480
Abandon ship.
Abandon...

730
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,731
Ship.

731
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,608
Abandon ship.

732
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,485
The creature
was that angry?

733
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,904
Its home had
been destroyed.

734
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,032
The life-form wanted
<i>Voyager</i> for itself,

735
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:03,870
and it was going to kill
anyone who remained on board.

736
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:14,506
Captain Janeway's
only chance of saving her crew

737
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,009
was to try to reason
with the creature.

738
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,636
Listen to me.
I can still help you.

739
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,262
Abandon ship.

740
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,764
There are
other class-J nebulas.

741
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,223
I'll find you one.

742
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,809
Unable to comply.

743
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,477
I'd be able to "comply"

744
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,521
if you gave me access
to Astrometrics.

745
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,565
Warning.
Oxygen depletion in progress.

746
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,442
Give me back helm control!

747
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,362
Warning.
Helm circuits are overloading.

748
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,532
Abandon ship.

749
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,910
At least give me
access to the com
so I can warn my crew!

750
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,662
Unable to comply.

751

753
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,378
<i>I was with Tuvok</i>

Lie still.

757
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,467

(<i> gas hissing</i> )

759
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,222
Mr. Neelix...

760
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,557
proceed without me.

761
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,350
I'm not leaving you here.

762
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,102
I am injured.

763
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,937
Logic dictates
that you take the mask

764
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,731
and proceed
to Engineering.

765
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,441
I don't care
what "logic dictates."

766
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,361
This isn't the<i> Salvoxia.</i>
<i>We're not drawing lots.</i>

767
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,865
I am giving you an order.
And I'm disobeying it.

768
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:26,452
You're coming with me
if I have to drag you by
your pointy little ears.

769
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,915
<i>I had no choice.</i>
<i>I had to control my fear.</i>

770
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,210
(<i> gases roar</i> )

771
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,336
Pleasant thoughts.
Pleasant thoughts.

772
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,971
<i>While we made our way</i>
<i>to Engineering,</i>

773
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,141
<i>Captain Janeway tried to</i>
<i>make the creature reconsider</i>
<i>what it was doing.</i>

774
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,309
You're going to kill everyone
on this ship.

775
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,105
Do you understand
what that means?

776
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,941
To deprive of life...
extinguish.

777
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,111
Yes... and if you extinguish us,

778
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,279
you'll be
extinguishing yourself.

779
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,115
You need this crew.

780
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,908
Clarify.

781
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,660
The technology you're using
needs to be maintained.

782
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,663
Who do you think is going
to do that when we are gone?

783
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,084
<i>Voyager's</i> secondary systems
have already begun to fail.

784
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:18,130
In a few weeks, primary systems
will start to go off-line.

785
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,257
Unable to confirm.

786
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,677
Access the internal sensors.
Run a shipwide diagnostic.

787
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,387
See for yourself.

788
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,099
Abandon ship.

NEELIX:
<i>The Captain's rapport</i>
<i>with the creature</i>

790
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,812
<i>seemed to be</i>
<i>breaking down,</i>

791
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,189
<i>and she couldn't afford</i>
<i>to wait any longer.</i>

792
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,818
I need everyone's attention.
We're abandoning ship.

793
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,319
Get to the escape pods.

794
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,946
We may not be able
to eject the pods.

795
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,906
We'll push them out
if we have to.

796
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,993
He needs medical
attention!

797
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,078
It'll have to wait.
We're abandoning ship.

798
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,538
<i>The entire crew</i>
<i>had to evacuate.</i>

799
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,292
<i>The</i> Delta Flyer<i> and</i>
<i>the shuttles were launched,</i>

800
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,461
<i>followed by all but one</i>
<i>of the escape pods.</i>

801
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,756
That's everybody
but the Captain and
the First Officer.

802
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,341
After you.

803
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:13,101
I did what you asked--
we're abandoning ship.
What more do you want?

804
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:16,562
Diagnostic complete.
Secondary systems off-line.

805
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,565
Primary systems at 32 percent.

806
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:24,070
Estimated time to failure--
six days, 13 hours.

807
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,905
That sounds about right.

808
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,950
Captain Janeway,
report to Engineering.

809
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,619
Like hell, I will.

810
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,875
I won't be your prisoner.

811
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,211
You'll have to kill me.

812
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,545

00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,590
Captain Janeway,
report to Engineering.

815
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,969
Not until you restore
life support...

816
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:52,640
and give me back control
of my ship.

817
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,559
Unable to comply.

818
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,437
Then we'll die here together.

819
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,692
I'm guessing...

820
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,361
(<i> coughing</i> )

821
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,988
I've got
about two more minutes...

822
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,698
and then you're on your own.

823
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,326
Captain Janeway,
report to Engineering.

824
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,578
I told you...
(<i> coughing</i> )

825
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,955
...the only way I'm helping

826
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:21,253
is if you return control
of my... ship!

827
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,296
(<i> coughing</i> )

828
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,507
It looked like
the creature was calling
the Captain's bluff.

829
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,885
She was down
to her final breath.

830
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,304
But at the last moment...

831
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,726
(<i> coughing</i> )

832
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,563
(<i> wheezing</i> )

833
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,025
Access to all systems
has been restored.

834
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,945
It took almost two days
for the crew

835
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,988
to return to the ship.

836
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,199
Eventually,
an artificial environment

837
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,702
was created
in an isolated section
of Deck 12.

838
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:58,039
The creature's been
living there ever since.

839
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,792
I told you there was
a monster on Deck 12.

840
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,669
Haven't you
been listening?
It's not a monster.

841
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,422
It's an alien
life-form.

842
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,673
(<i> rattling</i> )

843
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,467
What was that?

844
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,345
Maybe it's an alien life-form
coming to get us.

845
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,848
Haven't you learned anything
about letting your imagination
get the best of you?

846
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,394
There.
That little jolt

847
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,854
was probably nothing more than
our friend leaving the ship

848
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,232
to go to a new home
that the Captain found for him.

849
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,109
Time to regenerate.

850
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,408
What if the life-form
didn't leave?

851
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,327
What if it
wants revenge?

852
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,203
Well...

853
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,457
w-what if I told you
I made up the whole thing?

854
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,460
Naomi told me you
always exaggerate.

855
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,254
I knew the story
wasn't true
the moment you said

856
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:49,299
the Bussard collectors
produced nadion emissions.

857
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,343
I should've known better

858
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,053
than to try fooling
the four of you.

859
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,555
All right, in you go.

860
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,484
Pleasant dreams.

861
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,908
How are the
children?

862
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,077
Tucked in their alcoves,
safe and sound.

863
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,912
I hope
they weren't frightened.

864
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,748
Oh... why would they
be frightened, Captain?

865
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,583
They<i> were</i> in the dark
for three hours.

866
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,461
Oh, no, not to worry.

867
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,214
I told them a story
to pass the time.

868
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,965
Let me guess-- "Mother Goose."

869
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,884
Certainly not.

870
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,761
Some of those fairy tales
can be frightening--

871
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,847
ogres
and child-eating monsters.

872
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,350
Speaking of which,
is everything... okay?

873
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,519
We're just taking
some final readings

874
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,730
before we resume course.
Show him, Harry.

875
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,072
Well...

876
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,325
I hope it lives
happily ever after.
