1
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,684
[groans] Ensign Kim,
please try and hold us steady.

2
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,269
This material is extremely fragile.

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,356
Sorry, Doc,
I'm doing the best I can.

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,440
<i>Maybe I should have insisted</i>

5
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,985
on a more experienced pilot,
like Mr. Paris.

6
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,863
Oh, I'd give anything
to trade places with him right now.

7
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>Seven, can you join me, please?</i>

8
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,534
On my way.

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,995
I don't know if I can take three more days
of chasing comets with him.

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,874
The time might pass more easily
if we disable his vocal processor.

11
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,299
I thought you might
find this interesting.

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,390
Pre-animate biomatter.

13
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,767
Look deeper.

14
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,314
An undeveloped nucleus contained
in a cytoplasmic matrix.

15
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,900
And buried deep inside
that nucleus--

16
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,070
primitive strands of DNA.

17
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,863
The beginnings of life, Seven.

18
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,490
What's your point?

19
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,410
When I look at this,
I don't see a mere cell.

20
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,954
I see the potential
for literature and art,

21
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,664
empires and kingdoms.

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,375
Perhaps your visual subroutines
are malfunctioning.

23
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,501
[sighs]

24
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,420
Someday...

25
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,756
this cytoplasmic matrix may fall

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,091
into the primordial sea
of a distant world,

27
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,845
where it could ignite
an evolutionary process.

28
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,347
Eons from now,
a creature not unlike you

29
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,975
could emerge,
look up at the stars

30
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,728
and ask, "Who am I?

31
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,605
How did I come to be?"

32
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,566
It's the miracle of creation,
Seven.

33
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,027
Doesn't that excite you?

34
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,781
Ensign Kim, I asked you
to hold us steady.

35
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,075
We're under attack!

36
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,316
This is the Federation Ship
Delta Flyer.

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,735
We're on a peaceful mission.

38
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,861
Hold your fire.

39
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,363
[Male] <i>You're transporting</i>
<i>a suspected photonic insurgent</i>

40
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,823
<i>through Lokirrim space.</i>

41
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,992
<i>Drop your shields</i>
<i>and prepare to be boarded.</i>

42
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,703
Photonic insurgent?

43
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,955
I--If you're referring
to the hologram,

44
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,498
he's our Doctor.

45
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,002
Seven, we've lost thrusters.

46
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,046
I'll try reinitializing
the driver coils.

47
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,965
[Kim] Voyager, this is the Flyer.
Mayday!

48
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:17,966
Come in.

49
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,927
[Computer] <i>Subspace</i>
<i>communications are off-line.</i>

50
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,390
[Seven]
<i>It's a tractor beam.</i>

51
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,851
Remodulate our shields.
That should break us free.

52
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,146
Shields are down.

53
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,152
[garbled]
What's happening?

54
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,031
They're using
some kind of disruption field.

55
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,949
It's decompiling your matrix.

56
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,410
[Male] <i>Federation vessel,</i>
<i>power down your systems</i>

57
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,287
<i>and prepare to surrender</i>
<i>the photonic.</i>

58
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,622
Seven, they're pulling us in.

59
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,665
You're going to have to hide
the Doctor's program.

60
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,168
Do something, please.

61
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,050
We don't want to hurt you.
We're here for the insurgent.

62
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,762
Where's the photonic?

63
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,098
You decompiled his matrix.

64
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,225
You murdered him.

65
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,935
Seven?

66
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,729
I'm sorry.
There wasn't enough time.

67
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,692
Biogenic material.

68
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,070
It could be used
to create viral weapons.

69
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,404
Confiscate it.

70
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,198
Our Doctor was using
these spores

71
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,034
to synthesize new medicines,
not weapons.

72
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,953
What's this?

73
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,375
It's my portable
regeneration unit.

74
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,043
I have a unique physiology.

75
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,005
This device maintains
my cybernetic systems.

76
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,508
- Have this analyzed.
- [Male] Yes, sir.

77
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,760
There's no one else aboard.

78
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,929
Take them to detention,

79
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,889
and secure their ship
in the Docking Bay.

80
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,058
You got what you wanted.
Let us go.

81
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,560
Transporting photonics

82
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,021
and manufacturing biogenic
weapons are serious charges.

83
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,945
Let's go.

84
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,160
I want to talk
to your superior!

85
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,912
[grunting]

86
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,374
[grunts]

87
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,211
Careful, Ensign,
or you'll fracture a metacarpal.

88
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,338
That'd be the least
of our problems.

89
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,133
The situation is not
as desperate as it appears.

90
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,177
Not as desperate?

91
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,054
We're prisoners
on an alien ship.

92
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,348
Voyager has no idea
we're missing,

93
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,767
and the Doctor's
been decompiled.

94
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:37,689
The reports of my decompilation
have been greatly exaggerated.

95
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,443
Doc?

96
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,447
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

97
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:50,285
Seven downloaded my program
into her cybernetic matrix.

98
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,204
An interesting sensation,
to say the least.

99
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,457
And now you're in control
of Seven's body?

100
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,709
Total control, it seems.

101
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,794
What about Seven?
Is she all right?

102
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,380
I scanned her before the aliens
came aboard.

103
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,423
Physiologically, she's fine.

104
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,218
As for her consciousness,
I'm assuming it's submerged,

105
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,845
but there's no way to be sure,

106
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,932
until I vacate her systems
and conduct a neurological exam.

107
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,975
Then we need
the mobile emitter.

108
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,353
This experience will make
a fascinating article

109
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,938
for the Starfleet
Medical Journal.

110
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,814
Ow.

111
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,025
Careful.
That's not your body, remember?

112
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:27,405
I knew Seven's senses were more acute
than the average humanoid, but...

113
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,491
I had no idea.
[sniffs]

114
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,617
What <i>is </i>that?

115
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,410
What?

116
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,871
That smell.
[sniffs]

117
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,290
[sniffs]
I don't smell anything.

118
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,334
[sniffs] It could be
an airborne toxin.

119
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,044
Do you think
they're trying to poison us?

120
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,338
[both sniffing]

121
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,341
[sniffing]

122
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,053
It's you.

123
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,930
[sniffs]

124
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,309
It's been a busy day.
I guess I'm perspiring a little.

125
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,435
A little?

126
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,854
[sniffs]

127
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,649
Seven's had a busy day, too,
and she's come through it

128
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,901
smelling like
the proverbial rose.

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,285
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54238.3.</i>

130
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,204
<i>We've completed</i>
<i>our maintenance layover</i>

131
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,914
<i>at the Maldorian Station,</i>

132
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,959
<i>and we're on our way</i>
<i>to rendezvous with the Delta Flyer.</i>

133
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,461
<i>We expect to reach them</i>
<i>in 48 hours.</i>

134
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,214
[Paris]
Headache, fever,

135
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:30,093
respiratory distress,
tremors.

136
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,595
Looks like some kind of virus.

137
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,348
It is not a virus.

138
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,976
You want to tell me
what's going on?

139
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,978
In the Doctor's database,

140
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:44,315
you'll find a medication
under file Theta-12-Alpha.

141
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,984
Please replicate it
immediately.

142
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,905
You know I can't give out medicine
without knowing what it's for.

143
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,911
If you must know, I am suffering
from a neurochemical imbalance.

144
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,080
An "imbalance"?

145
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,374
It is native to my species.

146
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,836
Oh... this wouldn't be
the kind of imbalance

147
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,048
that comes around
once every seven years?

148
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,595
My pon farr is
in the early stages.

149
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,639
The urges are still controllable.

150
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,017
You never fail
to amaze me, Tuvok.

151
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,438
A man of your advanced years
still driven by the mating instinct?

152
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,152
Unlike in humans, the Vulcan
libido increases with time.

153
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,488
Well, I guess there has to be
some kind of reward

154
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,239
for all that Vulcan discipline.

155
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,368
The Doctor anticipated my needs
and developed a treatment.

156
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,996
Combined with meditation,

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,457
it will enable me
to control the symptoms.

158
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,211
Well, if that doesn't work,
there's always a cold sonic shower.

159
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,963
I'll tell the Captain
that you'll be out of commission

160
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,256
for a couple of days.

161
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,218
She will want to know why.

162
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,097
Well, according to my tricorder,

163
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,767
all we've got here
is a mild case of the Tarkalean flu.

164
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,062
Thank you, Lieutenant.

165
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,398
[door opens, closes]

166
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,950
Mmm! I had no idea
that eating was such a...

167
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,119
sensual experience.

168
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,412
The tastes, the textures,

169
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,623
feeling it slide down
Seven's esophagus.

170
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,125
It's... it's exquisite!

171
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,211
They're prison rations.
My uniform probably tastes better.

172
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,879
You know,
I was thinking.

173
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,756
When we get back to Voyager,
perhaps you and Seven

174
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,342
could help me modify
my physical parameters.

175
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,636
- Why?
- So I can eat, of course,

176
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,138
like any other member
of the crew.

177
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,807
There's just one small problem--
you don't have a stomach.

178
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,308
Where is the food gonna go?

179
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,853
I believe we can construct
a holographic stomach.

180
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,480
It can store the food
for eventual recycling.

181
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,275
Eh... maybe we should focus
on something more productive,

182
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,110
like getting out of here.

183
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,904
Relax, Ensign.

184
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,073
Our shipmates have never
let us down before.

185
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,160
I'm sure the Captain will clear up
this little misunderstanding.

186
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,080
In the meantime,
are you going to finish that?

187
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,707
[clattering]

188
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,917
[giggling]

189
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,628
[Female] You!

190
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,754
Come with us.

191
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,882
I'm the senior officer.

192
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,758
If you're going
to take someone, take me.

193
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,427
My orders were specific.

194
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,097
Don't worry, Ensign.
I can take care of myself.

195
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,477
Mmm. My compliments
to the chef.

196
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,325
The prisoner, sir.

197
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:47,665
Pulse-phased weapons,
duranium-enforced hull. Hmm.

198
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,668
Much more sophisticated than
the typical smuggler's vessel.

199
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,254
How many ways do you
want me to say this?

200
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,090
We are not smugglers
or terrorists.

201
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,675
We are explorers.

202
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,427
Let us contact our ship.

203
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,221
Our Captain
will explain everything.

204
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,640
If you're innocent,
then you won't mind

205
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,683
telling me more
about this vessel.

206
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,809
[sighs]

207
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,188
For instance, um...
this device.

208
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,482
What does it do?

209
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,776
That's a standard
food replicator.

210
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,778
Can it be used to create
bioweapons?

211
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,573
Not unless you count
Mr. Neelix's Bolian soufflé.

212
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,992
Let me show you.

213
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,538
Computer, one slice
of New York cheesecake.

214
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,669
This is an old
Earth delicacy.

215
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,463
How do I know you're not trying
to poison me?

216
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,007
Oh, please.

217
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,515
Mmm...

218
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,850
Mmm!

219
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,687
Oh...

220
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,523
Oh, I never imagined... Mmm!

221
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,316
Is this the first time
you've tried that?

222
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,030
Of course not,
but it's just that I usually...

223
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:05,285
avoid foods
that are this... rich.

224
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,953
I do have a figure to maintain.

225
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,039
Oh, I better get
another for you.

226
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,791
Uh, computer,
another slice of cheesecake.

227
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,796
Uh... here.

228
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,056
Mmm.

229
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,020
What other foods
can that device create?

230
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,856
Hmm...

231
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,026
[Seven and Ranek laughing]

232
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,821
[Seven]
Oh... during my time with the collective,

233
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,867
we assimilated
thousands of cultures

234
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,161
from one end of the galaxy
to the other.

235
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,873
I'll say this for the Borg,
we certainly do travel.

236
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,500
[chuckling]

237
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,753
Oh, of course, my life
didn't truly begin

238
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,297
until I came aboard Voyager

239
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,841
and met the person who...
who changed my life,

240
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,179
the only one who
truly believed in me,

241
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,972
saw my true potential...

242
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,098
Your Captain?

243
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,351
Our Doctor.

244
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,187
That's right, the "photonic."

245
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,690
If only you could have
known him.

246
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:23,071
Ruggedly handsome, a sharp wit,
a towering intellect...

247
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,616
If he and I hadn't been
colleagues, well...

248
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,661
Now we'll never know
what heights he could have reached.

249
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,623
I hope you understand,
I had no choice.

250
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,375
"I was just following orders."

251
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,751
I've heard that before.

252
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,253
Maybe there's something
I could do for you.

253
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,048
Uh, I-I'll speak to my superiors,

254
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,174
ask for leniency.

255
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,969
Hmm. If I survive that long.

256
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,262
What do you mean?

257
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:52,308
My cybernetic components
are already depolarizing.

258
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,770
I need my regener...
regeneration device.

259
00:14:55,853 --> 00:15:00,817
As you can see, my motor functions
are already impaired.

260
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,528
Right.

261
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,657
If I give this... back to you,

262
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,202
will you do something for me?

263
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,418
It was so nice of you
to escort me.

264
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,045
Ah, nice to see you, Ensign.

265
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,297
- Are you drunk?
- It wasn't my fault.

266
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,758
Seven's unique physiology
is... unique.

267
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,635
It doesn't react well
to synthehol.

268
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,678
What happened?

269
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,180
Captain Ranek and I shared
a meal aboard the Flyer.

270
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,433
He's really a gentleman
once you get to know him.

271
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,435
You had a dinner date
in Seven's body?

272
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,644
It wasn't a "date."

273
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,229
It was a tactical maneuver,

274
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,065
designed to win the trust
of our captors,

275
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,443
and it worked.

276
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,695
I won't ask what you
had to do to get this.

277
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,697
Nothing unladylike,
I assure you.

278
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,532
They lost their medic
in a recent skirmish,

279
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,075
and I offered
to take his place.

280
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,495
Let's download your program
before they change their mind.

281
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,585
Hey, careful where you point
those tubules.

282
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,878
Sorry.

283
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,054
Easy.

284
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,347
How do you feel?

285
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,892
I'm impaired.

286
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,518
You've had quite a shock
to your system.

287
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,853
Let me explain what's happened.

288
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,730
I know exactly
what's happened.

289
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,482
You've been abusing
my body.

290
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,324
- I'm a doctor!
- Shh!

291
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,242
I would never abuse
your body.

292
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,119
I was trying to get information.

293
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,039
Sometimes a, a glass
of wine can...

294
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,749
loosen the tongue.

295
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,875
One glass.

296
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,044
That doesn't excuse
the other eight.

297
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,253
Was it that many?

298
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,546
[chuckling]

299
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,715
[Kim] Seven, you were aware
of everything?

300
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,134
Painfully.

301
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,513
I'm afraid the role of "spy"
wasn't written into my program.

302
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,015
I was forced to...
improvise.

303
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,519
You "improvised" your way
through an entire cheesecake,

304
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,480
as well as three servings
of Ktarian chocolate puffs.

305
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,483
Now I have to suffer
the consequences.

306
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,111
I apologize if I...
overindulged.

307
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,613
I'll be more careful next time.

308
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,281
There won't be a next time.

309
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,243
I'll be discovered.
They'll decompile my program.

310
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,494
Shh!

311
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,500
I know this is difficult for you,

312
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,418
but you're going to have
to put up with it

313
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,254
until we can get out of here.

314
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,673
How do you propose
we do that?

315
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,466
Maybe you can tap
into their com system,

316
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,926
get a message to Voyager.

317
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,221
Deciphering alien computers
isn't exactly my forte.

318
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,973
But it is one of mine.

319
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,684
If you can get close enough
while they're accessing their systems,

320
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,936
I'll be able to observe
their command protocols.

321
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,145
[Male]
What's the situation?

322
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,315
[Female] The Captain wants
the female prisoner in the Medical Bay.

323
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,441
We should proceed.

324
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,944
[groans]

325
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,948
You're saving my life.

326
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,450
I want you to know
how grateful I am.

327
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,077
Try to remember that

328
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,080
the next time you're tempted
to overindulge.

329
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,878
[deeply inhales and exhales]

330
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,471
Photonics' viral weapon
attacks the cerebral cortex.

331
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:21,100
Within days, the victims suffer
complete synaptic failure.

332
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,602
Well, if we can't stop the virus,

333
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,729
we may be able
to slow its progress.

334
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,064
We need to synthesize
a neural inhibitor.

335
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,196
Forgive me, but aren't you
the ship's Tactical Officer?

336
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,033
Tactical Officer,
Medic, Engineer.

337
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,493
We've lost nearly a third
of our crew to the photonics.

338
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,871
Well, you certainly know your way
around a medical bay.

339
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,498
[chuckles] You may have
missed your true calling.

340
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,585
Actually, Emmik always thought
I'd become a teacher.

341
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,503
He used to call me
"the little professor."

342
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,380
Who's Emmik?

343
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,758
The photonic who helped
raise my brother and me.

344
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,677
He knew more about treating
scrapes and bruises

345
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,763
than any organic doctor
I ever met.

346
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,640
Sounds like someone
I'd enjoy meeting.

347
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,727
Maybe...
before he joined the insurgency.

348
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,228
Why did he do that?

349
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,607
I ask myself that question
every day.

350
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,777
We never treated him
like a servant,

351
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,904
but he turned against us anyway.

352
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:22,411
Is it... possible
he felt... subjugated?

353
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,789
I don't see how.

354
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,458
He lived his own life,
pursued his own interests.

355
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,335
He was part of our family.

356
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,380
At least I thought he was.

357
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,549
We should get back
to the patient.

358
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,974
It could take up to a day
to determine if the inhibitor is working.

359
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,101
Thank you.

360
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,270
Don't thank me.
Thank my ship's doctor.

361
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,065
He taught me everything
I know about medicine.

362
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,150
And remember--
he was a photonic.

363
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,028
Actually, you have a lot
in common with him.

364
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,115
He was something
of a jack-of-all-trades, too.

365
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,826
I suspect you'd have
gotten along famously.

366
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,330
I'm certain he would've taken
a liking to you.

367
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,592
[panting]

368
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,971
Your neurotransmitters
aren't absorbing the medication.

369
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,347
Can you increase
the dosage?

370
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,183
Not without causing damage
to your neocortex.

371
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,978
The Doc might be able to synthesize
a stronger medicine, but...

372
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,148
I'll make the best
of the situation until he returns.

373
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,075
I do have one area of expertise
that might help--

374
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,077
the holodeck.

375
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,581
I am a married man.

376
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,793
Look, it's the holodeck, Tuvok.
It doesn't count.

377
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,337
Is that what you tell
your wife?

378
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,548
No, of course not.

379
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,761
My days of rescuing slave girls
from Planet 10 are history.

380
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,264
Look, you have photographs
of your wife, right?

381
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,559
Well, the computer can
use them to create a replica.

382
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,271
It wouldn't be breaking your vows
if it's a hologram of your wife.

383
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,530
As it was in the dawn
of our days,

384
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,699
as it will be
for all tomorrows,

385
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,411
to you, my husband,
I consecrate all that I am.

386
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,788
T'Pel, my wife,

387
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,165
from you I receive
all that I am.

388
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:35,169
As it was in the beginning,
so shall it be now.

389
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,380
Two bodies; one mind.

390
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,846
I'm picking up a vessel
closing at high impulse.

391
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,598
They're firing.

392
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,352
- Shields are holding.
- Open a channel.

393
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,813
This is Captain
Kathryn Janeway

394
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,815
of the Federation Starship
Voyager.

395
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,399
We're on a peaceful mission.

396
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,152
We've detected photonic activity
aboard your vessel.

397
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,196
Drop your shields
and prepare to be boarded.

398
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,614
Photonic activity?

399
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,575
Tuvok-- he's in Holodeck 2.

400
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,785
They're firing again.

401
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,211
It's some kind of photonic disrupter
directed at Holodeck 2.

402
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,923
Target their weapons array
and fire.

403
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,928
[console beeps]

404
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,388
- They're hailing.
- On screen.

405
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,141
Drop your shields and prepare
to receive our inspection teams.

406
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,477
You're not in a position
to be making demands.

407
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,979
Why did you fire on us?

408
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,148
Your vessel is carrying photonics
through Lokirrim space.

409
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,693
We didn't realize
that was forbidden.

410
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,404
We'd be happy to shut down
our holodecks.

411
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,455
Your sensors should confirm
they've been deactivated.

412
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,167
You're still required
to submit to inspection.

413
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,130
Your sensors should also confirm
that our weapons are ready to fire.

414
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,591
We're both reasonable people.

415
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,509
I suggest a compromise.

416
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,804
Your vessel will escort us
through Lokirrim territory.

417
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,556
That way,
you can keep an eye on us,

418
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,725
make sure we don't reactivate
our holodecks.

419
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,060
The other alternative is...

420
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,646
we destroy your ship.

421
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,110
Your proposal is acceptable.

422
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,950
Sometimes diplomacy requires
a little saber rattling.

423
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,495
Begin long-range scans.

424
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,168
I can picture them now--

425
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,923
my father in his airponics bay
pruning his cona vines,

426
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,424
my mother reading
in her favorite chair.

427
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,511
Nothing in that home
ever changes.

428
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,015
It must be comforting to have
a place like that to go back to.

429
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,225
I've never been away
this long before.

430
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,480
His progress is remarkable.

431
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,232
I want you to know,
I'm going to tell my superiors

432
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,817
everything you've done for us.

433
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,320
First Ranek and now you.

434
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,783
I may become the first prisoner of war
to be decorated by his captors.

435
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,579
I know someone
who'd really enjoy meeting you.

436
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,915
Who?

437
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,877
My brother, Lohden.

438
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,087
Your brother?

439
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,172
You'd like him.

440
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,966
He's ambitious,
accomplished,

441
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,009
and he'd love
your sense of humor.

442
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,681
Hmm. Apparently,
it's my most attractive quality.

443
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,184
[Ranek] <i>Seven of Nine,</i>
<i>please report to the Bridge.</i>

444
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,450
Let me guess-- your crew
decided to abandon ship.

445
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,869
I wanted to thank you.

446
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,997
I had a wonderful time
the other night.

447
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,250
It's not often that I...

448
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,543
indulge myself like that.

449
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,795
It's been a long time
for me, too.

450
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,131
I remembered your interest
in stellar phenomenon,

451
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,760
so I requested a course change
to show you something.

452
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,605
What is it?

453
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,193
To an astronomer,
it's simply a pulsar cluster,

454
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,488
but our poets call it
the "Window of Dreams."

455
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,907
You could travel from one end
of the Quadrant to the other

456
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,409
and never see anything like it.

457
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,370
Lovely! Hmm.

458
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,373
[echoing sound]

459
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:46,045
It's the pulsar's EM fields
vibrating against our hull.

460
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,171
Huh.

461
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,800
I once thought this was
the most beautiful sight in the sector.

462
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,052
Hmm.

463
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,553
I see now
that I was wrong.

464
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,474
Hmm.

465
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,767
Oh. I almost forgot.

466
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,229
Oh, I promised a friend
I'd go easy on the synthehol.

467
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,731
[rhythmical beating]

468
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,024
Do you hear that?

469
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,651
It's identical to the rhythm
produced

470
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,945
by the eight-chambered
Ktarian heart.

471
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,739
Hmm.

472
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:19,787
Is something wrong?

473
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,749
Rapid pulse,
respiratory distress.

474
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,335
You may be having a reaction
to the pulsar's radiation.

475
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,462
We should get you
to the Medical Bay.

476
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,798
No, I'm not going to
the Medical Bay.

477
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,758
You starship captains
are all alike.

478
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,843
You can stare down the barrel
of a phaser cannon,

479
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,720
but you can't stomach
a simple medical exam.

480
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,807
I don't need an exam to know
what I'm suffering from.

481
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,142
[grunts]

482
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,479
[clears throat]

483
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,064
- I'm sorry. I thought...
- You were wrong.

484
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,857
I didn't mean to offend you.
It's just...

485
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,818
I've never met a woman
like you before.

486
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,195
That's because there are
no women like me.

487
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,794
- [annoyed sigh]
- Is something wrong?

488
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,712
Ranek summoned me
to the Bridge

489
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,590
under the pretext
of a little stargazing.

490
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,261
What he really wanted was to use
my face as a tongue depressor.

491
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,554
I'm surprised to hear that.

492
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,305
It was completely inappropriate!

493
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,349
That kind of behavior
would get a Starfleet Captain

494
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,560
reassigned to a garbage scow.

495
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,270
I'm not defending
what he did, but...

496
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,314
you have to understand,
we've been out here for a long time.

497
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,567
It's difficult to hide your feelings,

498
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,652
especially when you work closely
with someone you're attracted to.

499
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,324
You... have feelings for him?

500
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,119
[sighs]

501
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,163
I've known Lotharios
like Ranek.

502
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,331
Trust me, you don't want
anything to do with him.

503
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,500
You need someone who...

504
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,503
who can appreciate
your many talents.

505
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,755
Someone... overflowing

506
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,967
with intelligence
and compassion,

507
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,968
someone capable...

508
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,052
Ow!

509
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,763
[groans]

510
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,599
It looks like a spasm
in the trapezius.

511
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,560
I had no idea it could be...
so excruciating.

512
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,479
That's what happens when
you work so long without rest.

513
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,439
[groans]

514
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,690
Our last medic showed me
a technique that might help.

515
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,277
- I'll try it, if you like.
- Please, anything!

516
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,280
Oh, that...

517
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,326
that feels... wonderful.

518
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,536
Oh...

519
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,463
- Did I hurt you?
- No, no-no, no, no, no.

520
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,589
Well, then what's wrong?

521
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,883
[sighs]

522
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,385
There's something
you don't know about me,

523
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,305
something I have to tell you.

524
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,431
It's all right.

525
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,850
I know.

526
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,561
You do?
How could you?

527
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:53,815
Your cybernetic implants,
your portable regenerator?

528
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,193
You're not going
to tell anyone, are you?

529
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,321
I would never say anything
to the crew,

530
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,989
but Ranek knows.

531
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,658
He does?

532
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,285
Of course, it was apparent
the moment we scanned you.

533
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,163
I can't believe
you didn't say anything.

534
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,582
It wouldn't have been
appropriate.

535
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,085
You're part Borg.

536
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,962
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

537
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,547
Ah. Mmm.

538
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,217
- <i>Security to Medical Bay.</i>
- This is Lieutenant Jaryn.

539
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,510
<i>The prisoner is ill.</i>

540
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,387
<i>He's requesting treatment</i>
<i>by his crewmate.</i>

541
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,681
Hmm.

542
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,807
[groaning]

543
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,060
Ensign.

544
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,521
[groaning]

545
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,190
Where the hell have you been?

546
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,442
I had to fake a seizure before
the guard would let me see you.

547
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,527
Calm down.

548
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,612
Seven and I have been
making progress.

549
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,455
- [sighs]
- Did you get a look at their computer?

550
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,875
During the one brief moment when
the Doctor wasn't indulging himself.

551
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,671
I think I've shown considerable restraint,
under the circumstances.

552
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,256
Kissing Ranek on the Bridge?

553
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,049
Is that your idea of restraint?

554
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,134
Kissing?

555
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,593
Not that it's any
of your business,

556
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,430
but if you must know,
Ranek kissed me.

557
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,598
And the massage you got
from Lieutenant Jaryn?

558
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,183
Entirely therapeutic.

559
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,978
You became sexually aroused
in my body.

560
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,775
When did it become a crime
to enjoy a sensation or two?

561
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,069
Of course, you'd be the last
person to understand that.

562
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,404
What do you mean?

563
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,033
The whole world is full
of experiences and sensations,

564
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,909
but you insist
on denying yourself.

565
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,162
Instead of replicating caviar,

566
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,956
you choose
nutritional supplement 13-Alpha.

567
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,333
Caviar is an indulgence.

568
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,126
Indulgences are what
make life worth living!

569
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,252
Shh!

570
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,089
These last few days
have been a revelation.

571
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,342
Feeling your lungs
fill with air,

572
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,469
the surge of adrenaline
through your veins.

573
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,096
Until I spent a day in your skin,
I never knew what I was missing.

574
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,724
You may have been
better off not knowing.

575
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,601
We're quite a pair.

576
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,437
Me, trapped by the limitations
of photons and force fields.

577
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,066
You, by a drone's obsession
with efficiency.

578
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,860
- You'd make an excellent hologram.
- All right!

579
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,489
Listen, you can argue all you want
when we get back to Voyager,

580
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,575
but that's not going to happen
unless we come up with a plan.

581
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,494
Did you learn anything
about their com system?

582
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,245
It can only be accessed
from the Bridge,

583
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,414
but I saw Ranek
enter his command codes.

584
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,458
If we can get
those codes to Voyager,

585
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,919
they may be able to disable
the shields and beam us out.

586
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,046
[sighs]
How are we going to do that?

587
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,591
The subspace transceiver
on the Flyer.

588
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,427
- Can you get aboard?
- It's heavily guarded.

589
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,639
I can get us aboard.

590
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,146
Captain, may I speak with you?

591
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,190
Privately.

592
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,947
I owe you an apology.

593
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,782
Well, I was the one
who acted inappropriately.

594
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,451
Oh, a kiss is hardly
a court-martial offense.

595
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,662
It's just that you...
caught me by surprise.

596
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,330
I-I won't make
that mistake again.

597
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,583
Perhaps, we should...
start over.

598
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,085
What did you have in mind?

599
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,962
Oh, we could start
with a toast.

600
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,840
- I thought synth...
- Oh, I can make an exception

601
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,717
for a... special occasion.

602
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:11,388
Computer, champagne,
two glasses.

603
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,691
To new beginnings.

604
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,111
Maybe there's
some hope for us yet.

605
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,241
As I've discovered recently,
anything is possible.

606
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,495
[exhales]

607
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,497
Computer, dim the lights.

608
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,293
Play EMH Music File
Gamma-12.

609
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,880
[waltz plays]

610
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,478
Oh.
This is interesting.

611
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,645
It's called a waltz.

612
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,647
Something else I learned
from our Doctor.

613
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,609
<i>Captain Ranek,</i>
<i>please come to the Bridge.</i>

614
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,902
What is it?

615
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,154
<i>We've received</i>
<i>an encrypted transmission.</i>

616
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,655
Oh, I'll be right there.

617
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,781
You're not leaving?

618
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,410
Um...

619
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,579
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

620
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,583
I really think
you should stay.

621
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,923
[groans then exhales]

622
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,302
Never play hard to get
with a hologram.

623
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,354
Still no sign of the Flyer's
warp signature.

624
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,941
I appreciate your
sense of duty, Tuvok,

625
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,109
but we can handle
the situation without you.

626
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,862
Under the circumstances,
abandoning my post

627
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,739
would be a dereliction of duty.

628
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,991
My illness is still
in the early stages.

629
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,284
I can control it.

630
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,704
If I remember correctly,
the last time you came down

631
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,542
with the Tarkalean flu
was seven years ago.

632
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,337
As soon as this is over,
the holodeck is at your disposal.

633
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,091
There you are, Commander.

634
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,678
Now, a person in your condition
really ought to be in bed.

635
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,347
This is my
grandmother's recipe,

636
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,849
guaranteed to cure even
the most stubborn flu.

637
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,018
Now... smell that?

638
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,689
- I don't smell anything.
- Exactly.

639
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,983
I prepared it
just the way you like it.

640
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,485
No herbs or spices
of any kind.

641
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,945
It's practically tasteless.

642
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,154
[communications beep]

643
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,115
We're receiving a hail.

644
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,867
- It's the Delta Flyer.
- On screen.

645
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,245
Seven, it's good
to see you.

646
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,414
I'm afraid there's no time
for pleasantries, Captain.

647
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,208
We're being held prisoner
on a Lokirrim patrol ship.

648
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,294
I'm sending you our precise location

649
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,713
and the command codes
to disable their shields.

650
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,506
Are the Doctor and Harry
all right?

651
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,342
Ensign Kim
is his usual chipper self.

652
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:58,221
As for me, I'm looking forward
to a long, uneventful shift in Sick Bay.

653
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,727
Doctor?

654
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,312
It's a long story, Captain.

655
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,646
Delta Flyer out.

656
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,232
They may be in more trouble
than we thought.

657
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,358
Set a course.

658
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,486
[Paris] Our escort isn't going
to take kindly to a detour.

659
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,030
What's the status
of their weapons?

660
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,532
They've repaired
their forward phasers.

661
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,035
Target their power matrix.

662
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,121
We may only get one shot,
so make it count.

663
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:25,999
Ready.

664
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,126
Do it.

665
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,631
Direct hit.

666
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,257
Get us out of here,
maximum warp.

667
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,602
What's wrong with him?

668
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,604
Apparently, Captain Ranek

669
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,273
has an even lower tolerance
for synthehol than I do.

670
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,733
That doesn't sound like Ranek.

671
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,152
It's probably not something
he'd admit to his crew.

672
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,529
We should keep this
between us.

673
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,492
What are you doing?

674
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,785
Reviving him.

675
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,495
I-I wouldn't recommend that.

676
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,542
Take her to detention.

677
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,796
Separate her
from the other prisoner.

678
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,632
There are traces of sedative
in your bloodstream.

679
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,719
What was your plan?

680
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,054
To aid the insurgents?

681
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,555
There was no plan.

682
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,723
We trusted you.

683
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,725
I'm still a prisoner
on your ship,

684
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:29,104
and despite our friendship,
my first obligation is to escape.

685
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,106
We were going
to recommend leniency.

686
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,482
If you knew who I really was,

687
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,900
I doubt you'd be trying
to help me.

688
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,027
<i>Alien vessel approaching.</i>

689
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,365
I want her
where I can see her.

690
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,043
[Tuvok]
They are raising shields.

691
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,878
Stand by with those
command codes.

692
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,004
Open a channel.

693
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,507
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway.

694
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,092
We don't want a fight.

695
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,344
Return my people
and we'll be on our way.

696
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,138
Your people were caught
transporting

697
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,807
a photonic insurgent
and biogenic material.

698
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,767
We don't want
to disable your ship,

699
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,477
but we will if we have to.

700
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,569
We're losing
our ventral shield grid.

701
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,154
Compensate.

702
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,655
I'm trying.

703
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,158
They've tapped into
the shield matrix.

704
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,410
They're using your
command authorization.

705
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,166
They're rerouting power.

706
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,169
He's tying their shields
directly into the warp matrix.

707
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,380
If you fire on us,
you'll trigger a core breach.

708
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,424
You'll be killing the people
you're here to rescue.

709
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,884
End transmission.

710
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,219
Tractor beam.

711
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,307
Full reverse!
Target their emitters.

712
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,897
They've broken free.

713
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,523
Chakotay, can you send
a com signal

714
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,442
directly to Seven's cortical node?

715
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,532
[Janeway] <i>Doctor, if you can hear me,</i>
<i>we need your help.</i>

716
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,659
<i>Try to disable their shields.</i>

717
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,250
[grunting]

718
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,336
It's a photonic.

719
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:18,838
Cover me.

720
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,549
Stay back!
I'm not afraid to use this.

721
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,430
Hey. Whoa!

722
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,310
Step away.

723
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,812
[beeping]

724
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,230
She destabilized
the shield grid.

725
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,397
It's failing.

726
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,484
Watch them.

727
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,870
If you try to reinitialize the grid,
it'll overload.

728
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,163
We could all die.

729
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,040
Ranek, don't!

730
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,708
[yells]

731
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,754
Stay back.

732
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,589
I'm a doctor. Let me help.

733
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,842
Their shields are down.
I have a lock.

734
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,927
Away team,
stand by for transport.

735
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,263
I have injured here, Captain.
I can't leave yet.

736
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,059
He'll die
without immediate surgery.

737
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,854
I know this is difficult to grasp,

738
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,023
but I'm the person you've been
getting to know the last few days.

739
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,109
My program was in control
of Seven's body.

740
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,402
You're lying.

741
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,029
I know you have feelings
for Ranek.

742
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,784
If he dies, you're never going
to forgive yourself.

743
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,002
Your vital signs are stable.

744
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,257
Suppose I should be,
uh, grateful.

745
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,343
A "thank you" is customary
after someone saves your life.

746
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,972
What happened
was between me

747
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,600
and Seven of Nine, not you.

748
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,476
I'm sorry you feel that way.

749
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,355
The truth is, aside from
a few awkward moments,

750
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,940
I enjoyed our time together.

751
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,944
There are many women

752
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,572
who'd appreciate
an attractive man like you.

753
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,449
I'm just not one of them.

754
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,869
Um, more of our vessels
are on the way.

755
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,746
You should leave
while you can.

756
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,707
Thank you.

757
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,465
I guess you won't be
introducing me to your brother.

758
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,636
I'm not sure you're the kind
of person he's interested in.

759
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,138
You mean because
I'm a hologram.

760
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,473
[chuckles]

761
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,100
I don't imagine this experience

762
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,603
is going to change your feelings
about photonics.

763
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,523
But I wanted you to know...

764
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,070
I'm grateful for the time
we've spent together.

765
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,614
You're a talented doctor.

766
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,075
We're the ones
who should be grateful.

767
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,868
I'm glad I could help.

768
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,788
Doctor to Voyager.

769
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,040
One to beam out.

770
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,759
Commander...

771
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,595
it's good to see
you're over the flu.

772
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,763
I have fully recovered.

773
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,056
Thank you
for your assistance.

774
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,725
Oh, don't mention it.
I just hope everything was okay.

775
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,394
Not exactly.

776
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,814
My wife's ears are four millimeters
shorter than your facsimile's.

777
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,316
So I took a little
artistic license.

778
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,652
Aside from that,
was everything all right?

779
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,030
The hologram was adequate,

780
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,033
but no substitute for my wife.

781
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,120
Of course not.

782
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,508
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

783
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,801
There isn't one... yet.

784
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,971
The Mess Hall
is three decks up.

785
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,598
In case you've forgotten,

786
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,018
I've lost my appetite...
permanently.

787
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,854
That doesn't mean you're
incapable of enjoying a meal.

788
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,819
Foie gras with truffles,
an ancient Earth delicacy.

789
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,779
Chateau d'Yquem.

790
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,573
According to
the culinary database,

791
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,866
the ideal accompaniment.

792
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,618
Not your usual fare.

793
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,746
It's come to my attention

794
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,749
that nutritional supplements
don't fully meet my needs.

795
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,626
I see.

796
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,795
I thought we could share
this experience.

797
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,381
I'll describe the meal to you...

798
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,341
the tastes, the sensations.

799
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,470
Perhaps you can enjoy it
vicariously.

800
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,306
What about the wine?

801
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,267
It doesn't exactly agree
with you.

802
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,604
If I become sick,
I won't have far to go.

803
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,985
To shared experiences.

804
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,779
Hear, hear.
