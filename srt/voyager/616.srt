1
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:10,552
Heart, heart, heart...

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,638
just one more heart.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,474
You might as well
be showing us
your hand, Neelix.

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,686
This is a game of
strategy, deception.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,313
Never let the opponents
know your hand.

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,815
Right.

7
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,150
Right.

8
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,277
(<i> snorts in disgust</i> )

9
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,698
Ten.

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,368
I see your ten and raise you 20.

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,996
Neelix?

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,623
I'm thinking...

13
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,587
20... another 20.
(<i> laughs</i> )

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,924
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say we're being hustled.

15
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,718
Ensign...
Oh, I'm not buying

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,511
the innocent Talaxian routine.

17
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,304
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,139
I've-I've... This is
the first time I've played...

19
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,224
What is it called?

20
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,684
ALL:
Poker.

21
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,435
Look, why don't
we make things

22
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,270
a little more
interesting?
Forget the chips.

23
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,065
Let's bet on tomorrow's
work detail, all right?

24
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,027
Whoever wins this hand
gets the morning off.

25
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,319
I'm in.

26
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,572
I'm in.
Sounds good to me.

27
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,908
What have you got?

28
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,534
Two pair.

29
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,161
Does... does that beat a flush?

30
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,955
I knew you were bluffing.

31
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,833
That beats me. Tom?

32
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,214
Battle stations!

33
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,592
(<i> poker chips</i>
<i>clatter to floor)</i>

34
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,053
And I had a full house.

35
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,207
I can't shake 'em.

36
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,336
Return fire.

37
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,755
Why didn't our sensors
detect them?

38
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,465
It looks like they used
a dispersal field

39
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,718
to mask their approach.

40
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,427
Warp drive?

41
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,514
No luck. Too much damage
to the plasma injectors.

42
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,184
Harry, get down there
and see what you can do.

43
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,818
Shields down 18 percent.
Harry, status?

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,655
I need time
to clear the injectors.

45
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,366
Sir, the cube's power output
is fluctuating.

46
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,493
Then we're still in the game.

47
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,995
Bring us about.

48
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,330
Target their propulsion matrix.

49
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,583
We've lost phasers.

50
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,294
Arm photon torpedoes.
Fire when ready.

51
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,884
We knocked out
their main propulsion system.

52
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,301
Good.

53
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,137
Now get us out
of here, Tom.

54
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,891
They've got us
in a tractor beam.

55
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,101
Harry,

56
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,810
we need warp power now.

57
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,021
We lost two more relays.
I can't!

58
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,815
(<i> screams</i> )

59
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,150
Harry?

60
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,112
Harry?!

61
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,323
Engines are off-line.

62
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,576
We are the Borg.
Your biological

63
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,286
and technological
distinctiveness

64
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,829
will be added to our own.

65
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,790
Resistance is futile.

66
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,063
CHAKOTAY (<i> distorted):</i>
Neelix.

67
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,731
Neelix!

68
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,441
Commander?

69
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,902
It's all right.
You were unconscious,

70
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,570
but I don't think
you're injured.

71
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,031
I was dreaming you'd
been assimilated.

72
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,201
Your subconscious
was jumping the gun,
but not by much.

73
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,578
From the look
of this room,

74
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,831
I'd say we're
in an assimilation chamber.

75
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,792
Where's Harry?

76
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,418
He's not here.

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,171
Well, we've got to find him.

78
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,964
We need to get
our bearings first,

79
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,674
figure out
what's going on.

80
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,592
We're in a Borg cube,
and Harry's missing.

81
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,927
That's what's going on.

82
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,386
Sir...

83
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,269
Nobody we know.

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,899
Some kind of botched
assimilation?

85
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,443
From the looks of it.

86
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,654
(<i> sighs</i> ):
What are they
waiting for?

87
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,990
They've got three more
potential drones here!

88
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,533
Stay calm.
Calm?

89
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,243
We're in the
chamber of horrors,

90
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,120
or haven't you noticed?
We're not drones yet.

91
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,456
If we keep our heads,
maybe we can find a way out.

92
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,168
There's a force field
around this room.

93
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,586
Let's try to disable it.

94
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,721
Their ion trail ends
directly ahead.

95
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:32,142
I'm detecting another vessel,
bearing 30 mark 112.

96
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,894
It's a Borg cube.

97
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,855
Red Alert.
Alter course to intercept.

98
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,941
Adjust shields
to rotating frequencies.
Have they detected us?

99
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,319
TUVOK:
Unclear. The vessel's
holding position.

100
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,154
As soon as we're
within sensor range,

101
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,947
start scanning
for the away team.

102
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,949
On screen.

103
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,785
SEVEN:
Their propulsion system
is off-line.

104
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,495
The damage is not that severe.

105
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,748
The drones should've
repaired it by now.

106
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,416
Lucky for us they didn't,
or we'd never have
caught up with them.

107
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,002
Any sign of our people?

108
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,129
Not yet.

109
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,590
They are targeting
our warp core.

110
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,300
Shields are holding.

111
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,219
Return fire.
Aim for their weapons array.

112
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,267
Now they're going
after our impulse engines.

113
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,269
That one was meant
for our sensors.

114
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,145
They can't seem to make up
their minds.

115
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,023
Their attack strategy
is erratic, inefficient.

116
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,109
TUVOK:
And finished.

117
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,902
We've disabled their weapons.

118
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,612
That was too easy.

119
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,282
Maybe they're in worse shape
than we thought.

120
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,742
I'm picking up
non-Borg life signs.

121
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,660
One of them is
definitely Talaxian.

122
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,414
It looks as though they haven't
been assimilated yet.

123
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,999
Try to get a transporter lock.

124
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,667
Their shields
are interfering.

125
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,795
Target their shield generator
and fire.

126
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,505
SEVEN:
Captain, I believe I can explain
the unusual behavior

127
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,883
of these Borg.

128
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,761
There should be thousands
of drones manning the vessel,

129
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,013
but I'm picking up
only five signatures.

130
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,849
We are the Borg.
You will be assimilated.

131
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,311
Resistance is futile.

132
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,646
It doesn't sound like
they've lost their confidence.

133
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,523
Their shield generators
are too deep inside the vessel.

134
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,734
Our weapons can't reach them.

135
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,778
Open a channel.

136
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,950
Borg vessel, this is
the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

137
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,577
You're holding our crewmen.

138
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,039
We're willing to cease firing
if you return them.

139
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,958
Negotiation is irrelevant.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,543
You will be assimilated.

141
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,130
Not today and not by you.

142
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,841
Agree, or I'll resume firing.

143
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,550
They are scanning us.

144
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,930
We will return your crew members

145
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,766
in exchange
for specific technology.

146
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,437
Talk about unusual behavior.
The Borg negotiating?

147
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,938
What technology?

148
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,065
Your navigational deflector.

149
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,067
Disengage it
from your secondary hull.

150
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,944
JANEWAY:
Mute audio.

151
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,072
If we surrender our deflector,
we'll be dead in space.

152
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,616
We won't be able
to go to warp.
What would they want with it?

153
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,827
SEVEN:
When their communications
array was damaged,

154
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,121
it severed their link
to the collective.

155
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,957
They intend to adapt
our deflector to regain it.

156
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,336
And call for reinforcements?
That's the last thing we need.

157
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:08,089
We'll have to stall them
until we can find
another way out of this.

158
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,346
I'll consider the exchange,
but first I want to be certain

159
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,848
my crewmen are unharmed
and alive.

160
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,059
You have scanned our vessel.

161
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,935
Our scans were inconclusive.

162
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,563
We want to see them
for ourselves.

163
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,194
You may transport
one individual.

164
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,572
Seven.

165
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:10,277
BORG:
<i>Proceed to Grid 63,</i>
<i>Subjunction 01.</i>

166
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,033
<i>State your designation.</i>

167
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,122
Seven of Nine.

168
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,459
These drones
have not fully matured.

169
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,003
Where are the others?
<i>There are no others.</i>

170
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,088
<i>The drones</i>
<i>aboard this vessel were...</i>

171
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,299
deactivated.

172
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,968
We are the Borg.

173
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,058
Seven of Nine--

174
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,560
a Borg designation.

175
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,894
She's like us.

176
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,396
Not like us.

177
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,897
She's damaged.

178
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,859
Her infrastructure
has been removed.

179
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,444
We could fix her.

180
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,737
You will add to
our perfection.

181
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,823
You are neonatal drones.

182
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,617
You should still be
in maturation chambers.

183
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,452
We've matured
long enough.

184
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,872
Doubtful. Your thoracic nodes
haven't formed yet.

185
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,332
You're incomplete.

186
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,125
You'll continue
to malfunction.

187
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,337
You must return
to your maturation chambers.

188
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,590
Comply.
Don't listen to her.

189
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,384
We tried to
go back in.

190
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,135
The chambers
were off-line.

191
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,304
What happened
to the adult drones?

192
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,557
We don't know.
Irrelevant.

193
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,724
Don't tell her anything.

194
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,855
This vessel has been
severely damaged.

195
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,066
You won't be able
to repair it alone.

196
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,861
I can help you,
but first you must
release the hostages.

197
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,321
That wasn't the agreement.

198
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,407
I've modified
the agreement.

199
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,825
I didn't realize I'd be
dealing with children.

200
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,161
Your behavior
is erratic. I can't
be certain that you...

201
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,497
No modifications.

202
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:32,043
We show you the hostages;
you give us the deflector.

203
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,836
Comply.

204
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,674
Comply.

205
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,599
Take me to them.

206
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,734
If she tries
to resist...

207
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,611
assimilate her.

208
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,667
Do you have
a designation?

209
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,502
Second.

210
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,046
You were the second
to emerge from
the chambers.

211
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,215
No, the first.

212
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,842
I could not
establish order.

213
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:26,139
I became second...
and he became first.

214
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,016
So you've established
a chain of command--

215
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,310
a hierarchy.

216
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,312
We're a collective.

217
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,564
A collective of
five on a vessel

218
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,108
normally run
by 5,000.

219
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,901
What makes you think
you'll survive?

220
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,530
When we reestablish
our link with the Borg,

221
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,741
they will come for us.

222
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,794
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

223
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,338
Commander, we've
got company.

224
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,969
I wish to see
if they're injured.

225
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,644
Seven?
Don't let their appearance
fool you.

226
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,314
They are in control
of this vessel
and all of its armaments.

227
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,774
Are you injured?

228
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,942
Nothing serious.

229
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,781
The previous tenant.

230
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:28,368
We were trying to perfect
our assimilation techniques.

231
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,910
You failed.

232
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,663
One of these captives
was attempting

233
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,707
to disconnect
the security field.

234
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,625
Actually, I was
just trying to...

235
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,293
(<i> yells</i> )

236
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,713
That was unnecessary.

237
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,964
He is not
permanently damaged.

238
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,924
He learned his lesson.

239
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:53,434
The Borg are prepared
to negotiate for your release.

240
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,269
I will return for you.

241
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,106
Give my regards to Harry.

242
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,495
The deflector array.

243
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,415
I'm not authorized
to give you technology.

244
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,876
I must report back
to Captain Janeway.

245
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,046
Agreed.

246
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,340
I also need to take
an adult drone

247
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,509
and a datanode back
to<i> Voyager</i> for analysis.

248
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,968
Why?

249
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,596
Something happened
on this vessel

250
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,472
that none of us understand.

251
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,684
If it happens again,
it could endanger all of you.

252
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,569
No sign of Harry yet,
but there are parts

253
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,487
of the cube that
we still can't scan.

254
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,948
Could the drones
be holding him
in another location?

255
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,825
Unlikely. Seven said
they didn't seem

256
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,786
to be aware
of his presence.

257
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,412
If he ejected
in an escape pod,

258
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,122
we would have detected
his beacon by now.

259
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,124
Try to activate
his combadge.

260
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,376
Match the carrier wave to
a Borg interlink frequency.

261
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,920
They shouldn't
detect it.

262
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,546
Aye, Captain.

263
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,717
What have we learned
from our friend here?

264
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,429
The bigger they come,
the harder they fall.

265
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,266
Behold the David
that slew our Goliath.

266
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,520
A pathogen?

267
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,856
A spaceborne virus
that adapted
to Borg physiology.

268
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,358
It's inert now, but in
its virulent state,

269
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,277
it attacked the drones
and killed them.

270
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,488
Why weren't
the juveniles infected?

271
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,907
The maturation chamber
is designed to protect
developing drones.

272
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,701
Malfunctions caused
by the deaths
of the adults

273
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,203
lead several of the chambers
to open prematurely.

274
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,206
Does this pathogen
only target the Borg?

275
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,794
The Borg and other
cybernetic organisms
it encounters.

276
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,880
You're not thinking
of using it as
a biological weapon.

277
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,757
If we can revive
the pathogen

278
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,468
and reintroduce it,
we could neutralize the drones

279
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,345
without harming
the away team.

280
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,222
Neutralize? You mean
"murder," don't you?

281
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,766
Captain, they're
children.

282
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,643
Need I remind you
that these "children"

283
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,311
have committed
murder themselves

284
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,939
in their futile attempts
to assimilate others.

285
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,190
Seven...

286
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,526
tell me something.

287
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,277
You saw them,

288
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,946
talked to them.

289
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,739
Do you think
they'll kill the hostages

290
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,574
if we don't give them
what they want?

291
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,579
Yes.

292
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,459
I want that pathogen
as an option, Doctor,

293
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,045
but I won't consider
using it until I've seen

294
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,922
these drones for myself.

295
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,924
Think you can arrange that?

296
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,718
Then you're with me.

297
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,139
(<i> combadge chirping</i> )

298
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,479
(<i> groaning</i> )

299
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,948
(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

300
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,506
Computer, identify the source
of this com signal.

301
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,426
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

302
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,637
(<i> sighs</i> ):
I need to respond
on the same carrier wave.

303
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,683
That procedure will require
significant modifications.

304
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,065
Well, don't worry.
I'm<i> way</i> ahead of you.

305
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,002
Why are you here?

306
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,713
I wanted to make
a new proposal.

307
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,633
We've already negotiated.

308
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,595
You've seen
the hostages.

309
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,306
Now give us the
deflector as agreed.

310
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,683
Maybe it's hard
for you to accept,

311
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,561
but you don't have
to rejoin the hive.

312
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,229
Our Doctor can remove

313
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,273
your implants,
you can come with us.

314
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,860
You were individuals
yourselves not long ago--

315
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,237
children with families.

316
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,407
You were abducted
and assimilated.

317
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,995
I recognize your species.

318
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,497
You're Brunali.

319
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,541
And you're Norcadian.

320
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,794
Do you remember
your world?

321
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,212
A Theta-Class planetoid.

322
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,799
Population: 260 million.

323
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,843
Binary suns.

324
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,386
And what did it look like
when those suns set each night?

325
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,848
Can you remember that?
Irrelevant!

326
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,809
The deflector,<i> now.</i>
We need more time.

327
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,894
That deflector array
is essential to our...

328
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,771
No.
(<i> gasps</i> )

329
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,357
Give it to us.

330
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,067
Or what? You'll
assimilate me?

331
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,777
That won't solve
your problem.

332
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,863
I can't give you
<i>Voyager's</i>  deflector,

333
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:01,034
but maybe we can repair
your technology.

334
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,994
Clarify.

335
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:07,498
Seven knows a good deal
about Borg systems.

336
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,416
You have two hours.

337
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,293
I don't know
the extent of the damage.

338
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,628
It could take longer.

339
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,506
<i>Two</i> hours...

340
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,051
or your hostages die.

341
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,142
Don't come back
here, Captain.

342
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,957
I bought us another two hours.
The pathogen?

343
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,751
It should be
ready by then.

344
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,087
Did you see the away team?
I'm afraid not.

345
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,463
But Seven assured me
our people haven't been harmed.

346
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,675
I can't believe
we're negotiating
with adolescent drones.

347
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,510
They're not exactly drones.

348
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,179
Mature Borg are predictable.

349
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,889
They'll ignore you
or assimilate you,

350
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,516
but these... juveniles,
they're unstable.

351
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,852
They are contemptuous
of authority,

352
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,063
convinced
that they are superior--

353
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,649
typical adolescent behavior
for any species.

354
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,069
(<i> console beeping</i> )
It's a transmission...

355
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,361
from the cube.

356
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,530
Seven?
No.

357
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,241
It's Harry.

358
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,201
I'm clearing it up now.

359
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,829
<i>Delta Flyer </i> to<i>  Voyager.</i>
<i>Respond.</i>

360
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,415
We're receiving you, Ensign.
Where are you?

361
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,084
Still in the<i> Flyer.</i>

362
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,253
It's locked up
in some kind of hangar bay

363
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,004
along with two alien ships.

364
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,756
I've isolated his coordinates.

365
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,176
How close is he
to their shield generator?

366
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,053
Roughly 800 meters.

367
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,847
Harry, are there
any plasma charges
aboard the<i> Flyer?</i>

368
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,266
Yes, ma'am.

369
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,767
In that case,
how do you feel

370
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,560
about going for
a little walk?

371
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,520
I could use the exercise.

372
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,107
Tuvok will guide you
to the shield generator.

373
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,652
If you destroy it, you won't
have to make the trip back.

374
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,445
Understood.

375
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,626
I have the technology
you've requested.

376
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,336
Thank you.

377
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,969
You were a drone
for 18 years.

378
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,513
Correct.

379
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,765
I accessed your datafile.

380
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,851
Why?

381
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,271
I thought
it might be relevant.

382
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,190
(<i> sighs</i> )

383
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,066
What else did you learn?

384
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:43,029
You were assimilated
as a juvenile, like us.

385
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,531
My parents
were scientists
studying the Borg.

386
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,741
They took me with them.

387
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,410
My childhood was short.

388
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,746
Childhood?

389
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,958
The years between birth
and physical maturity,

390
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,712
when humanoids adapt
to their roles
as individuals.

391
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,132
Perhaps you have memory
of yours.

392
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,301
I don't know.

393
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:09,305
What about your parents?
Do you remember them?

394
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,016
No.

395
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,809
No memories.

396
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,645
Your subvocal processor
is malfunctioning.

397
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,396
I can repair it for you.

398
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,400
It's a slight adjustment.

399
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,155
It won't be painful.

400
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,955
The first told me
my malfunction
could not be repaired,

401
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,499
until we reconnected
with the collective.

402
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,133
This color...

403
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,970
My mother's hair...

404
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,513
was this color.

405
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,182
FIRST:
I thought
we agreed--

406
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,809
no irrelevant discussions.

407
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,897
What is the punishment
for disobeying the protocols?

408
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,857
Deactivation.

409
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,069
I engaged him in
this discussion.

410
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,155
Return to your station.

411
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,429
I found some
unsettling information.

412
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,098
I examined their
communication records.

413
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,017
The collective did
receive the drones'
initial distress call.

414
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,728
How long before they arrive?

415
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,315
A vessel was
not dispatched.

416
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,318
The collective declared
the neonatal drones
irrelevant

417
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,611
and severed their link
to the hive permanently.

418
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,073
They see them as damaged,
unworthy of reassimilation.

419
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,159
Precisely.
Are the drones aware of this?

420
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,495
No. They don't
have the ability
to decrypt the message.

421
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,624
Once they learn they've
been rejected by the hive,

422
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,460
they won't need our deflector.

423
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,795
They might be willing
to release the hostages.

424
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,880
Normally when drones
learn they're irrelevant,

425
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,715
they deactivate themselves.

426
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,968
But these neonatal drones
are unpredictable.

427
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,846
They may not adhere
to Borg protocols.

428
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,226
There<i> is</i> another option.

429
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,897
We could invite them
to<i> Voyager.</i>

430
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,067
When they realize they have
no place else to go...

431
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,196
If you're suggesting
transforming them
into individuals,

432
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,906
that would be
extremely difficult.

433
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,867
You turned out
pretty well, Seven.

434
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,787
That's because I was prepared
before you encountered me.

435
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,622
What do you mean?

436
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,584
When I was first captured
by the Borg,

437
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,587
I was young and frightened.

438
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,050
I watched my parents
assimilated.

439
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,635
Then I was placed
in a maturation chamber,

440
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,637
and the hive mind began
to restructure

441
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,891
my synaptic pathways,
purge my individuality.

442
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,311
When I emerged five years later,

443
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,688
the turmoil
of my forced assimilation

444
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,815
had been replaced with order.

445
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,111
You may not be aware
of this, Captain,

446
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:15,408
but that order continues to be
a source of strength for me.

447
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:19,161
I could not have regained
my humanity without it.

448
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,164
I appreciate
your insights.

449
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,920
But just because they
didn't have the benefit
of your Borg upbringing,

450
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,588
doesn't mean we're going
to turn our backs on them.

451
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,466
There has to be another way.

452
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,262
Not all drones
can be saved, Captain.

453
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,350
Continue the repairs
aboard the Borg cube.

454
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,895
We'll hold onto this
information for now.

455
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,355
Yes, Captain.

456
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:51,193
They do have one thing
going for them.

457
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,362
You.

458
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,281
If there's anyone
who can reach them,

459
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,907
it's you.

460
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,129
KIM:
Three of hearts
on a transwarp conduit.

461
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,755
Ensign?

462
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,425
King of clubs...

463
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,552
on a power coupling.

464
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,554
I'm marking my route

465
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,639
with playing cards in case I
have to come back this same way.

466
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,976
TUVOK:
You shouldn't distract yourself,
Mr. Kim.

467
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,103
I need a little distraction.

468
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:30,274
This hike is bringing up
some bad memories.

469
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,193
An earlier visit to a Borg cube?

470
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:37,072
Nope, haunted house
my parents took me to
when I was six.

471
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:41,285
Borg vessels may be forbidding,
but they are not haunted.

472
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,746
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Tuvok?

473
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,748
Turn left, Ensign.

474
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:51,337
Nine of diamonds on a data node.

475
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,257
The resonance field
collapsed.

476
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,134
It'll take an hour
to reinitialize.

477
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,512
These delays
are intentional.

478
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,930
I'm working
as efficiently as I can.

479
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,225
Examine my work for yourself
if you have doubts.

480
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,479
This data's flawed.

481
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,356
More likely it's
your understanding

482
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,899
of quadric field
theory that's flawed.

483
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,818
Ignore her.

484
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,903
She's trying to divide us.

485
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,114
They rely on you.
Yet you lack

486
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,659
the skills necessary to ensure
their survival.

487
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,036
We've managed so far.

488
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,703
We're Borg.

489
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,831
You've forgotten
what that means.

490
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,792
The unity of the collective...

491
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,461
common goals...

492
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,004
the quest for perfection...

493
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,215
I have not forgotten.

494
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,133
But you don't need
to remain drones

495
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,010
to experience those things.

496
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,139
Come back with me to<i> Voyager.</i>

497
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,267
38 minutes.

498
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,935
You're wasting time.

499
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,980
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

500
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,652
Another maturation chamber
is malfunctioning.

501

SEVEN:
Its autonomic nervous
system is failing.

502

It's Borg.
It<i> will</i> adapt.

503
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,544
It's not adapting.

504
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,003
Let Seven help.

505
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,682
We can modulate the stasis field
to stabilize its functions,

506
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,935
at least temporarily.
Assist me.

507
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,354
The field is degrading.

508
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,148
We need to transport it
into an incubation pod--
quickly.

509
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,664

510

511
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,603
Why is it doing that?

512

It's respiratory
system is impaired.

513
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,608
And this incubation pod
is malfunctioning.

514
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,485
We must transport this
infant to<i> Voyager.</i>

515
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,905
No. The drone is part
of our collective.

516
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,534
Not if it dies.

517
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,500
(<i> baby panting</i> )

The shield generator
should be directly ahead.

520
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,763
I see it.

You left these.

I like her.

She looks like Seven of Nine.

532
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,642
Is Seven your friend?

533
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,644
You know, she's my friend, too.

534
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,020
Maybe someday...

535
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,481
Your weapon won't work here.

536
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,734
Dampening field.

537
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,071
How long has it been
since you lost contact?

538
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,031
Four or five minutes.
His bio-signs?

539
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,575
Doctor to the Captain.

540
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,368
Please report
to Sick Bay immediately.

541
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,494
On my way.

542
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,663
Keep looking
for him.

543
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,207
What's the emergency?

544
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,459
I thought you should see
for yourself.

545
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,587
Somebody left a bundle
on our doorstep.

546
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,131
I turned around
and there she was,
lying on a bio-bed.

547
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,092
Seven must have
beamed her here.

548
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,177
A good thing, too.
A few more minutes

549
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,430
and I wouldn't have been able
to do anything for her.

550
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:17,770
It's hard to believe
she could grow up
to be a drone.

551
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,855
(<i> baby crying</i> )

552
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,571
Hold her for a moment
while I take some readings.

553
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,328
(<i> baby stops crying</i> )

554
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,833
Oh. I guess she just
wanted to be held.

555
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,631
Oh.

556
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,342
The pathogen.

557
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,929
I finished synthesizing it.

558
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,891
Start working with Tuvok
on a way to deploy
the virus.

559
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,560
Captain, you don't
seriously plan to use it.

560
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,771
If I have to.

561
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,567
Let's just hope your
brothers and sisters

562
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,861
don't force my hand.

563
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,700
You complain of delays,
then you interrupt my work.

564
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,161
Can you identify this?

565
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,372
It's a plasma charge.

566
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,254
You tried to deceive us.

567
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,931
FIRST:
Nanoprobes were injected
into his bloodstream.

568
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,391
He won't survive
without medical attention.

569
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,226
Call your Captain.

570
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,228
Tell her to give us
the deflector.

571
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,814
That won't be necessary.

572
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,482
I only need a few more
minutes to repair...

573
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,900
No more delays.

574
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,361
No more deceptions.

575
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,488
The deflector.

576
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,911
Resistance is futile.

577
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,168
FIRST:
Comply.

578
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,754
Return Harry Kim;
then we'll talk.

579
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:11,466
We've talked enough.
Your requests are irrelevant.

580
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,803
Comply, or we'll assimilate
the others.

581
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,976
It'll take us at least an hour
to dismantle the deflector

582
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,854
and transfer
the components...
Now.

583
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,356
I can't give it to you now.

584
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,234
It's complex technology
that's part of our ship.

585
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,277
We can't simply remove it,

586
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,406
and no amount
of threats from you
is going to change that.

587
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,078
They've locked a tractor beam
onto the deflector.

588
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,705
TORRES:
They're trying
to tear it off.

589
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,040
Hull stress is increasing.

590
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,958
Breaches on Decks 10 and 11.

591
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,378
Increase shield strength
and randomize the harmonics.

592
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,050
They're adapting.

593
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,432
Even with<i> Voyager's</i>
deflector,

594
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:04,143
your efforts to
return to the hive
will fail.

595
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,187
They'll come for us.

596
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,065
No, they won't.

597
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,359
The Borg received
your message,

598
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,319
but chose
to ignore it.

599
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,906
They consider
you irrelevant.

600
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,532
Irrelevant?

601
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,158
We are damaged.

602
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,953
They don't want us.

603
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,621
Ignore her.

604
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,163
It's another lie.

605
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,876
Their reply is
in data grid 426.

606
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,169
Use decryption
protocol theta-3.

607
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,047
Return to your station.

608
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,645
It's another deception.

609
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,106
She's manipulating us.

610
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,357
The transmission
is authentic.

611
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,238
It's a mistake.

612
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,866
The collective does not
tolerate imperfection.

613
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,661
Then we'll assimilate
more species...

614
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,122
prove we're worthy.

615
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,627
Hull stress is reaching
critical levels.

616
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,672
Reroute all emergency power
to structural integrity.

617
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,715
That'll buy us
another minute at most.

618
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,051
Captain, I found a fluctuation

619
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,012
in their shield grid
near a plasma duct.

620
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,597
It's too intermittent
to beam out the hostages,

621
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,350
but we<i> could</i> use it
to deploy the pathogen.

622
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,814
Captain...

623
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,149
Not yet.

624
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,566
There is
no alternative.

625
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,068
There's always
an alternative.

626
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,987
We just need to find it.

627
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,449
Their tractor
beam draws power

628
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,827
from the same grid
as their shield matrix.

629
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,496
If we use the deflector

630
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,498
to send a feedback pulse
along the beam,

631
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,583
it could disrupt
their shields. Do it.

632
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,211
Rerouting more plasma.

633
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,131
If this doesn't work,
it'll do more damage
to us than the cube.

634
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:59,467
It'll work.
Prepare to fire.

635
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,261
You have no future
with the Borg...

636
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,598
but you do
with<i> Voyager--</i>

637
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,601
a chance to reclaim
your real lives.

638
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,646
What do you know
about real lives?

639
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,525
Does he speak
for all of you?

640
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,736
You should make your
decisions yourself,

641
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,696
as individuals.

642
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,996
They are sending
a feedback pulse
through our tractor beam.

643
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,540
It's overloading
our shield matrix.

644
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,000
Adapt!

645
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,632
Their tractor beam
is fluctuating.

646
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,300
Their shields
are dropping.

647
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,969
I've got a partial lock
on the away team.

648
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,679
Boosting the confinement beam.

649
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,223
I've got three of them.

650
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,100
Confirmed.

651
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,936
Chakotay, Paris and Neelix
are in Transporter Room 2.

652
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,854
What about Seven and Harry?

653
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,856
They must be in a section
that's still shielded.

654
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,025
Amplify the feedback pulse.

655
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,281
The other captives are gone.

656
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,867
The shields around this chamber
are failing.

657
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,827
Instructions.

658
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,252
Lower your shields.

659
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,841
Lower the shields!

660
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,429
No!

661
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,564
(<i> grunts</i> )

662
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,194
Leave her alone.

663
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,404
Get back to your station.

664
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,949
Do what I say.

665
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,450
What<i> you</i> say?

666
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,535
I thought we were
a collective.

667
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,579
One mind, one voice.

668
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,373
I protected you...

669
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,375
gave you order.

670
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,712
<i>Your</i> order.
<i>Your</i> rules.

671
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:04,550
Their feedback pulse
is overloading
the induction grids.

672
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,641
This vessel will be destroyed.
We must evacuate.

673
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,686
No!
Assist me!

674
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,783
(<i> groans</i> )

675
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,702
You're damaged.
Lie still.

676
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,412
We have to resist.

677
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,624
The collective will come for us.

678
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,754
His cortical implants
are depolarizing.

679
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,466
I can't help him.

680
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,390
We'll find a new home.

681
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,642
You'll see.

682
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,313
W-we are Borg.

683
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,901
Yes.

684
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,111
We are Borg.

685
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,253
Lower the shields.

686
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,853
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

687
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,980
<i>Harry is recovering</i>
<i>in Sick Bay,</i>

688
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,024
<i>and the rest</i>
<i>of the away team</i>
<i>is safe and sound.</i>

689
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,859
<i>As for the drones,</i>

690
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,819
<i>the Doctor's removed</i>
<i>most of their implants,</i>

691
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,155
<i>leaving us with four</i>
<i>very troubled children.</i>

692
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,033
We've sent out calls
to any Brunali
and Norcadian ships

693
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,743
that might be
in the vicinity,

694
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,453
but we haven't gotten
any responses so far,

695
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,996
and we're still
trying to figure out

696
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,082
where the other
two came from.

697
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,708
It may take a while.

698
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,294
They could use the time.

699
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,087
They have a great deal
to learn.

700
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,423
It might help if they
had someone around

701
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,758
who knew what
they're up against.

702
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,220
I've never been responsible
for children.

703
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:14,722
Mr. Neelix would be
a wiser choice.

704
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:18,393
From what I've seen,
you're the one they've
established a bond with.

705
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,728
They'll be looking to you
for guidance.

706
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,357
Perhaps I could...
help them avoid

707
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,068
some of the obstacles
I've encountered.

708
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,995
Do we have to regenerate now?

709
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,871
Yes.

710
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,999
But first...

711
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,710
I was able to salvage
your assimilation
profiles.

712
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,131
They include your names
and some limited
