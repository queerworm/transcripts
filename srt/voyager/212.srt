1
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,077
We need this
completely filled.

2
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,830
We don't have time
to haggle over price.

3
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,581
Understood.

4
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,044
Captain.

5
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,107
Janeway to<i> Voy...</i>

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,234
GUARD:
Get up!

7
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,078
MALE:
Get away from her!

8
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,449
Commander--

9
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,909
any word on
that tellerium?

10
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,995
Not yet. How bad is it?

11
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,329
The antimatter
reaction rate

12
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,914
is down to 12%.

13
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,249
If it drops below nine the
plasma injectors will lock up

14
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,544
and we'll never be able to
reinitialize the nacelles.

15
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,087
Options?

16
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,381
If we're going to reduce our
power demands even further,

17
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,257
we're going to have to drop
the shields.

18
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,093
I don't want
to be defenseless

19
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,553
this close
to a hostile planet.

20
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,638
All other systems
are already off-line.

21
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,390
Life support
is at minimal.

22
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,516
You asked for options?

23
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,018
That's our last one.

24
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,022
All right, power
down the shields.

25
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,115
That helped.

26
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,491
It's only a matter of time.

27
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,743
There's nothing more we can do

28
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,660
without the tellerium.

29
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,745
<i>Neelix to</i> Voyager.

30
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,287
Yes, Neelix.

31
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,623
<i>The rest of the away team</i>
<i>is gone, Commander.</i>

32
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,876
<i>They've been taken</i>
<i>by the Mokra.</i>

33
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

34
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,420
Did you get the tellerium?

35
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,255
<i>Yes, I have it.</i>

36
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,381
Then we need you here.

37
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,383
Prepare to beam to engineering.

38
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,220
Rerouting emergency power
to transporter room two.

39
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,013
And...

40
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,139
energizing.

41
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,940
Chakotay to away team:

42
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,649
Captain, can you hear me?

43
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,443
Unlock the control conduit.

44
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,780
CHAKOTAY:
Tuvok, Torres?

45
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,782
Please respond.

46
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,075
Keep an eye on the float rate.

47
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,953
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,289
CREWMAN:
Rate's holding steady.

49
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,876
KIM:
The reaction rate
is stabilized at 13%.

50
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,796
Up to 15... 18.

51
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,923
It worked then?
We're all right?

52
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,133
Maybe.

53
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,675
Once the rate is normal

54
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,095
we'll try getting
the warp drive back on-line.

55
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,763
Then we'll see
if there was any damage.

56
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,515
Begin rerouting power back
to all key systems.

57
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,642
What happened down there?

58
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,936
I don't know, exactly.

59
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,687
I went in the shop,
completed the trade,

60
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,815
then I heard weapons fire
on the street.

61
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,442
By the time I got out there,
they were gone.

62
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,735
Are you sure
it was the Mokra?

63
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,613
I spoke to witnesses
on the street.

64
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,073
They said it was quite a fight.

65
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,366
Any idea how the Mokra knew
you were down there?

66
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:29,830
Someone must have told them
we were coming.

67
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,249
The Mokra have informants
everywhere.

68
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,168
Could your contact
be one of them?

69
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,962
I don't think I would have
made it back here

70
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,755
with the tellerium
if he had been.

71
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,590
Besides, he's involved

72
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,425
with the Alsaurian
resistance movement.

73
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,136
He would never help the Mokra.

74
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,180
They've probably got
the resistance movement

75
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,097
under surveillance.

76
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,640
KIM:
Commander--

77
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,725
I think we're ready
to give the engines a try.

78
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,733
I'm opening
the plasma injectors.

79
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,536
Warp engines are back on-line.

80
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,747
All systems normal.

81
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,999
Good work, Mr. Kim.

82
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,667
Mr. Neelix,
you're with me.

83
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,670
I think it's time
we contact the Mokra.

84
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,673
Mr. Paris, set a new course.

85
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,633
Bring us out from behind
the moon and establish

86
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,677
the standard orbit
around the planet-- slowly.

87
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,221
We don't want
to look aggressive.

88
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,139
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,516
What kind of response should we
expect when they see us?

90
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,727
The Mokra are paranoid
and hostile.

91
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,812
They have little use
for diplomacy.

92
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,105
I wouldn't be surprised

93
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,399
if they started shooting
at us immediately.

94
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,111
We'll be in full view
of the planet in a few seconds.

95
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,828
Their orbital sensor net
has picked us up.

96
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,663
They're scanning the ship.

97
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,376
We're being hailed.

98
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,045
On screen.

99
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:04,007
<i>I am Third Magistrate Augris</i>
<i>of the Mokra order.</i>

100
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,052
Commander Chakotay of
the Federation Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

101
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,512
<i>May I assume</i>
<i>you're seeking permission</i>

102
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,972
<i>to conduct business with us?</i>

103
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,307
No.

104
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,516
Some of my crew members

105
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,060
have already been
to the surface.

106
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,519
We've lost contact with them.

107
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,855
<i>I see.</i>

108
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,067
<i>You must have been unaware</i>
<i>of our regulations.</i>

109
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,818
<i>I'll transfer</i>
<i>a complete copy</i>

110
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,612
<i>for future reference.</i>

111
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,989
I have reason to believe
they're being detained.

112
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,867
<i>Detained?</i>
<i>That's possible.</i>

113
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,827
<i>I'll look into it for you.</i>

114
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,455
<i>I'll contact</i>
<i>you shortly.</i>

115
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,706
Thank you.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,919
He's not like any Mokra
I've ever met.

117
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,462
I can't believe he'll
really help us.

118
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,631
If there's any chance
for a diplomatic solution,

119
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,258
we have to pursue it.

120
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,094
In the meantime I want
continuous scans of the surface.

121
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,845
Standard search pattern.

122
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,075
I advise caution.

123
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,994
There's a control circuit there.

124
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,162
I can see it.

125
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,210
If only we knew
that Neelix made it,

126
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,171
back to the ship
with the tellerium.

127
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,382
Then at least this
would be worth it.

128
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,677
I regret I have no such
reassurance to offer you.

129
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,637
We don't even know what happened
to the captain.

130
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,848
She might have been killed
out there on the street.

131
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,433
That is possible.

132
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,312
It is also possible

133
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,356
that she has safely
retuned to<i> Voyager.</i>

134
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,691
We have insufficient
evidence to dismiss

135
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,859
either conclusion.

136
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,237
I guess that's
the Vulcan way

137
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,531
of telling me
to hope for the best.

138
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:58,330
(<i> someone humming</i> )

139
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,401
(<i> groaning</i> )

140
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,820
Look who's awake.

141
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,282
Just rest.

142
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,326
You must be thirsty.

143
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,329
Maybe hungry?

144
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,206
For a little something?

145
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,558
Where am I?

146
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,018
Oh, it hasn't been that long.

147
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,438
I wish I had some... there.

148
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,898
This will do.

149
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,447
Drink.

150
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,079
Thank you.

151
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,872
I'll fix you some soup.

152
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,957
Now, just lie down.

153
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,919
You're very kind, but I--

154
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,837
It's all right.
You're safe now.

155
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,131
I really can't--

156
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,133
Shh-shh.

157
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,551
Don't worry.

158
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,470
Everything's all right now.

159
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,433
My little girl is home.

160
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,172
I'm very grateful

161
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,756
for everything
you've done for me.

162
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,924
But you know there's nothing

163
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,385
I wouldn't do
for my sweet Ralkana.

164
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,971
My name is Kathryn Janeway.

165
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,182
"Kathryn"?

166
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,559
That's an unusual name.

167
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,893
Very pretty.

168
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,687
I like it.

169
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,315
I am a starship captain.

170
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,234
It is very important
that I contact my ship.

171
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,612
Wonderful.

172
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,573
Captain Kathryn...

173
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:42,536
of a glorious starship.

174
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,620
Then what happens?

175
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,205
Go on.

176
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,247
I'm listening.

177
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,332
I love your stories.

178
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,125
It's not a story.

179
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,169
It's a request.

180
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,254
May I use your
communications equipment?

181
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,673
Communications...

182
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:58,092
Uh, we're not supposed
to have any of that.

183
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,386
The Mokra don't allow it.

184
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,471
They can't have control
of everything.

185
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,807
Surely there's someone
who has an illegal transmitter.

186
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,144
I know what you'd like--
some talsa root soup.

187
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,856
Can you tell me what happened

188
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,608
to the people I was with
on the street?

189
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,610
You really should be
more careful out there.

190
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,239
Those Mokra will pick
a fight for no reason.

191
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:23,368
I don't want you
getting hurt... again.

192
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:29,541
But I saw the way you handled
that ugly one.

193
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,125
I couldn't have
done any better.

194
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,169
I was so proud
of you, Ralkana.

195
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,089
My two friends--
did the Mokra take them?

196
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,340
I'm afraid so.

197
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,841
Where would they
have been taken?

198
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,176
A detention center?

199
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:43,971
The prison.

200
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,099
All right.

201
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,434
How do I get there?

202
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,976
Soup.

203
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,769
I'm forgetting the soup.

204
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,065
I appreciate your hospitality
but I can't stay here.

205
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,358
I've got to get to that prison.

206
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,068
You're right,
the time has come.

207
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,696
Now that we're together again,
we can't wait another day.

208
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,531
My beautiful...

209
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,576
and brave girl.

210
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:08,037
The Mokra won't stand
a chance against us.

211
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,750
You're very kind to offer

212
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,126
but I didn't mean

213
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,753
we'd be going
together.

214
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:19,006
You must eat and rest

215
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,841
to get your strength back.

216
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,093
We'll leave soon enough.

217
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,637
We don't want
to keep her waiting

218
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,096
any longer
than we have to.

219
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,851
Keep who waiting?

220
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:36,650
She must miss you
so terribly.

221
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,984
It's hard to bear,

222
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:42,238
thinking of her alone
in that dark cell.

223
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,575
It's been difficult
for all of us

224
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:50,121
but don't worry,
we'll get her out.

225
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,332
You'll see
your mother again.

226
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,804
Our world has come
under attack before.

227
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,681
You can understand
our concern

228
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,392
at finding strangers
who arrive secretly

229
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,727
from a hidden ship.

230
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,938
I assure you, we have
no hostile intentions.

231
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,024
I believe you,

232
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,442
but some of
my colleagues

233
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,696
are cautious about
dealing with...

234
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,238
disreputable ships.

235
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,032
What does that mean?

236
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,244
It seems you've been making
more enemies than friends

237
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,038
since you arrived from the...

238
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,581
alpha quadrant, is it?

239
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,126
Some think even that story
is a lie.

240
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,294
But not you.

241
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,754
Of course not.

242
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,297
I am here to help.

243
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,093
Then I'd like to talk
to my crew members.

244
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,637
I'm afraid that
will be difficult

245
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,972
in the current climate
of mistrust.

246
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,475
Perhaps if you
could tell us

247
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,976
more about what
brought you here--

248
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,479
who you've been
dealing with.

249
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,523
I'll consider that

250
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,234
after I talk
to my crew members.

251
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,861
You're not
making it very easy

252
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,529
for me to help you.

253
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,828
Let me see
what I can arrange.

254
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,038
It may take some time.

255
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,289
Commander.

256
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,424
Talk to your contacts again.

257
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,634
I want an alternative
to sitting here

258
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,388
waiting for him
to get back to us.

259
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,807
Your question is based
on a faulty assumption.

260
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,392
I cannot answer it.

261
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,104
You can't deny being in contact
with the resistance.

262
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,564
I deny that we
are intending

263
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,065
to supply them
with weapons.

264
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,234
These lies are useless.

265
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,153
We know you're
helping the subversives.

266
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,406
I want names.

267
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,241
I have none
to give you.

268
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,659
We told you already,
we don't know

269
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,620
anything about
the resistance!

270
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,040
I've heard that many times
from many people.

271
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,876
Take him.

272
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,463
TUVOK:
Lieutenant, stop!

273
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,090
That will not
help either of us.

274
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,884
He's right.

275
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,482
SOLDIER: Open up!
FEMALE: No!

276
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,357
SOLDIER: Break it down!

277
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,777
(<i> yelling continues</i> )

278
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,112
(<i> door opening</i> )

279
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,030
I see soldiers out there. What's
happening?

280
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,492
They're everywhere,
searching the whole area.

281
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,118
I don't want to cause
trouble for you.

282
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,328
I'll go soon as it's dark.

283
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,913
You've always been
a troublemaker

284
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,122
ever since you could walk.

285
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,458
I've never seen
such a willful child.

286
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,042
But that's what
I love most about you,

287
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,920
your spirit.
Now, don't worry.

288
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,632
When they come through here,
we'll be gone already.

289
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,511
Now, your mother will want
some of her things.

290
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,390
Ah... a pretty dress
to wear.

291
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,310
They're only looking for me.

292
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,855
You don't have to get more
involved than you already are.

293
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,523
Why, if my precious
girl is involved

294
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,358
then I'm involved too.

295
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,326
Do you remember this?

296
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,954
She always used to wear it
on special occasions.

297
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:22,792
I think today
would count... as one.

298
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,294
You know what I think
she would like even more?

299
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,716
Is to see you wearing it.

300
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,925
I couldn't possibly take it.

301
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,426
Be careful. Be careful.

302
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,929
This won't heal if you
move around too much.

303
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,138
If you want to help

304
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,557
tell me about
that prison.

305
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,392
What kind of security
do they have?

306
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,101
Are there force fields,
detection grids,

307
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,897
physical barriers?
Yes, all of it.

308
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,315
What about guards?
Lots of guards.

309
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,944
The Mokra make
a big show of it--

310
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,821
always bragging about
how no one

311
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,364
has ever escaped.

312
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,701
Listen to me...

313
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,620
I can't bring you
to prison with me.

314
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,997
It's too dangerous.

315
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,834
I'm not afraid.

316
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,336
And that could get
both of us killed.

317
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,714
You have to stay here.

318
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,508
If I stay here I can't
bring the letters.

319
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,636
Letters...
to the prison?

320
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,221
Letters.

321
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,016
Don't you remember how we used
to write to her together?

322
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,733
Here they are.

323
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,151
I still write them--

324
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,653
every week since
she's been gone...

325
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,074
I've always known
that one day

326
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,034
I'd be able to...
to give them to her.

327
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,787
I've never forgotten.

328
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,456
These are all
to your wife?

329
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,749
How long has it been?

330
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,710
My last letter...

331
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:54,008
My last letter is not...
it's not here.

332
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:59,305
Oh, I wrote it three days ago,
but it's... it's not...

333
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:03,350
I can't let her think
I've stopped writing--

334
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:09,398
that I gave up hope only,
only days before...

335
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,942
Huh, I'll write it again.

336
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,658
My hand...

337
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,660
My hand shakes sometimes.

338
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,329
You write it so it looks nice.

339
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,372
I'm very sorry, I have to go

340
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,458
before the soldiers come

341
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:32,171
the last one...
the last one was about...

342
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,884
My memory isn't very good.

343
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,512
No, I remember.

344
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,348
I went walking in the morning.

345
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,352
It was... it was very cold.

346
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,312
Tell her I wore my sweater.

347
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:53,526
She worries about
that sort of... thing.

348
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,279
And... and, uh...

349
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,951
And I, uh, and I what?

350
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,956
And I saw that they had
torn down that old building

351
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:11,502
where you and the other children
used to... to play.

352
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:15,506
And, uh... what else?

353
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,468
Tell her that it rained
for two and half days.

354
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,638
I don't know
if she can see the sky...

355
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,684
where they're keeping her.

356
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,691
And... there was more.

357
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:38,571
There was something
about a friend... I, uh...

358
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,198
I...can't I remember?

359
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,782
I wanted to tell her!

360
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,165
It's all right.
She'll understand.

361
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,628
Yes, yes, you're right.

362
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,714
She will.

363
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,770
Please let me come with you.

364
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,813
I'm sorry.
That's not possible.

365
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,148
SOLDIER:
Check this one here!

366
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,233
(<i> banging )</i>

367
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,650
Is there another way out?

368
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,861
(<i> soldiers yelling,</i>
<i>banging continues</i> )

369
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,279
There.

370
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,326
SOLDIER:
Open the door!
Open the door, now!

371
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,204
SOLDIER:
Break it down!

372
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,825
(<i> tapping</i> )

373
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,623
This is a waste of time.

374
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,666
We don't need him anyway.

375
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,334
I need him.

376
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,086
If he's a member
of the resistance

377
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,006
he may be able to help me
contact my ship.

378
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,884
Monster!

379
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,349
He's the one.
He took your mother.

380
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,392
We have to...

381
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,146
they want a fight.

382
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,939
Don't give them one.

383
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,861
(<i> shouting and scuffling</i> )

384
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,322
MALE:
I've done nothing.
I've done nothing.

385
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,740
Please, please!

386
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,367
AUGRIS:
You look like
a helpful citizen.

387
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,912
So tell me, you might have
seen some strangers

388
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,165
who were in the
market place earlier today.

389
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,249
MALE:
No, sir. No, sir!

390
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,501
I've seen no one.
Please.

391
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,961
AUGRIS:
You!

392
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,639
I'm looking for someone,
a woman.

393
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,266
I haven't seen
any woman.

394
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,730
There are two
right over here.

395
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,023
You see them,
don't you?

396
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,482
MALE:
Yes.

397
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,985
Maybe we should
discuss this elsewhere.

398
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,906
( whispers )
Caylem!

399
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,743
Good morning.

400
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,161
<i>(laughter)</i>

401
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,081
I seem to have lost my hat.

402
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,923
It's about this... this big.

403
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,899
Have you seen my hat?

404
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,487
Run along, old man.

405
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,156
Without my hat?

406
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,960
There you go.

407
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,336
(<i> laughter</i> )

408
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:53,533
The... it's
all right now.

409
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,952
They've gone.

410
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,299
(<i> footsteps and guards'</i>
<i>chattering receding</i> )

411
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,731
(<i> distant screaming</i> )

412
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,574
NEELIX:
The prison is in the northeast
corner of the city.

413
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,118
My sources tell me
it's surrounded

414
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,453
by metaphasic shields.

415
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,163
Can we find a way
to beam through them?

416
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,707
The Mokra aren't familiar
with transporter technology.

417
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,167
There is a periodic
fluctuation

418
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,252
in the shields energy pattern.

419
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,046
I'm working on a way
to take advantage of it.

420
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,672
There's only one
problem with that.

421
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,798
If the Mokra detect us

422
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,258
breaking through
their shields,

423
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,260
we'll be surrounded
by soldiers in seconds.

424
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,636
If we could
beam in close enough

425
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,138
to where the away team
is being held

426
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,890
we might be able
to get in and out of there

427
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,766
before the Mokra
had a chance to react.

428
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,853
We can't locate
the away team from here.

429
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,147
The detention level
is subterranean

430
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,525
and the rock is too dense
for our sensors to penetrate.

431
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,985
You'll have to look for them
after you beam into the prison.

432
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,111
Too dangerous.

433
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,821
We can't risk beaming in.

434
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,324
We'll have to find another way
that the Mokra won't detect.

435
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,868
Sounds like a challenge
for you, Mr. Kim.

436
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,998
MALE:
You'd be welcomed to use our
transmitter if we still had one.

437
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,042
The Mokra confiscated
it this morning.

438
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,960
Then I'll have to find
my crew members myself.

439
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,171
I know two of them were
arrested, what about Neelix?

440
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,423
He stayed
inside with me,

441
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,965
then got transported
up to your ship.

442
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,926
Good. What can you
tell me about the prison?

443
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,219
I know about the prison.

444
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,970
We need all the information
we can get.

445
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,722
I have to reach my crew. 

446
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,267
Don't you think there are people
in there I'd like to get out?

447
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,352
Any sane person would
tell you it's impossible.

448
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,104
Spoken like a coward.

449
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,314
I've heard about you old man,
you're the coward!

450
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,982
Enough.

451
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,776
What are you doing
with this lunatic?

452
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,986
Has he been telling you
stories of his brave deeds?

453
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,988
They're just fantasies.
Taking him along on this

454
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,614
rescue mission of yours
is suicide.

455
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,368
He's already saved me
from the Mokra once.

456
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,828
And he saved you from
those soldiers today.

457
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,205
All right,
stay with him.

458
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,374
Go off to the prison,
get yourself killed.

459
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,542
I don't have to get killed

460
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,127
if you will tell me
what you know.

461
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,213
There are access tunnels
on the north side.

462
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,631
They'll get you in a little
closer, but they're guarded.

463
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,674
Then I'll need weapons.

464
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,176
They're not free.

465
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,095
I don't have
anything to trade.

466
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,972
That's worth
some weapons.

467
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,265
I can't.

468
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,851
Yes, you can...
if it'll help

469
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,562
to bring her back to us.

470
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,856
Thank you.

471
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,484
I can have someone meet you
on the street

472
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,943
in three hours
to make the trade.

473
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,236
He'll be wearing
a blue vest.

474
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,488
Watch for him.

475
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,323
We will. Thank you.

476
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,366
I'd wish you luck,

477
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,993
but what you'll need
is a miracle.

478
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,887
He's more than
three hours late.

479
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,515
We have to consider
the possibility

480
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,224
that he's been arrested.

481
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,811
You mustn't believe what
he told you about me.

482
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,064
I don't believe it.

483
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,108
You're not a coward.

484
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,445
I had to keep
my little girl safe.

485
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,364
It was just too dangerous
to get involved.

486
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,324
Can you understand?

487
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,368
Your mother wouldn't listen.

488
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,744
She wanted to fight.

489
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:28,915
She was always... so passionate
about what she believed in.

490
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,708
She didn't care about the risk.

491
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,129
You were proud of her.

492
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,341
I didn't want to lose her.

493
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:40,386
I didn't want you to grow up
without a mother.

494
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:44,181
I tried so hard
to change her mind

495
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,893
and finally she changed mine.

496
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,936
She convinced me
to go with her.

497
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,025
I said I would meet her...
by the river.

498
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:59,321
She was leading a raid
against a Mokra supply center.

499
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,284
I said I would meet her...

500
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,664
but I didn't... I couldn't.

501
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,166
I was too afraid.

502
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:19,174
She was still waiting for me
when they arrested her.

503
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,344
I could never tell
you about this.

504
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,803
I knew you would
hate me.

505
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,847
I couldn't bear that.
Please, Ralkana.

506
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,642
If you can ever forgive me...

507
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,244
What is it?

508
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,828
A blue vest.

509
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,748
Then it's time to go.

510
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,653
What happened?

511
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,488
He was wearing
military boots,

512
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,905
like the Mokra. It was a trap.

513
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,157
A trap?
And you saw it?

514
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,116
My clever girl.

515
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,451
We'll be all right.

516
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,536
We have each other.
That's all we'll need.

517
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,580
It's not that simple.
We can't just walk into

518
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,290
the prison without weapons.

519
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:46,345
Maybe we'll have to try
a different strategy.

520
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,348
(<i> grunting</i> )

521
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:01,735
We don't have to ask
your friend any more questions

522
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,944
if you give us the answers.

523
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,281
I told you I don't...

524
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,408
(<i> panting</i> )

525
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,630
I'm sorry.

526
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,507
(<i> panting</i> )

527
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,477
I guess I...
I always assumed

528
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,438
that Vulcans
didn't feel pain

529
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,441
like the rest of us.

530
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,442
That you were able

531
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,862
to block it out somehow

532
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,488
until I heard...

533
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,742
was that you I heard?

534
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:56,164
Vulcans...
are capable of suppressing...

535
00:31:56,164 --> 00:32:00,168
certain levels
of physical pain.

536
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,963
Beyond that,
we must simply

537
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,841
endure the experience.

538
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,344
How can you say that
so calmly?

539
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:14,474
You must feel some anger
at what they did to you.

540
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,477
Some desire
to fight back.

541
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,939
Under the circumstances,

542
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:25,736
physical resistance
is ineffective.

543
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,530
We are... fighting back

544
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,618
by refusing to give them
any information.

545
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,537
GUARD:
Get down there!

546
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,343
GUARD:
Three more hours.

547
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,555
GUARD 2:
There's nothing going
on around here.

548
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,475
Wake me if the lieutenant
shows up, will you?

549
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,977
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

550
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,411
You girls aren't supposed

551
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,331
to come down here anymore.

552
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,999
Do you want me to leave?

553
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,464
I didn't say that.

554
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,135
Then I won't.

555
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,096
If my lieutenant saw
you here I'd be in trouble.

556
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:41,102
Nobody will
see us back here.

557
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,938
It's dark...

558
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,648
private.

559
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,252
I like this strategy.

560
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,731
Ready to go?

561
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,025
No... you're not coming with me.

562
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,568
Of course I am.

563
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,029
We settled this.

564
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,574
You told that man, Darod,
how I saved you

565
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,742
from the Mokra!

566
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,868
You did save me.

567
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,161
Now I'm returning
the favor.

568
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:44,374
(<i> force field deactivating</i>
<i>and reactivating</i> )

569
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,251
I promise I'll try
to find your wife.

570
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,296
Wait!

571
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,007
Ralkana!

572
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,383
No!

573
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,472
I've been studying
their orbital sensor net.

574
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,059
It surrounds
the entire planet.

575
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,561
This is the most sophisticated
system I've ever seen.

576
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,021
It monitors everything we do,

577
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,565
there's no way
of disabling it from orbit.

578
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,275
So much for a surprise attack.

579
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,944
We may still be able
to surprise them

580
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,695
even if they do
see us coming.

581
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,196
We can modify
the main deflector

582
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,032
to send out send out
dozens of radion beams

583
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,909
which should penetrate
the prison shields.

584
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,327
One of them will carry
our transporter signal.

585
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,747
But the sensor net won't be
able to distinguish which one

586
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,582
so the Mokra won't know
the exact location

587
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,250
we're beaming to.

588
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,753
Then they won't know where to
concentrate their defenses.

589
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,671
That's the best head start
I can give you.

590
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,506
Then it'll have to do.
How long will it take

591
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,507
to modify the deflector?

592
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,926
I can do it right now.

593
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,303
Chakotay to Paris:
Is the rescue team ready?

594
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,387
<i>Standing by.</i>

595
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,889
Prepare for transport.

596
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,474
Deflector ready,
Commander.

597
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,017
Initiate the radion beams.

598
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,561
Sending out
the first volley.

599
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,897
It's working. They're getting
through the shields.

600
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,565
Begin the transport.

601
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,858
Transporter room two,

602
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,819
synchronize
your confinement beams to--

603
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,571
that came from the surface.

604
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,572
Maximum shields.

605
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,615
Damage report.

606
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,492
Shields at 90%.

607
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,202
That was a precision hit right
to the source of the beams.

608
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,288
Main deflector is now offline.

609
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,166
We're being hailed
from the surface.

610
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,376
On screen.

611
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,463
<i>Your attempt</i>
<i>to penetrate our defenses</i>

612
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,215
<i>is a hostile act</i>
<i>against the Mokra order.</i>

613
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,176
<i>There are now 85</i>
<i>phased-ion cannons</i>

614
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,762
<i>targeted at the your ship.</i>

615
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,307
<i>If you don't withdraw from</i>
<i>Mokra space in two minutes,</i>

616
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,768
<i>we will open fire.</i>

617
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,199
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

618
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,713
Commander.

619
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,381
Give me some good news,
Mr. Kim.

620
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,759
There's a disruption in
the shields around the prison.

621
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,343
That qualifies.
Good work.

622
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,845
I wish I could
take credit for it,

623
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,638
but it's coming from
inside the prison.

624
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,057
Can we get through?

625
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,642
Yes, but the Mokra will
detect our transport.

626
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,186
Sounds like they have
other things

627
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,896
to worry about right now.

628
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,814
That disruption might
not be accidental.

629
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,858
Someone in there might
be trying to get out.

630
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,193
That's big assumption.

631
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:01,529
Even if our people
didn't cause the problem

632
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,157
you know they'd take
advantage of it.

633
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,951
This is our best chance
to find them.

634
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,077
In about 30 seconds,

635
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,494
the Mokra are going
to open fire.

636
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,038
I don't know how
long we'll be able

637
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,915
to wait for you.

638
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,250
Understood.

639
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,719
JANEWAY:
Darod.

640
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,807
I'm looking
for my people.

641
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,142
They're back this way.

642
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,726
I'll show you.

643
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,372
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

644
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,630
Don't move.

645
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,965
(<i> sighs</i> )

646
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,341
There you are.

647
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,843
What are you doing here?

648
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,553
I will do everything
in my power

649
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,264
to protect
my only child.

650
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,640
(<i> sighs</i> )

651
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,604
There's a phased-ion charge
coming at us from the planet.

652
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,065
Full power to the shields.

653
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,652
KIM:
Shields at 60%.
Minor damage on deck 14.

654
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,778
They're firing again.

655
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,238
Modulate the shield frequencies.

656
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,572
Try to throw off their sensors.

657
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,828
No effect.

658
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,830
Direct hit to the port nacelle.

659
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,874
Redirect all warp power
to the shields.

660
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,626
Two more coming in.

661
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,802
Captain.
(<i> sighs</i> )

662
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,762
We've got to get you
back to the ship.

663
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,972
You're hurt.

664
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,058
Ralkana,
the other cells are this way.

665
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,934
We must find your mother.

666
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,438
Follow this passageway
until it dead-ends.

667
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,358
Then you'll see
a smaller passageway.

668
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,859
Captain, what are you doing?

669
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,195
There's one more person
I have to find.

670
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,404
Guards!

671
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:15,247
After all that time
I spent looking for you,

672
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,665
all I had to do was wait here.

673
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,421
Shields down to 23%.

674
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,215
We've got to get out of
their weapons range.

675
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,550
Scan one more time
for the away team.

676
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,886
There's no sign of them.

677
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,680
Prepare to break orbit.

678
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,727
Wait-- set a course bearing
2-1-9 mark 4-7.

679
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,562
Where are you
taking us, Mr. Kim?

680
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,065
There's a large
electrical storm

681
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,524
over the northern
magnetic pole.

682
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,568
It's giving our
sensors some trouble.

683
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,945
It should do
the same for theirs.

684
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,529
A blind spot?
Exactly.

685
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,739
If we maintain our position

686
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,032
directly above the storm,

687
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,575
their sensor net
may not be able

688
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,244
to keep an accurate lock
on our position.

689
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:55,745
How long do you think
this will work?

690
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,330
The storm's already
dissipating.

691
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,497
A few more minutes.

692
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,083
I'll take every second
I can get.

693
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,337
I must say
I'm impressed, Caylem.

694
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,757
You never made it
this far before.

695
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,175
Every so often
he goes on one

696
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:13,972
of his missions...
to rescue his wife.

697
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,308
She's been dead
for 12 years.

698
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,143
Lies.

699
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,978
Lies... lies!

700
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,564
Sometimes... he gets all
the way up to the front gate.

701
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,942
We send him on his way

702
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,445
and allow him
to serve as a reminder

703
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:32,198
of just how futile it is
to challenge us.

704
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,741
I thought you'd learn
that lesson

705
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,909
when you lost your daughter.

706
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,619
She made it as far
as the tunnels

707
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,204
before she was shot.

708
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,747
No!

709
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:44,169
So much tragedy
for one man to bear.

710
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:47,005
And now your foolishness
has condemned

711
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,132
another innocent woman.

712
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,635
Take the others back
for questioning.

713
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,387
I'll interrogate
this one myself.

714
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,930
No!

715
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,140
I won't let you
hurt her!

716
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,696
(<i> groaning</i> )

717
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,906
(<i> groaning</i> )

718
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,033
Caylem!

719
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,428
Ralkala...

720
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,350
He said
you'd been shot.

721
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,437
He was lying
to you, father.

722
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,938
I'm all right.

723
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,941
And your mother?

724
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,027
She's fine.

725
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,155
She was so happy
to get your letters.

726
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,703
She wanted me
to tell you something.

727
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,581
She forgives you.

728
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,542
We both do.

729
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,137
My sweet girl.

730
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,368
Captain.

731
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,246
I'm coming.

732
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,427
No one will forget
what he did here today.

733
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,053
I'll make sure of that.

734
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,517
Chakotay to
Transporter Room Two.

735
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,684
Do we have them?

736
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,312
JANEWAY:
<i>We're all back, Commander.</i>

737
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,439
<i>Take us out of here.</i>

738
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,648
Gladly.

739
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,233
Lieutenant,
you heard her.

740
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,950
KIM:
The warp drive is
functioning normally

741
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,869
and we'll have
the main deflector back on-line

742
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,246
tomorrow.

743
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,583
Yes, thank you,
Mr. Kim.

744
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,461
Captain, are
you all right?

745
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,296
I'm fine.
