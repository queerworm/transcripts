1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,463
Good afternoon,
Ensign.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,381
How are<i> we</i> 
doing today?

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,759
We're doing just
fine, thank you.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,803
Good, good.

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,889
By the way, I was wondering
if you'd take a look

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,933
at the thermal array
in the kitchen.

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,476
It overloaded
this morning

8
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,687
and vaporized
an entire pot roast.

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,105
I'd be happy to.
Wonderful.

10
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,818
I informed Ensign Kim
about the problem hours ago

11
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,444
and he still hasn't
come down to fix it.

12
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,779
He's been working
on a problem

13
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,865
with the structural
integrity grid.

14
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:34,034
I'm sure he hasn't
forgotten about you.

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,995
If this thing doesn't
get fixed soon

16
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,038
we'll all be eating
cold leftovers for dinner,

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,791
and who do you think
the crew will blame?

18
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,711
Looks like you need a new set
of anodyne relays.

19
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,753
( grunts )

20
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,338
I'll go down
to Engineering

21
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,340
and get some for you
out of storage.
Thanks.

22
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,511
Oh, and while you're here,
would you mind taking a look

23
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,804
at the replicator?

24
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,305
It's been having
trouble making anything

25
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,642
with large amounts
of cellulose.
Of course.

26
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,477
Cabbage, syllium,

27
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,980
green beans, celery--
it all comes out

28
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,606
looking a touch
too yellow.

29
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,525
I thought you didn't
use replicated vegetables

30
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,943
when you're cooking.

31
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,988
Always fresh, organic,
from the aeroponic bay?

32
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:14,074
Well, the yields have been
a little low lately.

33
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,662
Normally, I would never dream
of using synthesized veggies.

34
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,916
It looks like a malfunction
in the power grid.

35
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,876
Shouldn't be
too difficult...

36
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,460
( gasping )

37
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,755
What's wrong?

38
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,007
I think I'm having
a contraction.

39
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,260
Oh, yeah. It's a
contraction, all right.

40
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,428
That's wonderful.

41
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,847
Labor can't be far behind.

42
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,391
Let-Let's get you
to Sickbay.

43
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,726
Try to breathe now.

44
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,021
Deep, deep, regular breaths.
Not so fast now.

45
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,439
We're having a baby.

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,024
Aw!

47
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,317
Push!

48
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,279
( gasping )

49
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,990
Don't forget to
breathe, Samantha.

50
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,700
Deep, regular breaths.

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,952
That's it.

52
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,497
Cervical dilation is
at 10.2 centimeters.

53
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,041
Prostaglandin levels
are normal.

54
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,208
Push, Ensign!

55
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,251
You push, damn it!

56
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm sick of pushing!

57
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,297
I know you're
fatigued.

58
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,882
Try to focus on
your breathing.

59
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,467
Remember the
exercises we did.

60
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,303
When you feel a
contraction, bear down.

61
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,697
( sighs )

62
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,865
This is ridiculous.

63
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,241
It's been seven hours.

64
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,201
How long does it take
to deliver a baby?

65
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,830
As long as it takes,
Mr. Paris.

66
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,247
TUVOK: Indeed.

67
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,916
During the birth of
our third child,

68
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,335
my wife was in labor
for 96 hours.

69
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,545
Four days?

70
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,382
I have learned that pregnancy
and patience go hand-in-hand.

71
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,175
You know, I didn't
expect to be this nervous.

72
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,053
It's not even my child.

73
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:02,016
In a way, this child
belongs to all of us.

74
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,518
It is the first baby
born on<i> Voyager.</i>

75
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,978
I'm just not sure whether

76
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,396
I should be welcoming it
on board or apologizing.

77
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,065
Captain?

78
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,234
<i>Voyager</i> isn't exactly
anyone's idea of a nursery

79
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,655
and the Delta Quadrant
isn't much of a playground.

80
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,573
My father had a
saying, Captain.

81
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,118
"Home is wherever
you happen to be."

82
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,995
TUVOK:
Captain, long range sensors

83
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,205
are picking up heavy subspace
communications ahead.

84
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,332
They're Vidiian.

85
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,709
All stop. A ship?

86
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,793
At least 20 ships

87
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,128
within sensor range.

88
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,672
I am also detecting
a G-type star system

89
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,674
with two inhabited planets.

90
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,634
Lifesigns... Vidiian.

91
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,553
Sounds like we're headed
right into their territory.

92
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,763
And I'm in no mood to
donate any organs today.

93
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,432
Options,
Mr. Paris.

94
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:48,020
There's a large plasma drift,
bearing 4-0 mark 7.

95
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,148
It extends almost half
the length of this sector.

96
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,900
The interference from
the plasma should block us

97
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,484
from their sensors.

98
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,195
Good thinking. Lay in
a course at full impulse.

99
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,030
Mr. Tuvok, deflectors
at maximum.

100
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,416
( gasping )

101
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,169
( straining )

102
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,420
Oh!

103
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,089
Oh, what was that?

104
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,423
What's wrong?

105
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,051
A pain... in my abdomen.

106
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,929
It's different... sharp.

107
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,180
Oh, God!

108
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,514
The baby has
shifted position,

109
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,349
and its exocranial
ridges have lodged

110
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,726
in the uterine wall.

111
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,144
This is a rare
complication,

112
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,311
but it's been
known to happen

113
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,022
in human-Ktarian
pregnancies.

114
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,565
Can we reposition
the baby?

115
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,067
No, its spinal
column is too fragile.

116
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,610
I don't want to
risk nerve damage.

117
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,445
( groaning )

118
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,280
If we don't deliver
the baby now,

119
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,615
its ridges could
perforate the uterus

120
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,784
and cause internal
bleeding.

121
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,660
Kes, prepare for
fetal transport.

122
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,124
We're clearing the
Vidiian system, Captain.

123
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,583
Take us out of
the plasma drift

124
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,044
and resume our
previous course.

125
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,256
DR. ZIMMERMAN:
I've locked onto
the baby's coordinates.

126
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,799
We're ready to begin.

127
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,342
Initiating
umbilical separation.

128
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,636
Energizing.

129
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,977
( crying )

130
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,228
( exhales )

131
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,355
Congratulations, Ensign.

132
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,357
It's a girl.

133
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,860
( crying loudly )

134
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,074
Is she all right?

135
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,453
The transport caused a slight
hemocythemic imbalance,

136
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,497
but we'll stabilize
her cell membranes

137
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,915
with osmotic pressure therapy.

138
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,793
( rumbling )

139
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,128
What was that?

140
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,172
We hit some kind of
subspace turbulence

141
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,132
as we were coming out
of the plasma drift.

142
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,300
I can't tell if...

143
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,137
What the hell?

144
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,514
Captain, the warp engines
just stalled.

145
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,640
Go to impulse.

146
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,392
Impulse engines
aren't responding.

147
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,687
Maneuvering thrusters
are out too.

148
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,230
We're losing main power.

149
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,564
Switching
to backup power.

150
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,025
Red Alert.
Bridge to Engineering.

151
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,526
<i>Report!</i>

152
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,069
Our antimatter supply
is being drained, Captain.

153
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,361
I don't know why.

154
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,198
The containment fields
are in place.

155
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,325
It's like we sprung a leak,
but I can't find the crack.

156
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,409
B'Elanna,
try infusing the warp core

157
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,120
with repeated proton bursts.

158
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,913
That should be enough
to keep it going.

159
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,457
I think I can generate enough
protons in the sensor array

160
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,211
for a burst every 30 seconds.
<i>Do it.</i>

161
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,795
Hogan, these proton bursts

162
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,379
are going to cause a lot of
stress on the hull.

163
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,341
Reinforce structural
integrity to...

164
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,218
( low booming )

165
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,344
Now what?

166
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,640
What was that?

167
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,559
It appeared to
be a proton burst.

168
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,643
Already?

169
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,270
Bridge to Torres, report.

170
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,357
Engineering, respond.

171
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,776
Captain, three E.P.S. conduits
just ruptured in Engineering.

172
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
They took heavy casualties.

173
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,117
The incubator is losing power.
( baby crying )

174
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,119
Activate the auxiliary
respirator.

175
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,293
We've got wounded here!
( people groaning )

176
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,010
<i>( dramatic</i>
<i>theme music playing )</i>

177
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,115
Second-degree plasma burns
on the face and neck.

178
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,326
Treat him with
the dermaline gel.

179
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,286
Fractured clavicle,
thoracic contusions.

180
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,996
Nothing serious,
she can wait.

181
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,500
Fused vertebrae,
prep him for surgery.

182
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,043
Status.
It doesn't look good, Doctor.

183
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,128
The baby's cell membranes
won't stabilize.

184
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,796
Increase the
osmotic...

185
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,548
( low booming )

186
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,259
That's not helping.

187
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,636
Increase the osmotic
pressure ratio by 10%.

188
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,389
KIM:
<i>Bridge to Sick Bay.</i>

189
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,432
<i>There's been a major</i>
<i>coolant leak in the mess hall.</i>

190
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,059
<i>You've got more</i>
<i>wounded on the way.</i>

191
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,310
Acknowledged.

192
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,813
Torres to Bridge!

193
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,898
We're definitely...

194
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,400
( grunts )

195
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,568
We're definitely being
hit by proton bursts,

196
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,862
but I don't know where
they're coming from.

197
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,114
I never even started
the procedure.

198
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,616
She's right. The main sensor
array is off-line.

199
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,494
Not a single burst was fired.

200
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,413
Yet the bursts appear
to be originating from
within the ship--

201
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,039
it's like they're coming
out of thin air.

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,874
Captain, these bursts
are weakening

203
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,752
the structural integrity of the
hull; we cannot take any more.

204
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,505
Can we increase power
to structural reinforcement?

205
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,424
KIM: Our antimatter
supply is too low.

206
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,509
There's just not
enough power to go...

207
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,138
Hull breach on Deck 15,
Section 29 Alpha.

208
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,973
Emergency force fields
are off-line.

209
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,641
Captain,
I've been working on a way

210
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,477
to enhance our portable
force field generators.

211
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,811
It might be enough to seal
that breach.

212
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,938
Go.

213
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,693
NEELIX:
Don't you worry.

214
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,196
We have the best
doctor in the quadrant.

215
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,615
Doctor, her cell membranes
are losing cohesion.

216
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,784
Try remodulating
the osmotic pressure.

217
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,372
No effect.

218
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,125
Hang on, I'll
be right there.

219
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,219
Oh, no.

220
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,472
Jefferies Tube 12 runs
right over the breach.

221
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,056
If we can get close enough,
we should be able

222
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,724
to set up a portable
containment field.

223
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,311
The breach has weakened the
integrity of that tube by 22%.

224
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,812
That's why we need
to reinforce the field.

225
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,689
We'll use the power
conduits on this deck.

226
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,318
( grunting )

227
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,402
Go!

228
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,905
I've analyzed the bursts
on all spectral frequencies.

229
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,824
There's still no indication
of where they're coming from.

230
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,826
At this point, I don't give a
damn where they're coming from.

231
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,202
I just want to stop them.

232
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,163
Chakotay, do we have
enough auxiliary power

233
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,456
to magnetize the hull?

234
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,124
It might cushion the
impact of the bursts.

235
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,334
We have just barely enough.

236
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,377
Give it a try.

237
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,254
I've stabilized
my imaging array

238
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,839
but it could go out
at any time.
Doctor...

239
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,508
Prepare for emergency
resuscitation.

240
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,925
My baby, she...

241
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,677
She's going to die,
isn't she?

242
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,472
Not if I can help it.

243
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,687
Here it is. The breach
is directly below us.

244
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,528
Make it fast, Harry.

245
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,446
Torres to Hogan.
What's your status?

246
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,615
Almost got it, Lieutenant.

247
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,908
I'm rerouting all power
in this section to your...

248
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,827
( low booming )

249
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,496
( screams )

250
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,083
Torres to Hogan.

251
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,627
Hogan, are you there?

252
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,462
Ugh, I'm hurt...

253
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,796
Hurry, we have
to help him.

254
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,006
Just give me a minute.

255
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,717
( machine beeping )

256
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,221
DR. ZIMMERMAN: Again!
( monitor flatlining )

257
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,430
Nothing.

258
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,190
I'm sorry, Ensign.

259
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,488
( crying )

260
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,614
( groans )

261
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,575
Hogan to Sick Bay.

262
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,202
I need... medical assistance.

263
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,580
Deck 15, Section 29.

264
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,873
I'll go.
( sobbing )

265
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,129
The breach is widening.
Let's get out of here.

266
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,841
Damn it, Harry,
let's go!

267
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,842
Hold on.

268
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,927
My minute isn't
up yet...

269
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,178
Agh!

270
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,435
Harry!

271
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,687
Grab my hand!

272
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,987
Harry!

273
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,036
( gasping )

274
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,289
KES:
Lieutenant Hogan!

275
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,332
TORRES:
Kes, over here!

276
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,802
Torres to Bridge.

277
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,971
Ensign Kim is dead.

278
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,307
<i>Kes just disappeared.</i>

279
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,559
Disappeared?
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

280
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,436
She just vanished.

281
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,440
There seems to be
some kind of spatial rift

282
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,066
<i>right where</i>
<i>she disappeared.</i>

283
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,152
Can you determine
where it leads?

284
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,861
Stand by, Bridge.

285
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,827
I just threw a piece
of conduit into the rift.

286
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,747
Just as it vanished,
I detected another

287
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,457
oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere.

288
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,874
Another atmosphere?

289
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,460
Whatever's on
the other side of that rift

290
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,630
there's air--
maybe Kes is still alive.

291
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,800
( low booming )

292
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,010
Get out of there, Torres.
The hull breach is widening.

293
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,471
I'm going to evacuate
the entire deck.

294
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,306
You don't have
to tell me twice.

295
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,890
The main computer core
is failing.

296
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,434
Switching to backup processor.

297
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,269
( grunts )

298
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,355
Chakotay, are you ready
to magnetize the hull?

299
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,483
Standby. I'm having trouble
with the alignment module.

300
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,443
Try remodulating
the field emitter.

301
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,611
( all grunting )

302
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,863
Chakotay.

303
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,658
I've got alignment.

304
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,035
Magnetizing the hull.

305
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,005
I think it worked.
Let's hope so.

306
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,882
I want a full damage report
from all decks.

307
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,425
Are you all right, Captain?

308
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,926
It's just a scratch.

309
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,595
It's more than a scratch,
maybe should go...

310
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,929
I'm fine, Lieutenant.

311
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,765
TUVOK:
Damage reports are coming in.

312
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,059
The hull breach
on Deck 15 has widened

313
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,729
to include Deck 14, Section 12.

314
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,731
And there are
632 micro-fractures

315
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,858
along the hull's
infrastructure.

316
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,860
All primary systems
are off-line.

317
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,070
We are running
on emergency power only.

318
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,656
The antimatter supply
has dropped to 18%

319
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,242
and is continuing
to fall.

320
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,912
Warp coils in both nacelles
have fused and are inoperative.

321
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,915
The environmental control
systems are failing.

322
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,876
15 crew members
have been seriously wounded

323
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,210
with plasma burns.

324
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,880
27 experienced
other injuries.

325
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,715
The doctor is setting up
triage facilities

326
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,884
in Sick Bay
and Holodeck Two.

327
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,844
I must also regretfully report

328
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,930
that Ensign Wildman's baby
did not survive.

329
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,729
I want an engineering team
to seal those micro-fractures

330
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,856
before they become breaches.
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.

331
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,148
Mr. Paris, grab
a medical tricorder

332
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,109
and go assist the doctor.
Right.

333
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,402
Commander, you have the Bridge.

334
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,779
I'm going to go talk
to Ensign Wildman.

335
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,614
Maybe I can help...
MAN: Hold on...

336
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,575
( grunting )

337
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,498
The magnetic field
is collapsing.

338
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,999
The hull is depolarizing.

339
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,883
The fire suppression
system is out!

340
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,594
COMPUTER:<i> Warning!</i>
<i>Hull breach on Deck One.</i>

341
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,554
<i>Emergency force fields</i>
<i>inoperative.</i>

342
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,639
Everybody out!

343
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,140
Go! Go! Go!

344
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,478
Hurry, Captain!

345
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,521
I'm trying
to reroute emergency power

346
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,064
to the field emitters!

347
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,319
Captain!

348
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,946
I can seal this breach!

349
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,206
Captain, let's go!

350
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,344
Captain?

351
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,306
Ensign Kim,
scan the Bridge.

352
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,975
I just saw myself
cross the Bridge

353
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,602
and enter that turbolift.

354
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:04,315
It was very faint--
almost like a ghost image,

355
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,109
and I looked like hell.

356
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,611
Captain, there was

357
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,822
a minor spatial fluctuation
on the Bridge,

358
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,573
but it was only there
for a millisecond.

359
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,701
Bridge to Engineering.

360
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,076
B'Elanna, how long
until we can use

361
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,161
the main sensor array?

362
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,412
<i>Another three hours.</i>

363
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,664
We're only
about halfway through

364
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,081
the proton burst
procedure.

365
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,458
See if you can speed up
the process.

366
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,085
We need the sensors
as soon as possible.

367
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,128
Understood.

368
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,632
Mr. Kim,
modify a tricorder

369
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,634
to scan for spatial anomalies.

370
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,595
Go over every centimeter
of this Bridge.

371
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,930
Examine the sensor logs

372
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,598
from our trip through
the plasma drift.

373
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,018
Look for
anything unusual.

374
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,227
I'll be in Sick Bay.

375
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,687
Aye, Captain.

376
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,609
Good news, Ensign.

377
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,278
Our baby
is perfectly healthy.

378
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,532
There's no sign of
any inter-species abnormalities.

379
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,034
"Our" baby?

380
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,493
A figure of speech.

381
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,703
I am, in part,
responsible

382
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,665
for bringing her
into the world.

383
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,459
You may hold her now.

384
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,045
Hello, there.

385
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,426
Congratulations, Samantha.

386
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,304
She's adorable.

387
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,098
Have you thought
of a name?

388
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,266
Not yet.

389
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,309
I really thought
it would be a boy.

390
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,520
Let me know
as soon as you decide.

391
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,940
I've been making
a blanket for her.

392
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,275
All that's missing
is an initial.

393
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,031
Get some rest.

394
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,077
How's our<i> other</i> 
patient doing?

395
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,079
She's still
unconscious.

396
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,622
I ran
a microcellular scan.

397
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,498
We're almost identical
in every way.

398
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,625
Almost?

399
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,334
There's a slight
phase shift

400
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,669
in their DNA.

401
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,713
Do you have
any theory

402
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,965
about where
she came from?

403
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,051
Not yet, but I intend
to find out.

404
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,176
Can you wake her?

405
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,177
I believe so.

406
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,013
Good...

407
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,389
because I think
she's going to have

408
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,182
an interesting
story to tell.

409
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,482
I was running
through the corridor

410
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,901
with my medkit...

411
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,360
Deck 15...

412
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:20,952
And then, suddenly,
I felt dizzy,

413
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,162
and my vision
started to blur.

414
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,626
After that,
I don't remember anything,

415
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,044
until you woke me up
just now.

416
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,880
You were found
unconscious down on Deck 15

417
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,590
holding a medkit.

418
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,927
We also found this
lying next to you.

419
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,805
It's a piece
of damaged conduit.

420
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,516
Our analysis shows
it's from<i> Voyager.</i>

421
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,684
Deck 15,

422
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,021
Section 29-Alpha,
Bulkhead 052.

423
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,148
But there's no damage
to Deck 15

424
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,732
or anywhere else
on this ship.

425
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,485
There was massive damage
to Deck 15.

426
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,112
The evidence
would seem to suggest

427
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,114
that you've come
from a different ship,

428
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,784
a different<i> Voyager.</i>

429
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,038
We did find
a spatial rift on Deck 15.

430
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,081
It's possible that
it somehow connects us

431
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,666
to this other<i> Voyager.</i>

432
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,417
If you're right,
where is the other ship?

433
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,419
A parallel universe?
Another dimension?

434
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,629
Another point in time?

435
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,255
I'm not sure.

436
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,717
Almost everything about
the<i> Voyager</i> Kes described

437
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,510
is identical to ours.

438
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,681
We've had similar experiences,
similar personal histories.

439
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,975
We both entered a plasma cloud

440
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,518
to avoid the Vidiians.

441
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,937
Both of our engines stalled
as we left the cloud,

442
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,398
which caused both of our
antimatter supplies to drain,

443
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,026
and then we both decided
to keep our engines running

444
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:38,529
by emitting proton bursts.

445
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,906
But after that,

446
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,366
our experiences
diverged.

447
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,329
We started emitting
the proton bursts.

448
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,706
They didn't.

449
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,000
Our ship was being damaged
by proton bursts.

450
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,002
We couldn't figure out
where they were coming from.

451
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,129
That's more
than a coincidence.

452
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,630
Janeway to Engineering.

453
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,965
B'Elanna,
I want you to stop

454
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,425
the proton bursts
immediately.

455
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,843
But if we stop now,
the power levels will...

456
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,012
<i>I'll explain later,</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

457
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,056
Understood.

458
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,808
I don't know how,

459
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,937
but there's
another<i> Voyager</i> out there,

460
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,397
and I intend to find it.

461
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,983
<i>( gentle</i>
<i>dramatic theme playing )</i>

462
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,070
We analyzed the sensor logs

463
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,780
from our trip
through the plasma cloud.

464
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,489
We couldn't find
anything unusual,

465
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,784
until we ran
a quantum-level analysis.

466
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,869
Remember that subspace
turbulence we hit

467
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,746
just before
we left the cloud?
JANEWAY: Yes.

468
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,206
Well, watch what happens.

469
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,919
KIM:
At first, we thought it was

470
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,503
a sensor aberration,

471
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,756
but they were in perfect
calibration at the time.

472
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,591
B'ELANNA: So I ran
a multispectral analysis

473
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,051
on the subspace
turbulence.

474
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,552
It was more
than just turbulence.

475
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,638
It was some kind
of divergence field.

476
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,098
And the moment
we passed through it,

477
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,058
all of our sensor
readings doubled.

478
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,270
Mass, energy output,
bio-signatures-- everything.

479
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,521
Every particle
of matter on the ship

480
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,108
seems to have been
duplicated in that instant.

481
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,318
So where's
the other ship?

482
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,653
As strange
as it sounds, Captain,

483
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,029
according
to these readings,

484
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,073
another<i> Voyager</i> is
right here, right now,

485
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,659
occupying the same point
in space/time that we are.

486
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,247
Quantum theorists
at Kent State University

487
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,333
ran an experiment in which
a single particle of matter

488
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,503
was duplicated using the
divergence of subspace fields--

489
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,255
a spatial scission.

490
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,091
If the same forces were at work
inside the plasma cloud,

491
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,217
they may have duplicated

492
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,718
every particle
of matter on<i> Voyager.</i>

493
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,014
Matter--
but not antimatter.

494
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,182
Captain?

495
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,724
In that Kent
State experiment,

496
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,643
they were able
to duplicate normal matter,

497
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,353
but when they tried to duplicate
antimatter particles,

498
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,106
the experiment failed.

499
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,067
So the antimatter
on the ships

500
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,610
<i>wasn't</i> duplicated.

501
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,114
Both engines have been
trying to draw power

502
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,283
from a single source
of antimatter.

503
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,243
Like Siamese twins
linked at the chest

504
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,037
with only one heart.

505
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,330
So what do we do?

506
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,707
I don't know.

507
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,042
But whatever it is,
we're going to have

508
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,793
to coordinate it
with the other ship.

509
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,420
Start working on a way
to communicate with them.
Right.

510
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,588
The only link we know of

511
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,050
is on Deck 15--
the spatial rift.

512
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,094
We're going to need a way
to send Kes back through safely.

513
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,348
We could rig a portable
phase discriminator.

514
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,141
It might protect her
from the spatial transition.

515
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,642
Get on it.

516
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,396
When can I start
breast feeding?

517
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,690
Right away.

518
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,317
However, I should
forewarn you

519
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,611
that her incisors will erupt
within three to four weeks.

520
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:28,406
Since your skin lacks
the scales of a Ktarian,

521
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,910
we'll have
to discuss alternatives.

522
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,328
When can I
take her home?

523
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,997
In 24 hours. I want
to observe the infant

524
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,833
to make sure
there's no more damage
to her cell membranes.

525
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,168
You're welcome
to stay the night

526
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,294
so you may be with her.

527
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,296
I'd like that.
( baby crying )

528
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,049
Hey. What's
the matter?

529
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,433
ZIMMERMAN:<i> Congratulations,</i>
<i>Ensign, it's a girl.</i>

530
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,894
<i>I've stabilized</i>
<i>my imaging array</i>

531
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,645
<i>but it could go out</i>
<i>at any time.</i>

532
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,398
KES:<i> Doctor, her cell membranes</i>
<i>are losing cohesion.</i>

533
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,358
ZIMMERMAN:<i> Try remodulating</i>
<i>the osmotic pressure.</i>

534
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,401
KES:<i> No effect.</i>

535
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,194
<i>Again.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

536
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,196
WILDMAN:<i> My baby, she's going</i>
<i>to die, isn't she?</i>

537
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,989
ZIMMERMAN:
<i>I'm sorry, Ensign.</i> 
( monitor flatlining )

538
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,991
<i>She's going to die,</i>
<i>isn't she?</i>

539
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,410
(<i> baby crying</i> )

540
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,994
ZIMMERMAN ( faintly ):
Kes...

541
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,496
Kes?

542
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,416
( gasps )

543
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,334
Are you all right?

544
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,378
Yes.

545
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,339
It's just...
the baby's crying.

546
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,800
It was like
a bad memory.

547
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,343
What do you mean?

548
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,762
On my<i> Voyager,</i>

549
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,349
during the delivery,
there were complications.

550
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,893
We performed
a fetal transport.

551
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,477
The same thing
happened here.

552
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,981
The transport
was successful.

553
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,401
On my ship, the medical
systems were heavily damaged.

554
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,154
The osmotic pressure
therapy didn't work.

555
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,406
The baby died.

556
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,408
I'm sorry to hear that,

557
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,452
but try to understand,
it wasn't your fault.

558
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,412
The situation was
out of your control.

559
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,706
Doctor, I've got
to get back to my ship.

560
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,336
They need my help.
The captain's
working on it, Kes.

561
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,545
In the meantime,

562
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,214
try to get some rest.

563
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:13,012
Besides, I'm sure your<i> Voyager</i>
is also equipped

564
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,390
with a proficient
emergency medical hologram.

565
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,897
It's a little harder
to establish

566
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,732
a com link
than I thought, Captain.

567
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,651
The molecular signature
of the second<i> Voyager</i>

568
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,403
is slightly out of phase
with our own.

569
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,323
I can't get visual,
audio-- nothing.

570
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,658
Have you tried remodulating
the com-frequency carrier?

571
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,785
Five times on 47
different frequencies.

572
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,496
There has to be a way.

573
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:41,499
If they were recalibrating
their carrier wave
at the same time--

574
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,376
so we could match
phase variants--

575
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,461
would that allow us
to connect?

576
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,754
I think so, but in order
to get them to do that

577
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,756
we'd have to communicate
with them first.

578
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,467
It's the chicken
and the egg.

579
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,970
Maybe we need something
a little more primitive.

580
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,182
Is there a signal we could
emit on all subspace bands

581
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,808
just to get their attention?

582
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,229
A rotating band pulse
might do it,

583
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,438
but it wouldn't
be much more

584
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,731
than a shrill whistle.

585
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,733
That might be enough,
give it a try.

586
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,443
All right, Captain.

587
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,903
All of the ship's
command functions

588
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,863
have been rerouted
to Main Engineering.

589
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,448
JANEWAY: Welcome
to the new Bridge.

590
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,699
Now, let's see about...

591
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,285
( shrill tone )
What's that?

592
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,578
TORRES: I don't know.
It's some kind of com-emissions

593
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,540
coming through
all subspace bands.

594
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,541
Coming from where?

595
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,500
Good question.

596
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,085
I can't tell,

597
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,753
but it's got
a Federation signature.

598
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,588
Try recalibrating our frequency
carrier to match it.

599
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,635
( shrill tone )
That's it.

600
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,887
They recalibrated

601
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,556
and locked onto
our phase variant.

602
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,349
What kind of communication
can we establish?

603
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,351
Not much at this point.
We can use

604
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,186
the emergency encryption code
for a short message.

605
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,603
Not more
than five seconds.

606
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,897
That should be enough.

607
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,651
JANEWAY 1:
That's the emergency code.

608
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,695
Run it through an
alpha-numeric sequencer.

609
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,868
TORRES:
I think someone's telling us

610
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:04,748
to lock onto a frequency
of 12 gigahertz.

611
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,792
Do it.

612
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,798
I'll try to clear it up.

613
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,558
<i>Captain,</i>
<i>this isn't an illusion.</i>

614
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,184
<i>What you're seeing is real,</i>

615
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,396
<i>but it's going to take</i>
<i>some explaining.</i>

616
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,773
There are two<i> Voyagers</i>
and two crews?

617
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,942
That's what I was told.

618
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,193
Could this possibly be

619
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,903
some kind
of subterfuge, Captain?

620
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,363
An alien deception?

621
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,073
That woman,
whoever she is,

622
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,492
had very specific
knowledge

623
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:40,658
of what happened here--

624
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,952
the damage from
the proton bursts,

625
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,787
Wildman's baby,
Kes disappearing.

626
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,539
She even knew that when
I was 12 years old,

627
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,249
I walked home
in a thunderstorm

628
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,543
over seven kilometers
because I lost
a tennis match.

629
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,462
And her explanation
of how the ships

630
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:54,672
were duplicated--
certainly plausible.

631
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,674
If it is true,
what do we do about it?

632
00:27:56,674 --> 00:28:00,804
My... counterpart
has suggested we try

633
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,389
to merge the two ships.

634
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,849
Recreate the subspace
divergence field

635
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,809
we passed through
and then depolarize it.

636
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,561
Both ships would have
to send out

637
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,397
a massive resonance pulse
from their deflector dishes

638
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,565
at exactly the same time.

639
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,192
They may be able
to do that,

640
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,486
but we barely
have enough power
for life support.

641
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:19,072
How can we get enough to send
an energy pulse of that size?

642
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,782
We could evacuate
all the crew to this deck

643
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,784
and cut off life support
everywhere else.

644
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,287
Then we could divert
all power to the deflector dish.

645
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,913
B'Elanna, reestablish
the com link

646
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,415
with the other ship.

647
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,671
<i>This is Janeway.</i>
<i>What have you decided?</i>

648
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,342
Captain, we think we can
channel enough energy

649
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,553
to our deflector dish
to try the merging process.

650
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,513
<i>Good.</i>
<i>When can we start?</i>

651
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,097
We'll need
at least 15 minutes

652
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,474
to make
our preparations.

653
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,850
<i>We'll be ready.</i>

654
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,101
And Captain...

655
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,147
we'll only have enough
power to try this once.

656
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,066
<i>I understand.</i>

657
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,778
Chakotay, Tuvok--
begin the evacuation process.

658
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,322
Aye, Captain.

659
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,948
I'll tell the doctor know
he'll have to rely

660
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,492
on his backup
power supply.

661
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:10,874
( beeping )

662
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,338
( sighs )

663
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,964
We're ready, Captain.

664
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,510
<i>We're standing by,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

665
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,345
<i>I think you should</i>
<i>take the lead</i>

666
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,347
<i>in this operation</i>
<i>since you may have</i>
<i>to make allowances</i>

667
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,349
<i>for your weakened</i>
<i>power systems.</i>

668
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,559
Acknowledged.

669
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,560
Lieutenant Torres,

670
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,645
and Lieutenant Torres.

671
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,146
Charge the
deflector dishes.

672
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,816
Deflector dish charging.

673
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,652
Capacitance levels
are rising.

674
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,279
Sixty percent.

675
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,780
Eighty-five percent.

676
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,156
Ninety-eight percent...

677
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:47,327
We're ready to create
the subspace divergence field.

678
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,788
Initiating.

679
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,957
Power flow nominal,
Captain.

680
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,251
Synchronize
computer event timing.

681
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,464
Ready to release
depolarization pulse

682
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,716
on my mark.

683
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,841
Now.

684
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,770
The pulses have been
emitted, Captain.

685
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,521
The fields are starting
to depolarize.

686
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,855
But we aren't merging.

687
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,942
In fact, we're going
further out of phase!

688
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,236
Increase power
to the deflector dish.

689
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,782
I can't! Too much
plasma backflow.

690
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,158
If we keep this up,

691
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,660
we're going to lose
our antimatter connection.

692
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,744
We'll both be destroyed.

693
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:29,911
Abort!

694
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,622
Aborting resonance pulse.

695
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,123
What went wrong?
I'm not sure.

696
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,083
I think the plasma flow
became too turbulent.

697
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,669
The divergence fields
were so chaotic

698
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,630
we couldn't complete
the merging.

699
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,131
We've lost
the com link as well.

700
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,882
( gasps )

701
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,219
Captain,
the antimatter leak?

702
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,680
It's becoming
a hemorrhage.

703
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,222
If we don't start
the proton bursts,

704
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,475
we'll be completely
drained in 30 minutes.

705
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,602
The lives of both crews
are at stake here.

706
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,853
I can't make
unilateral decisions

707
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,563
that might affect
that other ship.

708
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,939
Janeway to Kim.

709
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,150
Is the spatial rift
still stable?

710
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,443
I think so, Captain,

711
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,861
and I've rigged
a phase discriminator.

712
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,738
Kes should be able
to go back safely.

713
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,699
Rig another one,
Ensign.

714
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,074
I'm going with her.

715
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:14,873
This should protect you

716
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,625
from the spatial
transition.

717
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,127
Keep trying to reestablish
a com-link between the ships.

718
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,046
I will. But remember,
we have fewer than 30 minutes

719
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,339
of antimatter left.

720
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,257
Whatever you do over
there, do it fast.

721
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,010
Understood.
Are you ready?
Yes.

722
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,644
It's gotten worse here.

723
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,145
Command Control
is in Main Engineering.

724
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,313
Let's go.

725
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:43,235
I don't know how else to stop
the antimatter drain,

726
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,903
except with proton bursts.

727
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,488
We can't do that.

728
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,491
We'd damage the other ship
just like this one.

729
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,785
Think, people.
We need options.

730
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,912
I agree, Captain.

731
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,290
And I think we need to talk.

732
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,843
By my estimates,
our antimatter supply

733
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,803
will run out in less than
half an hour.

734
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,013
The attempt
to merge our ships

735
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,432
is throwing us further
out of phase.

736
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,683
The quantum cohesion

737
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,186
on both<i> Voyagers</i>
is breaking down.

738
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,814
Just like the original
Kent State experiment.

739
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,525
The duplicate atoms couldn't
occupy the same point

740
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,193
in space/time
for very long before...

741
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,280
Mutual
annihilation.

742
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,823
What are our options?

743
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,575
Let's try
a different tack.

744
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,745
Instead of trying
to merge the two ships,

745
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,329
let's try
to separate them.

746
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,583
Maybe we could divide
the antimatter between us.

747
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,834
I'm afraid not.

748
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,335
We've been studying
that theory.

749
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,129
B'Elanna tells me that
any attempt to disrupt

750
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,090
the antimatter supply
would destroy us all.

751
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,551
What about evacuating
your crew to my ship?

752
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,887
It might get crowded,
but we could manage.

753
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,722
We've been studying
that theory,

754
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,057
and<i> my</i> B'Elanna
tells me that

755
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,644
sending any more than five
to ten people through the rift

756
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,520
would radically alter
the atomic balance

757
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,939
of the two<i> Voyagers.</i>

758
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,565
We'd both be destroyed.

759
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,988
Captain, I think you should
return to your ship

760
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,407
and run a metallurgical
analysis.

761
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:16,244
Find out the precise phase
modulation of your hull.

762
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,788
I'll do the same here.

763
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:18,997
Maybe we can find a way

764
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,541
to realign
the phase displacement.

765
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,043
You're going
to self-destruct your ship.

766
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,212
What makes you say that?

767
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,382
Because that's what I would do
if your<i> Voyager</i> were intact

768
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,092
and my<i> Voyager</i> 
were crippled.

769
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,595
My crew wounded or dead.

770
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,598
I'd sacrifice my ship
so that yours could survive.

771
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,100
Then I'm glad we agree.

772
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,811
Go back to your ship.

773
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,187
I didn't say I agree.

774
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,063
I said I understand.

775
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,441
I'm not willing to let you
make that sacrifice yet.

776
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,026
We haven't explored
all the options.

777
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,903
Yes, we have,
and we both know it.

778
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,113
This is my ship
and my decision.

779
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,615
Captain,
I'm not going to let--

780
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,908
I've made my decision.

781
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,451
Please don't make me
call security

782
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,370
and have you escorted
off my ship because...

783
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,415
( quiet )
you know I'll do it.

784
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,418
All right,
I'll go back,

785
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,753
but give me 15 minutes

786
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,171
to come up
with another solution.

787
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,340
After that,
it's your decision.

788
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,012
15 minutes.

789
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,388
Good luck.

790
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,058
To both of us.

791
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,941
Okay, I've managed
to reestablish a com-link

792
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,067
with the other<i> Voyager.</i>

793
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,443
Hail them.

794
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,822
Captain,
I've got an idea.

795
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,365
Actually, it was yours.

796
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,075
It might be possible
to realign

797
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,368
the phase displacement
between us.

798
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,953
<i>We don't have time</i>
<i>to try it.</i>

799
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,788
<i>My plan is the one</i>
<i>that's going to work.</i>

800
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,081
<i>It's time that</i>
<i>we both accept that.</i>

801
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,249
( alarm wailing )

802
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,500
We've got
a perimeter alert.

803
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,919
A vessel
is approaching

804
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,254
bearing 005 mark 318.

805
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,048
They've just
dropped out of warp.

806
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,382
Can you identify them?

807
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:53,800
They're
Vidiian, sir.

808
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,012
Red Alert.

809
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,431
Shields.
Still off-line.

810
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,267
Captain, we're picking up
a Vidiian ship heading this way.

811
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,102
Can you see them too?
Yes.

812
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,437
Do you have any weapons?

813
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,230
Stand by.
Tuvok?

814
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,982
Negative, Captain.
We had to reroute power

815
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,817
to compensate
for the antimatter loss.

816
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,902
It would take several hours

817
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,236
to bring weapons
back on-line.

818
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,618
VIDIIAN COMMANDER:
What is it?

819
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,244
Their ship seems
to be trapped

820
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,246
in some sort of
spatial flux.

821
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,790
Have they detected us?

822
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,042
Yes, but they can't
raise their shields.

823
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,253
And it appears that whatever is
happening to them has disrupted

824
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,714
their weapons systems.

825
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,132
Load a hyper-thermic charge.

826
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,637
Fire.

827
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,556
Captain, they have fired
an energy weapon.

828
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,058
All hands, brace for impact.

829
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,268
Damage Control teams
stand by.

830
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,397
( all grunting )

831
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,777
What happened?
They couldn't have missed.

832
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,487
Maybe they hit
the other<i> Voyager.</i>

833
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,571
Hail them.

834
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,990
I've lost the com-link again.

835
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,116
Try to get it back.

836
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,044
We have destroyed
their weapons array.

837
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,964
Maneuver us to within
grappling range.

838
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:25,642
They are cutting an access route
through the hull on Deck 5.

839
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,605
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

840
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,124
( both grunt )

841
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,214
( sensor beeping )

842
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,674
Vulcan, male.

843
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,634
Phaser blast damaged
the right kidney,

844
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,260
but the other organs
are healthy.

845
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,637
Begin with them.

846
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,231
( grunts )

847
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,365
( sensor beeping )

848
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,953
I've erected an emergency
force field around Sick Bay--

849
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,163
that should hold them off
for a while.

850
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,706
I won't let them
take my baby.

851
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:30,999
It's going to be
all right, Ensign.

852
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,167
Give her to me
and I'll hide her

853
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,376
inside an access port.

854
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,003
If they do break in,
it's unlikely

855
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,338
they'll look for
anyone there.
( baby crying )

856
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,715
Trust me, Ensign.

857
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,926
I won't let anyone
touch our baby.

858
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,219
Mama will see you soon.

859
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,180
Lieutenant, give me a hand.
Move this.

860
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,598
We're going to have
to cut away

861
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,183
the internal circuitry
to make room...

862
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,309
( phaser blast )
Vidiians.

863
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,811
They're using some kind
of disrupter

864
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,354
to break down the force field.

865
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,151
The force field's down.

866
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,531
JANEWAY:
Commander...

867
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,866
They've got everything
below Deck 5,

868
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,243
and I don't know
how much longer

869
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,786
we can keep them away
from the Bridge.

870
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,247
Mr. Kim, how many Vidiians
are there on this ship?

871
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,290
347 and more
are boarding.

872
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,666
We're outnumbered
two to one.

873
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,877
I've got an incoming
subspace signal.

874
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,420
It's from
the other<i> Voyager.</i>

875
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,880
They must have reestablished
the com-link.

876
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,965
Onscreen.

877
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,094
<i>Captain, this com-link</i>
<i>might not last much longer.</i>

878
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,511
<i>What's happening</i>
<i>over there?</i>

879
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,097
We've been boarded.

880
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,975
The Vidiians are on the verge
of taking over our ship.

881
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,517
Are they on yours?

882
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,187
<i>No. We don't think</i>
<i>they can detect our ship.</i>

883
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,940
<i>Captain, we can have</i>
<i>a security detachment</i>

884
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,650
<i>cross the spatial rift</i>
<i>and board your ship</i>

885
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,110
<i>within five minutes.</i>

886
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,989
No. If we do that,

887
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,617
the Vidiians might become aware
of your<i> Voyager.</i>

888
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,494
That would put
both ships at risk.

889
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,371
<i>We can't just stand by</i>
<i>and let you all be killed.</i>

890
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,834
I'm not about
to let that happen.

891
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,919
I'll destroy this ship.

892
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:01,589
<i>I don't suppose there's any way</i>
<i>I can change your mind.</i>

893
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,925
<i>I know how stubborn</i>
<i>you can be.</i>

894
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,927
True.

895
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,221
But there is something else
I can do for you.

896
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,682
I'm going to send Harry Kim
through the rift

897
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,517
with Ensign
Wildman's baby.

898
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,811
Somehow
it seems only fair.

899
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,272
<i>We'll be waiting</i>
<i>for them.</i>

900
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,691
Just make me
a promise, Kathryn.

901
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,442
Get your crew home.

902
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,279
<i>I will.</i>

903
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,363
<i>I will.</i>

904
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,870
Harry, you've
got five minutes.

905
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,996
Get the baby.

906
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,497
But Captain--
Move it, Ensign!

907
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,623
That's an order!

908
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,549
Computer, initiate
the self-destruct sequence.

909
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,011
Authorization
Janeway Pi 1-1-0.

910
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:52,182
Set at five minutes
and mute voice warnings.

911
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,771
Enable.

912
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,650
COMPUTER:<i> Warning. Self-destruct</i>
<i>sequence has been initiated.</i>

913
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,404
<i>Warp core overload</i>
<i>in four minutes, 55 seconds.</i>

914
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,366
<i>There will be</i>
<i>no further audio warnings.</i>

915
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,617
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

916
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,415
Ocampa, female.

917
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,958
The organs are healthy.

918
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,669
She has an extremely high rate
of tissue regeneration.

919
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,213
Extract her pelvic ridge.

920
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,381
We'll analyze
the bone marrow

921
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:25,590
for phage resistance.

922
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,344
VIDIIAN 1:
The others are human.

923
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,804
My scans indicate
their pancreatic tissues

924
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,806
are well-suited
for transplant.

925
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,350
VIDIIAN 2: Begin the
extraction procedure.

926
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,310
( gasps )
Shh.
( whimpers )

927
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,357
This one--
a female human.

928
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,733
She's recently
given birth.

929
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,235
Are you certain?

930
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,779
Yes. Her hemo-uterine
levels are far above normal.

931
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,697
Where's the infant?

932
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,991
Set your bio-pro
to maximum. Find it.

933
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,160
( whimpering )
Shh... Shh, shh.

934
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,582
( Vidiian voices speaking
indistinctly nearby )

935
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,297
( both Vidiians
speaking indistinctly )

936
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,018
( grunts )

937
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,065
No!

938
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,443
Ensign Kim,
is that you?

939
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:27,735
Doc!

940
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,195
Am I glad
to see you.

941
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,905
Have we retaken the ship?

942
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,866
No. Actually, the captain's put
the ship on self-destruct.

943
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,285
She ordered me
to take the baby

944
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:36,661
and go
to the other<i> Voyager.</i>

945
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,330
Well, I guess you'd
better hurry then.

946
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,374
Goodbye, Doc.

947
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:44,002
Ensign, tell
my counterpart

948
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,212
that I've corrected
all signs of hemocythemia.

949
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,464
He'll know what
that means.

950
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:48,589
Will do.

951
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,475
Hello.

952
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:01,144
I'm Captain
Kathryn Janeway.

953
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,687
Welcome to the Bridge.

954
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,023
Commander!

955
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,150
( beeping )

956
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,372
( B'Elanna sighs )

957
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,789
It's about time.

958
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,041
Tuvok to Janeway.

959
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,377
Ensign Kim has made it
through the rift.

960
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,836
With the infant.

961
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,546
Acknowledged.

962
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,132
Captain,
the Vidiian ship

963
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,177
has been destroyed.

964
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,678
So has the other<i> Voyager.</i>

965
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:42,185
<i>( building dramatic score ) </i>

966
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:46,272
JANEWAY:<i> Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49548.7.</i>

967
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,359
<i>There are no signs</i>
<i>of any pursuing Vidiian vessels</i>

968
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,694
<i>and we have resumed</i>
<i>a course toward home.</i>

969
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,573
Repair efforts
are underway.

970
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,033
Lieutenant
Torres estimates

971
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,326
we'll be able
to return to the Bridge

972
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,577
within three days.

973
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,287
Good. I'm not sure
how much longer

974
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,663
B'Elanna can tolerate

975
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,790
my standing over
her shoulder in Engineering.

976
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,543
Hm...

977
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:09,670
Tuvok, is there something
on your mind?

978
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,507
I am curious, Captain.

979
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,925
Before the
Vidiians attacked,

980
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,134
when you were
in disagreement

981
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,219
with the other captain...

982
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,470
Would I have given
the order

983
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,680
to self-destruct our ship?

984
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,726
I've gone over that moment
a thousand times in my mind.

985
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,397
The truth is, yes,
I would've given the order.

986
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:30,858
But I will admit,
there was a part of me

987
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,985
that could see
her point of view.

988
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,156
One could say that
you are both the doubter

989
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,491
and the doubted.

990
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,701
I do not envy
the paradox of logic

991
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,454
you were faced with
in that situation.

992
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,580
Neither did I.

993
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,624
And neither did she.

994
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,553
( cooing )

995
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,889
Thank you.

996
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,475
Thank you so much.

997
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,310
You're welcome.

998
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,395
But you should also
thank the doctor.

999
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,563
It was his counterpart

1000
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,607
who saved her
from the Vidiians.

1001
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,233
I'm not surprised.

1002
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,445
I am programmed to be heroic
when the need arises.

1003
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,490
By the way, Ensign,
this other doctor,

1004
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,949
did he have a name?

1005
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,076
I really didn't
have time to ask.

1006
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,369
Am I allowed
to go back

1007
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,163
to my temporary
Bridge now, Doctor?

1008
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,664
By all means.

1009
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,500
( baby cooing )

1010
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,882
It's good to have
you back, Ensign.

1011
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:37,883
Thank you.

1012
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,051
I think.

1013
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,386
Something wrong?

1014
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,720
I'm not sure.

1015
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,390
I mean, this isn't
really my ship.

1016
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,058
And you're not really
my captain,

1017
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,936
and yet you are,
and there's no difference,

1018
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,606
but I know
there's a difference.

1019
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,065
Or is there?

1020
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,067
It's all
a little weird.

1021
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,070
Mr. Kim, we're
Starfleet officers.

1022
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,989
Weird is part
of the job.
