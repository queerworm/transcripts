00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,253
NARRATOR:
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek Voyager...

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,464
<i>I'm Captain Braxton of</i>
<i>the Federation timeship Aeon.</i>

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,925
<i>I've come from</i>
<i>29th-century Earth.</i>

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,009
Why are you firing at us?

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,761
<i>Your vessel</i>
<i>is responsible</i>

6
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,805
<i>for a disaster in my century,</i>
<i>a temporal explosion</i>

7
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,849
<i>that will destroy</i>
<i>all of Earth's solar system.</i>

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,017
<i>I've come back in time</i>
<i>to prevent that occurrence.</i>

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>My mission is your destruction.</i>

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,023
We seem to be caught in some
kind of graviton distortion.

11
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,359
We're being pulled in too.

12
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:35,327
I find it hard to believe
a ship from the 29th century

13
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,621
could've landed on this beach
without being noticed.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,039
That ship shouldn't be here.

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,958
It belongs to another century.

16
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,417
We have to take it back.

17
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,461
No one else knows
there's something up there.

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,005
We've got to tell somebody
about this.

19
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:46,964
We've got to call NASA.

20
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,465
She's a security risk.

21
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,551
Go to Griffith,
get the data

22
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,760
get rid of her.

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,637
What the hell did you do
to my computer?

24
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,015
It is screwed up.
The hard drive is wiped.

25
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,265
Get down!

26
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,686
Starling is using

27
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,104
29th century technology
against us.

28
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,439
We may not be able
to keep up with him.

29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,154
Yes.

30
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,322
He's accessing
our main computer.

31
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,115
Get us back into orbit--

32
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,452
STARLING:
<i>Captain Janeway,</i>
<i>you're from the 24th century,</i>

33
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,289
and here, all this time I
thought you were from the 29th.

34
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,292
Looks like I have
the home-field advantage.

35
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,545
NARRATOR:
<i>And now the conclusion.</i>

36
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,426
Let me guess.

37
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,053
Someone broke into
the van last night

38
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,094
while I was sleeping

39
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,638
tried to snatch
the stereo.

40
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,807
You bravely
fought them off

41
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,684
and now you're
repairing the damage.

42
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,101
That's exactly what happened.

43
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,562
My hero.

44
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,737
What's it like...

45
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,239
life as a spy I mean?

46
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,240
Classified.

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,953
Oh, right. I forgot.

48
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,955
But you said
"secret agent"

49
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,456
and nobody says
secret agent

50
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,749
and you do that a lot.

51
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,668
You get things
not quite right...

52
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,837
like you don't
belong here.

53
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,422
Rain, you're fantasizing.

54
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,092
And you're insulting
my intelligence.

55
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:16,095
Yesterday afternoon,
I picked up a UFO in orbit.

56
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,055
Today, my life
is completely out of control,

57
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:23,393
so don't think
I'm too stupid to notice.

58
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,645
I apologize.

59
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,521
Accepted.

60
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,442
Would you also accept that there
are lives at stake here?

61
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,027
The more you keep
asking me questions,

62
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,447
the more difficult
you make things for everybody.

63
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,533
I'll try.

64
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,666
So...

65
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,042
why'd you become an astronomer?

66
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,838
My brother.

67
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,381
Had a telescope,
a little refractor.

68
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,967
You could barely see

69
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,136
in the tree house next door
actually, but...

70
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,138
it was enough.

71
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:02,808
It was enough to see
the rings of Saturn.

72
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,476
I remember...
I remember I used

73
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,769
to think that they looked like

74
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:11,150
jewels
from pirate's treasure.

75
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,403
All I ever wanted since then
was to...

76
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,906
reach up and touch them.

77
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,116
TUVOK:
Good morning.

78
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,995
Agent Tuvok,
what's up?

79
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,788
Breakfast is up.

80
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,081
Have you made
any progress?

81
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,248
I think so.

82
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,751
Chili burritos,
footlong hot dogs,

83
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,294
and Goliath Gulps.

84
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,754
This is not
a breakfast.

85
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,673
This is an afternoon
at Dodger Stadium.

86
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,299
And that is
a non sequitur.

87
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,926
Would you please hand me
a burrito?

88
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,929
Everything you guys do
is just a little bit off.

89
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,229
These things
are kind of crude.

90
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,815
So much for sending
a locator signal.

91
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,776
There is another option.

92
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,445
The radio dish
at the observatory.

93
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,530
We could use the same setup.

94
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,948
ROBINSON:
The same setup

95
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,744
that I used to send that message
to your...

96
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,747
whatever it is up in orbit.

97
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,207
We will require your assistance.

98
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,250
No kidding.

99
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,418
Well?

100
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,212
Not on an empty stomach.

101
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,290
CHAKOTAY:
Starling downloaded
nearly 20 percent

102
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,125
of our computer core
while we were trying to beam

103
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,918
the timeship
out of his building.

104
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,213
TORRES:
I'm replacing those programs
as quickly as I can,

105
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,090
but some of it
isn't retrievable.

106
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,842
Like the doctor.

107
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,636
There's literally nothing
left of him. He's just gone.

108
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,306
Unfortunately, the doctor
is only one of our problems.

109
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,058
Our weapons are off-line.

110
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,685
Tuvok and Paris are missing
somewhere in Los Angeles,

111
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,479
and we've confirmed
Captain Braxton's hypothesis.

112
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,358
If Starling does attempt
a flight to the future,

113
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,484
it will most likely
end in disaster.

114
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:46,948
Captain, I've analyzed
Braxton's schematic.

115
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,409
The temporal technology
is incredibly complex.

116
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,330
TORRES:
No matter how much a genius
this Starling might be,

117
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,208
he is not a trained pilot
from the 29th century.

118
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,667
Without the exact calibration,

119
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,587
that ship will rip
the time-space continuum apart.

120
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,382
The instant he jumps
to the 29th century,

121
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,008
there won't be
a 29th century--

122
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,343
not for Earth, anyway.

123
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,178
The entire solar system
will be destroyed.

124
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,679
I want that timeship.

125
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,099
Long-range transporters are
still down.

126
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,142
We'd have to drop
out of orbit again.

127
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,395
Captain, I strongly
recommend against that.

128
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,734
The more legitimate
news organizations

129
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,612
have apparently decided that
the<i> Voyager</i> image is fraudulent.

130
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,406
However, I've also
been monitoring

131
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,867
more official channels
and the United States Military

132
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,203
is taking things just
a little more seriously.

133
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,538
If we risk another pass
through the lower atmosphere

134
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,333
there's a chance of getting
intercepted by the air force.

135
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,460
If we can't get
to the ship...

136
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,337
maybe we can get to the man.
Torres, I want you to--

137
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,715
WOMAN:
<i>Captain Janeway,</i>
<i>I'm receiving a transmission</i>

138
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,509
<i>from Lieutenant Tuvok,</i>
<i>audio only.</i>

139
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,429
Mr. Tuvok, report.

140
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,931
TUVOK:
<i>Lieutenant Paris and I are</i>
<i>at the Griffith Observatory</i>

141
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,391
<i>in the Hollywood Hills.</i>

142
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,184
We have modified
the satellite dish transmitter

143
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,477
to carry and receive

144
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,231
<i>Voyager</i> communication
frequencies.

145
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,024
I regret
the bad connection.

146
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,985
It's quite all right, Mr. Tuvok.
What's happened?

147
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,321
We have become associated
with a young woman

148
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,489
employed at the astronomical
laboratory.

149
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,159
It was she who sent
the message to<i> Voyager</i>

150
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,534
but her lab is
under the supervision

151
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,620
<i>of an individual named</i>
<i>Henry Starling.</i>

152
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,580
Oh, we've met Mr. Starling.

153
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,833
He has the timeship,
and he's the one

154
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,752
who will cause the disaster
in the 29th century.

155
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,630
Then it would seem,
we must find a way to stop him.

156
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,132
Tell me about this young woman.

157
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,009
Can we trust her?

158
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,428
She and Lieutenant Paris
appear to be bonding

159
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,056
on a cross-cultural level.

160
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,724
I would have to say yes.

161
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,395
Ask if she'd be willing
to help us.

162
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,297
How's it going?

163
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,508
I find your interest
in my well-being

164
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,759
to be less than genuine.

165
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,803
Try to be
a little more grateful, doc.

166
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,515
The schematics I downloaded
from your ship

167
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,099
indicated you were stuck
in the sick bay

168
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,476
24 hours a day.

169
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,855
I recently suffered
a severe program loss

170
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,482
and I'm still
in the process

171
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,359
of retrieving
my memory files

172
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,152
but apparently,
on a few occasions

173
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,821
I have been projected
into other locations.

174
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,158
Undoubtedly you are using
a similar procedure.

175
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,868
My holographic simulator.

176
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:41,289
We use it to test
our new microchip designs.

177
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,501
I projected you through
the emitters in the office.

178
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,254
Your program
really isn't very sophisticated.

179
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,256
That is a matter of opinion.

180
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,092
Now, would you please return me
to my vessel?

181
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,052
Can't do that. Not yet.

182
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,263
I've a few questions
I want answered.

183
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,515
If you have need
of medical expertise

184
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,226
I would refer you
to a more local physician.

185
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,643
All Captain Janeway's talk

186
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,688
about a disaster
I caused is just smoke.

187
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,816
You came here
to steal my timeship.

188
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,069
That is simply not the case.

189
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,821
That timeship is
from the 29th century--

190
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,949
technology 500 years
more advanced

191
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,284
than anything you've got.

192
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,160
You'd love to get
your hands on it.

193
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,288
You figured I'd
be an easy target--

194
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,873
some backwards 20th century
Neanderthal who doesn't know

195
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,709
what he's got, but you found
out otherwise, didn't you?

196
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,714
A paranoid response indicative
of bipolar personality disorder.

197
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,425
If my history is accurate

198
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,302
Southern California
in the late 20th century

199
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,596
had no shortage
of psychotherapists--

200
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,140
competent and otherwise.

201
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,183
I suggest you find one.

202
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,894
Now...

203
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,688
return me to<i> Voyager.</i>

204
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,276
I've learned
your weapons are damaged,

205
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,069
your ship's teleporter
is half-shot,

206
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,656
but I didn't get
all the personnel files.

207
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,117
I have to know my enemy.

208
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,745
Give me Captain Janeway's
psychological profile.

209
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,624
I'm a doctor, not a data base.

210
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,544
I'd say you're a little bit
of both. Start talking.

211
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,464
Or suffer the consequences?

212
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,591
Hardly.

213
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,551
I'm a hologram.

214
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,095
I experience neither pain...

215
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,264
nor fear of death.

216
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,807
You have no means
of coercing me.

217
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,935
(<i> gasps</i> )

218
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,978
Pain.

219
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,691
It's an interesting sensation,
isn't it?

220
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,235
I...

221
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,070
I never realized...

222
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,031
how unpleasant it could be?

223
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,032
(<i> tapping keys</i> )

224
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,993
(<i> gasps</i> )

225
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,079
This is what burning feels like.

226
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,456
For a human to experience

227
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,082
what you're going through
right now

228
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,877
he'd have to be on fire.

229
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,086
(<i> tapping keys</i> )

230
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,214
(<i> groans</i> )

231
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,174
(<i> panting</i> )

232
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,592
How?

233
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,595
By reconfiguring
your tactile response sensors.

234
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,430
Easy as proverbial pie.

235
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,233
Feeling more cooperative?

236
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:18,238
(<i> intercom beeps</i> )

237
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,491
I'm in a meeting, Dave.

238
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,992
Put her through.

239
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,996
Mr. Starling...
oh, my god, I'm so scared.

240
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,915
They're going to find me.
I don't know what to do.

241
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,251
Take it easy, Rain.
Everything's okay.

242
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,337
Everything's not okay. People
are shooting at me.

243
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,506
They're going to find me.
I don't know what to do.

244
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,757
Yes, you do.
You're going to jump in a cab

245
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,553
and come to my office.
You'll be safe here.

246
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,970
No, they'll find me.

247
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,472
<i>Where are you?</i>

248
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,766
Metro Plaza...
by the fountain.

249
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,102
Please come get me.

250
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,311
Please.

251
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,312
I'll send somebody.

252
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,689
No!

253
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,692
You.

254
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,404
I'm really scared.

255
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,697
I'll be right there.

256
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,203
He bought it...
sort of.

257
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,329
What do you mean?

258
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,706
I don't know.

259
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,124
His voice sounded
a little suspicious.

260
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,754
Pack a lunch, Doc.

261
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,796
We're going for a walk.

262
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,507
In case you
have forgotten

263
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,384
I can only appear
in a room equipped

264
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,470
with a holographic
projection system.

265
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,972
In short,
I'm going nowhere.

266
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,079
Interferometric dispersion
is on-line.

267
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,332
That should take care
of any radar detection.

268
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,209
And I've configured
the shields

269
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,586
to disguise
our visual profile.

270
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,714
Unless somebody gets
right on top of us

271
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,842
we should look like
a small 20th century aircraft.

272
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,219
The transporters
are on-line.

273
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,764
We should be within range
in about ten minutes.

274
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:54,268
You can see the entire
baja peninsula.

275
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,854
I'd forgotten how
beautiful the view is

276
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,772
from this altitude.

277
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,234
I never thought
I'd see it again.

278
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,028
You trained as a pilot
in North America, didn't you?

279
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,113
That's right.
My first year at the Academy.

280
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,699
Then I went to Venus
for a couple of months

281
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,493
to learn how to handle
atmospheric storms

282
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,370
and then I dodged asteroids

283
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,955
for a semester
in the belt.

284
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,251
It sounds like you had more fun
at the Academy than I did.

285
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,295
I remember dodging
a few punches in the lab.

286
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:26,801
Only you, B'elanna, could start
a brawl in astro-theory 101.

287
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,136
I guess I was just
a little more...

288
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,097
enthusiastic...

289
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,265
in those days.

290
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,349
I guess so.

291
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,312
Chakotay...

292
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,148
what if we're stuck here?

293
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,277
What if we can't
find a way back?

294
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,070
There are still
a few isolated places

295
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,988
left in this century.

296
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,449
We'd have to keep low profiles.

297
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,034
We'd have to get jobs.

298
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,995
I've thought about pursuing
archaeology full-time.

299
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,415
Maybe I could teach at
a university or work on

300
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,459
one of the important digs
in Central America.

301
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,419
There was still a lot of
important discoveries to be made

302
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,671
in this century.

303
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,674
I could win a Nobel Prize.

304
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,342
So much for a low profile.

305
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,264
What about you?

306
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:18,227
"Highly qualified Klingon
seeks position as engineer."

307
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,188
I'd hire you in a second.

308
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,565
Let's start our descent.

309
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,779
Approach course laid in.

310
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,864
Full power to thrusters.

311
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,866
Watch out for birds.

312
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,668
(<i> beeping</i> )

313
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,632
Paris to Chakotay.

314
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,967
Go ahead.

315
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,010
<i>Starling's arrived,</i>
<i>with the doctor.</i>

316
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,471
What? How is that possible?

317
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,932
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Are you within range?</i>

318
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,099
Almost.

319
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,394
Another two minutes.

320
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,855
I don't know, Doc...

321
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,231
you were awfully quiet
in the ride over here.

322
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm not programmed
to make small talk.

323
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,777
Maybe just a
little bit anxious

324
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,321
about being out
in the real world.

325
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,198
It's just another
environment to me.

326
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,537
Mind your manners, Doc.

327
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,000
If your shipmates
start any trouble

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,250
you'll be holo-dust.

329
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,676
I've triangulated the position
of the van, Chakotay.

330
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,012
Stand by for
tricorder uplink.

331
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,597
You'll be able to lock on
the moment starling is inside.

332
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,395
Mr. Starling,
I'm so glad you're here.

333
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,855
Tell your new
friends to come out

334
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,690
or their colleague
here is going to die.

335
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,025
What are you
talking about?

336
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,278
Let's go.

337
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,822
Oh, my van is this way.

338
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,365
We're taking my car.

339
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,579
Well... I left my stuff
in the van.

340
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,374
I'll send somebody
back for it.

341
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,542
Is there a problem?

342
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,585
No.

343
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,423
He's heading in
the wrong direction.

344
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,716
They're not going
to the van.

345
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,300
Mr. Chakotay,
there is a problem.

346
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,761
(<i> beeping</i> )

347
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,355
That... that's the guy
that tried to kill me.

348
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,276
No, he was trying
to rescue you.

349
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,611
Where are we going?

350
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,071
To my office.
You'll be safe there.

351
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,822
Office, right.

352
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,207
We're recalibrating
Starling's position.

353
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:50,088
You're going to have
to take him out of his own car.

354
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,591
There may not be
enough time.

355
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,217
I've determined
the coordinates.

356
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,886
Now, Chakotay!

357
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,805
We've got a lock
on Starling's position.

358
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,306
Energizing.

359
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,976
Dunbar, take
the surface streets.

360
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,895
The 101's a nightmare
this time of...

361
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,105
oh, my god!

362
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,690
Run!

363
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,984
(<i> beeping</i> )

364
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:17,615
Pattern buffer's overloading.
He's activated some device.

365
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,283
It's interfering
with the transport.

366
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,124
(<i> grunting</i> )

367
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,253
(<i> groaning</i> )

368
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,338
Hmm!

369
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,218
(<i> moaning</i> )

370
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,144
(<i> engine starts</i> )

371
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,486
Oh!

372
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,238
Are you all right?

373
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,323
I guess so.

374
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,324
Doctor?

375
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,534
I've been equipped

376
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,703
with an autonomous,
self-sustaining

377
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,579
mobile holo-emitter.

378
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:11,460
In short, I am footloose
and fancy-free.

379
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,380
Chakotay:
Captain we've got Starling
in our transporter buffers

380
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,174
but we can't rematerialize him.

381
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,551
The interference is disrupting
computer pathways.

382
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,346
Aft thrusters are down.

383
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,639
Captain, we're close enough

384
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,391
to use the short-range
transporter.

385
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,809
Janeway to transporter room one.

386
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,935
Lock directly
on to the shuttle's

387
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:28,895
pattern buffers and energize.

388
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,312
WOMAN:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

389
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,606
Chakotay, we're taking over
from here.

390
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,941
Mr. Kim, let's go.

391
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,279
The buffers are purged.

392
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,616
They've taken Starling
off our hands.

393
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,993
We're losing altitude.

394
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,752
He's got what looks like
a tricorder.

395
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:59,341
It's putting out some kind of
interference signal.

396
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:05,598
KIM:
I'm isolating it
and suppressing the amplitude.

397
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,849
Got him.

398
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,561
Damn it.

399
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,855
Janeway to sick bay.

400
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,149
Medical emergency
in transporter room one.

401
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,400
KES:
<i>Acknowledged, Captain.</i>

402
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,949
Propulsion is off-line.

403
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,409
<i>Voyager,</i> we're going down.

404
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,657
(<i> door opens</i> )

405
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,019
Where are we?

406
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,356
This one looks
like an Indian...

407
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,608
and that one...

408
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,111
I don't know what
her story is.

409
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,365
What's that thing on her head?

410
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,291
(<i> growling</i> )

411
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,500
(<i> laughing</i> )

412
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,253
Careful, butch.

413
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,297
She looks like a fighter.

414
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,548
Who are you?

415
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,675
You first.

416
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,553
Are you spying
on us... chief?

417
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,138
(<i> chuckles</i> )

418
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:14,268
No.
Just passing by.

419
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,313
In your new
stealth plane?

420
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,481
Who sent you?

421
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,525
Nobody sent us.

422
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,028
We had engine trouble.

423
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,031
I don't believe her. They're
wearing military uniforms,

424
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,824
flying a secret plane.

425
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,993
They're coming for us.

426
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,996
"U.S.S." equals
federal government.

427
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:37,041
The federal government
is the beast.

428
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,752
We are not from the beast.

429
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,379
Just take us to our plane.

430
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,255
Shut up!

431
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,049
(<i> Groans</i> )

432
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,466
That'll be all!

433
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,634
Call for reinforcements.

434
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,024
It's going to be a long day.

435
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,284
ROBINSON:
I've gone out with guys

436
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,576
who've disappeared
into thin air

437
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,911
on the first date.

438
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,205
I assume she is speaking
figuratively.

439
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,000
But I have never
actually seen it happen.

440
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,420
And you , Mr. Leisure suit!

441
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,879
There's a name
I hadn't considered.

442
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,216
That guy punched
you a bunch of times.

443
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:32,012
You should have a black eye
or a swollen lip a broken nose.

444
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,222
Try to relax.

445
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:37,101
You appear to be...
hallucinating.

446
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,936
Oh, is that what I am?

447
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,729
I'm hallucinating.

448
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,441
Rain, I'm sorry you got
dragged into all this.

449
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,319
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

450
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,694
Tuvok here.

451
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,405
Tuvok, we've got Starling

452
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,824
but we've lost contact
with Chakotay and Torres.

453
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,742
Their shuttle went down
over Arizona.

454
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,619
Mr. Kim is transmitting
the coordinates

455
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,829
to your tricorder.

456
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:57,913
I want you to find them.

457
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,914
Aye, captain.

458
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,999
Tuvok out.

459
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,213
Mr. Starling
is under control.

460
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,048
I suggest you return
to Chronowerx

461
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,549
and continue
the business there.

462
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,845
The doctor and I must
make our way to Arizona.

463
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,517
He suffered minor
synaptic stress

464
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,686
during the extended transport

465
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,854
enough to cause
unconsciousness

466
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,314
but not any permanent damage.

467
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,898
Can you bring him
out of it?

468
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,941
Yes, Captain.

469
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:36,452
Welcome
to the 24th century.

470
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,829
I took the precaution
of removing your tricorder.

471
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,289
That's what it's called,
by the way.

472
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,707
It didn't work.

473
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,583
It should have blocked
your ship's teleporter.

474
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,793
It works perfectly.

475
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,170
You just don't know
how to use it.

476
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,047
Give me some credit, captain.

477
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,424
I did pretty well
for a primitive.

478
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,218
Well, that's all over now.

479
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,844
I've won

480
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,138
so disable the force field
around Chronowerx.

481
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,015
I want that timeship.

482
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,976
You're in no position to be
making any demands, Captain.

483
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,186
On the contrary.

484
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,104
What are you going to do--
shoot me?

485
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,106
The thought has crossed my mind.

486
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,900
Well, it wouldn't
get you anything.

487
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,443
I've rigged the timeship.

488
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,777
If you try to
teleport it again

489
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,488
if you even go near it

490
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,990
Los Angeles will look like
the face of the moon.

491
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,244
You'd destroy
an entire city?

492
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,661
You don't care
about the future,

493
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,205
you don't care
about the present.

494
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,956
Does anything
matter to you, Mr. Starling?

495
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,084
The betterment of mankind.

496
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,460
It doesn't look like that.

497
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,586
Why do you think I want
to go to the future?

498
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,465
A vacation?

499
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,176
To get more technology.

500
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,387
That's why you're launching
the timeship.

501
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:40,598
I've cannibalized the ship
itself as much as I can.

502
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,269
There's nothing left to base
a commercial product on.

503
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,813
And the future is just waiting
to be exploited.

504
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,357
You just don't get it, do you?

505
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,901
I created the micro-computer
revolution.

506
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,571
Using technology
you never should have had.

507
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,115
Irrelevant. My products
benefit the entire world.

508
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,491
Without me, there would be

509
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,494
no laptops, no internet,
no bar-code readers.

510
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,581
What's good for Chronowerx
is good for everybody.

511
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:06,666
I can't stop now. One trip
to the 29th century,

512
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,877
and I can bring back
enough technology

513
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,339
to start the next
ten computer revolutions.

514
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,509
If you even attempt
to travel to the future,

515
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,220
you risk creating
a temporal explosion

516
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,264
that could cost
billions of lives,

517
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,848
including your own.

518
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,185
I'm willing to take that risk.

519
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:29,356
In my time... Mr. Starling,

520
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:33,277
no human being would dream
of endangering the future

521
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,653
to gain advantage
in the present.

522
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,281
Captain, the future
you're talking about--

523
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,283
that's 900 years from now.

524
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,201
I can't be concerned
about that right now.

525
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,203
I have a company to run

526
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,205
and a whole world full
of people waiting for me

527
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,166
to make their lives
a little bit better.

528
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,089
Computer,
reactivate force field.

529
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,140
Chronowerx stock
is about to crash.

530
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,666
There are two forces
at work in the world--

531
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,292
the drive
toward collectivity

532
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,252
and the drive
toward individuality.

533
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,464
You are the former
and I am the latter.

534
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,090
We told you

535
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,426
we are not from
the United States government

536
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,886
and we are not...

537
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,346
The beast has many heads

538
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,223
and I'm looking at two of them.

539
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,516
Listen, I used to think

540
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,560
violence could be
the solution to a problem

541
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,269
but it's not true.

542
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,604
You are no patriot.

543
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,649
I was a freedom fighter...
so I thought.

544
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,150
That gun will
get you nowhere.

545
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,194
Porter!

546
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,613
They're coming--
the Feds.

547
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,156
How many?

548
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,783
Three cars and a chopper
two miles up Edgemont road.

549
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,910
This is it, men.

550
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,545
Get into position
behind the house.

551
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,213
Butchie and me
will take these two.

552
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,638
Looks like
your friends out there

553
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,348
still believe in violence.

554
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,974
Too bad for you.

555
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,026
ROBINSON:
Let's recap.
U.F.O. in orbit,

556
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:42,573
laser pistols,
people vanishing.

557
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,408
I've seen every episode
of<i> Mission: Impossible.</i>

558
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,076
You're not secret agents.

559
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,495
I told you,
I can't talk about it.

560
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,830
Well, you can't keep
a girl from hypothesizing.

561
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,708
I'm a scientist.

562
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,168
I'm thinking...

563
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,337
I'm thinking
alternate dimension.

564
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,299
I'm thinking...
<i>Close Encounter.</i>

565
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,676
Whatever.

566
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:07,473
Talk about a motley crew--
we have the doctor,

567
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,975
a guy with the worst,
worst taste in clothing

568
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,893
I've ever seen.

569
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,439
Tuvok-- what a freakasaurus.

570
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,400
Has the guy ever
cracked a smile?

571
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,194
Not that I can recall.

572
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,615
And you-- Tom Paris.

573
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,200
Hmm, sexy...

574
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,911
in a howdy doody
sort of way.

575
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,414
Pretty goofy,
although sometimes

576
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:36,209
I think you're the smartest man
I've ever met.

577
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:40,255
All this running around you do--
your mission--

578
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,923
you're so dedicated, you know?

579
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,594
Like you care about something
more than just your own...

580
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,764
little life.

581
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,265
Is that so unusual?

582
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:53,977
Yeah.

583
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,565
Whoa.

584
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,941
I missed the turn.

585
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,787
COMPUTER:
<i>Sat-com 47-- activating.</i>

586
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,503
Engage Starling location sweep.

587
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,171
Sweep underway.

588
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,271
TUVOK:
<i>We're in Arizona.</i>
<i>Chakotay and Torres</i>

589
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,273
<i>are 30 kilometers</i>
<i>northeast of Phoenix.</i>

590
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,275
Good. Get to them
as soon as you can.

591
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,944
KIM:
Captain, there's
a transport in progress.

592
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,029
What?

593
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,534
Starling's gone.
He's beamed to the surface.

594
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,661
He's got some kind
of satellite in orbit.

595
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,120
It sent a
transporter signal

596
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,622
through our shields
like they weren't there.

597
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,623
Where's Starling now?

598
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,667
Tracking the signal.

599
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,377
He's back at the
Chronowerx building.

600
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,179
Mr. Dunbar, good work.

601
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,682
I think it's time
to get out of here.

602
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,115
I guess this is good-bye.

603
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,450
Guess it is.

604
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,996
Listen... are you
busy tomorrow night?

605
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,708
'Cause, um...

606
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,295
you know,
we should hang together.

607
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,963
I can't.

608
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,090
Oh. Well,
what about this weekend?

609
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,550
Um...

610
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,804
You're married.

611
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,222
Absolutely not.

612
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,309
Just... very busy.

613
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,938
Oh... yeah, you got to
get back to Mars, right?

614
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,315
Hmm... Saturn.

615
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,024
That's perfect.

616
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,569
I told you
I always loved Saturn.

617
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,071
So, give me your phone number.

618
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,156
Rain...

619
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,659
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

620
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,078
Tachyon emissions.

621
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,584
They're moving the timeship.

622
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,087
Timeship?
What are you talking about?

623
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,633
You wouldn't mind hanging
with me for a while longer, huh?

624
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,554
MAN:
We want the aircraft

625
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,182
and the occupants
from the aircraft.

626
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,518
Get off my land!

627
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,727
What are they going
to do when they find

628
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,937
a half-Klingon in here?

629
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,647
MAN:
Who the hell
are you two?!

630
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,357
TUVOK:
Please stand aside, officer.

631
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,733
MAN:
I'm warning both of you!

632
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,319
(<i> phasers blasting</i> )

633
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,487
They've got lasers!

634
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,156
A black man
and some bald guy.

635
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,407
(<i> phaser fire and gunfire</i>
<i>outside</i> )

636
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,284
(<i> phaser fire only</i> )

637
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,536
(<i> approaching footsteps</i> )

638
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,013
God in heaven help us.

639
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:19,307
Divine intervention is...
unlikely.

640
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,100
(<i> groans</i> )

641
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,645
(<i> groans</i> )

642
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:32,111
(<i> sighs</i> )

643
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,363
Tuvok's at the shuttle.

644
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,740
He's starting repairs.

645
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,074
Doctor, how..?

646
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,409
It's a long story,
commander.

647
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,995
Suffice it to say
I'm making a house call.

648
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,427
It's Paris again. On audio.

649
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,095
Status report, Tom.

650
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,805
<i>We just turned off</i>
<i>the main highway</i>

651
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,890
<i>onto a desert road.</i>

652
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,350
Hi. This is
Rain Robinson.

653
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,810
You don't know me,
but the point is

654
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,812
there is zero traffic
on this road.

655
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,480
<i>They're going to know</i>
<i>we're following them.</i>

656
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,191
Thank you, Ms. Robinson.
I'll keep that in mind.

657
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,693
Tom, we've scanned the area.

658
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,361
There appears to be
a small landing field,

659
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,280
about ten kilometers
ahead of you.

660
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,823
It could be
his launch site.

661
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,284
<i>Stay on him.</i>
<i>Our weapons are still off-line</i>

662
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,954
and Torres hasn't finished
repairing the shuttle.

663
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,413
It might all be up to you.

664
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,164
I'll do my best.
Paris out.

665
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,638
Look out!

666
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,353
(<i> tires squealing</i> )

667
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,565
Get in behind him.

668
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,775
What?

669
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:52,985
Right off his bumper.

670
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,498
A little closer.

671
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,540
Forget it.

672
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,792
One more meter!

673
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,209
Just shoot!

674
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,808
(<i> engine sputtering</i> )

675
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,685
It's flooded.
Give it a second.

676
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,811
Well, do you
think we got him?

677
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,979
I think so.

678
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,230
(<i> sighs</i> )

679
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,316
(<i> rumbling</i> )

680
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,993
Come on.

681
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,870
( van engine sputtering )

682
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,954
Jump!

683
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,926
Chakotay to Paris.

684
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,971
What's your status?

685
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,222
We're fine.

686
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,892
Good shooting.

687
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,145
Wasn't there supposed to be
a timeship in that truck?

688
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,150
I'm scanning the debris.

689
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,568
It was a temporal
transponder

690
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,403
set to give off
tachyon signals.

691
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,238
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

692
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,489
The timeship's
not here, Captain.

693
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,991
It was a ruse.

694
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,077
Starling's going to launch
from a different site.

695
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,209
Activate hyper-impulse.

696
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:35,795
COMPUTER:
Hyper-impulse drive engaged.

697
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,880
Let's do it.

698
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,423
Command confirmed.

699
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,812
The timeship is entering
the upper ionosphere.

700
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,522
Track his course.

701
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,399
Janeway to shuttlecraft,
return to<i> Voyager</i> immediately.

702
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,151
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Acknowledged, Captain.</i>

703
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,403
Phasers are still off-line.

704
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,656
I've armed the photon torpedoes,
but we still can't fire them.

705
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,492
The launch activation sequencers
aren't responding.

706
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,536
I think I can reroute
fire command through the helm.

707
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,706
There's no time.
Take the bridge, Mr. Kim.

708
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,166
Should be second nature
to you by now.

709
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,542
Captain...

710
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,878
Open the access portal
to torpedo bay one.

711
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,589
I'm going in there to
reconfigure for manual launch.

712
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,091
Captain, with
the activation sequencers down,

713
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,759
you'd have to launch
from inside the tube.

714
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,427
It's too dangerous.
The plasma exhaust--

715
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,804
You have your orders.

716
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,479
I've got the transporters
back on-line.

717
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,649
Mr. Paris, stand by.
We're bringing you aboard.

718
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,733
Acknowledged.

719
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,738
Your spaceship's waiting.

720
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:51,329
I've never met anyone
quite like you...

721
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,456
and I don't think
I ever will.

722
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,751
Same here.

723
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,090
Say hi to Saturn for me.

724
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,551
I will.

725
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,912
Initiate temporal inversion.

726
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,331
Initiating.

727
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,379
KIM:
<i>Bridge to Janeway.</i>

728
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,630
The shuttle is back on board.

729
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,549
Good. I'm nearly there.

730
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,843
Captain, the timeship
has jumped to warp one.

731
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,553
Go to warp.
We can't lose him now.

732
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,267
Welcome to the bridge,
Doctor.

733
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,102
Thank you.
It's a pleasure to be here.

734
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,396
CHAKOTAY:
Status?

735
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,647
The captain's in
torpedo tube one.

736
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,233
She's preparing
for a manual launch.

737
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:04,610
CHAKOTAY:
Doctor, get
down there.

738
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,239
How exactly do I get
to torpedo tube one?

739
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,489
Ensign Kaplan,
go with him.

740
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,615
KAPLAN:
Aye, sir.

741
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,290
The timeship is powering
its temporal field generator.

742
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,376
Starling will be able to open
a rift within seconds.

743
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,961
KIM:
Commander, the field
he's creating-- it's unstable.

744
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,588
TORRES:
If he enters
the rift like this

745
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,299
that timeship will create
a temporal explosion.

746
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,010
Events are occurring just
as Captain Braxton predicted.

747
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,637
The disaster may well
be inevitable.

748
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,139
Fate, Tuvok?

749
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,599
I won't accept that.

750
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,059
Close to within ten kilometers.

751
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,269
We'll ram him if we have to.

752
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,188
Aye, sir.

753
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:44,734
Temporal core has reached
cascade potential.

754
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:49,447
Penetration point
at 96-mark-047.

755
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,829
Janeway to bridge.

756
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,497
I've reconfigured
for manual launch.

757
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,958
<i>Arm the torpedo.</i>

758
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,459
Torpedo armed.

759
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,004
Lock on target.

760
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,005
Locked on.

761
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,048
Hail starling.

762
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,259
KIM:
On screen.

763
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,802
CHAKOTAY:
This is<i> Voyager.</i>

764
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,137
Pull away from the rift.

765
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,221
<i>Or what?</i>

766
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,556
<i>Your weapons are down, friend.</i>

767
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,435
<i>See you... sometime.</i>

768
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,813
Chakotay to Janeway.

769
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,648
Captain,
we have no other choice.

770
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,401
KIM:
He's entering
the rift.

771
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,653
Fire!

772
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,113
(<i> groans</i> )

773
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,868
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

774
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,120
Uh-oh.

775
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,754
Captain, I insist you
come to sick bay.

776
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,840
There'll be plenty of
time for that, Doctor.

777
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,012
The bridge is
yours, Captain.

778
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,389
Is there a chance in hell
we can reopen that rift?

779
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,600
Captain, the rift is opening.

780
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,103
KIM:
There's something
coming out.

781
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,896
It's the timeship.
Let's see it.

782
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,981
TUVOK:
We're being hailed.

783
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:08,485
On screen.

784
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,069
Captain Braxton?

785
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,154
<i>Do you know me?</i>

786
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,156
Yes, unfortunately.

787
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,325
You tried to destroy our ship
in the 24th century

788
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,701
and the next time we saw you

789
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,413
you were an old man,
homeless in 1996.

790
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,290
<i>I never experienced</i>
<i>that time-line.</i>

791
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,083
Then what are you doing here?

792
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,751
<i>In my century,</i>
<i>we can scan time--</i>

793
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,171
<i>much as you use sensors</i>
<i>to scan space.</i>

794
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,965
<i>The temporal integrity</i>
<i>commission detected your vessel</i>

795
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,384
<i>over 20th century Earth.</i>

796
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,010
<i>I was sent</i>
<i>to correct that anomaly.</i>

797
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,388
<i>Prepare to follow me back</i>
<i>into the rift.</i>

798
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,681
<i>I'm returning you</i>
<i>to your own time</i>

799
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,726
<i>to your previous coordinates</i>
<i>in the delta quadrant.</i>

800
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,102
Captain...

801
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,480
we've been trying
to get home to Earth

802
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,023
for the last two years.

803
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,150
Can you return us
to our century,

804
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,861
but keep us here
in the Alpha quadrant?

805
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,531
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Temporal prime directive.</i>

806
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,075
<i>I'm afraid you're on your own.</i>
<i>Braxton out.</i>

807
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,541
The timeship
is re-entering the rift.

808
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,174
Mr. Paris...

809
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,803
follow him in.

810
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,474
Aye, captain.

811
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:32,693
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 50312.5.</i>

812
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,946
<i>We are again</i>
<i>in the Delta quadrant</i>

813
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,281
<i>at the exact time and place</i>

814
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,949
<i>we first encountered</i>
<i>the timeship.</i>

815
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,867
<i>I've resumed a course</i>
<i>for Earth,</i>

816
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,413
<i>and I've ordered the crew</i>
<i>to the mess hall for a toast.</i>

817
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,789
<i>( laughter )</i>

818
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,707
ALL:
Cheers.

819
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,666
Hear, hear.

820
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,709
To the future.

821
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,002
Hear, hear.

822
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,005
How long will you be
out and about, doctor?

823
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,425
If you're referring
to my newfound mobility

824
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,842
that is entirely
up to me.

825
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,303
I'm still trying to
figure out exactly

826
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,638
how the doctor's
autonomous emitter works,

827
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,265
but it looks like
downloading him

828
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:03,600
back into the ship's computer

829
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,435
isn't going to be much
of a problem.

830
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,562
Apparently the reverse
is also true.

831
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,772
I will be able to make use
of the emitter as casually

832
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,690
as you might
slip on a pair of shoes.

833
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,569
It's a little more
involved than that.

834
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,572
You know, Kes,
now that I'll be to-and-fro,

835
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,949
your responsibilities
in sick bay will increase.

836
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,410
I'm up to the challenge,
doctor, but what about you?

837
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,537
There's going to be more to
your life now than sick bay.

838
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,331
Nothing I can't handle.

839
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,916
You know, captain, I've always
wanted a little more privacy.

840
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,586
Perhaps under the circumstances,
my own quarters.

841
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,421
One step at a time, doctor.

842
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,383
You should have seen it

843
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,635
when the parking
enforcement officer

844
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:39,885
came over to the van.

845
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,514
Tuvok tried to use
pure Vulcan logic

846
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,140
to talk her out of
giving us a citation.

847
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,183
Did it work?

848
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,601
Of course not.

849
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,811
Given Mr. Paris'
alleged familiarity

850
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,396
with 20th-century America,

851
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:54,317
it is a wonder we survived
the experience at all.

852
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,110
Tuvok...

853
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,989
has anyone ever told you
you're a real freakasaurus?
