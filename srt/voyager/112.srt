1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:06,131
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48693.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>We've altered course</i>
<i>to investigate</i>

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,803
<i>some unusually intense</i>
<i>photonic activity</i>

4
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,930
<i>in a nearby protostar.</i>

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,056
<i>Lieutenant Torres and I</i>
<i>are beaming aboard samples</i>

6
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,017
<i>for further analysis.</i>

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,396
Containment field is active.
We're ready for transport.

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,731
Energize.

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,110
That's strange.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,821
Both containers
should have been filled.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,699
Here's the problem.

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,659
A slight breach
in the annular confinement beam.

13
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,661
I'm aborting transport.

14
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,538
Okay, let's try
that again.

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,039
Energizing.

16
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,752
All right.

17
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,838
I'll get a complete
phase spectrum analysis

18
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,381
on this as soon as possible.

19
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,842
If this photonic matter
works as well as I think,

20
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,301
it could boost
the efficiency

21
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,052
of our power converters
15 percent.

22
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,221
I'd say more like 20.

23
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,514
How long will it
take to finish

24
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,682
the preliminary
analysis?

25
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,977
Um, six hours, maybe more.

26
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,688
I'd like to get it
sooner than that.

27
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,065
I believe Ensign Kim
is off duty.

28
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,400
Could you use his help?

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,610
Can you convince him
to give up his free time?

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,404
I think I might
be able to.

31
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,280
Janeway to Kim.

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,532
That's odd.

33
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,325
Computer, locate Ensign Kim.

34
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,744
COMPUTER:
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

35
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,954
<i>Ensign Kim</i>
<i>is not aboard the ship.</i>

36
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,166
Sensor logs show no record

37
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,335
of any unauthorized
transporter activity,

38
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,504
and all shuttlecraft
are accounted for.

39
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,923
If Ensign Kim left the ship,

40
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,841
he did not do so by
conventional means.

41
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,510
His last shift ended
four hours ago,

42
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,887
and he was scheduled for time

43
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,555
on Holodeck 2
when he went off duty.

44
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,681
No one has seen him since.

45
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,766
Scan the holodeck.

46
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,521
What's the matter?

47
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,815
There is significant
interference in the holodeck.

48
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,276
I cannot obtain
a clear scan.

49
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,527
Is it a system
malfunction?

50
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,362
I do not believe so.

51
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,991
Commander.

52
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,373
TUVOK: The holodeck
is definitely active.

53
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,960
There appears to be
a program in progress.

54
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,628
Can you shut it down?

55
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,213
The manual overrides
are not functioning.

56
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,716
I cannot terminate the program.

57
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,135
All right,
let's go in.

58
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,000
( tricorders beeping )

59
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,761
( theme music playing )

60
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,824
Computer, identify program.

61
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,286
COMPUTER:
<i>The program in progress</i>
<i>is a holonovel based</i>

62
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,205
<i>on the epic Earth poem</i>
Beowulf.

63
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,249
<i>Beowulf?</i>

64
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:54,502
An ancient English epic
set in sixth century Denmark,

65
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,921
if I remember correctly.

66
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,006
It's about a hero
named Beowulf

67
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,675
who fights a creature
that's terrorizing a kingdom

68
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,552
and murdering its subjects.

69
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,973
Monsters and swordplay,
that sort of thing.

70
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,348
I'm not detecting
any life signs,

71
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,768
but there is still
considerable interference.

72
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,311
I can't determine
the source.

73
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,440
Speak as a friend

74
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,692
or stand challenged.

75
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,945
Computer, delete character.

76
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,659
The holodeck
command systems

77
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,368
must not be
functioning either.

78
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,748
We must also consider
the possibility

79
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,126
that the safety programs
are malfunctioning as well.

80
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,295
I'm am Freya,
shield-maiden,

81
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,130
daughter of King Hrothgar.

82
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,589
I hold this guard post

83
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,383
against any intruders
who would bear us harm.

84
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,718
So declare yourselves.

85
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,596
I will hear
your answer

86
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,765
before you march any further
through this land.

87
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,934
We have no desire
to trespass.

88
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,394
However, we are on
an urgent mission,

89
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,604
so if you would allow us
to continue,

90
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,064
we would
appreciate it.

91
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,150
What land do you call home?

92
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,486
Your faces tell me
you are not men of the Danes.

93
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,571
Are you...

94
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,033
kinsmen of Beowulf?

95
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,205
Yes. We are
Beowulf's kinsmen.

96
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,748
My name is Chakotay,
and this is Tuvok.

97
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,126
Have you seen Beowulf?

98
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,545
Yes.

99
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,755
He was like no other.

100
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,135
Hair straight and raven black,
eyes bright with fierce fire,

101
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,762
the burning gaze of a hero.

102
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,059
Grandiloquence
notwithstanding,

103
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,353
that would qualify
as a description of Mr. Kim.

104
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,395
How did you know
he was Beowulf?

105
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,439
This<i> is</i> Harry's
holonovel.

106
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,567
It'd make sense that
he'd be playing the hero.

107
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,569
She might be able
to help us figure out

108
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,737
what happened to him.

109
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,905
A reasonable assumption.

110
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,324
Your kinsman was
a truly noble warrior.

111
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,077
It is right you should
avenge his death.

112
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,789
Yes, but first,

113
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,959
we'd like to know more
about how Beowulf died.

114
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,794
Of course.

115
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,714
Come.
I will take you to the king.

116
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,593
Hail, Lord Hrothgar.

117
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,511
I bring new friends,

118
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,056
Chakotay and Tuvok,
kinsmen of Beowulf,

119
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,766
who come to avenge his death.

120
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,685
Greet them well.

121
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,772
I would bid you welcome
to my hall,

122
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,276
but the days of glad tidings
are gone from this place.

123
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,445
We grieve with you
for your kinsman.

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:30,450
We had hoped that a warrior
of Beowulf's strength and renown

125
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,578
would be able to deliver us
from our curse.

126
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,208
Could you tell us exactly
what happened to him?

127
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,876
He met with
the same fate

128
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,212
as did 30 of
our own warriors.

129
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,756
Grendel.

130
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,758
That's the monster
who's been attacking you.

131
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,510
Repelled by light and laughter,

132
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,554
the beast waits
until we slumber.

133
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,015
Then, bereft of remorse,

134
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,436
Grendel comes in murderous rage
to my hall

135
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,520
to take my people,

136
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,316
and there is nothing
anyone can do

137
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,318
to stop it.

138
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,903
If you are wise,

139
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,740
you will forego your vengeance
and return home.

140
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,910
Death lives here now.

141
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,162
My Lord is fatigued.

142
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,330
It is time to retire.

143
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,580
TUVOK:
We would like

144
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,582
more information
about Beowulf.

145
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,793
Would it be possible
to examine his body?

146
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,671
The body of
Beowulf is gone.

147
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,173
Dragged down to
Grendel's foul lair,

148
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,424
no doubt.

149
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,092
The beast leaves no traces.

150
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,885
Did anyone actually
see the battle?

151
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,181
No. Beowulf chose
to face Grendel alone.

152
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,767
Then I think we'd like to see
this Grendel for ourselves.

153
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,353
To what purpose?

154
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,356
To raise false hopes
in our king again

155
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,982
as did your kinsman?

156
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,359
Leave us alone
in our misery.

157
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,693
FREYA:
Unferth!

158
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,945
These men are our guests.

159
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,572
You will show them
the hospitality they deserve.

160
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,283
They deserve nothing!

161
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,953
If their Beowulf was truly
the champion he claimed to be,

162
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,957
then Grendel would be dead,
his head mounted on a spear.

163
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,503
Instead, we spend yet
another night in terror.

164
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,421
TUVOK:
If you would allow us

165
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,132
to assist you, perhaps we could
help alleviate your terror.

166
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,094
Your names mean nothing to me.

167
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,389
There are no songs of your deeds

168
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,433
nor stories of the battles
you have fought.

169
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,852
Who are you to believe
you can slay Grendel?

170
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,438
We have no intention
of slaying anyone.

171
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,357
We simply wish to examine
the creature.

172
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,067
( laughs )

173
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,653
Grendel might not wish
to be examined...

174
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,864
without a fight.

175
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,949
And if you would fight Grendel,

176
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,744
then you will first
prove your worth to me.

177
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,954
Defend yourselves.

178
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,833
You are able warriors.

179
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,086
You may stand sentry tonight.

180
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,261
You are brave men.

181
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,138
I hope to see you again,
fate permitting.

182
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,271
Chakotay to Janeway.

183
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,106
Go ahead.

184
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,192
<i>Captain, we haven't found</i>
<i>any definite signs of Harry,</i>

185
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,027
<i>but we've encountered</i>
<i>several holodeck characters</i>

186
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,530
<i>who claim to know</i>
<i>what happened to him.</i>

187
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,158
TUVOK:
<i>Mr. Kim was running a holonovel</i>
<i>based on the poem</i> Beowulf.

188
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,702
<i>According</i>
<i>to the holo-characters,</i>

189
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,788
<i>he attempted to battle</i>
<i>a creature of some kind</i>

190
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,290
<i>and was killed in the process.</i>

191
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,293
Killed?

192
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,253
Since the safety programs
are malfunctioning,

193
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,629
we must consider
the possibility.

194
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>But...</i>
<i>you haven't found a body?</i>

195
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,261
No. If we shut down the program,
we'd know if he's here or not.

196
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,596
Run a diagnostic

197
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,973
on the holodeck's
imaging control systems.

198
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,392
If they're not working,
try to repair them.

199
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,727
And relay your tricorder
scans to the Bridge.

200
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,729
I'd like to analyze
your readings.

201
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,190
CHAKOTAY:<i> Aye, Captain.</i>
<i>Chakotay out.</i>

202
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,694
The primary imaging matrix
should be here

203
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,405
behind this wooden panel.

204
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,325
I will attempt to locate
the auxiliary matrix.

205
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,871
This ancient Earth culture
seems fascinated with monsters.

206
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,625
Every culture
has its demons.

207
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,003
They embody the darkest emotions
of its people.

208
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,797
Giving them physical form
in heroic literature

209
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,634
is a way of exploring
those feelings.

210
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:19,137
The Vok'sha of Rakella Prime

211
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,890
believe that hate is a beast
which lives inside the stomach.

212
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,683
Their greatest
mythical hero

213
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,853
is a man who ate
stones for 23 days

214
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,981
to kill the beast,
and became a saint.

215
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,150
Such fables are necessary
only in cultures

216
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,111
which unduly emphasize
emotional behavior.

217
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,446
I would point out

218
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,615
there are no demons
in Vulcan literature.

219
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,660
That might account
for its popularity.

220
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,411
JANEWAY:
<i>Bridge to Chakotay.</i>

221
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,372
Chakotay here.

222
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,582
Commander, we've analyzed
your tricorder data.

223
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,545
A deep-level scan shows minute
quantities of photonic energy.

224
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,672
<i>How could it be</i>
<i>in the holodeck?</i>

225
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,923
We think it happened
when we beamed aboard

226
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,842
the samples
from the protostar.

227
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,303
There<i> was</i> a breach in
the annular confinement beam,

228
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,389
and photonic energy
must have leaked

229
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,224
into the transporter system.

230
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,142
And from there into
other ship systems as well.

231
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,144
We've already found some
in the replicators.

232
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,188
TUVOK:
<i>That raises an uncomfortable</i>
<i>possibility, Captain.</i>

233
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,024
If the holodeck's conversion
nodes were contaminated,

234
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,901
Ensign Kim may have
inadvertently undergone

235
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,195
the process
of matter conversion.

236
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,365
You're saying he might have
been converted into energy?

237
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,034
We have to consider it
a possibility.

238
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,374
After all, the holodecks
are basically an outgrowth

239
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,209
of transporter technology.

240
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,295
Changing energy into matter
and back again.

241
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,465
Every time a program is run.

242
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,008
Except it's not supposed
to convert people.

243
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,427
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Hold on, Captain.</i>

244
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,053
Something's coming.

245
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,762
( unearthly howling )

246
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,224
It is an object approximately
one meter in diameter.

247
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,018
I think Grendel may
be paying us a visit.

248
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,811
Captain, the
holo-characters told us

249
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,855
Kim was killed by Grendel.

250
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,567
An examination of this part of
the program might be advisable.

251
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,901
<i>Proceed.</i>

252
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,907
Captain, I'm picking up signs
of matter/energy conversion.

253
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,367
Emergency transport.

254
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,910
Get them out
of there now.

255
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,704
I can't get a lock.

256
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,039
( unearthly howling
intensifies )

257
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,463
Commander Chakotay, report.

258
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,881
Mr. Tuvok?

259
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,759
Captain, I've lost
their life signs.

260
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,093
They're gone.

261
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,856
TORRES:
This is a scan of the holodeck

262
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,610
just before we lost contact
with Chakotay and Tuvok.

263
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,528
The readings are pretty garbled,

264
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,030
but I'm still inclined to think
that there is a malfunction

265
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,492
in the holodeck's
matter conversion nodes.

266
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,786
Photonic energy leaking
into the subsystems

267
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,954
could certainly
damage the nodes,

268
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,457
and it might have created
a defect in the program

269
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,125
that occurs
when Grendel shows up.

270
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,835
A defect that dematerialized
our people.

271
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,672
I'm not willing
to accept the fact

272
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,675
that Harry and the others
are gone for good.

273
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,552
Their molecular patterns
might still be there.

274
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,014
And if they are, we might be
able to rematerialize them.

275
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:12,018
The only thing we can do is
go back into the holodeck.

276
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,562
Study this... energy surge.

277
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,980
Find out what
exactly happened.

278
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,190
Anyone who goes
back in there

279
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,483
might wind up
just like the others.

280
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,861
Maybe not anyone.

281
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,363
Me?

282
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,573
PARIS:
A hologram can't be
converted into energy.

283
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,949
It already<i> is</i> energy.

284
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,785
You're
the perfect choice.

285
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,871
How do you intend to transfer me
out of Sick Bay?

286
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,955
We'll have
to modify

287
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,873
your data stream
protocols

288
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,166
and imaging
systems,

289
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,459
but the fact that
you're going

290
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,711
to the holodeck
simplifies things.

291
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,878
The projection
systems

292
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,421
are already
in place there.

293
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,881
And we're going
to give you
complete control

294
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,175
over your magnetic
containment field.

295
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,010
You'll be able to
make yourself solid,

296
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,762
or let matter pass
through you at will.

297
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,805
Nothing on
the holodeck

298
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,930
will be able
to touch you--

299
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,349
unless you
want it to.

300
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,978
I see.

301
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,232
Think of this as your first
away mission, Doctor.

302
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,651
I can understand
your hesitation,

303
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,903
but there are three
lives at stake,

304
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,405
and you have
the best chance

305
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,114
of anyone on this ship
to save them.

306
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,993
Do you
understand that?

307
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,787
Yes.

308
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,539
Good.

309
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,833
Your job is to find
the photonic energy surge

310
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,042
and scan it closely.

311
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,878
We need all
the data we can get.

312
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,295
You'll have to interact

313
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,964
with the characters
in the holonovel,

314
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,676
so make sure you're familiar
with the Beowulf story.

315
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,553
Your circuit
modifications

316
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,555
will be finished
in three hours.

317
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,849
Yes, Captain.

318
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,274
( door opens, closes )

319
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,612
Computer,

320
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,907
access full text
of ancient Earth epic<i> Beowulf</i>

321
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,534
including historical annotation
and cultural references.

322
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,537
<i>Data compilation in progress.</i>

323
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,496
Doctor?

324
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,624
Ah, Kes.
Come in.

325
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,959
I don't know
how long I'll be gone,

326
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,296
but my absence is no reason
to suspend your studies.

327
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,715
How are you doing
with the protein synthesis text?

328
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,383
I finished it
yesterday.

329
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,968
Good. Then you may
as well start learning

330
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,637
how to operate
the base-pair sequencer.

331
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,055
You'll find the manual
in the technical data base.

332
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,017
Was there
something else?

333
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,478
There's something
bothering you.

334
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,729
Not at all.

335
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,063
Now if you'll excuse me,

336
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,816
I have a great deal
of preparation to do.

337
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,859
You're nervous about
this mission, aren't you?

338
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,068
Nervous?

339
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,449
I can perform emergency surgery
without getting nervous.

340
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,118
I can make life-or-death
decisions about patients

341
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,703
without getting nervous.

342
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,831
What makes you think
I'm nervous?

343
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,999
Those things are
familiar to you.

344
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,919
You've been programmed
to do them, but...

345
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:48,967
this is different,
isn't it?

346
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,101
I can describe every detail
of every piece of equipment

347
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,229
in this Sick Bay-- from bio-bed
to neurostimulator--

348
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:09,612
but I've never even
seen a sky or a forest,

349
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,366
let alone Vikings and monsters.

350
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,411
I can't afford to fail.

351
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,874
But I don't know what to expect
in that holodeck.

352
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,458
You've been telling
me that you

353
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,044
deserve to be treated
like a member of the crew.

354
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,129
Well, here's your chance.

355
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,924
And I can tell you

356
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,218
that none of the crew
knows exactly what to expect

357
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,220
when they go on an away mission.

358
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,058
Doctor,

359
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,101
have you chosen
a name for yourself yet?

360
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,357
I have narrowed the list
to three possibilities.

361
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,068
Then let me suggest
you choose one before you go.

362
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,114
It might help you feel more
like a Starfleet officer.

363
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,745
Hm.

364
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,205
You may be right.

365
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,749
I'll give it some thought.

366
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,084
And Kes...

367
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,214
thank you.

368
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,091
Good luck.

369
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,351
Paris to Janeway.

370
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,895
We're ready
for the transfer, Captain.

371
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,688
JANEWAY:
<i>Good. Go ahead.</i>

372
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,565
How about you,
Doctor?

373
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,233
You ready?

374
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,818
Of course.

375
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,194
I've already transported

376
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,363
a tricorder
onto the holodeck.

377
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,158
Engaging transfer
circuits... now.

378
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,595
JANEWAY:<i> Is everything</i>
<i>all right, Doctor?</i>

379
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,432
Yes. There were no problems
with the transfer.

380
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,684
I'm on my way.

381
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,697
Speak as a friend

382
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,283
or stand challenged.

383
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,701
I am...

384
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,578
Yes, you're Freya,
the king's daughter.

385
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,998
A female warrior
known as a shield-maiden.

386
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,417
We have never met,
and yet you know my name?

387
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,129
Are you a sorcerer?

388
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,007
No.

389
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:38,011
It's simply that...
your reputation precedes you.

390
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,762
A warrior of your skill...

391
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,264
You're quite famous
where I come from.

392
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,102
I did not know
that word of my deeds

393
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,854
has carried to other lands.

394
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,355
Tell me what you have heard.

395
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,735
Well... your battle with...

396
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,612
Scyld the Gar-Dane?

397
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,780
...is practically legend.

398
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,990
An incredible story.

399
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,200
I burned his hall
to the ground.

400
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,410
There was nothing
left but ashes!

401
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,745
Charming.

402
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,997
And did you
hear of my campaign

403
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,748
against the heatho-bards
to the south?

404
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,416
I fought them for--

405
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,210
I'd be delighted
to hear all about it,

406
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,837
but I'm on an urgent
mission of my own.

407
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,463
I'm looking for Grendel.

408
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,632
( sighs )

409
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,677
Only a warrior would seek
that which others flee.

410
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,387
What is your name?

411
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,556
I'm glad you asked.

412
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,017
My name is... Schweitzer.

413
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,268
Dr. Schweitzer.

414
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,897
"Schweitzer."

415
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,565
A hero's name.

416
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,610
Come, I will take you
to the king.

417
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,654
Hmm.

418
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,574
FREYA:
The hall is not far from here.

419
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,872
Look, fortune
is with us.

420
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,291
Atuta, a most
powerful plant.

421
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,252
What exactly do you
intend to do with it?

422
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,754
We brew the atuta
into a broth,

423
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,130
which we drink
before battle.

424
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,174
It brings on
the spirit of the bear

425
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,219
and gives us strength
to swing our swords.

426
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,970
It's more likely to bring on
profuse sweating,

427
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,889
convulsions,
and acute delirium.

428
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,558
This is
an<i> Amanita muscaria--</i>

429
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,435
a fungus common to
subartic climates,

430
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,478
and, let me assure you,
quite poisonous.

431
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,606
Yes, but those
it does not kill,

432
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,899
it makes strong.

433
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,943
A most hearty plant.

434
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,986
Are you a master
of herb-lore?

435
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,321
Well, in a way,
I suppose I am.

436
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,950
You are truly a man
of many talents,

437
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,201
Lord Schweitzer.

438
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,286
Your people must
value you greatly.

439
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,122
You would think so.

440
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,251
Hail, Lord Hrothgar!

441
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,962
I bring a new friend,
Schweitzer,

442
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,797
who has come
to destroy Grendel.

443
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,133
Greet him well.

444
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,219
I would bid you welcome
to my hall,

445
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:47,223
but the days of glad tidings
are gone from this place.

446
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,017
DOCTOR:
I'm sorry
to hear that,

447
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,769
but with your permission,
sir, I'd like to stay

448
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,687
here tonight, and
wait for Grendel.

449
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,606
To what purpose?

450
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,943
To raise false hopes again,

451
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,361
as have others before you?

452
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,157
Leave us alone
in our misery.

453
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,492
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

454
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,161
I have a mission.

455
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,246
Your name means
nothing to me.

456
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,873
There are no songs
of your deeds

457
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,918
nor stories of the battles
you have fought.

458
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,921
Who are you to believe
you can slay Grendel?

459
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,091
I'm simply a... warrior.

460
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,926
I'm only concerned
with Grendel.

461
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,511
I have no quarrel
with you.

462
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,804
Indeed you do,

463
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,889
and if you will fight Grendel,

464
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:33,644
then you will first
prove your worth to me.

465
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,730
Defend yourself!

466
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,404
Fate be with you.

467
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,491
( laughter )

468
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,244
( yelling )

469
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,999
( laughs )

470
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,585
If this is your best,
then you should thank me.

471
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,171
Grendel would
destroy you

472
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,256
with far greater
ease than I.

473
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,716
( sighs )

474
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,301
This is absurd.

475
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,932
So be it.

476
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,184
( yells )

477
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,645
( screaming )

478
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,396
( groaning )

479
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,274
You might want to put
some ice on that.

480
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,650
It'll take down
the swelling.

481
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,279
Our time of deliverance
is at hand.

482
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,406
We have been given
a new champion--

483
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,784
one whom weapons
cannot hurt.

484
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,912
The one who will
destroy Grendel

485
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,288
and end
our suffering.

486
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,665
All hail the hero!

487
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,792
All hail Schweitzer!

488
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,253
WARRIORS:
All hail Schweitzer!

489
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,963
Schweitzer! Schweitzer!

490
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,049
Schweitzer!
Schweitzer!

491
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,134
Schweitzer! Schweitzer!

492
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,178
Schweitzer!
Schweitzer!

493
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,097
Schweitzer! Schweitzer!

494
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,639
Schweitzer!
Schweitzer!

495
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,813
Eat, eat.

496
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,565
What is it?

497
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,900
Elk.

498
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,193
When I built this hall,

499
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,612
the forest ran
thick with them,

500
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:10,324
but today,
game's more scarce.

501
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,825
Enjoy it, Lord Schweitzer.

502
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,370
It is a great delicacy
in our land.

503
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,592
Hmm. It's quite good.

504
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,263
We rarely hear stories
of other lands.

505
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:35,057
Honor us with a tale
of your home

506
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,767
to gladden
our hearts.

507
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,936
I'm not much of a storyteller.

508
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,355
Please... indulge us.

509
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:45,443
Ach, tell us a tale
of your prowess in battle.

510
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,779
Well, there was the time

511
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,240
I managed to stop the spread
of Parinisti measles

512
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,409
before it
became epidemic.

513
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,995
For a while,
things were touch and go.

514
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,331
Six people came down with it.

515
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:01,625
Fortunately, I was able
to isolate the endoplasmic virus

516
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,502
and replicate it
in order to form an antibody.

517
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:08,382
Even then, it wasn't
altogether clear

518
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,926
I could create
an effective vaccine.

519
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,430
But I worked at it
for 74 hours straight

520
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,682
and managed to create
an inoculation

521
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,933
that successfully protected
the crew.

522
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,935
You'll excuse me,
My Lord,

523
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,189
if I take leave
of this... folly.

524
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,027
A truly unique tale.

525
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,029
Come, Lord
Schweitzer.

526
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,072
Allow me to show
you my home.

527
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,617
If you are in need of anything,

528
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,120
please do not
hesitate to ask.

529
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,955
All I need is
to find Grendel.

530
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,374
You are
a true champion--

531
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,250
always ready
for the fight.

532
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,918
Ah, perhaps you
would like some mead

533
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,462
to fortify yourself
for battle?

534
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,255
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

535
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,258
Away. You're disturbing
Lord Schweitzer!

536
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:56,638
It was with that weapon
I made my first kill.

537
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,682
I was 11 years old.

538
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,436
You killed someone
when you were 11?

539
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,813
Well, it's a poor
weapon, I agree,

540
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,482
but a token of my youth.

541
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,150
You must have
similar trophies

542
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,276
from your own childhood.

543
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,823
I... don't remember much
about my childhood.

544
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,283
Well, I am certain

545
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,827
you distinguished yourself
in battle many times

546
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,287
and did honor to your father.

547
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,457
My Lord, it
grows late.

548
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,625
It is time to retire.

549
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,170
Always with you
it is time to sleep.

550
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,838
Perhaps you have forgotten

551
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,175
that the work of a warrior
is battle, not rest!

552
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,635
You would do well to learn
from Lord Schweitzer.

553
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,058
This was
a beautiful hall once...

554
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,018
before Grendel.

555
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,230
You will make it so again.

556
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,024
You have our thanks.

557
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,694
I appreciate your faith
in me, Sire.

558
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,243
Come, my lord.

559
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,456
You may have deceived
them with your tricks,

560
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,211
but the king is old
and desperate for hope,

561
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,088
and the rest are just fools!

562
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,715
You have nothing
to worry about, Unferth.

563
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,968
Once I'm done with Grendel,
I'll be leaving.

564
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,386
We shall see.

565
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,305
The morning will prove

566
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,266
if your deeds are
as strong as your words.

567
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,153
The nights here are cold.

568
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,447
I wanted to make certain
you were comfortable.

569
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,408
I appreciate
your concern.

570
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,707
I thought everyone
had gone to sleep.

571
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:55,257
Sleep does not come
easily in this place.

572
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,801
Not anymore.

573
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,473
I was taught the world
would end in winter.

574
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:05,643
First, there would
be a desperate cold,

575
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,686
followed by a demon who
would devour the sun.

576
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,026
It has been long
since we felt summer,

577
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,612
and a demon does
walk these halls.

578
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,616
Freya...

579
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,118
your world
isn't coming to an end.

580
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,329
Perhaps not,

581
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,705
but it has changed.

582
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:31,084
Every night
the monster comes,

583
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,212
and every day our
numbers are lessened,

584
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,838
and no one will
speak of it.

585
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,757
No one speaks of the fear
that he will be next.

586
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:42,221
But each meal becomes
quieter than the last,

587
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:46,183
and after a time,
we barely speak at all.

588
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:50,270
Do you know what it is
to be alone among many,

589
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,648
and unable to speak
your fears?

590
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,110
I think I do.

591
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,405
How do you survive?

592
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,157
I'm still learning how.

593
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:06,328
I'm sure that's
not very helpful.

594
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,789
Sometimes I believe

595
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,001
I can see the moment
of my own death.

596
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,672
It comes in battle,
I think,

597
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,883
my sword raised high.

598
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,638
It is said that
fate often spares

599
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:28,183
a doomed warrior, if
his courage can prevail.

600
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,810
But there have been days

601
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,689
when I felt my
own courage falter...

602
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,233
and then you came.

603
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,152
I'm glad I could help.

604
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,071
Perhaps<i> I</i> can
help<i> you.</i>

605
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,367
Before combat,

606
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,661
it is most important
to stay warm.

607
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,163
( clears throat )

608
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,415
Well, you've done
an excellent job

609
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,832
with the fire.
I'm sure I'll--

610
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,013
Fire is not
the only heat,

611
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,848
Lord Schweitzer.

612
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,685
You know where I sleep.

613
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,818
( sighs )

614
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:30,162
( unearthly howling )

615
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,168
Holodeck to Bridge.

616
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,877
JANEWAY:
<i>We're monitoring you.</i>

617
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,923
Captain, I'm picking up
readings of photonic energy.

618
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,176
( unearthly howling
intensifies )

619
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,097
Captain, it's right
in front of me.

620
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,934
It's some kind of...
photonic energy formation.

621
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,898
Emergency!

622
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,899
Get me out of here!

623
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,443
<i>Now!</i>

624
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,403
Sick Bay, emergency transfer.

625
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,405
I'm on it.

626
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,831
JANEWAY:
<i>Sickbay, report.</i>

627
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:16,333
Uh... I have him, Captain...

628
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,459
more or less.

629
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,672
I think you better come
take a look at this.

630
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,067
How does it feel?

631
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,569
Just like the old
one, actually.

632
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,779
Apparently, contact
with photonic energy

633
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,531
disrupted
your magnetic cohesion,

634
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,824
but we're still not sure

635
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,242
if that's what happened
to the others.

636
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,452
TORRES:
Captain, take
a look at this.

637
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,246
The readings from the
Doctor's tricorder

638
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,499
when the energy surge
made contact with him.

639
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,419
They're showing
a synaptic pattern.

640
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,628
I wouldn't expect to see

641
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,714
something like this
in photonic energy.

642
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,006
Is this the first time

643
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,299
those patterns
have shown up like this?

644
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,051
Yes, but it's
the first time

645
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,763
we've had clear readings
from a moment of contact.

646
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:14,683
I wonder if I could produce
these same patterns

647
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,393
in the samples
we have in Engineering.

648
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,228
If you can,
you might be able

649
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,397
to get more information
about how photonic energy

650
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,440
damaged the holodeck systems.

651
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,816
I'm on it.

652
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,067
I'll give you a hand.

653
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,948
PARIS:
Okay...

654
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,325
I've initiated
a polarization field.

655
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,620
I'm introducing it
into the container.

656
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,413
We're getting
a reaction.

657
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,332
It's producing a synaptic
pattern all right--

658
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,293
highly complex.

659
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,335
( loud hissing )

660
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,462
What's that?

661
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,674
( warning beeps )

662
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,008
PARIS:
Whatever it is,
it's cutting

663
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,343
through the bulkheads.

664
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,804
Let's get a containment field
around it.

665
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,013
It's heading for
Deck 14, Section C-5.

666
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,056
Okay, now I've got

667
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,517
a containment field
blocking it.

668
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,479
Whoa.
It's changing direction.

669
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,648
It's like it's avoiding
the containment field.

670
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,524
Let's give it another try.

671
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,860
Now it's blocked on three sides.

672
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,320
It's changing
course.

673
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,529
Heading for
the open side.

674
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,699
( sighs )

675
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,785
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

676
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,496
Those synaptic patterns...

677
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,998
could be some sort
of neural net.

678
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,501
We may be dealing
with a life-form.

679
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,043
JANEWAY:
<i>Bridge to Engineering.</i>

680
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,545
Torres here.

681
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,046
<i>We're detecting an energy mass</i>

682
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,507
moving through the ship.

683
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,134
<i>Right. It broke through</i>
<i>the sample container.</i>

684
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,638
<i>Captain, it's showing</i>
<i>the properties of a life-form.</i>

685
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,265
A life-form?

686
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,976
It seems to have
a neural net,

687
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,645
and it's demonstrating
signs of intelligent behavior.

688
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,355
It's cutting it's way
through the ship.

689
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,815
Heading for the outer hull.

690
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,859
It'll breach
in about 15 seconds.

691
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,944
<i>Are there any critical systems</i>
<i>in its path?</i>

692
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,154
Negative.
<i>Then let it go.</i>

693
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,699
Be ready to seal the hull breach
with a force field.

694
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,785
I'll have a damage control team
standing by for repairs.

695
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,829
And let's track it on sensors
when it gets out.

696
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,373
Captain,
it's penetrating the outer hull.

697
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,917
Force field
is in place.

698
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,295
I'm showing the energy form
100 meters off our port side.

699
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,130
Let's get it on screen.

700
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,765
What was that?

701
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,025
JANEWAY:
It appears to be some kind
of photonic lattice.

702
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,068
And it seems pretty clear
that the energy form

703
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,987
was trying to get
back to it,

704
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,741
as though it's...
a shelter of some kind.

705
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,910
Or maybe
a transportation device--

706
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,328
their equivalent of a ship.

707
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,540
At any rate,
we had sensor contact

708
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,001
for a few seconds,
and we picked up

709
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,838
three distinct bioelectrical
patterns inside it.

710
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,089
Bioelectrical?

711
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,132
What are you suggesting,
Captain?

712
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,968
We have three missing crewmen.

713
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,636
Our best guess

714
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,805
has been that they were
somehow converted into energy

715
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,223
while they were on the holodeck.

716
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,642
We find no sign of them
on this ship.

717
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,521
Then we pick up three discrete
patterns in that lattice,

718
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,899
three patterns that don't match
anything else in the lattice

719
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,860
and which have
biological components.

720
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,613
I don't think it's a stretch
to hypothesize

721
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,031
that those are our crew members

722
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,743
converted into a kind
of photonic energy.

723
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,954
But what are they
doing over there?

724
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,455
How did they get there?

725
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,290
We have good evidence now

726
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,794
that there are photonic beings
that live in that protostar--

727
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,379
life-forms
that have intelligence.

728
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,714
We didn't know that

729
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,008
when we beamed those
energy samples on board.

730
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,260
We had no idea
that what we were doing,

731
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,847
in essence, was capturing
those life-forms.

732
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,016
We locked them
in a containment field,

733
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,769
and began to experiment
on them.

734
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,854
If my people were
taken like that...

735
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,858
I know
what my response would be.

736
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,318
I would do
whatever was necessary

737
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,112
to get them back.

738
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,405
Then you think
they have simply...

739
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,782
retaliated against us?

740
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,408
Yes.

741
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:04,412
These beings can manifest
themselves on the holodeck

742
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,581
in the matrix
of a holo-character.

743
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,874
That's how they
were able to take

744
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,043
our crew members hostage.

745
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,920
Captain, if you're
right about this,

746
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,380
then we should return
the remaining life-form.

747
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,342
A gesture--
to show we mean well.

748
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,011
It's certainly worth a try.

749
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,471
If I took the life-form
onto the holodeck

750
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,057
and release it to Grendel,

751
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,225
maybe they'll understand
and release our people.

752
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,479
Ordinarily, officers go
through intensive training

753
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,647
before they're put

754
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,316
into a First Contact
situation...

755
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,611
but you're the only one
who can do this safely.

756
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,905
I'd like to finish
what I started, Captain.

757
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,115
I can do this.

758
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,825
I agree.

759
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,162
Make arrangements
to transfer the life-form

760
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,245
to a container, so the Doctor

761
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,873
can carry it.

762
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,960
But, remember...

763
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,379
if you're holding
the container,

764
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,049
you'll have to stay
in solid form.

765
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,843
I understand.

766
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,890
Freya?

767
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,810
Freya!

768
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,902
Lord Schweitzer!

769
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,988
We thought the Grendel
had taken you.

770
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,323
Not... entirely.

771
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,993
How did you survive?

772
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,829
That would be difficult
to explain,

773
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,249
but that's not
important right now.

774
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,920
This is a talisman
to destroy Grendel...

775
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,546
UNFERTH:
You lie!

776
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,091
No man could survive
an encounter with Grendel

777
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,760
unless he were
in league with the beast.

778
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,471
You have brought that talisman
to destroy us all.

779
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,639
That is not true.

780
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,141
He has returned
to help us.

781
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,308
No!

782
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,395
You speak his lies now.

783
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,022
He has bewitched you.

784
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:58,526
Unferth, I need to get
this talisman to the hall.

785
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,112
Then that gives me
reason enough

786
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,073
to make sure it
never gets there.

787
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,994
( grunting )

788
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,958
No! Please!

789
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,751
You don't know
what you're doing.

790
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,294
( grunting )

791
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,925
( yells )

792
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,516
Prepare to die, demon.

793
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,980
( groaning )

794
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,612
Freya...

795
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,118
My Lord...

796
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,664
My time has come.

797
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,415
Freya, I'm sorry.

798
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,586
There's nothing I can do.

799
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,132
It is a good death.

800
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,636
Take my sword.

801
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,764
Stop Unferth and Grendel.

802
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,392
I won't forget you.

803
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:18,106
Then I die happily...

804
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,651
with your name on my lips.

805
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,903
Farewell...

806
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,699
Schweitzer.

807
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,850
Here, Sire.

808
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,273
My Lord...

809
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,817
you know me
as a true warrior.

810
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,777
You know I am
the one hope you have

811
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,112
to rid your kingdom of Grendel.

812
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,407
That talisman will aid me
in my conquest.

813
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,616
I must have it.

814
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,410
Do not listen to him.

815
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,372
He has already
killed Freya.

816
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,720
( gasping )

817
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,600
Stop him, my Lord!

818
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,727
He is a madman!

819
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,688
The only reason you won't die

820
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:45,068
is that I've taken an oath
to do no harm.

821
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,255
Grendel...

822
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,547
I'm ready for you.

823
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,384
( unearthly howling )

824
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,686
( exclamations of dismay )

825
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,481
I don't know if you
can understand me--

826
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,025
but watch.

827
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,944
I'm setting this one free.

828
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,374
There's no need
for any more of this.

829
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,626
Please...

830
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,422
we ask you
to return our crew.

831
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,303
( console beeping )

832
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:56,014
Captain, the photonic lattice
has reappeared.

833
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,974
Scan it. All sensors.

834
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,892
I'm reading a massive
particle surge

835
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,852
on our holodeck.

836
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,771
The lattice
is gone again.

837
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,065
DOCTOR:
<i>Holodeck to Bridge.</i>

838
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,233
Go ahead, Doctor.

839
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,443
<i>What is it?</i>

840
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,445
We have them back,
Captain,

841
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,071
all three of them.

842
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,823
<i>Good work, Doctor.</i>

843
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,116
Yeah. Good work.

844
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:19,287
Would you mind telling me
where I was?

845
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:23,833
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48710.5.</i>

846
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,584
<i>Since the return</i>
<i>of our missing crewmen,</i>

847
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,128
<i>we've been unable to locate</i>

848
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,089
<i>any further traces</i>
<i>of the photonic aliens.</i>

849
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,424
I don't know
if the being

850
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,926
understood language
or just my behavior.

851
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,887
It would have
been interesting

852
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,931
to pursue the relationship
further.

853
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,475
It's one of the most
exciting aspects

854
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,934
of space exploration--

855
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,355
meeting new species,
establishing communication,

856
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,982
sharing differences
and similarities.

857
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,151
I'm sorry none of that
happened this time.

858
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,944
But it did.

859
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,697
It just didn't happen
in very predictable ways.

860
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,409
But if you think about it,

861
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,953
we entered into conflict,
communicated,

862
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,416
and eventually established
a peace treaty with them.

863
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,505
I'm placing a special
commendation in the logs

864
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,758
for exemplary performance
by the Chief Medical Officer

865
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,511
during his first away mission.

866
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,100
Thank you.

867
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,685
I'd like to cite you by name.

868
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,273
Kes tells me you've chosen one.
Is that true?

869
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:32,193
I had... but I'm not sure
I want to keep it.

870
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,820
The last time I heard
that name spoken

871
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,656
was a... painful one.

872
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,992
I don't think
I want to be reminded.

873
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,578
Sounds like you had
quite an adventure

874
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:44,122
on that holodeck, Doctor.

875
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,749
Yes, I would say so.

876
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,252
Well...

877
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,879
something tells me

878
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,507
you haven't had
your last one.

879
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,179
( door opens, closes )

880
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,807
Something tells me
the same thing.

881
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,297
( theme playing )
