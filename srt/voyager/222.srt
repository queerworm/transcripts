1
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,552
Tuvok to<i> Voyager.</i>

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,930
<i>Voyager,</i>
do you read?

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,139
(<i> groaning</i> )

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,432
You must lie still.

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,977
I-I-I can't feel my legs.

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,773
Several of your vertebrae
have been fractured.

7
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,275
Isn't there anything you can do?

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,445
I'm afraid the shuttle's
medical supplies are inadequate.

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,698
We must wait
for<i> Voyager</i> to find us.

10
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:31,907
(<i> gasping</i> )

11
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,617
It's getting worse.

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,910
My whole body feels numb.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,829
I want you to slow
your breathing

14
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,914
and relax
your muscles.

15
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,749
Try not to move.

16
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,377
A-All this time I thought...

17
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,128
I thought I was so lucky--

18
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,631
No family back home...

19
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,717
nobody to miss.

20
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,929
Now it seems kind of sad not,
not to leave anybody behind.

21
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,305
I believe
Ensign Macormak

22
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,725
would miss you a great deal.

23
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,436
You think so?

24
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,024
I was never really sure
how sh... sh...

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,943
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

26
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,365
(<i> tricorder emits steady tone)</i>

27
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,254
(<i> foliage rustles</i> )

28
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,803
It's all right.

29
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,889
Don't be frightened.
I won't hurt you.

30
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,181
Let me go!

31
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,600
Will you run if I do?

32
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,730
No.

33
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,982
(<i> sighs</i> )

34
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,318
My name is Tuvok.
Who are you?

35
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,279
Tressa.

36
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,864
You don't look like us.

37
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,950
I am not a member of your race.

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,993
I am Vulcan.

39
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,955
I thought this moon
was uninhabited.

40
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,497
Do you live here?

41
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,667
We came here on a ship,

42
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,003
but it crashed, like yours.

43
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,630
Where are your parents?

44
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,339
Dead.

45
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,301
Is he dead too?

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,261
Yes.

47
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,763
What were you doing to him?

48
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,515
I put a stasis field
around his body to protect it

49
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,183
until I can take it back
to my ship.

50
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,978
Why?

51
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,313
Some cultures,
like Mr. Bennet's,

52
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,024
consider an appropriate burial
to be a sign of respect.

53
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,609
Tressa,

54
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,527
is there anyone else
here with you?

55
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,741
It's all right.

56
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,582
There is no one
looking after you?

57
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,251
Everyone else died
in the crash.

58
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,004
We're alone.

59
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,718
There is no reason to be afraid.

60
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,055
I will take care of you now and
see that you get home safely.

61
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,011
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

62
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,139
<i>I've sent out scouting parties</i>

63
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,850
<i>to analyze the mineral deposits</i>
<i>in the moons around Drayan II.</i>

64
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,270
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>I've arranged a meeting</i>

65
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,272
<i>with the planet's leader.</i>

66
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,690
According to Neelix,
nobody's had direct contact

67
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,942
with the Drayans
for decades.

68
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,526
All he's heard are rumors.

69
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,654
Do any of those rumors
describe them as hostile?

70
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,239
No. Just very private.

71
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,573
That's something.

72
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,366
Deck 4.

73
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,077
My diplomacy professor
used to say

74
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,537
the opening 20 minutes
of a first-contact situation

75
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,123
are the most crucial.

76
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,374
I'd feel better
about this particular 20 minutes

77
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,835
if we had some idea
what to expect.

78
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,753
Sometimes, you have
to go in blind.

79
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,088
That's the exciting part.

80
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,756
When I was a
Science Officer,

81
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,176
I always envied
the Captain's privilege

82
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,552
of making first contact
with new races.

83
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,888
I envied it so much,

84
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,099
I almost got myself shipped
back to the Academy

85
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,349
for remedial training.

86
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,560
On my first assignment,

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,105
we were sent to make contact
with the Tarkannans.

88
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,356
I studied all the information
we had about them

89
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,151
and pestered the Captain
into letting me be part

90
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,819
of the diplomatic team.

91
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,864
When we came face-to-face
with the Tarkannan delegation,

92
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,741
I very proudly made the
traditional gesture for "hello,"

93
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,203
not realizing that males
and females of their race

94
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,788
use different styles
of movement, and I was

95
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,208
actually propositioning
the ambassador.

96
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,877
Energize.

97
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,471
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

98
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,764
I'd like to welcome
you aboard

99
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,475
the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

100
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,728
First Prelate Alcia.

101
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,897
May this day find
you at peace

102
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,273
and leave you with hope.

103
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,566
That's a traditional
blessing

104
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,400
from our ancient scrolls.

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,153
<i>Om-nah-hoo-pez-nyeetz.</i>

106
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,155
That's from the spirits
of my people.

107
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,533
It means, "peace in your heart,
fortune in your steps."

108
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,328
It's very gracious of you
to agree to meet with us.

109
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:55,498
We don't often engage in
dialogue with alien races,

110
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,543
but your story of crossing
the galaxy intrigued me.

111
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,880
I'd be glad to tell you all
about our journey and my crew.

112
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,133
Perhaps you'd like to see
more of our ship as well.

113
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,885
Thank you.

114
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,982
JANEWAY:
Our warp core
is designed to operate

115
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,484
for up to three years
before refueling.

116
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,363
CHAKOTAY:
The reaction chamber is
equipped with a compositor,

117
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,865
which allows us to
recrystallize the dilithium.

118
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,784
In our situation,
we can never be sure

119
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,827
when we'll be able
to find a new supply.

120
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,622
I'm sorry my Chief Engineer
isn't here to meet you.

121
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,291
She's leading one
of the away teams

122
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,500
surveying the moons
around Drayan.

123
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,169
I find it interesting

124
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,797
that you chose this
to show me first.

125
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:47,050
Do your people consider
advanced technology

126
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,718
to be their
highest achievement?

127
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,262
Not as an end in itself.

128
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,930
The purpose of all this

129
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,724
is to help us gain knowledge
about the universe

130
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,310
and the people in it.

131
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,270
Our ancestors were
brilliant scientists

132
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,604
and engineers.

133
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,189
They were continually
developing

134
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,234
better, smarter, more
efficient machines,

135
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,485
until the technology

136
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,737
became more important
than the people.

137
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,115
I believe that society
would have self-destructed

138
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,200
if it weren't for
the Reformation.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,911
My great-grandfather
helped to return us

140
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,038
to ourselves, and
since that time,

141
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,625
we've remained isolated
to avoid the influence

142
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,128
of those who might lead us
back down the wrong path.

143
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,673
Some human cultures
have done the same.

144
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,848
Will your friend be
all right in there?

145
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,226
Yes, I have secured his body
within the stasis field.

146
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,062
You are all very fortunate
to have escaped the crash

147
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,314
with only a few bruises.

148
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,358
The attendants protected us.

149
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,443
Attendants?
The people on our ship.

150
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,611
They got us to the escape pod

151
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,821
before they crashed.

152
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,366
Can we go now?
I want to go.

153
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,075
Are we going to fly
in your ship?

154
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,037
He said it was a shuttle,
not a ship.

155
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,205
We cannot leave yet.

156
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,165
My shuttle
is in need of repairs.

157
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,749
Can't you fix it?

158
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,251
I believe so.

159
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,337
However, I am more concerned
with getting through

160
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,464
the electrodynamic turbulence
in the ionosphere.

161
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,799
What's electro turbulence?

162
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,843
A thermal inversion gradient

163
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,346
is causing unusually strong
and unpredictable currents

164
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,223
in the upper levels
of the atmosphere.

165
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,393
Those currents caused
my shuttle to crash,

166
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,228
and I assume, yours as well.

167
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,064
I must find a way to safely
navigate through the turbulence

168
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,524
before we can attempt to leave.

169
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,234
Will that take
a long time?

170
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,736
It may.
You must be patient.

171
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,571
I don't want
to stay here anymore.

172
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,698
I don't like it here.

173
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,076
Your displeasure doesn't change
our situation,

174
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,495
nor does it bring us
any closer to a solution.

175
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,372
You don't have to be
so mean about it.

176
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,457
It isn't my intention
to be mean.

177
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,252
I only wish to provide you
with a realistic assessment.

178
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,089
Vulcan parents never shield
their children from the truth.

179
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,174
Doing so would only hinder
their ability to cope

180
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,926
with inevitable difficulties.

181
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,761
I'm hungry.

182
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,889
There is a supply of Starfleet
rations in the shuttle.

183
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,474
What's rations?

184
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,602
Concentrated, vitamin-enriched
nutritional supplements.

185
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,521
I want<i> takka</i> berries.

186
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,731
With<i> cherel</i> sauce.

187
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,942
We have only rations.

188
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,235
(<i> sighs</i> )

189
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,113
Now, I must begin working
on my shuttle.

190
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,406
By my estimate, we have fewer

191
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,032
than four hours
of daylight remaining.

192
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,951
We can't be here
when it's night.

193
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,702
That's when
the<i> morrok</i> comes.

194
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,538
Is that a species of animal?

195
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,082
The<i> morrok</i> is what
takes you when you die.

196
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,750
It lives here...

197
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,335
in the cave.

198
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,220
I'm not detecting any life-forms
other than ourselves.

199
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,597
It's here.

200
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,640
It'll come.

201
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,935
Have any of you ever
seen this creature?

202
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,354
You can only see it
when it comes for you.

203
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,022
Then it's too late.

204
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,192
I believe your anxiety
about our situation

205
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,486
is causing you
to imagine the presence...

206
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,820
It took
the others!

207
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,822
Jarren and Fayla--

208
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,407
The other children on the ship.

209
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,160
The<i> morrok</i> took them
while we were sleeping...

210
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,870
and tonight, it will take us.

211
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,349
The Federation consists
of over 150 different worlds

212
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,851
who have agreed to share
their knowledge and resources

213
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,479
in peaceful
cooperation.

214
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,481
Ah, visitors.

215
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,731
Welcome to Sick Bay.

216
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,526
I'm the Chief Medical Officer.

217
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,903
This is First Prelate
Alcia of Drayan II.

218
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,822
It's an honor
to meet you.

219
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,408
We don't often receive
such distinguished guests here,

220
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,910
unless there's been
some sort of accident.

221
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,041
I'm... sure nothing unfortunate
will happen to you

222
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,793
on your visit here, but if
it did, you can rest assured

223
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,046
you will find yourself
in very capable hands.

224
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,089
We are fully
equipped to provide

225
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,050
a wide variety
of treatments here,

226
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,968
from removing a splinter

227
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,889
to resequencing the base pairs
in a strand of DNA.

228
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,517
And our research facilities

229
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,102
are the most advanced
in Starfleet.

230
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,896
Very impressive.

231
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,523
You may be even more
interested to learn

232
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,150
that this man isn't really
a biological life-form.

233
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,112
He's a computer-generated
holographic projection.

234
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,661
My people believe

235
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,622
that physical matter's
only an illusion.

236
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,790
The body is not
the true self,

237
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,501
only a representation.

238
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,878
One of our greatest
philosophers, Plato,

239
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,630
wrote that what
we see around us

240
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,007
are only poor shadows
of ideal objects,

241
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,718
which exist on
a higher plane.

242
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,470
That is similar
to our teachings.

243
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,599
Our connection to what you call
a higher plane

244
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,101
is more important
than our attachment

245
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,395
to this brief existence,
however real it may seem.

246
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,230
KIM:
<i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

247
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,898
<i>There's an incoming message</i>
<i>for the First Prelate.</i>

248
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,359
Perhaps you'd like
to use my office.

249
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,487
Uh, yes.
Thank you, Doctor...?

250
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,864
I'm afraid
it's just Doctor.

251
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,619
Patch it through
on a secure channel

252
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,412
to the Doctor's office, Mr. Kim.

253
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,829
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

254
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,040
You did very well.
I think she was impressed.

255
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,418
Kes has been coaching me
on my diplomatic skills.

256
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,629
It shows.

257
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,756
Our next step will be
to open negotiations--

258
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,257
Find out what they
might be interested

259
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,467
in getting from us

260
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,510
in exchange for
the polyferranide.

261
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,055
I've been called away
on an emergency.

262
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,099
Is there anything
we can do to help?

263
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,351
No. Thank you. It would be
better if you and your crew

264
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,645
continued on your journey.

265
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,480
It's been
an interesting visit.

266
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,814
We'd been hoping to
learn more about you.

267
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,277
It's been our custom
for generations

268
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,738
to avoid close contact
with outsiders.

269
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,365
I choose to honor
that tradition.

270
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,117
Goodbye, Captain.

271
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,411
I hope you find your way home.

272
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,000
Was it something<i> I</i> said?

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,669
We could assure her
we have no intention

274
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,712
of interfering with their
culture or traditions.

275
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,089
No. She made
her wishes clear.

276
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,175
If we're not welcome, we'll go.

277
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,760
Recall the scouting parties.

278
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,929
We'll have to find our
polyferranide somewhere else.

279
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,475
Where did you last see
the missing children?

280
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,601
By the big tree,

281
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,770
when we went
to sleep last night.

282
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,188
Were either
of them injured?

283
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,648
Jarren hurt his hand.

284
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,107
But both were able
to walk?

285
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,484
Uh-huh.

286
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,319
Did any of you hear them
get up during the night?

287
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,363
You think they wandered
off and got lost,

288
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,781
but they didn't.

289
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,575
The<i> morrok</i> took them.
They're gone.

290
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,160
The other children
aren't within scanning range

291
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,829
of this tricorder.

292
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,580
That is the only thing we know
for certain at this time.

293
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,290
You don't understand.

294
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,834
We have to get away from here.

295
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,169
Please, can we go?
I'm scared.

296
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,671
Please, Tuvok?

297
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,466
Children, you are allowing
your fears to guide you.

298
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,635
You must learn
to exercise control

299
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,136
over your own imagination.
But the<i> morrok!</i>

300
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,638
Yes.

301
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,474
The existence of such a creature
is one possibility.

302
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,435
However, your emotional
reactions are preventing you

303
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,313
from accurately judging
how unlikely that is to be true.

304
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,523
I can't help it.

305
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,066
I'm scared.

306
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,818
I believe you<i> can</i> help it.

307
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,654
Vulcan children learn to detach
themselves from their emotions

308
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,198
at an early age.
How?

309
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,369
First, you must focus
on the object of your fear.

310
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,955
Picture the<i> morrok</i>
clearly in your minds.

311
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,504
That image is accompanied
by an emotional response.

312
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,506
Describe for me
what that feeling is like.

313
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,300
It makes my stomach
all tight.

314
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,220
I feel like I want to run,
but my legs won't work.

315
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,890
Now, if you could see this
emotion in physical form,

316
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,307
what would it look like?

317
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,560
It's like this big black cloud

318
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,563
with lots of thunder
and lightning all around us.

319
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,900
Then imagine a strong wind
is pushing that cloud away.

320
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,111
Watch as your fear
grows more distant.

321
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,781
It is no longer
a part of you.

322
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,282
Once you begin

323
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,577
to detach yourselves
from your emotional responses,

324
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,579
you come closer
to controlling them.

325
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,331
Eventually, they will be
eliminated altogether.

326
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,793
Do you live your whole life
without feeling anything?

327
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,421
More accurately, we strive
to control our feelings.

328
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,757
You don't get scared... ever?

329
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,091
No.

330
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,093
Even when your shuttle crashed?

331
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,345
That is correct.
But what if there was

332
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,389
this big hairy<i> tardeth</i>
coming after you...

333
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,934
The circumstances
are irrelevant.

334
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,519
A Vulcan approaches
every situation logically.

335
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,230
Now, I must begin work
on my shuttle.

336
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,316
We will resume the search
for the other children

337
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,901
once the sensors
are operational.

338
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,403
I expect each of you
to sit quietly

339
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,781
and not touch
any of the equipment.

340
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,825
We promise.

341
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,452
(<i> laughing and squealing</i> )

342
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,538
Elani, please,
put that down.

343
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,707
Let me have it!

344
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,959
No! I found it!

345
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,502
(<i> loud whirring</i> )

346
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,128
Be careful with that!

347
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,715
You...

348
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,550
will stay here.

349
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,554
And you...

350
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,473
will stay here.

351
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,933
Where do I get to sit?

352
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,063
But I want to sit next to you.

353
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,875
Tuvok?

354
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,083
Yes?

355
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,169
Why do your ears
look like that?

356
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,630
All Vulcans have
similarly shaped ears.

357
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,840
Why?

358
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,008
It is a result

359
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,592
of many millennia
of evolution.

360
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,219
Do they make you hear better?

361
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,095
No.

362
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,807
Where do Vulcans live?
Is it far away?

363
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,978
My home world is on the
other side of the galaxy.

364
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,521
Elani. Elani!

365
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,857
I asked you not
to play with that.

366
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,525
Sorry.

367
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,113
What are you doing?

368
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,367
It helps prepare you to
attain a meditative state.

369
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,785
Now close your eyes

370
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,329
and imagine all the
energy in your body

371
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,750
is flowing to the point
where your fingertips meet.

372
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,629
Nothing else you hear
or feel is important.

373
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,092
Let the outside
world fade away.

374
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,929
You exist only
inside your mind.

375
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,600
Tuvok?
Yes?

376
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,393
Do you have any children?

377
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,853
Be quiet.

378
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,023
We are trying to attain
a meditative state.

379
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,274
But I want to know.

380
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,026
I have four children.

381
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,819
Now, you must concentrate.

382
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,989
What are they like?

383
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,075
Well-behaved.

384
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,952
They had already mastered

385
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,536
several states of
heightened awareness

386
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,162
by the time they
were your age.

387
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,582
If Vulcans
don't feel anything,

388
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,333
does that mean
you don't love them?

389
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,545
My attachment to my children

390
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,631
cannot be described
as an emotion.

391
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,717
They are part
of my identity.

392
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,177
And I am...

393
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,764
incomplete without them.

394
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,225
I bet they miss you, too.

395
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,436
COWIN:
Tuvok?

396
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,646
Yes?

397
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,940
I have to scratch my nose.

398
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,608
You may.

399
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,652
TRESSA:
Tuvok!

400
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,861
Yes!

401
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,529
I hear something.

402
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,323
Is it a ship?

403
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,866
I believe so.

404
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,665
Can you see
who it is?

405
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,126
The sensors are
only partially functional.

406
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,919
I'm attempting
to identify the ship

407
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,295
by its shield harmonics.

408
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,339
Is somebody coming
to save us?

409
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,591
It is not a shuttle
from<i> Voyager.</i>

410
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,177
The pattern of the harmonics
matches that of the ships

411
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,429
we scanned in orbit
around Drayan.

412
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,390
It seems your people
have come looking for you.

413
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,435
We have to
hide, Tuvok.

414
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,021
You can't let them
find us here.

415
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,563
I don't understand.

416
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,858
I thought you wanted to go home.

417
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,526
They won't take us home.

418
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,486
They're the ones who
made us come here.

419
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,279
For what purpose?

420
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,158
They sent us here to die.

421
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,750
We<i> have</i> to go.

422
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,377
If they find us,
we'll<i> all</i> die.

423
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,795
Please, Tuvok.

424
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,339
Why would your own people
want to harm you?

425
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,257
Please.
They're coming.

426
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,010
Help us.

427
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,389
(<i> instruments whirring</i> )

428
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,233
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

429
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,693
DRAYAN:
Any indication
where they've gone?

430
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,236
DRAYAN 2:
No.

431
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,821
DRAYAN:
Spread out
and scan the area.

432
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,784
Two of them are
coming this way.

433
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,204
What are you doing?

434
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,164
This will hide us
from their scanners.

435
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,548
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

436
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,439
DRAYAN:
I'm not picking up
any life-forms this way.

437
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,252
Why do you believe
they've come to kill you?

438
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,795
We're supposed
to die here.

439
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,755
That's what this place is for.

440
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,507
They bring children here
for the final ritual.

441
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,885
Then the<i> morrok</i>
takes them away.

442
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,053
No one ever comes back.

443
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,471
TUVOK:
It is illogical

444
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,015
for a society to kill
its own children.

445
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,559
The scrolls
say we should be happy--

446
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,063
That when we die, the energy
inside us is set free.

447
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,481
Is it true?

448
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,566
Is that what
really happens?

449
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,320
Vulcans believe that
a person's<i> katra--</i>

450
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,489
What some might
call a soul--

451
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,492
Continues to exist
after the body dies.

452
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,077
Do you believe that?

453
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,037
When I was younger,

454
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,248
I accepted it
without question.

455
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:16,002
In recent years, I have
experienced doubts.

456
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,796
I do believe there is
more within each of us

457
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,923
than science
has yet explained.

458
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,383
I know
we should have more faith.

459
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,343
It's wrong
to be afraid of death.

460
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:28,514
There is nothing wrong
in choosing to live.

461
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,308
Will you help us?

462
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,976
Until I can gain
a better understanding

463
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,311
of your situation,

464
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,854
I believe
it would be best

465
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,273
to get you safely
back to<i> Voyager.</i>

466
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,573
Torres and Neelix
just got back,

467
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,035
but there's still no word
from Tuvok and Bennet.

468
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,537
I'm not picking up
their shuttle on sensors.

469
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,122
KIM:
There's heavy solar
flare activity.

470
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,082
It's causing
electrodynamic disturbance

471
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,416
throughout the system.

472
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,171
We found a vein
of pure polyferranide

473
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,422
three kilometers long.
It's a real shame we're leaving.

474
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,424
When was your last contact
with the other team?

475
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,510
Several hours ago.
Is there a problem?

476
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,222
We can't reach them.
When we spoke to them,

477
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,182
they were going to check out
the outermost moons.

478
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,018
Can you find
the shuttle's ion signature?

479
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,771
I'm reading one
on heading 151 mark 8.

480
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,274
That's where Neelix and I went.

481
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,984
And another one
on a divergent course,

482
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,485
20 degrees to starboard.

483
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,988
Set a course, Mr. Paris.

484
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,121
Our scans of the moon
are inconclusive.

485
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,455
We can't see anything through

486
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,124
the turbulence
in the atmosphere.

487
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,835
The Drayan ship still hasn't
responded to our hails.

488
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,921
Are you sure our signal's
getting through?

489
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,381
They're receiving it.

490
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,715
They're just
not answering.

491
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,217
Continue hails.

492
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,468
<i>This desecration</i>
<i>dishonors us both, Captain.</i>

493
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,763
I'm sorry.
I don't understand...

494
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,723
<i>This moon is our crysata...</i>
<i>sacred ground.</i>

495
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,683
<i>Your presence</i>
<i>is forbidden here.</i>

496
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,144
We've only come here
to look for one of our shuttles.

497
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,854
It's missing.

498
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,398
<i>We found your shuttle</i>
<i>on the surface.</i>

499
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,648
<i>The pilot is dead.</i>

500
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,567
There were two men on board.

501
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,236
Did you find both of them?

502
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,695
<i>No, only one.</i>

503
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,572
<i>If there's someone else</i>
<i>on this moon,</i>

504
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,657
<i>you must transport him back</i>
<i>to your ship immediately.</i>

505
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,450
That's what we intend to do.

506
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,994
<i>This kind of disturbance</i>

507
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,372
<i>is exactly why we avoid contact</i>
<i>with outsiders.</i>

508
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,624
<i>I was wrong to respond</i>
<i>to your communication.</i>

509
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,043
<i>I should have known better</i>
<i>than to indulge my curiosity.</i>

510
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,295
There's no one at fault here.

511
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,963
The shuttle crash
was an accident.

512
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,924
<i>One I expect you to correct</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

513
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,510
What's the status
of the transporters?

514
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,138
The targeting scanners
still can't lock

515
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,680
on to anything
on the surface.

516
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,557
It would be easier
if we sent down another shuttle.

517
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,893
No, that would only
make things worse.

518
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,271
(<i> sighs</i> ):
I'll keep working on it.

519
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,111
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

520
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,996
I don't see how you
could be thirsty again

521
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,622
after four drinks
of water.

522
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,374
Aren't you going
to sleep?

523
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,918
I can go several days
without rest if necessary.

524
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,212
You cannot.

525
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,631
It's warmer by the fire.

526
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,717
Go back and
try to sleep.

527
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,719
Do not worry.

528
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,389
I have run several
thorough scans of the area.

529
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,391
There are no other
life-forms present--

530
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,600
Inside the cave

531
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,686
or anywhere within
5 kilometers.

532
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,023
Maybe the<i> morrok</i> doesn't
show up on the scans.

533
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,608
I am also keeping watch
on all of you from here.

534
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,068
If there is any
indication of trouble,

535
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,029
I'll come immediately.

536
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,322
Okay.

537
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,467
We can't sleep.

538
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,260
(<i> sighs</i> )

539
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,887
Apparently not.

540
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,096
It's so dark.

541
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,140
I think the
fire's going out.

542
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,351
Maybe you should look.

543
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,020
I added more wood less
than a half an hour ago.

544
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,398
However,

545
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,774
it might be wise
to check it again.

546
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,028
I always have
my hair brushed

547
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,321
before I go to sleep.

548
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,323
I like to hear a story.

549
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,992
Tell us one about the
fire beast of Sullus.

550
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,161
I never understood
the practice in some cultures

551
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,954
of describing
ferocious creatures

552
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,956
in an attempt
to lull children to sleep.

553
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,376
Don't Vulcans tell
bedtime stories?

554
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,379
If my children
had difficulty sleeping,

555
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,089
I would play music for them.

556
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,383
I like music.

557
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,968
Unfortunately,
I don't have my lute.

558
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,220
What's that?

559
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,055
It is a five-stringed
instrument

560
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,057
tuned on a
diatonic scale.

561
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,642
It can be
very soothing.

562
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,730
My youngest son was
particularly fond of it.

563
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,026
He always used to ask me
to play "Falor's Journey."

564
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,571
It is a tale
of enlightenment

565
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,697
consisting
of 348 verses.

566
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,581
It may not be necessary to
include the complete narrative.

567
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,958
Falor was a prosperous merchant

568
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,044
who went on a journey
to gain greater awareness.

569
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:13,173
"Through storms,
he crossed the Voroth Sea

570
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:17,886
"to reach the clouded
shores of Raal,

571
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,180
where old T'Para
offered truth."

572

The windswept hills ♪

573
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:30,983

579

Tuvok! Tuvok!

580
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,755
They're gone.

581
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,939
Captain, you might want
to see this.

582
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,149
Have you found the shuttle?

583
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,318
Actually,
we've found two.

584
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,111
Both crashed
on the surface.

585
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,447
The sensor resolution
is still quite low.

586
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,948
This looks like
our shuttle.

587
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,368
I'd guess the other
one is Drayan.

588
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,744
We've also had
some indications

589
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,287
of life signs
on the surface.

590
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,206
A while ago, there seemed
to be four of them.

591
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,833
Now we can only
distinguish two.

592
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,378
I've been working
on the transporters.

593
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,880
It just isn't possible
to get a pattern lock

594
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,424
through all
the turbulence.

595
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,634
Then we've got to start
considering other options.

596
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,220
I want a full analysis
of the atmospheric conditions

597
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,223
and your best suggestion of how
to get a shuttle to the surface.

598
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,434
Then let's hope
we won't need to try it.

599
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,231
There were no
other life forms

600
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,234
and no unusual energy readings
within sensor range all night.

601
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,485
It was the<i> morrok.</i>

602
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,153
Why don't you believe me?

603
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,156
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Very well.

604
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,158
I'll investigate.

605
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,577
I'd like you
to wait here

606
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,370
while I look
inside the cave.

607
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,581
But if you go in there,

608
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:51,915
you won't come out.

609
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,460
I will take
every possible precaution.

610
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,466
I believe you can be responsible
with this.

611
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,509
Aim like this

612
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,386
and press here
to fire.

613
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,180
I'll seal the shuttle's
door while I'm gone.

614
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,226
No, Tuvok. Don't leave me
all by myself. Please!

615
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,228
If there is anything
in the cave,

616
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,148
it may help us determine
what has been happening here.

617
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,985
It is very important to gather
as much information as possible.

618
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,028
I'm scared.

619
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,616
We often fear
what we do not understand.

620
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,160
Our best defense is knowledge.

621
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,203
You must trust
me, Tressa.

622
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,705
I'll return shortly.

623
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,415
Promise?

624
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,417
I will not abandon you.

625
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:44,384
(<i> console beeping</i> )

626
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,433
(<i> door opens</i> )

627
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,489
What did you see in there?

628
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:33,118
I realize it
may frighten you,

629
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,287
but you must hear
the truth.

630
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,832
Suffice it to say,

631
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,375
I did not find
the other children,

632
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,502
nor do I have
any explanation

633
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,421
of what happened to them.

634
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,799
I'm going to be next,
aren't I?

635
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,341
There's nothing
we can do about it.

636
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,887
The disappearances have
occurred only at night.

637
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,932
We will attempt to leave
here before the sun sets.

638
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:57,434
I'll really be quiet this time.

639
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,685
I won't touch anything.

640
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,187
That would make it
difficult for you

641
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,856
to assist me with repairs.

642
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,067
The Drayans have just
sent another shuttle

643
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,653
down to the moon, Captain.

644
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,530
There must be at least 20
people on the surface.

645
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,031
I can't tell if
the two life-forms

646
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,450
we detected before
are still there.

647
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,619
How many search parties
could it take

648
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,120
to find two crash victims?

649
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,413
Captain, there's a break
in the turbulence.

650
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,206
I'm picking up
a com signal.

651
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,042
<i>Tuvok to</i> Voyager.
Voyager,<i> do you read?</i>

652
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,878
We read you, Tuvok.
Are you all right?

653
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,046
<i>Yes, Captain,</i>
<i>but Ensign Bennet is dead.</i>

654
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,591
We know. We've been trying
to get you off the surface,

655
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,718
but we're having some trouble
with the Drayans.

656
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,553
They insist on sending
their own search parties.

657
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,806
<i>Yes, I have been avoiding them.</i>

658
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,933
Why?<i> </i>
<i>I have a young girl with me</i>

659
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,977
<i>who claims</i>
<i>they have come to kill her.</i>

660
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,104
<i>I was reluctant</i>
<i>to believe it at first,</i>

661
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,815
<i>but several other children</i>
<i>have disappeared.</i>

662
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,900
(<i> static intensifies</i> )

663
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,443
There's nothing
I can do, Captain.

664
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,862
The signal's
breaking up.

665
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,280
Tuvok, what happened
to the other children?

666
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,907
<i>They have disappeared.</i>

667
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,576
<i>Something on this moon</i>
<i>is responsible.</i>

668
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,995
<i>We must leave here.</i>

669
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,579
<i>I'm attempting to repair...</i>

670
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,624
Scan Tuvok's shuttle for damage.

671
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,417
Will he be able to get himself
out of there?

672
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,044
There's no structural damage.

673
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,671
Some power fluctuations.

674
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,339
He should be able to take off.

675
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,132
What if they can't?

676
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,219
Hail the Drayan ship.

677
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,722
ALCIA:
<i>Captain.</i>

678
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,599
First Prelate,
it's come to my attention

679
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,601
that you have a damaged ship
on the surface as well

680
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,436
and there may be survivors.

681
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,230
I'd like to offer our help
in finding them.

682
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,732
Perhaps a joint
rescue operation...

683
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,692
<i>That won't be necessary,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

684
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:29,985
<i>You've been intrusive enough.</i>

685
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,737
Our sensor readings indicate

686
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,405
the people on the surface
may be in trouble.

687
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,781
I'm sure you must be

688
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,867
as concerned
for their safety as we are.

689
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:40,286
<i>There's no reason to fear for</i>
<i>anyone's safety on the crysata.</i>

690
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,873
<i>It's a blessed haven,</i>
<i>sheltered and unspoiled,</i>

691
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,000
<i>which is the very reason</i>
<i>why I can't allow you</i>

692
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,168
<i>to go there</i>
<i>under any circumstances.</i>

693
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,213
Then I regret to inform you
I'll be taking a shuttle

694
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,298
to the surface
without your permission.

695
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,926
<i>That's completely unacceptable.</i>

696
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,552
I believe it's necessary.

697
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,470
<i>If you launch</i>
<i>one of your shuttles,</i>

698
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,222
<i>I will be forced to send</i>
<i>one of ours after you.</i>

699
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,809
First Prelate, it's not my
intention to provoke a conflict.

700
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,102
<i>Well, then leave at once.</i>

701
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,311
I'll be glad to,

702
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,646
as soon as every member
of my crew

703
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,523
is safely back on board
this ship.

704
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,067
Janeway out.

705
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,402
Lieutenant, you're with me.

706
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,072
Mr. Kim, I need
your report.

707
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,240
I've been studying
the energy signature

708
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,617
of the Drayan shuttles.

709
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,410
They're using some kind
of dielectric field

710
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,287
to protect them
from the turbulence.

711
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,789
We could generate
the same kind of field

712
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,248
with our shuttle's
warp coils.

713
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,625
It won't be very stable.

714
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,960
It might be
a rough ride,

715
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,252
but we can make it.

716
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,004
Captain, maybe you shouldn't...

717
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,006
I know the risks, Commander,
but if there's any hope

718
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,841
left for a diplomatic
solution,

719
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,843
I've got to be down there
to see it through.

720
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,982
Let's get through
the preflight quickly.

721
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:54,402
Thrusters, impulse
engines, warp drive...

722
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,446
All propulsion systems
are nominal.

723
00:35:56,446 --> 00:36:00,951
Shields, phasers, inertial
dampers, com system.

724
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,285
I think we've got
all the basics.

725
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,997
Computer, initiate
cold launch sequence.

726
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,791
Or we could just skip
preflight altogether.

727
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,168
Definitely not recommended,
but sometimes necessary.

728
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,045
I'll remember that.

729
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,380
I'm taking the warp drive
off-line.

730
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,508
Setting up the dielectric field.

731
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,927
It's holding, but we'll
have to keep an eye

732
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,386
on the stabilizer integrity.

733
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,888
Janeway to Bridge.

734
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,223
Depressurize the shuttle bay
and open the space doors.

735
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,642
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

736
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,275
Captain, I'm picking up
a Drayan shuttle.

737
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,277
They're on an
intercept course.

738
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,612
Can we outrun them?

739
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,242
The dielectric field

740
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,120
is weakening our
structural integrity.

741
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,330
If we go much faster,
I'm afraid we'll break up.

742
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,874
We're improvising here.

743
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,125
The Drayans aren't.

744
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,751
We're on their home turf.

745
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,378
They have every advantage.

746
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,881
That may be reason enough
for them not to fire on us.

747
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,842
We'll be testing that theory
in a few seconds.

748
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,094
They're about to enter
weapons range, Captain.

749
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,470
Raise shields to maximum

750
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,098
and stand ready
to power the weapons.

751
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,815
Maneuvering thrusters

752
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,525
and impulse engines
are functional.

753
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,485
We're ready to lift off.

754
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,362
What about the electro...?

755
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,573
The currents that
made the ships crash?

756
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,449
I have determined that
a dielectric field

757
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,243
should allow us to
pass through them.

758
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,619
However, you should
still be prepared

759
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,913
for some turbulence.

760
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,083
Initiating prelaunch sequence.

761
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,668
Number three thruster
is failing.

762
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,961
Attempting to stabilize.

763
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,384
Drayan shuttle's
closing fast, Captain.

764
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,053
They'll overtake us
before we can land.

765
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,679
They haven't powered
their weapon systems.

766
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,556
Maybe they're
still willing to talk.

767
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,726
Let's hope the ones on the
surface feel the same way.

768
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,688
We'll be through this ionosphere
in a few more minutes.

769
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,232
Sensors are clearing up.

770
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,609
I'm reading Tuvok's shuttle.

771
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,527
He's trying to lift off,
but it looks

772
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,113
like there's some trouble
with the thrusters.

773
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,530
(<i> console beeps</i> )

774
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,282
And there's
a large Drayan search party

775
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,034
approaching his location.

776
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,079
I see them.

777
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,039
They're coming
all around us.

778
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,665
We've got to go--<i> Now.</i>

779
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,417
I'm attempting
an emergency procedure.

780
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,128
Please move away
from the console.

781
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,603
You did it!

782
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,105
You saved me.

783
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,565
I regret that may be
a premature conclusion.

784
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,276
The process
of powering the thrusters

785
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:42,028
has left us with minimal shields
and no functional weapons.

786
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,614
<i>Voyager</i> will be
watching for us.

787
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,865
When we clear the atmosphere,

788
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,159
we can be transported
aboard the ship.

789
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,910
Then what are we going to do?

790
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,412
You may request asylum
with the Federation if you wish.

791
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,290
Then we'll be able
to protect you.

792
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,167
I want to stay with you.

793
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,709
(<i> console beeping</i> )

794
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,586
The Drayan shuttle
is hailing us.

795
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,588
<i>You're holding</i>
<i>one of our children.</i>

796
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,798
<i>I want to speak to her.</i>

797
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,758
She believes
you intend to kill her.

798
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,010
Is that true?

799
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,886
<i>The child is confused.</i>

800
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,471
<i>I only want to help her.</i>

801
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,223
You want me to die.

802
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:13,434
<i>Tressa, I understand how</i>
<i>confusing this must be for you.</i>

803
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,021
<i>If you return to the surface,</i>
<i>I will answer all questions.</i>

804
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,773
No. I'm not going back there.

805
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,650
I'm staying with Tuvok.

806
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,195
We can resolve this matter
aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

807
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,864
<i>Unacceptable.</i>
<i>If you or any of your people</i>

808
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,615
<i>attempt to take Tressa</i>
<i>back to your ship,</i>

809
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,826
<i>I will use any means necessary</i>
<i>to stop you.</i>

810
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,828
Do what you will.

811
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,123
<i>Very well.</i>

812
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,457
<i>Fire.</i>

813
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,130
(<i> screaming</i> )

814
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,798
We weren't hit.

815
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,675
I believe that was a warning.

816
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,013
I've got phasers locked on
the Drayan shuttle, Captain.

817
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,389
Don't fire.

818
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,099
We might be able
to transport Tuvok from here.

819
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,642
(<i> beeping</i> )

820
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,561
There's still
too much interference.

821
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,438
We should be close enough
to get a com-signal through.

822
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:02,025
Tuvok, we're on our
way to the surface.

823
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,693
We'll intercept you
in a few moments.

824
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,278
<i>That may be too late, Captain.</i>

825
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,821
<i>I'm losing power rapidly.</i>

826
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,575
<i>I believe another hit</i>
<i>will force me to land.</i>

827
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,952
Go back down to the surface.
We'll follow you.

828
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,792
It's getting dark.

829
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,502
What's going
to happen to me?

830
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,505
All I can tell you is,
I will be here with you.

831
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,216
(<i> vegetation rustling</i> )

832
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,263
Mr. Tuvok, don't
make this difficult.

833
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,390
She's been frightened enough.

834
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,682
What she fears most

835
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,601
is being kept here
against her wishes.

836
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,019
This is a critical time.

837
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,813
I can't allow you
to interfere.

838
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,279
I regret it's
come to this.

839
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,488
You have found your crew member.
Now go.

840
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,157
I will not leave
without Tressa.

841
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,826
She has asked for my protection,
and I intend to provide it.

842
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,205
You simply don't understand
the harm you're doing.

843
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,748
This child wants to live.

844
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,126
We're going to do
whatever we can to help her.

845
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,877
It is not a choice.

846
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,670
This is her time.

847
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,881
Tressa has reached
the end of her life.

848
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,300
She has barely begun it.

849
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,344
<i>She</i> is 96 years old.

850
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,141
Tressa, these people
are outsiders.

851
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,935
They don't understand
how we live.

852
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:22,188
They see us as strange because
their aging process is reversed.

853
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,732
Please, you don't belong
with them.

854
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,234
I'm here to help you now.

855
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,361
No. Leave me alone.

856
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,448
It's perfectly natural
to be frightened.

857
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,825
You're taking a step
into the unknown.

858
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,244
The attendants would have
helped you prepare yourself.

859
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,163
You were never meant to face
this time alone.

860
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,747
We weren't alone.

861
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,166
Tuvok was here.

862
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,918
He stayed with us
and made us feel safe.

863
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,171
He told us there was no<i> morrok</i>

864
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,713
and that we shouldn't be afraid.

865
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,590
He took care of us...

866
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,804
even when we didn't behave
as well as Vulcan children.

867
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,514
He was right
about the<i> morrok.</i>

868
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,476
It only exists in stories.

869
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,645
At this age,
they become easily confused.

870
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,314
Their memories are clouded.

871
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:06,107
Near the end of life,
we reach

872
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,193
a stage of complete innocence.

873
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,529
We free ourselves from all
responsibilities to this life,

874
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,031
then we leave it peacefully.

875
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,991
Tressa doesn't seem to be ready.

876
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,784
Perhaps she needs more time.

877
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,496
That's not for you or me
to decide.

878
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,664
This is
a normal biological process,

879
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,541
which begins
the day we are created.

880
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,002
The energy contained
within our bodies

881
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,671
remains cohesive
for a limited number of years,

882
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,922
and then it is released.

883
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,966
Nothing can change that.

884
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,718
Nothing?

885
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,178
No.

886
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,514
It's the natural course of life.

887
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,725
Why was it so important
that Tressa stay here?

888
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,311
We believe this is where the
first spark of life was created.

889
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,812
We are all compelled

890
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,024
by a powerful instinct
to return here at the end,

891
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:51,777
to complete the cycle
and rejoin the infinite energy.

892
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,112
Tressa?

893
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,613
Do you feel it calling to you?

894
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,366
Tuvok?

895
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,620
She can offer you
better guidance than I.

896
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,664
You said you would protect me.

897
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,874
I cannot protect you

898
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,918
from the natural
conclusion of life,

899
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,504
nor would I try.

900
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,714
Vulcans consider death

901
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,259
to be the completion
of a journey.

902
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,553
There is nothing to fear.

903
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:21,015
I won't be afraid,
not if you're with me.

904
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,018
Tressa,

905
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:28,398
may this night
see you safely home.

906
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:32,777
Attending a child on the crysata
is an honorable role.

907
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,321
You have fulfilled it well.

908
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,701
The final moment of life
is the most sacred,

909
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,495
most private time.

910
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,665
I hope you can accept
my sincere apologies

911
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,501
for disturbing
your traditions.

912
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,171
Perhaps we've each misjudged
the other, Captain.

913
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,798
I would hate to let that ruin

914
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,259
any possibility of friendship
between our people.

915
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,930
We must leave them.

916
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:07,312
Tuvok, can your shuttle
make it back to<i> Voyager?</i>

917
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,188
Maybe we should wait for you.

918
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,773
No, I'll be fine.

919
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,658
We'll wait here
as long as you like.

920
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,119
I know it's time.

921
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,624
My only regret is leaving
my family, my grandson.

922
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,750
You remind me
of him sometimes.

923
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:36,591
You will still be with
them, in their thoughts,

924
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:40,386
as you will be in mine.
