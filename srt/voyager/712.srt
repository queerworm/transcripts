1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,798
Good morning.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,758
You're in a good mood.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,844
It's another beautiful day
in the Delta Quadrant.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,637
What did <i>you</i> have for breakfast?

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,099
I'll see you tonight.

6
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,314
-Here you are, lieutenant.
-Thank you.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,321
Nice job, ensign.

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,495
You keep the warp field that stable,
you might get us home a few years early.

9
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,627
The <i>Starfleet</i> Manual
allows for a variance of .3.

10
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,088
That's only a guideline.
You can do better.

11
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,512
I don't remember
giving you permission to work here.

12
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,389
I'm sorry, lieutenant.

13
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,850
I'm helping him study warp mechanics.

14
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,437
You should have notified me.
It's a busy day, and I--

15
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,397
Lieutenant.

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,899
I'm fine.

17
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,692
[groans]

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,618
-I'm detecting another life sign.
-Where?

19
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,536
Inside Lieutenant Torres.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,246
It could be a parasite.

21
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,797
-Seven of Nine to the doctor.
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

22
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,883
I'll be accompanying
Lieutenant Torres to Sick Bay.

23
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,510
[doctor]
<i>What's wrong?</i>

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,553
I believe she's pregnant.

25
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,173
{\an8}The fetus appears
to be about seven weeks old

26
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,799
and doing quite well.

27
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,676
{\an8}So are you.

28
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,178
{\an8}Why did she faint?

29
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,473
Klingon and human metabolisms
sometimes clash.

30
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,725
{\an8}Tell me about it.

31
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,518
{\an8}It's not uncommon
for such pregnancies

32
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,605
{\an8}to cause biochemical
fluctuations in the mother.

33
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,857
{\an8}-Is that serious?
-Not usually.

34
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,737
{\an8}You can expect some behavioral volatility,
increased nutritional needs.

35
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,282
{\an8}Creating new life is, uh, a big job.

36
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,993
{\an8}Hmm, creating new life.

37
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,454
I can't believe it.

38
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,540
{\an8}I don't mean to be indelicate,

39
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,459
but weren't you trying to get pregnant?

40
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,004
{\an8}Well, of course. I mean...

41
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,174
{\an8}Well, we knew we wanted a family.

42
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,927
{\an8}But the odds against
human-Klingon conception are so high.

43
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,597
{\an8}Well, apparently you've beaten the odds.
May I be the first to congratulate you?

44
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,351
When is the baby due?

45
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,687
Normally, Klingon pregnancies
run 30 weeks,

46
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,106
but with mixed species,
it could be sooner.

47
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,734
-Is it a girl or a boy?
-No, don't tell.

48
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,653
I want to be surprised.

49
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,948
We've already been surprised.

50
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,326
I just don't see any reason
to have to label the baby.

51
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,829
I don't want to know the gender.
I don't want to have to pick a name yet.

52
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,038
Okay, okay.

53
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,457
Mommy knows best.

54
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,751
"Mommy"?

55
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,174
I wonder if the holodeck
has any child-rearing programs.

56
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,385
There are some things
you just can't simulate.

57
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,680
-I will take whatever help I can get.
-We should get our quarters ready.

58
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,224
Maybe I can replicate
one of those antique cribs.

59
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,559
And put it where?

60
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,436
We'll need to rearrange the living area.

61
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,062
We need to do a lot more than that.

62
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,274
You're happy about this, right?

63
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,817
Of course I'm happy.

64
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,404
-Just a little overwhelmed, that's all.
-Me, too.

65
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,824
Can we keep this to ourselves
for a while?

66
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,784
Absolutely.

67
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,954
[chuckles]

68
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,249
[both laugh]

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,792
I, uh, need to get to work.

70
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,795
See you later...

71
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,672
Dad.

72
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,681
Great.

73
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,349
Congratulations, Tom.

74
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,559
Thanks.

75
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,311
-How did you find out?
-Icheb.

76
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,607
Oh, he wasn't supposed to tell?

77
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,943
Well, we were hoping to keep it private
for an hour or so.

78
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:07,533
As they say on Talax, "<i>Omara s'alas."</i>

79
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,660
Good news has no clothes.

80
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,329
[laughs]

81
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,206
Thanks. I guess.

82
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,043
Mm. Now, my good news would be
learning that I'll be the godfather.

83
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,213
I do have experience
with Naomi Wildman, you know.

84
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,257
I can't think of anyone more qualified.

85
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:28,721
Well, in that case, I've been making up
a list of names. Tell me...

86
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,685
Have you checked the warp core
for radiation leaks today?

87
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,270
No. Why?

88
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,898
You have a certain glow about you.

89
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,361
Okay, who told you?

90
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,614
I just heard. Congratulations.

91
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,698
[laughs]

92
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,368
-Thanks.
-Seven said you were dizzy.

93
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,953
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

94
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,622
Nothing ever rattled her,
not even the Cardassians.

95
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,706
This is scarier.

96
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,376
-Would you like some time off?
-To do what?

97
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,669
Adjust.

98
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,837
This is a big change.

99
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,757
I'll work during the day, sleep at night,
and have the baby when it's time.

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,927
Well, if you need to cut back
on your duties,

101
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,138
I'm sure Seven would be happy
to fill in for you.

102
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,431
I think I can handle it.

103
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,475
Congratulations, buddy.

104
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,270
Where did<i> you</i> hear the news?
In the datastream from Earth?

105
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,689
Actually, I think
it was a transmission from the Borg.

106
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,442
It's all over now.

107
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,360
No more late nights on the holodeck.

108
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945
No more racing the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

109
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,823
Don't you think you're
exaggerating just a little?

110
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,118
I've seen it happen.
The new dad gets tied down with family.

111
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,411
Old friends drop away.

112
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,122
It's fatherhood, Harry, not exile.

113
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,248
If you say so.

114
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,876
Kidding aside, how's it feel?

115
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,420
Well, it's...

116
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,256
It's not quite real yet.

117
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,383
Maybe that's what pregnancy's for.

118
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,510
Time to let reality sink in

119
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,847
before your life spins out of control.

120
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,944
[sighs]

121
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,237
You need any help?

122
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:13,409
Mr. Paris, this may be the first time
you've ever volunteered to assist me.

123
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,745
Really?

124
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,455
Well, we ought to change that.

125
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,540
I mean, we've known each other
a long time.

126
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,250
We ought to work more closely.

127
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,502
I'll keep that in mind.

128
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,007
So I guess you've heard
B'Elanna and I are gonna have a baby.

129
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,343
I was unaware.

130
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,429
Ohh, finally, someone who doesn't know.

131
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,183
Allow me to extend my best wishes.

132
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,351
Thanks.

133
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,063
You know, a baby is, uhm...

134
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,899
it's a big responsibility,

135
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,318
but I'm ready for it.

136
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,030
Not that you can ever be
completely ready.

137
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,115
Can you?

138
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,912
Lieutenant, are you asking me
for advice about fatherhood?

139
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,415
Well, I don't know anyone else
who's been through it.

140
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,211
I'm afraid my parenting skills
are somewhat dormant.

141
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,463
It's been many years
since my children were young.

142
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,591
Well then, you've had a long
time to think back on it.

143
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,134
Any helpful hints?

144
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,222
Offspring can be disturbingly illogical,

145
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,559
yet profoundly fulfilling.

146
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,979
You should anticipate paradox.

147
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,315
I'll remember that.

148
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,485
If you'd like my counsel
on more specific issues...

149
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,614
Something tells me
I'm going to be volunteering

150
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,449
to work with you on a regular basis.

151
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,087
-So?
-Looks nice.

152
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,883
Well, I figured quiet, romantic dinners

153
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,719
may soon be a thing of the past.

154
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,512
[sighs]

155
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,056
Tough day?

156
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,269
The Captain practically
relieved me of duty

157
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,731
as if I couldn't handle being an engineer
and being pregnant at the same time.

158
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,651
Well, if you ever need a baby-sitter,
"Godfather Neelix" is ready to go.

159
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,695
Chakotay wants to be godfather.

160
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,364
Well, Neelix already
has a list of names.

161
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,284
Now, I don't mind people
suggesting names.

162
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:22,997
What annoys me is all of the free advice
about feeding, discipline.

163
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,665
Folk wisdom is my favorite.

164
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,626
According to Chell,

165
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,670
Bolians believe
that if you give birth near a warp core

166
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,672
it'll improve the baby's disposition.

167
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,258
Why does everybody feel
they're entitled to give us advice?

168
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,426
This is <i>our </i>child.

169
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,055
Well, people should know better
than to interfere with a Klingon mother.

170
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,848
What's that supposed to mean?

171
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,351
Nothing. It was a joke.

172
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,311
What does being Klingon
have to do with it?

173
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,355
-Hey, take it easy.
-I don't want to take it easy.

174
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,774
I want everybody to back off
and just let me...

175
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,825
The doctor said I might experience
some behavioral volatility.

176
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,786
I guess this is it.

177
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,163
[sighs]

178
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,623
Well, forget about the doctor.

179
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,378
Forget the Captain
and all the godfathers.

180
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,380
-Maybe you're right.
-I know I am.

181
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,550
This isn't about
their expectations or hopes

182
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,762
or doubts.

183
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,640
None of this belongs to them.

184
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,434
It belongs to us.

185
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,104
All of it.

186
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,189
Lucky us.

187
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,776
[doctor]
<i>Lieutenants Torres and Paris</i>

188
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,194
<i>please report to Sick Bay.</i>

189
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,992
It's a holographic extrapolation
of your child's spine,

190
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,245
approximately ten months after birth.

191
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,871
-It's deviated.
-Yes.

192
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,790
There's a pronounced
curvature to the left.

193
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,291
Can it be corrected?

194
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,252
I had surgery for it when I was a baby.

195
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,463
-You never told me that.
-My mother had it, too.

196
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,426
It tends to run in Klingon families,
especially among females.

197
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,638
Are you saying that this baby is a girl?

198
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,098
No, I didn't say that.

199
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,641
But it is a girl, right?

200
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,852
You cannot infer that.

201
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,603
It's okay. You might as well just tell us.

202
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,898
Yes.

203
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,316
It's a girl.

204
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,612
And aside from the deviated spine,
she's healthy.

205
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,282
Will <i>she</i> need surgery?

206
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,367
Fortunately,
we've advanced beyond that.

207
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,744
Genetic modification
is the treatment of choice.

208
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,291
If you can project an image of the spine,

209
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,503
can you use the genetic data
to show us the whole baby?

210
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,508
I could.
It would only be an approximation.

211
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,803
-Let's take a look.
-I don't know.

212
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,055
Oh, come on. Aren't you curious?

213
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,434
Okay.

214
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,615
Oh, she's beautiful.

215
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,328
-Forehead ridges?
-[doctor] Yes.

216
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,997
But she's only one-quarter Klingon.

217
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,958
Klingon traits remain dominant
for several generations,

218
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,543
even with a single ancestor.

219
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,629
Oh, she looks just like her mother.

220
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,718
You are so much like your mother.

221
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,597
[Paris]
<i>She's perfect.</i>

222
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,308
Isn't she?

223
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,072
Oh, what a day.

224
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,157
Mm-hmm.

225
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,201
Six years in the Delta Quadrant

226
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,746
and nothing has ever scared me as much
as hearing our baby had a problem.

227
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,164
It's not much of a problem.

228
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,876
-Oh, well, we didn't know that at first.
-Now we know.

229
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,798
And we also know that the doctor

230
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,342
is going to fix everything
tomorrow morning.

231
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,345
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,265
It's a lot to take in all at once,

233
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,975
and I'm really tired.

234
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,353
We could both use some sleep.

235
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,522
Computer, dim the lights.

236
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,280
Somebody make sure
those coals are completely out.

237
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,614
I'll get it, Dad.

238
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,451
You kids be careful
and be back before sunset.

239
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,453
And bring your appetites
we're having fish for dinner.

240
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,955
If you two can catch any.

241
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,417
Dad, I increased the field strength
of the targeting lure.

242
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,461
Ooh, those fish don't stand a chance.

243
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,674
You better get going.
Your cousins aren't going to wait forever.

244
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,927
I was thinking maybe I could go fishing
with you and Uncle Carl.

245
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,222
I thought you were
looking forward to the hike?

246
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,766
Just the kids.
No dads to slow you down.

247
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,727
They don't like me.

248
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,645
Why would you say that?

249
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,689
Because it's true.

250
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,025
[girl]
Come on, B'Elanna, let's go.

251
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,652
See?

252
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,073
Now, go on. Have a good time.

253
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,534
Dad?

254
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,953
What is it?

255
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,248
Nothing.

256
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,471
Relax. We're not that late.

257
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,222
The doctor scheduled me at 0800.

258
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,935
You still have time for my favorite
gourmet breakfast: peanut butter toast.

259
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,269
I'm too tired to eat.

260
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,063
Well, if you're having
trouble sleeping now,

261
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,315
wait till those
0200 feedings come around.

262
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,691
You'll be in charge of those.

263
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,193
[chuckles]
I can't wait.

264
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,697
Look, uh, you don't
have to come with me.

265
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,074
It's a minor procedure.

266
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,827
Wouldn't you like some moral support?

267
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,913
I'm not an invalid.

268
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,542
Well, in that case, you're on your own.
That goes for breakfast, too.

269
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,132
I've been expanding my database
in obstetrics and pediatrics.

270
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,926
You haven't found another problem,
have you?

271
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,138
No, not at all, but I have put together
a prenatal enrichment program.

272
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,515
Why am I not surprised?

273
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,018
I'd like to start
with trans-abdominal vocalization.

274
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,479
Let me guess.
You're going to sing to my fetus.

275
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,064
Through a diatonal amplifier.

276
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,275
It's quite safe, and it should enhance
the child's mathematical abilities.

277
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,820
-Can we talk about this later?
-Absolutely.

278
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,155
At our first parenting class.

279
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,365
Parenting class.

280
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,076
Birthing techniques, feeding options,
bonding strategies.

281
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,662
It's not all hard work, though.
We'll have ample time for fun.

282
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,580
-Could we get on with it?
-Certainly.

283
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,959
Computer, dim lights.

284
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,337
I hope you don't expect me
to sleep through this.

285
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,630
Of course not.

286
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,882
The darkness encourages
vascular dilation.

287
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,469
Now, you may feel a slight tingling.
Please remain as still as possible.

288
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,183
B'Elanna, come have lunch.

289
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,978
That's okay. I'm not hungry.

290
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,521
You better eat while you can.

291
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,523
You know our dads
aren't going to catch any fish.

292
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,533
-Here.
-[Torres] Thanks.

293
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,161
Your mom wasn't sure
you'd be able to come this weekend.

294
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,954
I had a lot of schoolwork.

295
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,789
Well, I'm glad you made it.

296
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,249
[Torres]
That's nice of you to say.

297
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,710
-B'Elanna, can you hand me a drink?
-Okay.

298
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,589
Thanks.

299
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,342
[screams]

300
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,802
[both laughing]

301
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,556
My teacher said Klingons like live food.

302
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,724
[grunts]

303
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,642
Hey, stop it! Stop.

304
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,978
-It was just a joke.
-It was a stupid joke, Dean.

305
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,355
He's always doing stuff like that to me.

306
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,690
[growls]

307
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,984
-Don't be mad, B'Elanna.
-B'Elanna, wait!

308
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,861
{\an8}[doctor]
Computer, raise lights.

309
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,951
Your daughter's spinal column
is now perfectly aligned.

310
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,287
Is she going to be all right?

311
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,290
Better than all right
if her parents are any indication.

312
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:19,139
Computer,
access B'Elanna Torres' medical file.

313
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,474
<i>File accessed.</i>

314
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,353
Project a holographic image
of the baby.

315
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,069
Now, extrapolate what the child's
facial features will look like

316
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,947
at 12 years old.

317
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,124
Display the fetus genome.

318
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,002
Delete the following gene sequences.

319
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,302
Extrapolate what the child would look like
with those genetic changes.

320
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,852
Delete the following sequences.

321
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,523
Extrapolate.

322
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,789
Save changes.

323
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,668
Restrict access to this file:

324
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,920
B'Elanna Torres only.

325
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,930
There's no valid medical reason
to do what you're proposing.

326
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,015
I disagree.

327
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,934
You want to delete
entire DNA sequences.

328
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,228
The genes that create
redundant organs, for example.

329
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,855
They're superfluous.

330
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,648
Those redundancies
are there for a reason.

331
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,151
Does my daughter need
a third lung to survive?

332
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,696
Strictly speaking, no,
but having it may be beneficial.

333
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,656
Some geneticists
believe the extra lung evolved

334
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,783
to give Klingons greater stamina
on the battlefield.

335
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,578
My daughter is not going
to be a Klingon warrior.

336
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,664
With all due respect, you have no idea
what your daughter's going to be!

337
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,712
What if she develops
an interest in athletics?

338
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,631
Greater lung capacity
would be an advantage.

339
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,343
The point is, there's no reason
to arbitrarily remove genetic traits.

340
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,844
It's not arbitrary!

341
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,680
-It's preventive.
-How so?

342
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,183
That third lung could
become diseased, couldn't it?

343
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,684
I suppose.

344
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,145
What I'm suggesting is no different
than removing an appendix

345
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,813
before it becomes inflamed.

346
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,734
Why tamper with biological systems
that have evolved over eons?

347
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,153
Like curvature of the spine?

348
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,410
If I make these changes,
it'll affect her appearance.

349
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,121
I'm aware of that.

350
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,831
Are you also aware

351
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,752
that some of these genes
influence behavior, personality?

352
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,421
None of that's
as important as her health.

353
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,717
What does Tom think about all this?

354
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,553
I wanted to see what you thought first.

355
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,889
Well, as you can see,
I'm very dubious.

356
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,435
Look, I've done statistical analyses,
epidemiology.

357
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,604
At least review my work.

358
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,148
All right, I'll look at it.

359
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,944
But in the meantime...

360
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
I suggest you have a talk
with your husband.

361
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,741
Absolutely not.

362
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,577
This is our child's health
we're talking about.

363
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,037
No, it's more than that.

364
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,582
You want to change who she <i>is.</i>

365
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,126
Her individuality, her...

366
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,173
You don't want her to be Klingon.

367
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,886
That's what this is really about,
isn't it?

368
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,306
You're trying to protect her
from being Klingon,

369
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,308
because you had a rough time
when you were a kid.

370
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,477
I was treated like a monster.

371
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,439
That isn't going to happen
to our daughter.

372
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,443
Everyone on<i> Voyager</i>
will accept her for who she really is.

373
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,695
That's easy for you to say.
You're human.

374
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,488
Meaning what, exactly?

375
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,783
Meaning you don't understand
what it's like.

376
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,830
Okay, then, tell me.

377
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,209
When the people around you
are all one way and you're not,

378
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,381
you can't help feeling
like there's something wrong with you.

379
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,177
But<i> Voyager</i> isn't just one way.

380
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,097
We've got Bajorans,
Vulcans, a Talaxian...

381
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,308
And 140 humans.

382
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:36,354
Our daughter is going to have
a mixed heritage, just like her mother.

383
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,775
It's something you'll have in common,
something she should be proud of.

384
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,319
-Why destroy that?
-I'm not destroying anything!

385
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,740
Gene resequencing isn't a weapon.
It's a tool.

386
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,200
Like a hyperspanner!

387
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,452
She's not a machine.
She's our daughter.

388
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,832
I'm not exactly sure
what you want me to do.

389
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,878
I want you to order the doctor
to genetically alter my child.

390
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,838
Do you see what I'm dealing with here?

391
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,758
What you're asking for
is ethically questionable.

392
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,928
The doctor has reservations,
your husband is against it.

393
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,805
I only want to do what you did

394
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,641
for Seven of Nine.

395
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,603
-I beg your pardon?
-You had her implants removed.

396
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,980
I don't see the connection.

397
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,691
You altered her physiology.
You changed who she was.

398
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,194
I was acting in her best interests.

399
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,278
That's all I'm doing.

400
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,947
Seven was born human.

401
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,574
The captain just helped
to restore her original physiology.

402
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,493
And gave her a much better
life in the process.

403
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,120
Our child isn't even born yet.

404
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,996
How do you know what's going to
make her life better?

405
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,457
I just don't want her
to start at a disadvantage.

406
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,377
Look, the doctor said you might
experience mood swings...

407
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,797
That's it. Just dismiss my argument
as some kind of hormonal outburst!

408
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,258
-I didn't mean that!
-Stop it, both of you.

409
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,515
The biggest problem
you two have isn't ethical...

410
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,600
it's marital.

411
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,729
I'm happy to offer you advice as a friend,
but as your captain,

412
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,691
I am not going to overrule
the Chief Medical Officer.

413
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,276
You two need to work this out.

414
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,367
-B'Elanna.
-What?

415
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,495
You heard the captain.
We have to work this out.

416
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,831
There's nothing to work out.
You're getting what you want.

417
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,959
What I want is to have
a civilized discussion with my wife.

418
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,419
[sighs]

419
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,921
Maybe a change of scenery would help.
How about the holodeck?

420
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,549
-That's your solution to everything.
-At least I'm trying.

421
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,302
Look, I don't care where we do it,
but we have to talk this out.

422
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,761
I am tired of talking, all right?

423
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,268
[playing jazz melody]

424
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,356
[door chimes]

425
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,489
Do I need a reservation?

426
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,782
What happened?

427
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,577
I think B'Elanna and I
need some time apart.

428
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,913
My couch is your couch.

429
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:05,503
She's barely pregnant
and already we're having a major crisis.

430
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,339
You'll make up. You always do.

431
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,717
Yeah, but that's what worries me.
We're always fighting and making up.

432
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,344
How's that going to affect
our daughter?

433
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,262
She's going to have a great life.

434
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,516
Piloting the ship from your lap,
battling Dr. Chaotica on the holodeck.

435
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,354
Yeah, unless B'Elanna thinks
battling is too Klingon.

436
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,358
She's always been sensitive
about being part Klingon. You know that.

437
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,692
That doesn't give her the right

438
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,611
to turn our child
into a science experiment.

439
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,989
But it does explain
why this is so important to her.

440
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,159
[sighs]
What am I supposed to do?

441
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,080
Maybe you should tell her
you understand.

442
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,831
What good would that do?

443
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,919
It might make her less defensive,

444
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,880
then maybe it would be easier
for her to see your point of view.

445
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,424
Yeah? What if she can't?

446
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,513
Like I said, my couch is your couch.

447
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,365
She should be back by now.

448
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,326
Nobody has any idea where she went?

449
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,370
She just ran off down there.

450
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,580
I'm going to go look for her.

451
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,000
-Uncle John?
-Yeah?

452
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,670
I... It...

453
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,005
[rustling]

454
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,048
[John] B'Elanna.
Where have you been?

455
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,554
I'm sorry. I got kind of separated.

456
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,681
It was our fault.

457
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,767
It was Dean's fault.
He put a worm in her sandwich.

458
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,811
I was just kidding.

459
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,230
I'm really sorry.

460
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,149
Forget it.

461
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,611
Come on. Let's get dinner started.

462
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,497
-You want to talk about it?
-I just wish--

463
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,000
-You wish what?
-I wish I weren't Klingon.

464
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,338
-Now, why would you say that?
-Because everyone makes fun of me.

465
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,300
-Who's everyone?
-Dean, kids at school.

466
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,469
They all hate me.

467
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,932
Did I ever tell you what the kids
at my school used to call me?

468
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,811
I used to fall asleep
in class all the time,

469
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,441
so instead of John Torres,
they called me John "Snore-ez."

470
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,027
It's not the same thing.

471
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,153
Of course it is.

472
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,821
Kids tease each other.

473
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,241
They can be very cruel,
but it doesn't mean that they hate you

474
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,618
or that they hate Klingons.

475
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,286
You don't understand!

476
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,872
I think I do.

477
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,709
You have to learn
to be a little less sensitive.

478
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,504
Fine.

479
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,839
[kids laughing]

480
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,884
Now come on. Uncle Carl's going to tell
one of his famous fish stories.

481
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,804
I'd rather just read.

482
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,641
Suit yourself.

483
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,898
[kids laughing]

484
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,484
Did you know there are fish around here
that have wings?

485
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,069
Flying fish?

486
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,030
It's true. I'm telling you.
We saw one.

487
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,573
-Oh, yeah.
-[Michael] Really?

488
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,492
John, didn't we see
a flying fish today?

489
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,576
We sure did.

490
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,912
Jumped five feet in the air,
flew right into my lap.

491
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,080
[Michael] Oh, no!

492
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,748
I jumped into Uncle John's lap.

493
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,166
[all laughing]

494
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,319
Everybody asleep?

495
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,529
They were exhausted.

496
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,907
-Coffee?
-Sure.

497
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,995
-Listen, I'm sorry.
-For what?

498
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,955
The way Dean treated B'Elanna.

499
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,623
I had a talk with him.

500
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,334
He was just doing
what 11-year-olds do.

501
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,213
I'm sure B'Elanna overreacted.

502
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,674
What makes you say that?

503
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,261
She's too damn sensitive.

504
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,846
What do you mean?
She's a great kid.

505
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,640
You haven't been around her much
the last couple of years.

506
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:32,270
She's gotten moody,
unpredictable, argumentative.

507
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,772
Just like her mother.

508
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,399
[Carl] I thought you loved
Miral's intensity.

509
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,444
Everything's become a fight with her.

510
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,572
I guess the older I get,
the less intensity I can handle.

511
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,117
It's funny how Mom and Dad
always turn out to be right.

512
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,077
What do you mean?

513
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,497
Mom warned me not to marry Miral.

514
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,749
Mom loved Miral.

515
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,125
[John]
Sure, she did,

516
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,295
but she never thought I had
the constitution to live with a Klingon

517
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,632
and now I'm living with two of them.

518
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,010
[sighs]

519
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,930
[Chakotay]
Taya.

520
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,431
What?

521
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,601
Taya. It's the feminine
form of Chakotay.

522
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,685
What do you think?

523
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,272
I'll add it to the list,
right after "Floxia."

524
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,608
Neelix suggested that one.
It's number 32.

525
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,529
On second thought, you and Tom ought
to come up with your own name.

526
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,990
I knew there was a reason
I always liked you.

527
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,954
You look like you've been up all night.
Want to get some coffee?

528
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,623
That's the best offer
I've had all week.

529
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,837
-Morning.
-Hi.

530
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,089
Join us for breakfast?

531
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,718
You know what? I forgot my padd.

532
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,222
Why don't you two go ahead?
I'll meet you in the Mess Hall.

533
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,600
So, how are you today?

534
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,020
I haven't changed my mind,
if that's what you mean.

535
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,232
No, what I meant was, how are <i>you?</i>

536
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,403
I've been better, but I'll get over it.

537
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,240
You know, Harry has the
lumpiest pillows on the ship.

538
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,411
He snores, keeps the room way too hot.

539
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,541
I missed you.

540
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,002
Me, too.

541
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,215
I still owe you that slice
of peanut butter toast.

542
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,886
Why don't we go back to our quarters,
fire up the toaster?

543
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,680
Sounds nice.

544
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,682
[doctor] <i>Lieutenant Torres,</i>
<i>Lieutenant Paris,</i>

545
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,766
<i>please report to Sick Bay.</i>

546
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,690
I've reviewed the data you gave me,
and I've also done my own analysis.

547
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,859
Skip the details, doctor.

548
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,570
You've already made it clear
what you think of my proposal.

549
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,406
-Actually, I've changed my opinion.
-What?

550
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,452
The genetic alterations you've suggested
are necessary.

551
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,913
On what grounds?

552
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,249
The "clash" I mentioned between
Klingon and human metabolism.

553
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,044
It's more extensive than I realized.

554
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,921
How extensive?

555
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,424
Theoretically, it could lead
to complete metabolic failure.

556
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,217
But you can fix it?

557
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,929
By eliminating most of her Klingon
genetic material.

558
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,972
Are you sure about all of this?

559
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,476
My analysis was quite thorough.

560
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,186
If our circumstances were different,

561
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,938
you would be free
to seek a second opinion.

562
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:25,777
No offense, doc, but I am just trying
to understand what's going on.

563
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,363
You're welcome to review my findings,

564
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,617
but let me stress
it would be unwise to delay this too long.

565
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,410
Why?

566
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,329
The fetus is at a critical
stage of development.

567
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,997
Antibodies have begun to form.

568
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,627
How long do we have?

569
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,921
I've scheduled the procedure
for tomorrow morning,

570
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,673
with your permission.

571
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,183
I want to thank you both
for helping B'Elanna when she fainted.

572
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,352
I'm glad it wasn't a parasite.

573
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,270
[Paris]
You probably don't know this,

574
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,481
but there may be some problems
with the pregnancy.

575
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,566
I'm sorry to hear that.

576
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,194
[Paris] The doctor suggested
a treatment for the baby

577
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,239
but his findings are very
confusing, at least to me.

578
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,326
You have some expertise in genetics.
Do you mind taking a look at this?

579
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,536
Of course not.

580
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,834
Whatever the problem is,
I have no doubt the doctor will solve it.

581
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,210
I hope you're right.

582
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,212
Your confusion is understandable.

583
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,756
There's a computational error.

584
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,884
It's not like the doctor
to make a mistake.

585
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,804
I didn't think that was possible,

586
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,015
unless there's some sort
of glitch in his program.

587
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,684
-I'll run a diagnostic.
-Thank you.

588
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,646
Please tell Lieutenant Torres
if there's anything I can do...

589
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,482
I'll let her know. Thanks.

590
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,317
It appears to be more than a glitch.

591
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,071
I believe the doctor's program
has been tampered with.

592
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,034
B'Elanna, this is Tom. Respond.

593
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,496
Computer, locate Lieutenant Torres.

594
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,166
<i>Lieutenant Torres is in Sick Bay.</i>

595
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:09,338
Frankly, I'm relieved you decided
not to wait till the last minute.

596
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,591
Once this is behind us,
I'm sure we'll all feel better.

597
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,392
Someone's blocked
communications to Sick Bay.

598
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,061
See if you can deactivate the doctor.

599
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,397
Access to his program
has been restricted.

600
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,815
Keep trying.

601
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,817
-Paris to Tuvok.
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

602
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,194
Meet me in Sick Bay.

603
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,238
Why would she alter
the doctor's program?

604
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,116
To change his mind
about the medical procedure.

605
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,910
Computer, open Sick Bay doors.

606
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,328
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

607
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,958
Override.
Authorization: Tuvok-pi-alpha.

608
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,835
<i>Authorization denied.</i>

609
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,967
Doctor, stop what you're doing.

610
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,677
You're interrupting
a medical procedure.

611
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,388
Your program has been altered.

612
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,183
-What do you mean, altered?
-Ignore him.

613
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,268
B'Elanna, this is completely irrational.

614
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,063
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

615
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,732
I'm your patient.
Your first duty is to me and my baby.

616
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,318
-Tuvok to Bridge.
<i>-Kim here.</i>

617
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,820
There's a force field in Sick Bay.

618
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,238
I can't deactivate it.

619
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,116
Cut power to the EPS relay
surrounding the Surgical Bay.

620
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,120
Access has been restricted.
I'll have to bypass them.

621
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,914
You said it could be dangerous
to delay the procedure.

622
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,834
She's manipulating you, doc,
in more ways than one.

623
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,419
I'm sorry, but if there's something
wrong with my program.

624
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,505
There's nothing wrong
with your program!

625
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,341
[Kim]
<i>I'm cutting power to the Surgical Bay now.</i>

626
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,472
I suggest we deactivate your program,

627
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,766
until we determine
the extent of the alterations.

628
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,354
I understand.

629
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,773
Computer, deactivate EMH.

630
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,943
You had no right to interfere.

631
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,696
Tuvok, would you mind
giving us a minute?

632
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,204
I never thought
you would go this far.

633
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:09,292
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Reprogramming the doctor?

634
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,419
I upgraded his program,

635
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,629
so he could understand
what had to be done.

636
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,756
You mean to reconfigure our baby

637
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,384
so she wouldn't be
treated like a monster.

638
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,553
It's not just about the way
she'll be treated!

639
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,389
What else is it about, then?!

640
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,268
-Come on, B'Elanna, tell me!
-Forget it.

641
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,022
No, no. We're not going to forget it.
We're going to talk about this right now.

642
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,566
Stop telling me what to do!
You're not my father!

643
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,239
What are you talking about?

644
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,827
Look, my fath...

645
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,664
What? What about him?

646
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,835
Oh, we were inseparable.

647
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,839
He spoiled me and I worshipped him,

648
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,717
but the older I got...

649
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,137
...we just grew apart.

650
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,435
He ended up organizing this camping trip
with my cousins.

651
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,605
I guess he just wanted to--

652
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,816
I don't know
make things better again.

653
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,946
-But it didn't.
-It was awful.

654
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,742
I ended up trying to run away.

655
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,663
B'Elanna? What are you doing?

656
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,291
It was so stupid.

657
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,876
I mean, where was I going to go?

658
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,381
You probably just
wanted him to stop you.

659
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,176
Well, he did.

660
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,263
Don't touch me.

661
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,014
B'Elanna, what's wrong?

662
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,100
You know what's wrong.

663
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,559
No, I don't.

664
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,688
Maybe I'm just being moody
and unpredictable.

665
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,483
What are you talking about?

666
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,402
I heard what you said to Uncle Carl.

667
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,821
[sighs]

668
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,491
You shouldn't be listening
to private conversations.

669
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,327
And you shouldn't have said
what you did about Mommy!

670
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,704
[sobs]

671
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,848
B'Elanna, listen to me.

672
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,893
Your mother and I
are having problems but--

673
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,186
You don't love her anymore.

674
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,606
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is, and you don't love me either.

675
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,526
-B'Elanna--
-You're no different than anyone else.

676
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,153
You don't like Klingons. You said it.

677
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,780
You are twisting my words, B'Elanna.

678
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,408
Maybe he was right.
Maybe you misunderstood.

679
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,743
No, I know what I heard.

680
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,162
It made me so angry!

681
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,664
You had a right to be,
after the things he said.

682
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,291
It's not what he said.

683
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,376
It's what I said.

684
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,880
If you can't stand living with us,
then why don't you just leave?!

685
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,717
And that's exactly what he did.

686
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,219
Oh, B'Elanna...

687
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,264
Twelve days later

688
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,225
and he never came back.

689
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,270
You can't blame yourself for that.

690
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,980
Why not?

691
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:23,944
Because he was obviously
unhappy about his marriage.

692
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,238
He didn't leave
just because you told him to.

693
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,157
You don't know that.

694
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,912
Look, whatever the reason was,

695
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,957
I'm sure it was a horrible thing
for you to live with.

696
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,883
Wait a minute. You don't think...

697
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,386
[sighs]

698
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:53,140
B'Elanna,
I am never going to leave you.

699
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,475
You say that now

700
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,979
but think about how hard it is
to live with one Klingon.

701
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,898
Pretty soon it'll be two.

702
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,983
And someday I hope it's three or four.

703
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:09,240
I mean it, and I hope that
every one of them is just like you.

704
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,452
B'Elanna...

705
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:18,249
I am not your father,
and you are not your mother,

706
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,001
and our daughter
is going to be perfect

707
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,003
just the way she is.

708
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,880
You really think so?

709
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,883
I know so.

710
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,815
[doctor]
<i>Medical Officer's Log, Stardate 54452.6.</i>

711
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,651
<i>Lieutenant Torres</i>
<i>has deleted the alterations</i>

712
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,486
<i>she made to my program.</i>

713
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,156
<i>It's a relief to be back</i>
<i>to my old self again.</i>

714
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,242
Good morning, Lieutenant.

715
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,077
-You're not feeling ill, are you?
-No.

716
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,787
I'm fine.

717
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:02,793
I just wanted to apologize
for violating your program.

718
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,798
Apology accepted.

719
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,677
Not guilty by reason of biochemistry.

720
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,598
Nice of you to let me off the hook,

721
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,143
but biochemistry isn't an excuse.

722
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,563
I knew exactly what I was doing.

723
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,276
[gasps]

724
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,736
Is something wrong?

725
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,155
I don't know.

726
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,661
Your baby's kicking.

727
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,707
-So soon?
-Well, she is part Klingon.

728
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,958
[gasps]

729
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,211
There it is again.

730
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,965
May I?

731
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,972
[both exhale]

732
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,307
Feisty little thing, isn't she?

733
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,601
I wonder where she gets that from.

734
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,730
Speaking of the baby,
I have another request.

735
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,273
Yes?

736
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,736
I wonder
if you'd like to be her godfather.

737
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,909
Neelix wants the job,
but he's already got Naomi Wildman,

738
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,995
and Chakotay knows less about raising
kids than Harry, and if you think--

739
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,580
I accept.

740
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,499
Thanks.

741
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,168
Thank you.

742
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,504
I was also wondering...

743
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,841
Do you think I could
see her one more time?

744
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,678
The holographic projection, I mean.

745
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,471
I don't see why not.

746
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,865
[chuckles]

747
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,743
She is cute, isn't she?

748
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,537
[both laugh]
