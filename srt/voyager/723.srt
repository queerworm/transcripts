[rock 'n' roll playing]

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,465
[buzz of conversation]

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,261
Now these are delicious.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,600
-Uh, leave some for the rest of us.
-Hey, I'm eating for two.

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,853
Great party, Neelix.

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,731
Everybody seems to be enjoying it.

7
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,525
Yeah, except the Doc.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,406
Those are for eating,
not scanning.

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,741
What exactly are they?

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,078
Cheese pierogies.
Zefram Cochrane's favorite.

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,372
They have absolutely
no nutritional value.

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,998
[sighs]
This is a party, Doctor.

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,751
Sometimes you have to forget
about nutrition.

14
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,420
You could include a vitamin supplement
when you replicate.

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,382
Replicate?
I made them myself.

16
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,176
You two have outdone yourselves.

17
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,805
I've never seen First Contact Day
celebrated quite like this.

18
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,808
When I was your age, all it meant
was a day off from school.

19
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,394
Well, Neelix and I thought
we should make it more fun.

20
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,187
Well, you certainly succeeded.

21
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,023
When is Commander Tuvok
making his presentation?

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,067
Well, now's as good a time as any.

23
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,485
Captain.

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,364
Uh, may I have everyone's
attention, please?

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,661
-[music stops]
-In honor of the 315th anniversary

26
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,455
of his ancestors' arrival on Earth,

27
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,834
I've asked Mr. Tuvok
to recite the first words

28
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,503
spoken to humans by a Vulcan.

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,671
Commander?

30
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,591
Is this really necessary?

31
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,384
You promised.

32
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,846
Very well.

33
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,390
Live long and prosper.

34
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,767
-[man] Ah.
-[applause]

35
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:47,106
And now, for some more
of Zefram Cochrane's favorite music.

36
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,484
[rock 'n' roll playing]

37
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,820
[quiet chatter]

38
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,409
[laughs]

39
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,994
[laughter]

40
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,246
Hey, come on, Mr. Vulcan.

41
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,957
Vulcans do not dance.

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,917
But it's tradition.

43
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,045
There is no tradition, Mr. Neelix.

44
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,631
This ceremony
is entirely your invention.

45
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,091
This is an official
ship function, Commander.

46
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,178
Don't make me order you to dance.

47
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,014
Sorry to interrupt, but I've got
some interesting news.

48
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,474
Neelix, you might want to hear this.

49
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,850
Huh?

50
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,772
Long-range sensors have detected
several hundred life signs

51
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,733
approximately 4.9 light-years away.

52
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,735
They're Talaxian.

53
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,359
-Are we there yet?
-Not exactly.

54
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,071
The life signs appear to be coming
from inside that asteroid field.

55
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,281
[Neelix]
From a ship?

56
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,158
We are not detecting any vessels.

57
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,454
-No response from hails?
-Not yet.

58
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,791
I hope they're all right.

59
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,459
There's a lot of interference.

60
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,461
Maybe they haven't received
our transmissions.

61
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,296
Can we move in any closer?

62
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,299
<i>Voyager</i> is too big
to maneuver safely in there.

63
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,384
We could take the <i>Flyer.</i>

64
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,014
It wouldn't have hurt you
to do a few steps.

65
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,809
I am trying to concentrate
on the shields, Mr. Neelix.

66
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,477
I think you were just afraid.

67
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,438
-That's absurd.
-It's understandable.

68
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,359
-There were a lot of people watching.
-Vulcans don't experience fear.

69
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,654
I'm going to make it
my personal mission

70
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,740
to get you to dance at least once
before we reach Earth.

71
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,451
Then I suggest you find
a more productive hobby.

72
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,994
If you two don't stop it,

73
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,913
I'm going to come back there
and separate you.

74
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,999
[console beeping]

75
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:37,712
I've localized the life signs.
Bearing 108, mark 26.

76
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,382
They appear to be inside
a large asteroid.

77
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,592
-Inside?
-[rumbling]

78
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,344
-What was that?
-A thermalyte explosive.

79
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,597
30.6 kilometers to port.

80
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,559
I'm detecting another projectile,
heading directly toward us.

81
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,602
Evasive maneuvers.

82
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,942
We've lost shields.

83
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,695
Main propulsion is off-line.

84
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,905
We're going to have
to make an emergency landing.

85
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,073
Where?

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,075
The Talaxians' asteroid
is the closest.

87
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,120
The surface is covered
with craters, ice fields.

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,207
[sighs]
We don't have a choice.

89
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,709
Hold on.

90
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,734
Problem?

91
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,819
We've lost contact
with the away team.

92
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,114
I also detected some unusual energy
discharges in the asteroid field.

93
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,991
-What kind of discharges?
-It's difficult to tell

94
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,743
because of the interference,

95
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,037
but they appear
to be thermalytic explosions.

96
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,248
I believe several of them
were in close proximity to the <i>Flyer.</i>

97
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,000
Source?

98
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,668
Unknown.

99
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,089
[sighs]
We'll need to send a rescue team.

100
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,759
Work with B'Elanna.
Try to modify the shields

101
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,094
on one of the shuttles
to withstand these explosions.

102
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,398
Stay still.

103
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,735
Don't worry.
It's not serious.

104
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,656
Am I inside the asteroid?

105
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,032
Yes.

106
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,367
This is my home.

107
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,577
Where are my friends?

108
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,748
If you mean the aliens who were
on the ship with you, they're safe.

109
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,793
I'd like to see them.

110
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,711
You need to rest.

111
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,802
What were you doing
in the asteroid field?

112
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,597
Looking for you.

113
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,893
Well, not you specifically,

114
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,438
but my ship detected Talaxians.

115
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,732
I haven't come across any in years, so...

116
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,652
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,071
I'm Neelix.

118
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,614
Dexa.

119
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,783
I had an uncle named Neelix.

120
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,413
Are there other Talaxians
on your ship?

121
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,373
I'm the only one.

122
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,917
Why are you living with aliens?

123
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,127
They're my friends.

124
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,547
Did you receive our hails?

125
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:26,756
Yes.

126
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,383
Why didn't you respond?

127
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,719
We avoid contact with outsiders.

128
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,848
We were attacked.

129
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,684
There were explosions.

130
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,104
-Did you...?
-No.

131
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,814
We're not violent.

132
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,524
Who fired at us?

133
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,109
No one fired at you.

134
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,570
There are miners
who use explosive charges

135
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,238
to break apart the asteroids,

136
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,866
so they can collect minerals
from the debris.

137
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,201
I wish we'd known.

138
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,911
Why were you carrying weapons?

139
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,498
It's standard procedure
for an away mission.

140
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,254
Hello. What's your name?

141
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,798
Brax. What's yours?

142
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,800
I told you not to come in here.

143
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,427
I just wanted to see him.

144
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,513
You're supposed to be helping Oxilon.

145
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,390
He doesn't look dangerous to me.

146
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,104
I think you have the wrong idea
about us.

147
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,148
I'm not supposed to be
talking to you at all.

148
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,152
I'm feeling better.

149
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,112
I'd like to see my friends now.

150
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,410
-What are you doing?
-I've been told not to let you leave.

151
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,591
Harry?

152
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,759
Still no response to hails.

153
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,886
-Janeway to the Shuttle Bay.
-[Seven]<i> Go ahead, Captain.</i>

154
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,055
What's the status
of the shield modifications?

155
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,682
<i>Lieutenant Torres and I will be</i>
<i>finished in a few minutes.</i>

156
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,727
Good. Take an away team
and find them.

157
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,313
[electronic beeping]

158
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,607
Captain, there's a ship
approaching from astern.

159
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,067
We're being hailed.

160
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,401
On screen.

161
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,571
<i>Identify yourselves.</i>

162
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,866
I'm Captain Janeway
of the Federation Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

163
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,077
<i>Commander Nocona.</i>

164
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,913
<i>This is our asteroid field.</i>

165
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,873
We weren't aware of that.

166
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>Now you are.</i>

167
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,462
We lost one of our shuttles
inside the field.

168
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,631
We're preparing
to send a rescue team.

169
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,175
<i>All the resources belong to us.</i>

170
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,593
We're not interested
in the resources.

171
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,929
We were only trying
to make contact with the Talaxians.

172
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,099
<i>What's your interest in them?</i>

173
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,309
One of my crewmen is from Talax.

174
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,478
He was eager to meet some of his people.

175
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,190
<i>You should have requested permission</i>
<i>before sending in a shuttle.</i>

176
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,442
<i>We have a mining operation in progress.</i>

177
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,612
Does that explain
the explosions we detected?

178
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,447
<i>Mining charges.</i>

179
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,033
We'd appreciate it
if you'd stop using them,

180
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,869
until we can get our people out.

181
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,038
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>We're on a strict deadline.</i>

182
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,792
<i>But I'll conduct a search</i>
<i>for your crew.</i>

183
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,670
<i>If they need help,</i>
<i>we'll provide it.</i>

184
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,589
That's kind of you.

185
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,466
But we're prepared to go in
and get them ourselves.

186
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,721
<i>I cannot guarantee your safety</i>
<i>if you enter the asteroid field.</i>

187
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,806
<i>Stay here.</i>

188
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,767
<i>We'll contact you</i>
<i>when we find your people.</i>

189
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,074
I don't think
you're supposed to be here.

190
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,328
This is my home.
You can't tell me what to do.

191
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,788
No, of course not.

192
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,832
I just don't want you
to get in trouble.

193
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,085
Is that a model ship?

194
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,296
What's it called?

195
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,714
How about the <i>Two-Tailed Talchok</i>?

196
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,760
The <i>Fur Fly</i>?

197
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,678
[giggles]

198
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,848
The ship I come from
is called the <i>Voyager.</i>

199
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,558
Is it big?

200
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,977
And fast.

201
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,021
Can I see it?

202
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,191
I think it would be
a little difficult

203
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,693
to take you there
while I'm stuck here.

204
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,488
But if your mother
would let me out...

205
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,782
-[door closing]
-That's her.

206
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,741
[whispers]
You'd better hide.

207
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,410
You won't tell her I'm here?

208
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,037
No, of course not.

209
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,842
Neelix, this is Oxilon,
our council regent.

210
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,428
I wish I could say
it was nice to meet you,

211
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,973
but this wasn't exactly
the welcome I was expecting.

212
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,224
You're free to go now.

213
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,192
What about my friends?

214
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,777
We've determined
they aren't hostile.

215
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,281
They've been treated for their injuries
and asked to leave.

216
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,409
They're aboard your shuttle
making repairs.

217
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,160
I'll take you there.

218
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,789
Well, now that everything
has been cleared up,

219
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,042
maybe we could talk...

220
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,545
get to know each other a little?

221
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,133
If you'd like.

222
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,427
My friends, too?

223
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,178
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,471
Why not?

225
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,266
We've learned from experience
to keep to ourselves.

226
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,229
Well, if they're not welcome,
I'm not staying, either.

227
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,399
That's your choice.

228
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,575
I know Oxilon seems overly cautious,

229
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,952
but we're not used to having visitors.

230
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,955
How many of you live here?

231
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,376
Close to 500.

232
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,795
All of our homes are connected
to the central cavern

233
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,589
by tunnels and lifts.

234
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,839
They allow us to move easily

235
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,051
from one section
of the asteroid to another.

236
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,514
It must have taken years
to build all of this.

237
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,350
Almost five.

238
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,477
It still isn't finished.

239
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,356
[male voice]<i> ...group five,</i>
<i>report to the lower level...</i>

240
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,566
Where did the technology come from?

241
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,652
We arrived here
with a caravan of six ships.

242
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,198
We disassembled all but one of them
and modified their components.

243
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,658
We converted torpedo launchers
to blast away rock

244
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,202
and excavate these tunnels.

245
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,872
These conduits run
into the asteroid's core.

246
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:37,001
We use geothermal energy to melt the ice
that covers most of the outer surface.

247
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,962
It provides us with oxygen and water.

248
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,758
Who'd have imagined all of this
inside an asteroid?

249
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,890
Your son seems like
a wonderful boy.

250
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,268
How would you know?
You only met him for a few seconds.

251
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,190
True, but I'm a quick
judge of character.

252
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,069
He came to see you
while I was out, didn't he?

253
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,198
You can't blame him
for being curious.

254
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,576
Hmm. He's a lot like his father--

255
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,495
no fear.

256
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,372
I'd like to meet your husband.

257
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,209
He's dead.

258
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,295
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,798
-I didn't mean to...
-It's... It's all right.

260
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,174
You didn't know.

261
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,556
Neelix.

262
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,809
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

263
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:40,064
Dexa, this is Lieutenant Paris
and Commander Tuvok.

264
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,484
Thanks for bringing him back.
We were getting worried.

265
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,655
It was nice to meet you.

266
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,959
So, what can I do to help?

267
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,879
Well, you can give me a hand
with this plasma manifold.

268
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,591
How did it go?

269
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,470
Well, uh, they didn't exactly
send out a welcoming committee,

270
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,263
but I'm sure they have their reasons.

271
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,059
I guess my expectations
were a little high.

272
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,064
I regret that you didn't have
a more fulfilling experience.

273
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,649
That's nice of you to say,
Commander,

274
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,568
but it wasn't a complete
waste of time.

275
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,695
I got to meet some
of my people again...

276
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,780
even if it was a short visit.

277
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,866
Who knows?

278
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,913
It's probably the last time
I'll ever see another Talaxian.

279
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,508
Good work.
Now we need to run a systems...

280
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,927
-[beeping]
-[computer]<i> Intruder alert.</i>

281
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,888
At least we know internal sensors
are working.

282
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,651
[beeping]

283
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,782
[gasps]

284
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,408
[Neelix]
Brax!

285
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,288
-You know him?
-We're old friends.

286
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,250
You said you'd take me
to see<i> Voyager.</i>

287
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,044
I don't think your mother would approve.

288
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,838
You won't tell her
I was here, will you?

289
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,757
Here?

290
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,552
Why, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

291
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,888
I'll be right back.

292
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,810
[Oxilon] Three days isn't nearly
enough time for us

293
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,687
to dismantle all our equipment.

294
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,064
[Nocona] You should have begun
the first time we asked.

295
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,482
We can't wait any longer.

296
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,901
Demolition of the asteroid
is going to start

297
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,403
whether you're here or not.

298
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,737
You'd kill us?

299
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,534
We don't want to hurt anyone,
but our patience has run out.

300
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,078
We've only got one ship.

301
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,038
There won't be enough room
for any of our belongings.

302
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,166
It's not our fault you took apart
your other vessels.

303
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,961
-You can't do this.
-Dexa, don't provoke him.

304
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,713
Where are we supposed to go?

305
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,048
I'm sure you'll find a home somewhere.

306
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,051
This is our home!

307
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,636
You have no right to make us go.

308
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,599
-[groans]
-Leave her alone!

309
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,395
Bring him here!

310
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,232
-Don't touch him!
-Are you going to stop me?

311
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,401
[grunts]

312
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,361
[grunting]

313
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,948
[grunting]

314
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,996
You've said what you've come to say,
and now I suggest you leave.

315
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,959
You have three days to evacuate.

316
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,354
You can see now
why we're suspicious of outsiders.

317
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,064
Thank you for protecting the boy...

318
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,692
but I'm afraid your actions
might make things worse.

319
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,277
How could they get any worse?

320
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,614
Fighting back has never done anything
but cause us more trouble.

321
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,491
And what has running away
ever done for us?

322
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,284
It's kept us alive.

323
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,120
Maybe it's time we stayed
and defended ourselves.

324
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,705
Will you help us?

325
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,710
I agree with Oxilon.
Fighting isn't the answer.

326
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,297
-But I'll try to help.
-How?

327
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,134
Well, uh...
we could talk to my captain.

328
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,762
Maybe she can negotiate
with the miners,

329
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,306
uh, get them to agree
to let you stay.

330
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,100
Your captain would be willing to do that?

331
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,771
The best thing would be for you
to come to<i> Voyager--</i>

332
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,022
talk to her yourself.

333
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,192
-I want to go, too.
-Shh, Brax.

334
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,819
Why don't you both come?

335
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,406
I've seen your home.
I'd like you to see mine.

336
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,621
[doors open]

337
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,498
Commander Chakotay.

338
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,335
I'd like you to meet Dexa...
and Brax.

339
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,670
Welcome to the Bridge.

340
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,839
And this is Ensign Kim.

341
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,929
What's this?

342
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,890
This... is an engineering station.

343
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,727
And over there is Tactical.

344
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,354
And down there is the Helm.

345
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,150
And this...
is the Captain's chair.

346
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,278
Which station is yours?

347
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,740
Well, actually, I don't have a specific...
See, I'm-I'm more of a, uh...

348
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,868
Neelix does too many things
to have just one station.

349
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,581
He's our ambassador,
morale officer, trade negotiator.

350
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,667
Without a doubt, he's the most
versatile member of our crew.

351
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,546
[sighs]

352
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,883
[Seven] As you can see,
our sensors are extremely precise.

353
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,552
We can scan for life signs
light-years away.

354
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,637
That's how we found you.

355
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,806
I have something else
that may interest you.

356
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,271
-What is it?
-Talax.

357
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,024
You can scan that far away?

358
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,777
No, this image is from our database.

359
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,196
It's as beautiful as I remember.

360
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,533
There's the Godo Mountain Range.

361
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,535
And the Axiana Lakes.

362
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,954
That was always one
of my favorite places.

363
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,831
Mine, too.

364
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,586
Why don't we just go back to Talax?
We could live there.

365
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,047
It's still controlled by the Haakonians.

366
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,009
They don't treat Talaxians very well.
That's why we left.

367
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:45,763
Maybe Neelix could go with us,
and we could fight them.

368
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,389
Take the planet back.

369
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,977
If tomorrow's negotiations go well,
you won't have to go anywhere.

370
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,109
Next stop... Engineering.

371
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,820
The warp core!

372
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,113
Neelix!

373
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,448
Naomi.

374
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,952
I'm sorry. I forgot all about
our Kadis-Kot game.

375
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,371
That's all right.
I know you're busy.

376
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,997
I just want to meet your friends.

377
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,250
Of course. Dexa, Brax...

378
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,210
this is my goddaughter, Naomi.

379
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,378
Hi.

380
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,631
-You live on a beautiful ship.
-Thanks.

381
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,092
Maybe Brax would like to go
to the holodeck.

382
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,303
-That's a great idea.
-Lieutenant Paris has a new program.

383
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,097
"Invaders from the Ninth Dimension."

384
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,016
-Sounds scary.
-Very.

385
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,726
What's a holodeck?

386
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,105
Neelix is right.
Might be too scary for you.

387
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,191
I'm not afraid. Can I?

388
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,534
You're lucky to have found these people.

389
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,706
They obviously think
a great deal of you.

390
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,499
The feeling's mutual.

391
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,598
To the Axiana Lakes.

392
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,022
It really is delicious.

393
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,274
I've been saving it for 15 years.

394
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,110
I wasn't sure I'd ever open it.

395
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,865
But tonight...

396
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,408
seemed like the right occasion.

397
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,374
Would you like some more...

398
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,542
taga cake?

399
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,003
A little, please.

400
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,798
I haven't had this in years.

401
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,176
I'm glad you like it.

402
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,553
-Mmm.
-It's a family recipe.

403
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,138
You're a good cook.

404
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,185
I haven't seen Brax this happy
since his father was alive.

405
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,856
How did he...?

406
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,401
I'm sorry. You probably
don't want to talk about it.

407
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,195
I don't mind.

408
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,282
We'd settled on a planet
called Phanos.

409
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,117
There was a lot
of unoccupied territory,

410
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,162
but the government restricted us
to a very small area.

411
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,290
-Why?
-They said it was a quarantine,

412
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,793
to protect the population
from alien diseases.

413
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,420
But it was just an excuse.

414
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,216
We were outsiders. They didn't want us
mixing with their people.

415
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,929
It wasn't long before we realized
we didn't have enough land

416
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,264
to grow what we needed
to feed ourselves.

417
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:40,145
Oxilon said we'd just have
to conserve our resources.

418
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:45,359
But my husband was tired
of being told what to do.

419
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:49,405
So, he started farming
outside the restricted zone.

420
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,281
They didn't like that.

421
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,159
A security patrol confronted him.

422
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,954
He told them he had
to provide for his family,

423
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,123
that he wasn't afraid of them.

424
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,874
There was a fight. He was killed.

425
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,378
I'm sorry.

426
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,173
After that, we came here.

427
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,760
We thought we'd finally found a place
where no one would bother us.

428
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,179
Maybe this time it'll be different.

429
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,682
Maybe.

430
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,686
But even if it isn't...

431
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,314
thank you for trying.

432
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,366
I should get
a good night's sleep,

433
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,953
if I'm going to be my best
at the negotiations tomorrow.

434
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,878
Uh, Neelix?

435
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,425
It's been a wonderful day.

436
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,188
Isn't there enough to mine here,
without destroying their home?

437
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,525
Their home contains more
than 30 percent of the field's ore.

438
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,819
Without that asteroid...

439
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,447
the operation isn't worth the expense.

440
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,409
Would you be open
to some kind of compensation?

441
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,704
All we want are the minerals.

442
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,707
And you'd kill us to get them.

443
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,542
Wait.

444
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:31,882
The Talaxians have found a way
to produce a lot of geothermal energy.

445
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,967
Maybe they could share it with you.

446
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,305
What do you mean "share"?

447
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:44,311
You could convert it into fuel
to power your ships.

448
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,857
The energy they generate isn't
compatible with our technology.

449
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,485
We'd be willing to help you
make the modifications.

450
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:55,531
We have quotas to meet.
We don't have time for that.

451
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,868
Commander, the future of more
than 500 people is at stake here.

452
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,917
And once, there was
a transporter accident.

453
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,253
Neelix and Commander Tuvok
got combined

454
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,004
to make a completely different person.

455
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,172
Really?

456
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,175
You don't think I could make up
a story like that, do you?

457
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,302
Hello, Neelix.

458
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,181
-Do you want to play Kadis-Kot?
-Maybe later.

459
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,308
[indistinct chatter]

460
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,320
I knew it wouldn't work.

461
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,281
We did get them
to make a small concession.

462
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,824
They've extended the deadline.

463
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,243
You'll have enough time
to dismantle your equipment.

464
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,788
Thanks, but there's too much
to take with us.

465
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,168
Captain Janeway has agreed
to ferry all of you

466
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,628
and your supplies
to the nearest M-Class planet.

467
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,470
Come on, Brax.
We're going home.

468
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,641
-Why?
-We have to pack. Come on.

469
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,232
-You said you were gonna help us.
-Brax.

470
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,460
You wanted to see me?

471
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:36,131
I've detected five warp-capable species
within two light-years of the planet

472
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,884
where we're taking the Talaxians.

473
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,053
I'm worried they might be
vulnerable to attack.

474
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,598
-They would be vulnerable anywhere.
-I thought maybe you could help me

475
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,517
devise some defense strategies
for their new home.

476
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,147
Frankly, Mr. Neelix, they don't seem
inclined to defend themselves.

477
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,399
No, I suppose not...

478
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,319
But if they were going
to make a stand...

479
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,072
their emotional attachment
to their present home

480
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,907
might be an asset.

481
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,494
Are you saying they should stay?

482
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,037
I'm speaking hypothetically.

483
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,831
Hypothetically...

484
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,627
if they wanted to defend the asteroid,
how would they do it?

485
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,423
To begin with, they would need
to establish some kind of perimeter.

486
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,177
-You mean shields?
-Yes.

487
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,930
The miners are monitoring
the asteroid.

488
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,974
If they detected the Talaxians
erecting a shield,

489
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,517
they would attempt to stop them.

490
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,812
I suppose so.

491
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,398
Your people would need competent
leadership to defend against

492
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,275
a preemptive attack.

493
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,695
If you had the Captain's permission,

494
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,655
would you be willing
to provide that leadership?

495
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,282
Certainly not.

496
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,867
It would be a violation
of the Prime Directive.

497
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,744
And even if it weren't,

498
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,957
I don't believe that I am the person
most qualified to assume that role.

499
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,128
You mean me?

500
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,630
I am merely speaking hypothetically.

501
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,513
I couldn't lead those people,
Mr. Tuvok.

502
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,475
I'm not a fighter.

503
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,270
I'm just a cook...

504
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,565
who sometimes imagines himself
to be a diplomat.

505
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,026
On the contrary, Mr. Neelix...

506
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,196
you are much more than that.

507
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,118
You are perhaps the most resourceful
individual I have ever known.

508
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,830
I always thought you
just tolerated me.

509
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,709
You do have some annoying habits.

510
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,254
However, during your time on<i> Voyager,</i>

511
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,341
you've developed many valuable skills.

512
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,926
Skills that would serve you well
if you ever decided

513
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,220
to assume a leadership role.

514
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,681
You really think so?

515
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,392
Let me be clear.

516
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,270
I'm not urging you to do anything.

517
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,316
I am simply telling you that I believe
that you are more than capable.

518
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,288
Going somewhere, Mr. Neelix?

519
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,456
Just to see my friends.

520
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,583
Chakotay tells me you're
using your own ship.

521
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,460
Why not have Tom
take you in the <i>Flyer</i>?

522
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,128
I didn't want to bother anyone.

523
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,048
You wouldn't be planning
anything foolish, would you?

524
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,385
Whatever I do, I promise
it won't involve<i> Voyager.</i>

525
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,345
That wasn't my question.

526
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,808
I know you have
Prime Directive issues,

527
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,018
but I'm not officially
part of your crew,

528
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,895
so I don't have
the same constraints.

529
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,272
You're as much a part of this crew
as anyone else.

530
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,275
Are you ordering me not to go?

531
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,361
That depends on what
you're going to do.

532
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,073
It's up to the Talaxians.

533
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,293
Safe journey, Mr. Neelix.

534
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:14,349
I know from personal experience
that you have force field emitters.

535
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,936
We could use them
to establish a shield grid.

536
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,231
We'd need to deploy
a series of them

537
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:25,026
on the asteroid's surface,
along bisecting diameters.

538
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,280
16 emitters should be enough
to form a grid.

539
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,616
Even if you're right, it'd take weeks
to dig that many tunnels to the surface.

540
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,911
Commander Tuvok suggested
that we could modify the emitters,

541
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,206
so they could be fired
from torpedo tubes on your ship...

542
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,584
implanted in the surface.

543
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,212
As soon as the miners realize
what we are doing, they'd attack.

544
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,298
I could provide cover
from my ship.

545
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,175
But you're right,
we'd have to work quickly.

546
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,927
We could route power to the emitters
directly from the core.

547
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,638
-They'd have a permanent energy supply.
-Good idea.

548
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,308
If we do what you're suggesting,
people are going to be hurt.

549
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,810
This is your home!

550
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,399
The miners have no right
to force you out.

551
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,526
I agree, but fighting?

552
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,944
I don't like it either,

553
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,530
but, at some point,
you have to stand up for yourselves.

554
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,157
How do you know
there won't be someone else

555
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,743
to terrorize you
the next place you go?!

556
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,244
[loud chatter]

557
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,497
You know he's right.

558
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,460
No one has worked harder
to build this place than you.

559
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,379
Isn't it worth defending?

560
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,644
Wait for my comm call.

561
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,940
As soon as the last emitter's in place,
start routing power to the grid.

562
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,024
Understood.

563
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,862
You're scared, aren't you?

564
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,867
-You?
-Terrified.

565
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,454
-Be careful.
-I will.

566
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,873
-[beeping]
<i>-Oxilon to Neelix.</i>

567
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,292
<i>The emitters are loaded.</i>
<i>We're ready.</i>

568
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,879
I'll see you soon.

569
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,162
-Two more, and we're done.
-[Oxilon]<i> Acknowledged.</i>

570
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,873
We're moving into position
for the next one.

571
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,419
[alarm sounds]

572
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,087
The miners' ship
is on an intercept course.

573
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,589
Evasive maneuvers!

574
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,930
-They're targeting our shields.
-[Neelix]<i> I'll deal with them.</i>

575
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,724
Just focus on your job.

576
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,186
All right, Mr. Vulcan, let's see
if you were right about me.

577
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,324
-[loud chatter]
-[alarm sounds]

578
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,660
Neelix, you have to hurry.

579
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,830
Just one more emitter,
and you can activate the shield.

580
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,879
[alarm sounds]

581
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,425
Neelix to Oxilon.

582
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,178
<i>-My weapons are off-line.</i>
-We're not in position yet.

583
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,514
<i>You have to get there.</i>
<i>They're going to launch another charge.</i>

584
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,524
-Neelix, what are you doing?
-[Neelix]<i> Don't worry about me.</i>

585
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,235
Just get ready
to bring the grid online.

586
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,497
<i>Delta Flyer </i>to Neelix.
Are you all right?

587
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,625
Fine, Captain,
but you shouldn't be here.

588
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,710
<i>You're violating the Prime Directive.</i>

589
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,171
We're just helping a friend in distress.

590
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,980
Dexa to Neelix.

591
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,400
The shield's holding. You did it.

592
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,777
We did it.

593
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,991
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54868.6.</i>

594
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,035
<i>Commander Nocona</i>
<i>seems to have given up</i>

595
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,122
<i>his attempts to penetrate</i>
<i>the Talaxians' shield.</i>

596
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,208
Voyager's<i> ready to get underway,</i>
<i>but we're giving Mr. Neelix time</i>

597
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,794
<i>to say a difficult good-bye</i>
<i>to his new friends.</i>

598
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,213
We're grateful
for everything you've done.

599
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,298
I'm just happy things worked out.

600
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,719
And I'm glad that I could
spend some time here...

601
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,970
with all of you.

602
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,890
-I'd better go.
-Stay here!

603
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,726
He can't, Brax.

604
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,562
He has responsibilities on<i> Voyager.</i>

605
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,231
I promise I'll stay in touch
as long as I can.

606
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,379
-[door chimes]
-Come in.

607
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,343
Hi.

608
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,596
Neelix!

609
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,350
What are you working on?

610
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,228
A report on proto-humanoid cultures...

611
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,607
for Commander Chakotay's
paleontology class.

612
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,194
A-ha. Need some help?

613
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,112
I'm almost finished.

614
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:02,739
Oh.

615
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,992
Do you have time
for a game of Kadis-Kot?

616
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,286
I have to get up early.

617
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,038
Oh.

618
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,957
I guess you'd better
get to sleep then.

619
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,879
Do you want me to tuck you in?
Tell you a bedtime story?

620
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,965
[scoffs]
You haven't done that in years.

621
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,053
Just think of all the stories
you've missed.

622
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,973
Thanks, Neelix,
but I can put myself to bed.

623
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,393
I'm not a little girl anymore.

624
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,746
I didn't think anyone else
stayed up this late.

625
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:57,252
Well, I wouldn't want you
to have coffee all by yourself.

626
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,170
Have a seat.

627
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,259
[sighs]

628
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,099
I've been thinking about something.

629
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,812
It's a little hard to put into words.

630
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,190
And I haven't really made
a decision yet.

631
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,820
And, of course, I would never ignore
my responsibilities on<i> Voyager.</i>

632
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,613
Of course not.

633
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,824
I take them very seriously.

634
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,868
I know you do.

635
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,709
I've been thinking about something, too.
Maybe you could help me.

636
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,420
I'd be happy to.

637
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,633
It's an idea I'd need to talk
to Starfleet Command about.

638
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,888
-It must be important.
-It is.

639
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,309
Now that we've established
two-way communication with Earth...

640
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,898
it seems to me Starfleet could use
a permanent ambassador

641
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,274
in the Delta Quadrant.

642
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:06,404
This ambassador would have to stay
in frequent contact with<i> Voyager.</i>

643
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,865
[quietly]
Certainly.

644
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,163
It would be difficult for me
to run this ship without you, Neelix.

645
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,543
But that might be a sacrifice
I'd be willing to make...

646
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,629
for the greater good of Starfleet.

647
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,967
Of course, the assignment
would be entirely voluntary.

648
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,557
You wouldn't be interested, would you?

649
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,127
Good-bye...

650
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,630
and good luck, Ambassador.

651
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,935
Mr. Neelix.

652
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,658
Live long and prosper.

653
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,513
[door opens]

654
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,914
[sighs]
