1
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,988
(<i> instrument beeping</i> )

2
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,668
(<i> clicking chirps</i> )

3
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,011
Is there a genetic match?

4
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,307
Yes. Let's gather the find
and bring it back to the ship.

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,935
Could this be it--
the proof?

6
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,687
If it is, we've just made

7
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,939
the most important discovery
in Voth history.

8
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,851
Opposable thumb.

9
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,185
Multiple articulations
in the digits--

10
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,354
as expected with

11
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,189
a technologically-advanced
species.

12
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,953
Hmm... his cranial capacity
is 22 percent smaller than ours,

13
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,247
and he appears to be
lacking a dilitus lobe.

14
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,375
He had no sense of smell?

15
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,251
If he did, it was rudimentary.

16
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,337
I doubt this fellow
would have enjoyed

17
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,798
the sulfur lagoons of Hokath.

18
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,677
His cartilaginous microstructure
is extremely porous.

19
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,971
Most likely warm-blooded.

20
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,018
I believe
this was a non-saurian.

21
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,688
"Non-saurian"?
Doesn't that weaken our case?

22
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,857
No. No, the genetic markers

23
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,608
we share with this being
are undeniable.

24
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,944
We are related,
however distantly.

25
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,488
The question we must answer is,

26
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,491
what was our endotherm doing
in this part of space?

27
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,161
Was he... on an expedition?

28
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,538
Did he have a ship?
Crewmates?

29
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,961
This material-- it's composed
of synthetic polymers,

30
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,673
and the molecular structure
suggests replication technology.

31
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,508
And consider
the garment itself--

32
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,301
is this marking
purely decorative,

33
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,345
or does it have
a symbolic function?

34
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,098
Could it indicate status?

35
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,558
Possibly a military uniform.

36
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,102
At the very least,

37
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,353
we can assume he was part of
a social infrastructure,

38
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,397
and that would imply a ship.

39
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,787
Did your eyes see the
planet of our origin?

40
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,873
The true home
of our race?

41
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,668
Was it... beautiful?

42
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,047
Was it covered
by oceans, by sand?

43
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,134
Were there nine moons
above your head?

44
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,635
Were there none?

45
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,805
(<i> chuckles</i> )

46
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,307
He appears to be
at a loss for words.

47
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,187
His ship and the people on it

48
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,897
hold the key
to where we came from.

49
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,523
We've got to find it.

50
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,568
I'll contact our supporters
at the Circle of Archeology.

51
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,654
They might be able
to spare a research vessel,

52
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,822
perhaps a few assistants.

53
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,531
This isn't a field trip, Veer.

54
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,450
We need to mount
a sector-wide expedition.

55
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,910
And that means a fleet of ships.

56
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,164
We have to go directly
to the Ministry of Elders.

57
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:33,834
Professor, don't you think
that's a little precipitous?

58
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,837
Bone decalcification indicates
he died more than a year ago.

59
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,256
His ship could be thousands
of light-years away by now.

60
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,590
Time is running out.

61
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,676
You must remember,
Veer, from the moment

62
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,427
you were initiated
into my circle,

63
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,679
you made a commitment

64
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,848
to the pursuit of
scientific truth.

65
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,391
Before this, all we
had was a theory.

66
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,269
Now we have proof.

67
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,478
We simply have to get them

68
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,438
to open their eyes
and<i> see</i> it.

69
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,066
We're going to set a
course for the city ship,

70
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,526
present our friend here

71
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,569
and let<i> him</i>
do the talking.

72
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,704
For millions of years,
our people have believed

73
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,580
that we were
the first intelligent beings

74
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,209
to evolve in this region
of space--

75
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,252
the first race.

76
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,922
This assumption underlies
everything that we hold dear.

77
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,801
But that belief has been
questioned in recent years

78
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,055
not only by the Circles
of Science and Philosophy

79
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,473
but by common people as well.

80
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,142
Lying before you is proof

81
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,602
of the Distant
Origin Theory.

82
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,189
These remains
demonstrate beyond doubt

83
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,649
that we arose elsewhere
in this galaxy,

84
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,110
that we evolved
on a faraway planet

85
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,280
and traveled to this space
millions of years ago,

86
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,200
our true history lost.

87
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,618
A pile of bones.

88
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,787
Impressive.

89
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,497
This "pile of bones"
belonged to a being

90
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,042
who died
approximately one year ago

91
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,419
from a species
found nowhere in known space.

92
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:05,008
And yet, we share 47 genetic
markers with this being.

93
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,761
We are undoubtedly
related to him.

94
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,679
And I intend to prove to you

95
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,599
that we evolved on
the very same planet he did.

96
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,102
And that planet is
the long-lost world

97
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,562
of the Distant
Origin Theory.

98
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,606
Yes. That's exactly right.

99
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,150
And to find that planet--

100
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,985
our planet--

101
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,738
we must find a living member
of his kind.

102
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,408
I've created
a computer extrapolation.

103
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,702
We're looking for a race
of bipedal endotherms--

104
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,913
spacefaring
but technologically limited.

105
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,623
Based on their cranial capacity,

106
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,293
I'd say they're no more advanced
than most endotherms we've--

107
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,086
MALE:
"Endotherms"?

108
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:45,882
You're proposing that we are
related to a mammalian species?

109
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,259
Yes.

110
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,760
Which is why
I ask your permission

111
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,220
to launch an expedition and...

112
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,181
Let's talk about
your discovery.

113
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,892
I enjoyed
the colorful tale

114
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,104
of how you found
these remains.

115
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,023
It says here that you
paid a substantial sum

116
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,650
for their location.

117
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,319
I was dealing with traders.

118
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,903
They knew the location
of the cave.

119
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,862
I had no choice.

120
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,072
Have you considered

121
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,782
you were
the victim of a hoax?

122
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,285
I have analyzed every
micron of this skeleton.

123
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,828
I assure you, it's authentic.

124
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,789
Professor Gegen,
have you considered

125
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,251
the wider implications
of your... theory?

126
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,377
What do you mean?

127
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,171
By challenging Doctrine

128
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,506
you're suggesting that
everything we believe

129
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,384
about ourselves,
our history,

130
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,511
our ancient and
rightful claim

131
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,847
over this region of space,

132
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:38,018
the authority of
this Ministry itself...

133
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,602
is a lie.

134
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,896
That's not what
I'm saying at all.

135
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,984
However, in the light
of my discovery,

136
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,904
some of our beliefs
may have to be... reevaluated.

137
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,824
"Reevaluated."

138
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:02,250
We will... consider your
request for an expedition.

139
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,753
(<i> echoey gong sounds</i> )

140
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,261
(<i> door clangs open, closed</i> )

141
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,096
Well done, Professor.

142
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,848
Hardly.

143
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,600
I failed to anticipate
the level of ignorance

144
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,269
I would be facing.

145
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,688
What do we do now?

146
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,940
I want you
to arrange a meeting

147
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,650
with the Circle
of Exobiology.

148
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,236
We have supporters there.

149
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,246
Father, I'm concerned.

150
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,539
Unnecessarily.

151
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,790
I don't think they
were very receptive.

152
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,042
They don't need to be.

153
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,960
The evidence
will speak for itself

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,629
and word of my discovery
is already traveling.

155
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,382
If enough people
confront the Ministry...

156
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,301
Mathematics was never
your strong point, Father.

157
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,971
You might be overestimating
your support.

158
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,639
You don't believe me,
either, do you?

159
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,767
I...

160
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,394
I want to.

161
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,857
Our ancestors came
from somewhere else.

162
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,902
We don't even belong here?

163
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,822
It all just seems
so... incredible.

164
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,992
I'm disappointed in you.

165
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,204
Father, please...

166
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,331
let this go.

167
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,751
You're chasing a fantasy...

168
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,920
and you're wasting
your genius.

169
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,966
I'm worried about what's
going to happen to you

170
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,342
if you don't stop.

171
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,596
And what's going to happen
to you if I do stop?

172
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,681
To your children,
to all of Voth?

173
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,310
You'll continue
to live in ignorance...

174
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,479
progress held back
by ancient myth.

175
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,149
The truth<i> must</i> be known.

176
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,573
(<i> door opens</i> )

177
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,116
We've got to leave...

178
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,409
now.

179
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,701
What's happened?

180
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,454
I met
with the Circle of Exobiology.

181
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,497
They're... concerned.

182
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,456
There have been rumors.

183
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,374
About what?

184
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,001
The Ministry
has seized your research

185
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,669
and they're planning
to detain you.

186
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
On what charge?

187
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,423
Heresy against Doctrine.

188
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,757
I'll fight it.

189
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,050
It's too late.

190
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,427
Your supporters are frightened.

191
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,512
No one will back you.

192
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,766
I'll have to do this
on my own, then.

193
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,353
Go back to your family.

194
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,479
As long as
you're with me,

195
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,563
you're at risk.

196
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,902
I'm not leaving you,
Professor.

197
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,493
I've run an analysis
on the uniform marking.

198
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,952
I found what appears

199
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,288
to be a microscopic
identification code.

200
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,833
The translation matrix indicates
it's most likely a proper name.

201
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,460
A name?

202
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,006
Yes. I believe it's the name
of the endotherm's vessel.

203
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,883
We're looking
for something called...

204
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,094
<i>Voyager.</i>

205
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,184
GEGEN:
<i>Across the vastness of space</i>

206
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,603
<i>to find one ship</i>
<i>among a sea of stars</i>

207
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,021
<i>is no simple matter.</i>

208
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,191
<i>And for many weeks,</i>
<i>we found nothing.</i>

209
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,027
<i>And then, fortune glanced</i>
<i>in our direction.</i>

210
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,281
<i>A trader from a space station</i>
<i>bordering the Nekrit Expanse</i>

211
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,867
<i>informed us of a curious group</i>
<i>of explorers</i>

212
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,705
<i>claiming to be from</i>
<i>the other side of the galaxy.</i>

213
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,374
<i>The merchants there spoke</i>
<i>of a vessel called</i> Voyager.

214
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,213
<i>They were able to help</i>
<i>us clarify certain details.</i>

215
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,133
<i>With this new information,</i>

216
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,096
<i>we began to acquire</i>
<i>other items and new evidence.</i>

217
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,390
<i>Our most significant find:</i>

218
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,395
<i>A canister of warp plasma</i>
<i>from</i> Voyager's<i> engines.</i>

219
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,772
<i>So now we are scanning space</i>
for a matching signature.

220
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,734
<i>Little is known</i>
about these explorers,

221
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,776
<i>but they call</i>
<i>themselves "human"</i>

222
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,529
and they claim to
be traveling home

223
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,448
to a distant planet.

224
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,742
My thoughts are
with you, Frola,

225
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,745
as are those of
my colleague, Veer.

226
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,915
Ah, I just sent a transmission
to my daughter.

227
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,875
Was that wise?

228
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,294
I encrypted
the carrier signal.

229
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,587
There's no way
to trace it.

230
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,338
I hope you gave her
my regards.

231
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,797
Of course I did.

232
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,426
I've seen the tint
on your scales

233
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,969
when she's around.

234
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,803
I've let you into
my academic circle,

235
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,723
but now you wish to enter
my family as well?

236
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,558
No, Professor,
I would never presume...

237
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,184
You should know your place.

238
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,730
Traditionally, my family mates
with the family of Towt.

239
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,529
But... traditions are
meant to be broken.

240
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,531
(<i> chuckling</i> )

241
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,701
(<i> warbling beeps</i> )

242
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,536
It's the plasma signature.

243
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:53,750
Scanners have found a match--
a ship, 90 light-years away.

244
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,710
There are 148
life-forms aboard,

245
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,754
traveling at warp 6.2.

246
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm engaging
spatial displacement.

247
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,924
It's unlikely
their primitive sensors

248
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,552
will be able to detect us
once we're out of phase.

249
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,974
Take us out of transwarp.

250
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,058
We don't want to pass them.

251
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,310
Done.

252
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,270
I have an image.

253
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,564
What do we say to them?

254
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,108
Nothing.
Not at the moment.

255
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,194
We stand to learn more
by observing them.

256
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,904
Once we've collected
the information we need,

257
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,158
and if they appear nonviolent,
we'll make contact.

258
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,535
(<i> beeping</i> )

259
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,119
Entering portation range.

260
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,497
We'll be looking for
their data storage devices,

261
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,081
analyzing their behavior--

262
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,917
anything that can tell us
who and what these people are.

263
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,504
Eyes open, Veer.

264
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,392
Interphase is stable.

265
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,101
Curious.

266
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,354
I didn't expect the smell.

267
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,691
Well, they are
mammals, after all.

268
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,317
Ah, over here.

269
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,282
Ah, this appears to be
a computer access terminal.

270
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,451
Simple binary system.

271
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,871
I've downloaded
their database.

272
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,539
I'll bet you it's
an anodyne relay.

273
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,165
No way. Plasma conduit.

274
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,959
Relay. I'm telling you,
I checked the conduit network.

275
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,336
My point exactly.

276
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,588
You're not an engineer.

277
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,630
I'll bet you.

278
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,757
Name it.

279
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,383
A male and female
interacting.

280
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,467
Let's observe.

281
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,183
Well?

282
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,061
Well...

283
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,188
go ahead and gloat.

284
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,400
The anodyne relays--
who would've guessed?

285
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,651
Just a shot in the dark.

286
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,445
And it hit the bull's-eye.

287
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,113
Tonight, you pay up.

288
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,074
Holodeck 2, Klingon
martial arts program.

289
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,618
No getting out of it
this time.

290
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,660
Courting behavior?

291
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,828
Exactly.

292
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,954
Note how the female,

293
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,497
through her
feigned antagonism,

294
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,125
encourages the male
in his attempt to mate.

295
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,711
There's no sign of vasodilation
in their skin.

296
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,004
Obviously, they never
evolved that ability,

297
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,590
which would explain
their reliance

298
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,341
on crude verbal interplay.

299
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,676
PARIS:
I'll see you tonight.

300
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,177
B.Y.O.B.

301
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,345
What?

302
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,681
Bring your own<i> Bat'leth.</i>

303
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,436
<i>Bat'leth.</i>

304
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,979
Report.

305
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,148
CHAKOTAY:
We've completed
long-range scans.

306
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,691
If we maintain
our present course,

307
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,526
we'll enter a region
of heavy tetryon radiation

308
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,779
within two days.
What's the alternative?

309
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,447
A three-month detour.

310
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,991
Tuvok, enhance the shields.
Lieutenant, hold our course.

311
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,201
Harry, continue your scans.
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,246
JANEWAY:
Let's access everything
known about tetryon radiation.

313
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,039
I want to take
every precaution...

314
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,835
Well, Veer, what can you observe
about their social structure?

315
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,044
It's obviously hierarchical

316
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:47,214
with clear differences
in status and rank.

317
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:51,218
The males appear to be
subordinate to that female.

318
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,805
Perhaps a matriarchy.

319
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,723
My conclusion exactly.

320
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,850
(<i> console beeps</i> )

321
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,058
This is strange.

322
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,186
I'm picking up
spatial fluctuations.

323
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,316
They're coming from the Bridge.

324
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,693
Source?

325
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,404
I'm not sure, but they're highly
localized

326
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,366
with modulating
phase variants.

327
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,202
It looks like some kind
of cloaking technology.

328
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,497
All stop.
Intruder alert.

329
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,748
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

330
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,166
We've exceeded
our welcome.

331
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,292
Let's get back to the ship.

332
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,128
What's wrong?

333
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,129
Some sort of force field.

334
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,840
TUVOK:
I've erected

335
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,425
a level-10 containment field
around the Bridge, Captain.

336
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,845
Scanning on all
subspace frequencies.

337
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,596
I'm picking up
two life-forms.

338
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,765
Localize them.

339
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,642
Mission Ops 1.

340
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,143
Professor...

341
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,312
Their force field
is disrupting our interphase.

342
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,564
I'm compensating.

343
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,066
I can at least get us
off this deck.

344
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,401
Show yourselves.

345
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,820
Captain, the life-forms
left the Bridge.

346
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,614
They're now on Deck 2,
Section 13, Mess Hall.

347
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,575
Seal off the deck.

348
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,035
TUVOK:
Deck 2 sealed.

349
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,286
Security team to the Mess Hall.

350
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,956
Intruders?
I don't see any intruders.

351
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,043
It would appear we've
underestimated our endotherms.

352
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,460
Maybe we should
make contact--

353
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,503
explain ourselves.

354
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,047
It may come to that.

355
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,091
Captain, I've analyzed
those spatial phase variants.

356
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,718
Bridge to Chakotay.

357
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,677
Go ahead.

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,723
<i>to a dispersion frequency</i>
<i>of 1.85 gigahertz.</i>

360
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,017
<i>That should disrupt</i>
<i>their cloaking technology.</i>

361
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,769
Acknowledged.

362
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,854
I've matched the frequency
of their shields.

363
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,230
I think we can
get off this...

364
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,865
Spatial fluctuations...

365
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,199
there.

366
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,368
Neelix, get down!

367
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,789
(<i> clicking chirps</i> )

368
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,043
(<i> gasps</i> )

369
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,613
Minor phaser burns
to the upper thoracic region--

370
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,948
nothing serious--

371
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,658
but I want to check
for cellular damage.

372
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,993
I'll run
a microcellular scan.

373
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,911
Begin a DNA
analysis as well.

374
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,330
I'd like to know more about
his molecular physiology.

375
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,957
A belated welcome aboard.

376
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,333
I'm Captain Janeway.

377
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,960
Now, who are you
and what have you done

378
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,919
with my First Officer?

379
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,087
(<i> clicking chirps</i> )

380
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,840
You must have a ship.

381
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,715
Is it cloaked?

382
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,467
(<i> chirping</i> )

383
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,719
We're not going
to hurt you.

384
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,723
We just want
to know why you...

385
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,976
His heart rate and body
temperature have dropped.

386
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,353
His metabolism is almost
completely shut down.

387
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,354
Is he dying?

388
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,981
I don't think so.

389
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,483
His autonomic nervous system
is still fully functional.

390
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,736
He's gone into some sort
of protective hibernation.

391
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,364
Treat his injuries, then
see if you can revive him.

392
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,158
Examine his technology.

393
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,868
I want to know what
we're up against.

394
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,047
Don't be alarmed.

395
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,298
You're on my research vessel.

396
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,591
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

397
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,968
Your instinct is to flee,

398
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,095
but I must warn you
there's a confinement field

399
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,346
around the table.

400
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,264
Just stay calm
and you won't hurt yourself.

401
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,478
What do you want from me?
Why did you invade our ship?

402
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,982
It wasn't an invasion.
We were on a field expedition

403
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,568
to learn more
about your species.

404
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:39,864
We meant no harm.
I'm a molecular paleontologist.

405
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,991
Do you always harpoon
the local wildlife?

406
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,744
An unfortunate mistake.

407
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,580
Veer is inexperienced
and he panicked.

408
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,000
Your people were firing at us.
I couldn't get to him.

409
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,335
So you took me instead.

410
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,462
Yes. A living specimen
of human.

411
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,758
I've been studying
your computer database,

412
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,135
and I have many questions.

413
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,513
The planet of your origin,
correct?

414
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,807
That's right. Earth.

415
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:12,271
Are there any of my kind there?

416
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,440
Any of my species?

417
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,067
Who are you?

418
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,444
Please, answer the question.

419
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,031
Look, drop the force field
and tell me what's going on.

420
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,118
Then, maybe we can make first
contact in a civilized way.

421
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,286
For what it's worth,
I'm a scientist, too.

422
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,579
Maybe I can help you find

423
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,248
whatever it is you're looking
for.

424
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,582
I won't bite.

425
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,589
Thanks.

426
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,051
My name's Chakotay.

427
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,053
Gegen.

428
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,890
All right, Gegen,
let's talk about Earth.

429
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,230
Your call sounded urgent.

430
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,481
With good reason.

431
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,275
I've analyzed
the alien's DNA.

432
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,110
There are 47 genetic markers

433
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,903
identical to those
found in human DNA.

434
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,362
That's more
than coincidence.

435
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,614
I thought so, too.

436
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,241
I ran a search
for those markers

437
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,285
in Earth's
paleontological database.

438
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,911
Take a look at this.

439
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,123
JANEWAY:
Incredible.

440
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,874
That's one way
of putting it.

441
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,043
It says here that those markers
appeared in hundreds

442
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,839
of Earth species, dating back
tens of millions of...

443
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,719
Their species
evolved on Earth?

444
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,721
Apparently so.

445
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,600
And from the look of it,
you and he are distant cousins.

446
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,853
I wonder how distant.

447
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,522
Transfer yourself
to Holodeck 2.

448
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,065
I think it's time
we took a stroll

449
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,733
through primeval history.

450
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,532
I've entered the genetic markers
into the holo-database.

451
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,409
Let's see if we can find
our closet relative.

452
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,537
Computer, analyze
the genetic markers

453
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,206
and search Earth's
fossil record.

454
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,833
Identify any ancestors
common to both humans

455
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,044
and the alien in Sick Bay.

456
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,586
<i>Life-form found.</i>

457
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,214
Display.

458
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,840
Genus eryops.

459
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,382
Devonian Era.

460
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,885
Eryops...

461
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,513
this creature lived
over 400 million years ago.

462
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,017
And is thought to be
the last common ancestor

463
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,144
of cold-blooded and
warm-blooded organisms.

464
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,520
Yes, yes.

465
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,232
Let's take the next step
in our little stroll.

466
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,108
Computer, what's
the most highly evolved

467
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,570
cold-blooded organism
to develop from the eryops?

468
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,199
<i>Genus hadrosaur.</i>
<i>Cretaceous Era.</i>

469
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,034
Display the life-form.

470
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,208
As I recall,
the hadrosaur vanished

471
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,918
when a mass
extinction occurred

472
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,754
at the end of
the Cretaceous Period.

473
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,299
What if the hadrosaur
didn't die off?

474
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,968
What if some of them
survived that extinction

475
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,054
and continued to evolve?

476
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,014
I could well imagine
this creature

477
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,600
giving rise to a more
complex life-form.

478
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,561
Certainly the building blocks
are there--

479
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,398
bipedal, grasping hands...

480
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:04,026
Computer, run a genome
projection algorithm.

481
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,904
If the hadrosaur
had continued to evolve

482
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,365
over the last 65 million years,

483
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,201
extrapolate the most probable
appearance.

484
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,577
<i>Extrapolation complete.</i>

485
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,787
Display life-form.

486
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,419
That creature napping
in Sick Bay...

487
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,254
is a dinosaur.

488
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,964
The question is:

489
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:31,720
Why have we never seen him
in the natural history museums?

490
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,680
If a saurian species
had developed

491
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,182
a language and technology,

492
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,310
you'd think they would have
left something behind,

493
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,520
but what if it evolved
on an isolated continent?

494
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,940
A land mass
that was destroyed.

495
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,776
Earth has been devastated by
countless natural disasters

496
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,194
over the course
of its history--

497
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,947
asteroids, volcanoes,
earthquakes.

498
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,782
All evidence
of your race could be

499
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:55,035
at the bottom of the ocean
or under kilometers of rock.

500
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,246
Obviously not all of my people
became extinct.

501
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,497
Some of them must have developed
space-faring technology

502
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,167
and left the planet.

503
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,585
And ended up here in
the Delta Quadrant.

504
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,964
Our true origins on Earth
lost over the eons,

505
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,300
replaced by Doctrine...

506
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,385
the myth that we were
the first race.

507
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,556
Now you understand
why I had to find your ship.

508
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,977
Next time, you might try
a simple "hello" first.

509
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,647
"Eyes open."

510
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,067
I'm afraid I let my own
prejudice get in the way.

511
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,696
I was... wary of you.

512
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:34,033
We have very poor relations
with non-saurian races.

513
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,535
Mammals in particular
are considered to be a...

514
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,372
lower life-form,

515
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,582
but I must admit, I've never
gotten to know one before.

516
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,460
I hope I've made
a good impression.

517
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,962
In fact you have.

518
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,547
Well, I suggest
we get back to<i> Voyager.</i>

519
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,342
Your friend Veer
is probably sick of

520
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,926
the mammalian food by now.

521
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,927
I can't do that.

522
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,095
Why not?

523
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,554
I've already
made arrangements

524
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,432
to meet my supporters
on the fourth colony.

525
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,599
They're waiting for us.

526
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,559
Tell them we'll be late.

527
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,312
You don't understand
what I'm up against.

528
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,898
I'm being charged with
heresy against Doctrine.

529
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,316
You're my only evidence.

530
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,152
If enough people see
living proof of my theory,

531
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:13,364
even the Ministry will be forced
to acknowledge the truth.

532
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,991
I can't let you go now.

533
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,411
Not until it's over.

534
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,453
I'm sorry.

535
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,580
PARIS:
This should to the trick.

536
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,377
TUVOK:
An apple?

537
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,046
You said you wanted
an organic test subject.

538
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,340
I was referring
to a bio-cylinder,

539
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,050
but the fruit will suffice.

540
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,261
Let's give it a try.

541
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,181
Fascinating.

542
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,808
This alien device is apparently
pushing the apple

543
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,437
slightly out of phase
with our space-time continuum.

544
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,980
A personal cloaking device.

545
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,401
More advanced than
any cloak I've ever seen.

546
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,069
(<i> deep rumbling</i> )

547
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,653
Mr. Kim?

548
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,240
I'm reading a massive spatial
displacement dead ahead.

549
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,080
Red Alert.

550
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,540
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

551
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,583
We're being probed.

552
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,708
Shields at maximum.

553
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,168
Hail them.

554
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,837
No response.

555
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,091
They're locking onto the ship
with an energy beam.

556
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,926
It's cutting right
through our shields.

557
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,471
It's some sort of transporter.

558
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,522
Report.

559
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,857
We've been beamed
inside the alien vessel.

560
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,622
We're losing power.

561
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,789
Switch to auxiliary.

562
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm locked out
of command control.

563
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,502
All systems are
shutting down.

564
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,133
Arm yourselves.

565
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,761
Tuvok to Bridge.

566
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,888
Captain Janeway, respond.

567
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,150
Turbolifts are off-line.

568
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,068
Let's get
to a Jefferies tube.

569
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,161
(<i> clicking chirps</i> )

570
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,539
Tuvok, I hope
that's your stomach.

571
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,290
(<i> chirping</i> )

572
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,132
My tricorder's not working.

573
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,219
There appears to be a dampening
fie...

574
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,303
Tuvok?

575
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,395
Go.

576
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,396
I'm not going to...

577
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,813
That's an order,
Lieutenant.

578
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,614
KIM:
I can't get a single relay back
on-line.

579
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,866
Somehow, they've locked us
out of all primary systems.

580
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,451
Let's get down to
Main Engineering.

581
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,453
We can access the manual
override from there...

582
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,913
(<i> whooshing</i> )

583
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,086
Your vessel
is under our control.

584
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,636
GEGEN:
It's an automated message
from the Ministry of Elders.

585
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,764
It says that they've
captured the<i> Voyager,</i>

586
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,100
that if I don't return
to the city ship

587
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,395
and face my accusers,
they'll destroy my evidence...

588
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,606
kill everyone on board.

589
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,817
What are you
going to do?

590
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,153
I won't be responsible
for those deaths,

591
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,865
but if I go back now
without my support,

592
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,453
they'll discredit my theory,
suppress the truth.

593
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,870
That might be difficult

594
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,914
with the evidence
standing right beside you.

595
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,292
They've taken my ship.

596
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,711
It sounds to me
like we're all on trial here.

597
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,509
I've just laid in a course
for the city ship.

598
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,432
We're looking
for two of our own kind.

599
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,601
One was found
in your medical bay.

600
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,645
Where is the other?
I don't know.

601
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,314
He took my First Officer
and disappeared.

602
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,857
Our scans indicate
that your ship is alone.

603
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,818
Where do you come from?

604
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,820
If you want my cooperation,

605
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,323
I suggest you release
my vessel.

606
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,949
You are non-indigenous beings.

607
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,118
You have no rights
under Doctrine.

608
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,663
Where do you come from?

609
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:34,374
Apparently... we're from
the same place you are--

610
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,209
Earth.

611
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:42,007
I see that Gegen
has begun spreading his lies.

612
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,313
(<i> equipment powering up</i> )

613
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,357
(<i> beeping</i> )

614
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,165
Paris to Janeway.

615
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:18,418
<i>Captain, if you can hear me,</i>
<i>I've got weapons control</i>

616
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,463
<i>and I've armed</i>
<i>a full spread of torpedoes.</i>

617
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,674
Who's that?
My helmsman.

618
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,259
Sounds like he's
about to blast a hole

619
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,680
in the side of your ship.
Lieutenant Paris, fire.

620
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,473
You might want
to hold on to something.

621
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,397
COMPUTER:
<i>Launch protocols</i>
<i>have been disrupted.</i>

622
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,400
Switch to auxiliary protocols.

623
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,443
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

624
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,612
<i>Weapon systems are off-line.</i>

625
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,072
How?

626
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,699
<i>Method unknown.</i>

627
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,410
Paris to Janeway.

628
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,661
Go ahead.

629
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,371
<i>Captain, someone</i>
<i>on the alien vessel</i>

630
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,248
<i>detected my launch sequence.</i>

631
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,958
<i>I don't know how they did it,</i>
<i>but I'm completely locked out.</i>

632
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,419
Nice try, Tom.

633
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,128
Haluk to Command.

634
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,798
The<i> Voyager's</i> Captain
is proving uncooperative.

635
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,259
I request an interrogation
surgeon to assist with the...

636
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,635
MALE:
<i>That won't be necessary.</i>

637
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,636
<i>Gegen is in custody.</i>

638
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,970
<i>Remain on the</i> Voyager

639
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,723
<i>and wait</i>
<i>for further instructions.</i>

640
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,530
Professor Forra Gegen,

641
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,617
you are accused
of heresy against Doctrine.

642
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,244
Do you wish to
retract your claims

643
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,872
regarding
the Distant Origin Theory?

644
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,291
I do not.

645
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,756
Then we will proceed.

646
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,597
FEMALE:
Three months ago,
you circulated a study

647
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,892
criticizing what you called
"resistance to truth"--

648
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,227
once again,
disputing Doctrine.

649
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,397
I apologize if I wrote anything
that offended the Elders,

650
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,108
but I never even mentioned
the word "doctrine."

651
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,152
You didn't have to.

652
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,987
Your meaning was clear.

653
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,781
For nearly a decade,

654
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,032
you've used
the Distant Origin Theory

655
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,451
to attack and undermine

656
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:17,078
the guiding principles
of our society.

657
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,457
Not so! I've been pursuing
a scientific investigation.

658
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,417
I'm not concerned
at all with Doctrine!

659
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,169
My point exactly.

660
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,965
Your disregard for the effects
of your casual theorizing

661
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,175
is why you stand accused.

662
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,427
You are reckless and
irresponsible, and you are

663
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,472
a destructive influence
to our society.

664
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,056
But it is not too late

665
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,184
for you to redress
the damage you have done.

666
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,060
Disavow your claims.

667
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,688
Acknowledge your mistakes

668
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,691
and this Ministry
will show you leniency.

669
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,484
I'm sorry.

670
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,903
I can't deny the evidence.

671
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,113
The proof is standing
right beside me.

672
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,908
Proof? Really?

673
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,286
Our scientists have
analyzed your data.

674
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,038
Their conclusion:

675
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,666
"These creatures are
not related to us at all.

676
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,167
"The genetic similarities

677
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:08,254
are a result of random
convergence, nothing more."

678
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,756
If I may speak?

679
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,926
<i>Voyager's</i> database contains

680
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,679
a complete fossil record
of my planet.

681
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,640
Your genetic markers appear
not only in humans

682
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,226
but in hundreds of species
throughout our history.

683
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,854
That's a lot
of "random convergence."

684
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,981
If you'd take a look
at the data...

685
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,024
We have.

686
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,234
The data isn't in question.

687
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,404
Your interpretation is.

688
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,156
Professor Gegen,
I don't want to be here

689
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,992
any more than you do,

690
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,037
and frankly, I would prefer
not to be responsible

691
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:44,290
for disgracing one of
our most venerable scientists.

692
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,085
All I ask is that
you admit the possibility

693
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,629
that your interpretation
is wrong.

694
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,882
Will you at least do that?

695
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:55,886
I will admit that there
are still questions.

696
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,013
The picture is incomplete.

697
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,974
But I am certain of this:

698
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:05,437
We are from the planet
these humans call Earth.

699
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,689
There are those who disagree.

700
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,873
Tova Veer, you are
an accomplished young scientist.

701
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,208
You were initiated
into the Circle of Archaeology

702
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,752
with the highest of honors.

703
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,420
Yes, Minister.

704
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,006
And you have been
Professor Gegen's assistant

705
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,340
for six years.

706
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,175
I've had that privilege.

707
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,177
You are familiar--

708
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,556
intimately involved with
all of your mentor's research

709
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,601
regarding the so-called
Distant Origin Theory?

710
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,936
That is correct.

711
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,897
In your expert evaluation,

712
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:52,943
what is the validity
of the Professor's analysis?

713
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,032
It is flawed, Minister.

714
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,867
Veer!

715
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,162
You're saying you and Gegen
were mistaken?

716
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,707
Yes.

717
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,751
I've reviewed
all of his research,

718
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:13,630
including data
from the<i> Voyager's</i> computer.

719
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,967
I've checked and rechecked
the procedures.

720
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:21,387
I now believe
that we were... overzealous.

721
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,141
We saw an evolutionary
connection

722
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,976
when, in fact, there was none.

723
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:29,562
Enthusiasm and passion
are never wrong, Veer.

724
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,983
Your only mistake was allowing
them to distort your judgment.

725
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,943
You may go.

726
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,284
Professor Gegen,
I will ask you again:

727
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,453
Could you be mistaken?

728
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,039
What did you say to him?

729
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,583
That you'd take away his honors
if he didn't cooperate?

730
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,295
That you'd send him
to a detention colony?

731
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,131
Could you be mistaken?

732
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,507
Did you threaten his family?!

733
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,550
Respond to the question!

734
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,343
No! Why should I?

735
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,012
You've already made up
your mind.

736
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,263
This inquiry isn't
about evidence and proof.

737
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,932
It's about keeping you
in that chair!

738
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,142
Gegen!

739
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,434
It's about
maintaining a myth

740
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,311
that keeps the Ministry
in power.

741
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,772
You'd do anything
to silence me.

742
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,774
Well, it won't work.

743
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,526
I'll never
retract my claims.

744
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,070
I'd rather go to prison

745
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,279
than help you
perpetuate ignorance!

746
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,867
Your true scales
are finally showing.

747
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,952
You're right, Minister.

748
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,787
I was mistaken.

749
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,374
I thought you might actually
care about the truth,

750
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,210
even if it
called into question

751
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,794
some of our
deepest beliefs, and...

752
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,881
We are not immigrants!

753
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:44,679
I will not deny 20 million years
of history and Doctrine

754
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,059
just because one insignificant
saurian has a theory.

755
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,270
One last time:

756
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,732
Could you be mistaken?

757
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,317
It's you who are
mistaken, Minister.

758
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,945
What?

759
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,864
You accuse Gegen of having
his objectivity clouded

760
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,117
by... wishful thinking,

761
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,410
but aren't you guilty
of the same charge?

762
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,996
I am not on trial here.

763
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,414
I understand,

764
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,084
but, in a way, your beliefs are.

765
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,962
How you think about yourselves,
your place in the universe--

766
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,589
that is on trial

767
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,633
and this isn't the first time.

768
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,426
What do you mean?

769
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,012
I've had the opportunity
over the last few days

770
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,847
to learn something
about your culture--

771
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,515
your great accomplishments.

772
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,643
Consider the breakthrough
into transwarp.

773
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,353
An incredible achievement,
and yet,

774
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,940
your ancient Doctrine predicted
terrible disasters

775
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,566
if it were even attempted.

776
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,527
That held your race back
for millennia

777
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,280
until someone took a chance

778
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,490
and challenged
that prediction.

779
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,450
They succeeded,
and your society

780
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,911
entered a new chapter
of exploration

781
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,413
and your Doctrine
was changed accordingly.

782
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,373
I know from the history
of my own planet

783
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,960
that change is difficult.

784
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,630
New ideas are often greeted
with skepticism-- even fear.

785
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,175
But sometimes
those ideas<i> are</i> accepted

786
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,926
and when they are...

787
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,552
progress is made.

788
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,929
Eyes are opened.

789
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:12,433
When I open my eyes
to this<i> theory,</i>

790
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,562
what I see appalls me.

791
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:20,108
I see my race fleeing
your wretched planet--

792
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,944
a group of pathetic refugees

793
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,990
crawling and scratching
their way across the galaxy,

794
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,160
stumbling into this domain.

795
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,831
I see a race with no birthright,
no legacy.

796
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,334
That is unacceptable.

797
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:40,212
I see something very
different, Minister--

798
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:43,173
an ancient race
of saurians,

799
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,842
probably the first
intelligent life on Earth--

800
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,802
surrounded
by some of the most

801
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,762
terrifying creatures
that ever lived.

802
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,389
And yet they thrived,

803
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,434
developed language
and culture and technology.

804
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,896
And when the planet
was threatened with disaster,

805
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,565
they boldly launched themselves
into space,

806
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,276
crossed what must have seemed
like unimaginable distances,

807
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,946
facing the unknown every day,

808
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,533
but somehow,
they stayed together,

809
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,913
kept going with the same courage
that had served them before

810
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,956
until they reached
this Quadrant,

811
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,667
where they laid the foundation
of what was to become

812
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,045
the great Voth culture.

813
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,256
Deny that past...

814
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:28,509
and you deny the struggle and
achievements of your ancestors.

815
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,221
Deny your origins on Earth...

816
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:34,307
and you deny your true heritage.

817
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,367
Do you retract
your claims?

818
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,955
No.

819
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,207
I stand by them.

820
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,500
Very well.

821
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,420
It is my judgment
you will suffer

822
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,880
the consequences
of your obstinacy.

823
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,175
Gegen, you are guilty
of heresy against Doctrine

824
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,595
and will be placed
on a detention colony.

825
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,139
For as long as you breathe,

826
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,891
you will neither teach
nor engage in research.

827
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,978
Your life
as a scientist has ended.

828
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,647
As you wish.

829
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,112
Chakotay
of the<i> Voyager</i> starship,

830
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:33,825
you, your Captain and her crew
will join Professor Gegen.

831
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,035
Why? You have nothing to gain
by imprisoning them.

832
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,412
Let them go.

833
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,372
You will spend
the remainder of your lives

834
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,706
on a detention colony.

835
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,375
Your ship will be destroyed.

836
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,709
Minister...

837
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,920
You will surrender
your vessel immediately,

838
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,839
and inform your crew
that this judgment...

839
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,965
Stop this, please!

840
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,805
Are you offering me
an alternative?

841
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,492
I have...

842
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,494
reconsidered

843
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:19,829
and I retract
my claims

844
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,333
regarding
the Distant Origin Theory.

845
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:29,964
My analysis of the data
was obviously flawed.

846
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,094
I was...

847
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,638
mistaken.

848
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,892
You are prepared to refute
your work publicly

849
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,894
before the Circles of Science?

850
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,356
Yes.

851
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,567
You will then be assigned
to another area of research.

852
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,570
Surely paleontology
has become tiresome to you

853
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,406
after so many years.

854
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,533
Perhaps metallurgical analysis

855
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,702
would be a more rewarding
vocation for you.

856
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,787
Perhaps.

857
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,624
I am not unreasonable.

858
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,627
You were drawn into this...
situation

859
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,172
through no fault
of your own.

860
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,798
You are to be returned
to your ship

861
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:16,219
where you will set course
away from our territory.

862
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:22,016
It would be
in your best interest

863
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,728
if I never saw you again.

864
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,150
(<i> gong sounds</i> )

865
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,462
I'm not so good
at chemistry.

866
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:53,672
My career
as a metallurgical scientist

867
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:57,552
is likely to be...
undistinguished.

868
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,512
I'm sorry.

869
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,847
I was foolish.

870
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,435
Arrogant...

871
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,521
and I lost everything.

872
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:12,233
You were courageous,
as the Voth have always been

873
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,110
from the first time
they left Earth.

874
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,115
And you, Chakotay,
have been a colleague...

875
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,908
a friend.

876
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,536
I will not forget you.

877
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:26,289
There's something else
I hope you never forget.

878
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:43,681
Someday, every Voth
will see this as home.

879
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,642
Someday.

880
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,226
Eyes open.

881
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,396
Eyes open.

882
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,983
Chakotay to<i> Voyager--</i>
energize.
