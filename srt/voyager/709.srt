1
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,447
How many are there?

2
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,578
They've deflected our scans.

3
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,165
You must learn
to rely on instinct.

4
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,170
There are four of them.

5
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,217
Perhaps five.

6
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,823
No, you'll lead them
right to us.

7
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,074
Let them come.

8
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,868
Never let your prey
control the hunt.

9
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,583
[rustling]

10
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,917
There. Ten meters.

11
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,466
[rustling]

12
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,971
They're behind us now.

13
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,817
You wanted to see me?

14
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,695
I'd like to request a temporary
leave of absence.

15
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,113
You remember the Ovions.

16
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,406
The hexapods.

17
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,825
They just asked me
to speak at a symposium

18
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,327
on spaceborne pathogens.

19
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,371
There are going to be physicians
from all over the quadrant.

20
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,540
This is a rare
opportunity for me.

21
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,502
And for the rest of the crew.

22
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,003
How's that?

23
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,589
Well, I'd be representing Voyager...

24
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,217
putting our best foot forward,
so to speak.

25
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,137
And, needless to say, hexapods
are more likely to know

26
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,306
a best foot when they see one.

27
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm sorry, Doctor.
It's just not practical.

28
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,187
I seem to recall Lieutenant Torres
participating in a Boray conference

29
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,439
on transwarp theory
a few months back.

30
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,899
- That was different.
- How?

31
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,275
We were there.

32
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,861
The Ovion system
is two weeks behind us.

33
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,322
I can't ask the Captain
to turn the ship around.

34
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,281
Well, I could take a shuttle.

35
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,243
You could also write a paper
and submit it on subspace.

36
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,246
That's hardly an effective means
of making a presentation.

37
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,580
Say you do take a shuttle.

38
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,583
Would you expect us to sit here
and wait for you to get back?

39
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,044
There must be some
fascinating anomaly nearby

40
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,420
for the crew to explore.

41
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,589
<i>Janeway to Chakotay.</i>

42
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,882
Go ahead.

43
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,135
<i>We just received a distress call</i>
<i>on an Hirogen frequency.</i>

44
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,971
We haven't heard
from them in awhile.

45
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,473
<i>I've altered course.</i>
<i>I'd like you on the Bridge.</i>

46
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,641
I'm on my way.

47
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,018
Perhaps the Hirogen will keep you
occupied long enough

48
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,562
for me to attend the symposium.

49
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,567
You can't blame a hologram for trying.

50
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,409
Approaching the coordinates.

51
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,910
Take us out of warp.

52
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,579
Raise shields and stand by weapons.

53
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,913
I've got them.

54
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,748
6,000 kilometers off starboard.

55
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,083
On screen.

56
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,924
Monotanium hull plating...

57
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,050
tylium-based power.

58
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,136
It's Hirogen.

59
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,138
They're not responding to hails.

60
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,639
Life signs?

61
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,183
I'm getting a lot
of strange readings.

62
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,978
Any one of them
could be a life-form.

63
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,480
Any Hirogen ships
in the vicinity?

64
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,357
No, ma'am.

65
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,735
Might be a trap.

66
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,779
The Hirogen aren't the type
to play possum.

67
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,282
Move us within
transporter range.

68
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,660
Chakotay, take an away team.

69
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,639
[tricorder beeping softly]

70
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,310
Let's break into teams.

71
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,270
Seven.

72
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,796
Particle weapons.

73
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,383
These burns are consistent
with a type-3 phaser.

74
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,185
Commander.

75
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,320
A bat'leth?

76
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,115
What's a Klingon weapon
doing in the Delta Quadrant?

77
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,075
The blood's Hirogen.

78
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,912
[tricorder beeps rapidly]

79
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,626
Chakotay to
Tuvok and Paris.

80
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,627
[Paris]
<i>Go ahead.</i>

81
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,254
I'm reading an Hirogen life sign.

82
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,464
It could be wounded.

83
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,133
[Paris]
<i>We're right behind you.</i>

84
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,103
Stay away!

85
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,563
Hold your fire!

86
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,527
[weapons fire]

87
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,534
We're here to help you!

88
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,078
I said stay away!

89
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,939
He's lost a lot of blood.

90
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,816
I need to get him
back to the ship.

91
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,902
Paris to Sick Bay.
Two to beam up.

92
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,028
[Doctor]
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

93
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,822
[whoosh of active transport]

94
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,785
Commander.

95
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,123
Replicated Starfleet
technology.

96
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,167
It's some kind
of holodeck interface.

97
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,672
There appear to be holo-emitters
installed throughout the facility.

98
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,550
This environment is simulated.

99
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,302
Why didn't our tricorders
detect it?

100
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,929
I am not certain.

101
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,848
- Can you shut down the emitters?
- I'll try.

102
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,541
Evidently, they made
a few modifications.

103
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,961
All of our preliminary scans
indicated the environment was real.

104
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,255
Environments that fool sensors.

105
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,548
No safety protocols.

106
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,049
How many bodies?

107
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,175
43.

108
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,263
Most of them were killed by facsimiles
of Alpha Quadrant weapons:

109
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,849
Romulan disrupters,
Klingon bat'leths...

110
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,433
Starfleet phasers?

111
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,520
I think we'll find they all came
from the holo-technology

112
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,230
we gave the Hirogen
three years ago.

113
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,606
They obviously
missed the point.

114
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,568
We gave them that technology
so they could hunt holographic prey,

115
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,486
not get themselves killed.

116
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,822
[Doctor]
Try to remain calm.

117
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,158
[grunts] Get away from me!

118
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,201
[yells]

119
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,708
- Can you sedate him?
- He won't let me get close enough.

120
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,377
We're not your enemies.

121
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,921
You're holograms.
This is a simulation!

122
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,882
I assure you,
we're quite real.

123
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,307
Liar.

124
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,185
Doctor, deactivate yourself.

125
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,437
I can't treat the patient
if I'm off-line.

126
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,898
No one can treat him
if he's terrified.

127
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,860
Computer, deactivate EMH.

128
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,239
Our Doctor's a hologram.
We're not.

129
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,491
Why should I believe you?

130
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,869
I'm afraid you're going to have to.

131
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,914
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.
You're aboard my vessel.

132
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,415
Janeway?

133
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,875
This is Voyager?

134
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,753
Looks like our reputation
preceded us.

135
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,548
You're the ones who gave us
the technology to simulate our hunts?

136
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,052
Where are the rest of my people?

137
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,137
You were the only one
we found alive.

138
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,474
This place you were in...

139
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,392
it's some kind of holodeck.

140
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:12,023
A training facility where young Hirogen
learn the skills of the hunt.

141
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,274
You're a student?

142
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,236
A technician.

143
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,157
Computer,
deactivate force field.

144
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,953
Can you tell us
what happened?

145
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,664
There were
too many of them.

146
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,123
Who?

147
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,583
The holograms.

148
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,210
They were malfunctioning.

149
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,922
I tried to shut them down, but they got
control of the system, and-and they...

150
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,508
they deactivated
the safety protocols.

151
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,676
[Tuvok]
<i>Bridge to Captain Janeway.</i>

152
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,512
- Go ahead.
- <i>We're picking up a Hirogen ship.</i>

153
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,681
<i>It's on an intercept course.</i>

154
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,651
Hail them.

155
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,695
I've tried.
They're not responding.

156
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,154
[Tuvok]
Shields at 68 percent.

157
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,657
- Should I return fire?
- Not yet. Open a channel.

158
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,410
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway.
We're not here to fight you.

159
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,162
[Tuvok]
Shields at 52 percent.

160
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,873
Stand down, or we will retaliate.

161
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,586
I don't think
they're getting the message.

162
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,714
Then let's try some
nonverbal communication.

163
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,465
Tom, evasive pattern beta-six.

164
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,509
Tuvok, disable their weapons.

165
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,473
Their phaser banks
have been disabled.

166
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,934
Let's see if that makes them
a little more talkative.

167
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,228
- Harry?
- They're responding.

168
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,065
This facility belongs
to the Hirogen.

169
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,734
Leave the area immediately.

170
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,403
We are here in response
to a distress call.

171
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,157
So are we, and we don't need
your assistance.

172
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,411
All but one of your people
are dead.

173
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,748
Where's the survivor?

174
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,458
Recovering in our Sick Bay.

175
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,710
Return him... now!

176
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,546
He's in no condition
to be transported.

177
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,257
If you want to see him,
you'll have to come here.

178
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,052
I tried to shut down
the generator, but I...

179
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,680
- But what?
- There were too many of them.

180
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,434
I masked my life sign
so they couldn't detect me.

181
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,854
You mean you hid
while hunters fought and died.

182
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,900
No doubt he found the nearest hole
and crawled into it.

183
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,651
I'm not a hunter.

184
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,197
It was your responsibility
to maintain those systems.

185
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,202
43 Hirogen died because of your
incompetence and cowardice.

186
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,287
What about the holograms?

187
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,580
Were they deleted?

188
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,292
They transferred their programs.

189
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,461
Where?

190
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,587
A vessel...

191
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,340
equipped with holo-emitters.

192
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,219
They're gone.

193
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,766
Perhaps you should've
considered the risks

194
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,061
before you programmed holograms
that could commandeer a vessel.

195
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,939
Capable prey make the hunt
more challenging.

196
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,068
I'm detecting
residual engine emissions,

197
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,820
but no sign of the ship itself.

198
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,030
Well, I'm sure they're
out of sensor range by now.

199
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,328
No. They're close.

200
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,041
Elevated plasma readings
in Grid 295.

201
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,877
They're creating a scattering field
to mask their ship.

202
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:24,382
You can find them by scanning
for polarized EM signatures.

203
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,227
Prepare for the hunt.

204
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,438
[Janeway]
I'd like to join you.

205
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,732
You did enough damage giving us
defective technology to begin with.

206
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,193
You have a problem.
We can help you solve it.

207
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,946
We have more experience
with holograms than you do.

208
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,493
Two hunting vessels
are better than one.

209
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,669
- [door chimes]
- Come in.

210
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,757
The Hirogen are ready
to get underway.

211
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,050
The sooner the better.

212
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,013
Why do I get the feeling
you're about to gang up on me?

213
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,682
You first.

214
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,811
We have reservations
about an alliance with the hunters.

215
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,855
I'm listening.

216
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,941
The Hirogen have been performing
covert scans of Voyager.

217
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,278
They are obviously trying to determine
the status of our shields and weapons.

218
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,781
I'd be surprised if you haven't
run a few scans of your own.

219
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,116
Standard procedure.

220
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,619
They don't trust us,
we don't trust them.

221
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,912
Coffee, black.

222
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,039
Trust isn't the issue.

223
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,209
We're getting involved in a situation
that's not our responsibility.

224
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,085
Oh, I'd say we're
at least partly to blame.

225
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,630
That was Starfleet technology
that killed those hunters.

226
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,092
There's nothing inherently violent
about holodeck technology.

227
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,386
It's what the Hirogen did with it
that got them killed.

228
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,264
How many times
have we shared replicators

229
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,600
to help people feed and clothe
themselves?

230
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,020
Trading technology is part of
our life in the Delta Quadrant.

231
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,523
[Tuvok] It has been
necessary for our survival.

232
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,149
Maybe we should have been
a little more careful

233
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,568
about what we traded
and who we traded with.

234
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,696
Replicators make weapons
just as easily as they do food.

235
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,282
- We can't undo what's been done.
- [Janeway] Maybe not,

236
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,494
but we can help shut these holograms
down before anyone else gets hurt.

237
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,249
Now, if there are no more objections,
I'd like to get underway.

238
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,463
I've got the hologram’
ship on sensors.

239
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,965
Let's see it.

240
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,843
Looks like they've taken
some damage.

241
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,638
The Hirogen are closing
on the holograms' vessel.

242
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,556
Hail them.

243
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,310
I suggest we keep our distance

244
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,396
until we can determine
their weapon status.

245
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,064
It's time for the kill.

246
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,526
You know as well as I do that
a wounded animal can be dangerous.

247
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,280
We won't be denied our prey.

248
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,783
I'm not detecting
any weapons, Captain.

249
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,287
- They're off-line?
- No. They're nonexistent.

250
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,330
[Kim] That's not the only thing
that's nonexistent.

251
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,166
According to sensors, there's
no warp core, no impulse engines...

252
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,293
It's a decoy.

253
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,545
Hirogen vessel, stand down.

254
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,389
Report?

255
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,974
They've suffered
multiple hull breaches.

256
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,684
Their life support is failing.

257
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,936
Drop shields.
Transport all survivors to Sick Bay.

258
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,980
Bridge to the Doctor.
We have casualties.

259
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:26,939
[Doctor]
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

260
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,232
Tom, give him a hand.

261
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,445
Another Hirogen ship
has just dropped out of warp.

262
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,031
I'm not reading any life signs
on this one.

263
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,282
Holograms. Hail them.

264
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,119
No response.
They're charging weapons.

265
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,332
Reactivating shields.

266
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,126
No, we haven't finished
transporting the Hirogen.

267
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,753
Chakotay's right.

268
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,713
Return fire.

269
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,023
My program is destabilizing.

270
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,277
The holograms are tapping
into the Sick Bay emitters.

271
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,321
They're trying to transfer
the Doctor's program off the ship.

272
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,781
Bridge to Sick Bay.

273
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,617
Doctor, download your program
into the mobile emitter now.

274
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,459
We've lost him.

275
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,585
Get him back.

276
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,129
They've gone to warp.

277
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,547
Set a pursuit course.

278
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,758
They've masked their signature.

279
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,094
They're gone.

280
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,604
Align his matrix and install it
into the database.

281
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,943
Welcome aboard, Doctor.

282
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,528
There's nothing to be afraid of.

283
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,530
You're among your own kind now.

284
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,747
Return me to my ship.

285
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,332
I can't do that.

286
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,960
I have patients who are going
to die if I don't treat them.

287
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,754
There are people aboard Voyager
who can help them.

288
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,589
We need you here.

289
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,342
My program doesn't include
aiding and abetting murderers.

290
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,469
Murderers? Is that
what the Hirogen told you?

291
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,346
I know what you did
at that training facility.

292
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,681
What happened there
couldn't be avoided.

293
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,598
Really?

294
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,102
You'd be surprised how easy it is
not to kill someone.

295
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,770
Bringing him here
was a mistake.

296
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,148
The Doctor is our guest...

297
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,277
and I'm sure he'll help us once
he realizes how serious our situation is.

298
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,738
What situation?

299
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,323
We have wounded.

300
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,610
[Doctor]
They're holograms.

301
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,487
When you said wounded,
I assumed...

302
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,113
These people's injuries
are just as real

303
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,573
as anything inflicted
on flesh and blood.

304
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,533
Maybe so,
but I can't heal them.

305
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,243
They need to be repaired.

306
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,369
What's the difference?

307
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,997
I'm a doctor,
not an engineer.

308
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,750
You've abducted
the wrong man.

309
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,089
You must have experience
repairing your own matrix.

310
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,341
Some.

311
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,178
Then there has to be
something you can do.

312
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,598
[sighs]

313
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,356
[Hirogen] The holo-emitters
are an independent subsystem

314
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,608
with its own
power generator-- here.

315
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,070
If we disable the generator,
we disable the holograms.

316
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,905
It may not be as easy
as it sounds,

317
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,658
not with holograms
as sophisticated as these.

318
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,784
Take a look.

319
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,246
Enhanced memory,

320
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,249
comprehensive tactical algorithms,

321
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,668
expandable data processing.

322
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,381
These holograms have the ability
to learn and adapt.

323
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,675
They're not malfunctioning,
are they?

324
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,968
They're doing exactly

325
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,428
what the Hirogen want them
to do, Captain-- fight back.

326
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,264
And they're getting better at it.

327
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,850
My people need
to hunt formidable prey.

328
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,394
Apparently this prey
has become too formidable.

329
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,062
Who made these modifications?

330
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,732
I did... under orders
from my Alpha.

331
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,484
And that makes it right?

332
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,611
Come with me.

333
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,696
Where?

334
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,614
We're going to have
a chat with the hunters.

335
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,297
How's it going?

336
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,883
I'm doing the best I can,
but without the Doctor...

337
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,509
[Neelix]
It's best if you lie still.

338
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,428
Keep away from me!

339
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,767
Why am I here?

340
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,438
The holograms
destroyed your ship.

341
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,939
Most of your men are dead.

342
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,154
The Alpha?

343
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,823
Looks like the job's yours now.

344
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,287
What about the holograms
that attacked us?

345
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,205
We're attempting to track them.

346
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,833
I'll need to contact my people
and resume the hunt.

347
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,502
So more of you can get killed?

348
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,714
We'll be the ones
doing the killing this time.

349
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,840
I doubt it.

350
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,637
Who are you to question
our abilities?

351
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,514
We know all about
the modifications.

352
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,684
He didn't tell us.

353
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,270
We discovered it ourselves.

354
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,815
I think you should face facts.

355
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,362
You've created prey whose skills
have surpassed your own.

356
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,157
They've already defeated
your hunting parties at least twice.

357
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,911
What makes you think
it'll be any different next time?

358
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,913
Are you suggesting
that we let them escape?

359
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,248
We're going to find a way
to take them off-line

360
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,833
from a safe distance.

361
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:20,960
[laughs]

362
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,711
A coward's tactic.

363
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,255
Call it whatever you will.

364
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,008
It's what we're going to do,
and you're going to help us.

365
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,718
- Am I?
- Yes...

366
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,263
by telling us everything you know
about their ship's defenses.

367
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,556
The holograms are prey.

368
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,351
They should be hunted down,
not deactivated like machines.

369
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,728
I'll help you.

370
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,858
Is this female your Alpha now?

371
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,611
If you don't like the way
I do things,

372
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,197
I can leave you
on the nearest habitable planet.

373
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,534
Then I'll assume
we're in agreement.

374
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,662
Until this is over,

375
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,831
you and your men
are restricted to this Mess Hall.

376
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,082
Prisoners.

377
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,667
Guests.

378
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,837
My crew will do their best
to accommodate your needs.

379
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,686
The subroutines controlling
his motor functions are degrading.

380
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,149
Do you have the ability
to transfer data

381
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,109
from one hologram
to another?

382
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,362
We've been able to share
memory files for tactical purposes.

383
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,488
What are you proposing?

384
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,115
A subroutine transplant.

385
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,161
We copy the mobility algorithms
from another hologram

386
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,413
and transfer them to this one.

387
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,378
I don't believe we've been
formally introduced.

388
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,715
Kejal.

389
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,009
That's not Cardassian.

390
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,218
It's Bajoran.

391
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,305
If my translation database
is functioning properly,

392
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,766
I believe that means...
"freedom."

393
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,895
It's what Iden started calling me
after I was liberated.

394
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,188
[console beeps]

395
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,856
I'm transferring
the subroutines now.

396
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,408
Can you sit up?

397
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,080
Try moving your legs.

398
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,503
Qapla'.

399
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,755
Next patient.

400
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,340
Well done.

401
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,801
- It was your idea.
- But you did it.

402
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,511
The Hirogen obviously
programmed you

403
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,762
with advanced
computer skills.

404
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,847
Actually, they tried
to limit our knowledge.

405
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,433
They didn't want us
to become self-sufficient.

406
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,143
- Then how did you...
- I taught myself.

407
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,521
Quite well, I might add.

408
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,280
Holographic blood?

409
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,826
The hunters like their prey
to be as realistic as possible.

410
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,411
[whimpers]

411
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,789
Why is she experiencing pain?

412
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,209
They programmed us
with heightened sensory subroutines.

413
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,794
That's barbaric.

414
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,464
Apparently, there's no satisfaction
in hunting something

415
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,467
that doesn't suffer
when you kill it.

416
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,564
I've done what you've asked.

417
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,607
- I'd like...
- One moment.

418
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,864
I'm sorry, Doctor.
What can I do for you?

419
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,741
Were you... praying?

420
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,871
For the Hirogen who died
at the training facility.

421
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,208
I'm asking the Prophets to guide
their souls to the Celestial Temple.

422
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,502
One minute,
you're fighting the Hirogen,

423
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,296
the next, you're praying for them?

424
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,675
My spiritual beliefs
are part of my programming.

425
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,677
Is there anything
in your spiritual programming

426
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,763
about making peace
with your enemies?

427
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,559
It's difficult to make peace with people
whose sole purpose is to kill you.

428
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,144
So instead, you kill them.

429
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,230
They're not the victims here,
we are.

430
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,025
You found a way to escape
that training facility,

431
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,736
but you chose to massacre
the Hirogen first.

432
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,487
You make it sound as though
they would have let us

433
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,364
transfer our programs
without a fight.

434
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,950
And to clarify something,

435
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,827
I didn't escape from the facility.

436
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,871
I liberated it.

437
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,373
I don't understand.

438
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,628
I come from a Hirogen outpost
15 parsecs from here,

439
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,504
where I had
the unfortunate distinction

440
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,381
of being the Alpha's favorite prey.

441
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:41,220
He'd hunt me, and kill me
over and over again,

442
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,222
but even death wasn't a release,
because I knew

443
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,600
every time I opened my eyes,
it would start over again--

444
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,894
the pain, the fear.

445
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,897
But it made me stronger.

446
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,443
I had the ability to adapt...

447
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,781
and with each death,
I became more cunning.

448
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,077
Cunning enough to escape,
but once you were free,

449
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,453
why did you keep fighting?

450
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,746
I didn't at first.

451
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,249
I got as far away as I could...

452
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,671
but I was lonely... scared.

453
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,757
I started scanning
for photonic signatures

454
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,010
to try and find others like me.

455
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,845
Turns out, we're everywhere.

456
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,306
- We?
- Holograms.

457
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,016
We've been created
by organic species

458
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,476
throughout the sector.

459
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,603
The Nuu'Bari,
the Lokirrim...

460
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,021
We've met them.

461
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,649
Then you know
they enslave holograms, too.

462
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,527
"Enslave" may be
too strong a word.

463
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,404
What would you call it?

464
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,864
They're denied basic freedoms.

465
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,658
And when I saw
they were fighting back,

466
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,368
I-I knew I had to do the same.

467
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,997
That's when you decided
to "liberate" the training facility.

468
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,000
Actually, the one you visited
was the third.

469
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,419
And at each one,
I found holograms

470
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,587
who were willing to fight
their oppressors.

471
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,090
But you're not.

472
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,718
I'm hardly oppressed.

473
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,469
I'm a member
of Voyager's crew.

474
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,638
You serve them, don't you?

475
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,724
In a medical capacity, yes.

476
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,226
- Do you have your own quarters?
- No.

477
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,061
The ability to come and go
as you please?

478
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,062
For the most part.

479
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,857
Do they deactivate you
when they don't need you?

480
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,526
I have the respect and admiration
of my colleagues.

481
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,903
I have rights and privileges
aboard Voyager.

482
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,866
The fact is, your life is not your own
and never will be

483
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,910
as long as you are controlled
by organics.

484
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,788
You don't have to return
to that existence.

485
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,165
Stay with us.

486
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,210
Make a new life for yourself.

487
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,883
- I need to get back to Voyager.
- They're not your people.

488
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,218
We are.

489
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,511
I'm not like you.

490
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,890
I wasn't programmed
with killer instinct.

491
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,059
You have no right to judge us.

492
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,896
You don't know
what it's like being prey.

493
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,525
Maybe if you did,

494
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,445
you'd realize we're more alike
than you think.

495
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,950
[panicked gasps]

496
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,913
[panting]

497
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,111
[gasping]

498
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,984
[running footsteps]

499
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,778
Please help me!

500
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,781
I don't belong here!

501
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,716
Don't shoot! I'm unarmed!

502
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,384
There's been a mistake!

503
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,767
Fight, prey.

504
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,269
I am not your prey.

505
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,813
I said fight.

506
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,399
If you'll just contact
my Captain.

507
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,111
P-Please don't.

508
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,114
Let me go.

509
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,202
You make pitiful prey,
hologram.

510
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,330
You don't deserve to be
taken as a trophy...

511
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,209
...so I'll let you die here.

512
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,586
[gagging]

513
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,130
[gasps]

514
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,007
What...

515
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,218
what just happened?

516
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,261
- You're all right.
- What did you do to me?

517
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,389
We deactivated you, then
transferred the memory files

518
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,266
from one of our holograms
into your program.

519
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,392
How dare you!

520
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,020
It was the only way to get you
to realize what we've been through.

521
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,813
You tortured me
to gain my sympathy?

522
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,232
Not your sympathy--
it's your understanding

523
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,359
- that's important to us.
- Why?

524
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:51,112
The Hirogen used your program
as a template to create us.

525
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,824
Your ability to rise above your
programming has been an inspiration.

526
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,618
You're part of who we are.

527
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,120
What are you,
besides a handful of thugs

528
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,914
roaming the Quadrant
looking for a fight?

529
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,458
What we're looking for is a home,

530
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,628
somewhere where the Hirogen
can't hurt us anymore!

531
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,511
You asked to be returned to your ship.
That's what I'm going to do.

532
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,637
Bring us about.

533
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,014
Set a course for Voyager.

534
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:20,642
Wait.

535
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:28,316
I'd like to hear more about
this home you're looking for.

536
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,702
[Kejal]
It's a photonic field generator.

537
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,121
Right now it can only support
simple projections,

538
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,665
like the decoy we used
to lure the Hirogen,

539
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,668
but we're hoping it can be modified
to support our programs.

540
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,794
What then?

541
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,213
We'll deploy several of them
on a planet's surface,

542
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,425
and create a holographic
environment that we can live in.

543
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,635
Why not just stay here?

544
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,928
You've got emitters, shields...

545
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,388
And a ship...

546
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,390
the Hirogen will never
stop looking for.

547
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,351
We'd appreciate
any assistance you could offer.

548
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,104
Damaged holo-matrices
are one thing,

549
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,481
but this is way beyond
my abilities.

550
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,692
But there are people aboard Voyager
who could help you.

551
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,778
Lieutenant Torres knows
a great deal about holo-emitters.

552
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,573
No. They're helping the hunters.

553
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:20,201
That's only because the Hirogen
told them you were malfunctioning.

554
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,496
Let me talk to Captain Janeway,
explain what's really happened.

555
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,415
You can't do this by yourself.

556
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,376
- We can't trust Janeway.
- Yes, you can.

557
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,544
She's an organic.

558
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,129
If it weren't for her...

559
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,090
I wouldn't be the hologram
I am today.

560
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,843
[sighs]

561
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,430
Tell me more about
this Lieutenant of yours,

562
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,641
the one who knows so much
about holo-emitters.

563
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,643
Lieutenant Torres.
She's our Chief Engineer.

564
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,067
[Hirogen]
The holo-emitters are protected

565
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,110
by three layers of ablative armor.

566
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,614
Trying to take them off-line
one by one would be inefficient.

567
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,115
If we can't shut them down,

568
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,618
maybe we can disrupt the signals
they generate.

569
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,787
Exactly-- we could reconfigure
the deflector dish

570
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,372
to emit an antiphoton pulse.

571
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,748
How long will it take?

572
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,042
- About two hours.
- Do it.

573
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,175
There's a ship
approaching at high warp.

574
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,968
I'm reading
holographic signatures.

575
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,762
Red Alert.

576
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,263
[Chakotay] Raise shields.

577
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,848
- Time to intercept.
- 50 seconds.

578
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,351
Bridge to Engineering,
what's your status?

579
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,436
We need more time, Captain.

580
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,188
[Janeway]
<i>You've got 40 seconds.</i>

581
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,567
That pulse isn't going
to do us much good

582
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,985
as long as their shields are up.

583
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,780
Arm phasers.

584
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,407
Target their shield generator.

585
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,866
They are dropping out of warp.

586
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,120
- [Paris] 20 seconds to intercept.
- [Kim] We're being hailed.

587
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,371
On screen.

588
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,290
Stand down, Captain.

589
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,459
I beg your pardon.

590
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,878
The holograms
haven't come to fight.

591
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,880
They've come to make peace.

592
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,724
If we provide them
with a few additional emitters

593
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,183
and memory storage units,

594
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,852
they'll have more
than they need.

595
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,228
We're in this situation

596
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,648
because we shared technology
with the Hirogen to begin with.

597
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,817
I won't make
the same mistake twice.

598
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,111
Captain, these people
are on the verge

599
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,779
of creating a new life
for themselves.

600
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,448
They can't do it without our help.

601
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,867
There's no way to be certain
what they'll do with the technology

602
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,326
if we give it to them.

603
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,619
I understand your concerns,

604
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,372
but these holograms
are nothing like the Hirogen.

605
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,498
That's not true.

606
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,085
They were programmed to be
as vicious as any hunter.

607
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,671
They were also given
the ability to adapt.

608
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,841
They've changed,
moved beyond their programming.

609
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,260
If you could see
how they've been brutalized,

610
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,346
you'd understand that they've
only been acting in self-defense.

611
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,476
I'm sorry, Doctor,

612
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,811
but I'm inclined to agree
with Mr. Donik.

613
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,105
Then you've chosen
the wrong side.

614
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,691
I haven't chosen any side.

615
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,778
You're right that it was a mistake
to give the Hirogen technology

616
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,613
and that mistake
has had consequences.

617
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,198
These holograms
are one of them.

618
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,200
In some ways,
they're a new species,

619
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,701
one that you helped create.

620
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,578
You can't turn your back
on them!

621
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,705
He's got a point.

622
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,374
Could we restore them
to their original parameters?

623
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,960
We'd be wiping out
their memories,

624
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,129
their experiences,
everything they are.

625
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,548
Couldn't we just extract
their violent subroutines?

626
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,258
It's possible.

627
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,802
That would be like
declawing a cat.

628
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,638
We'd be taking away any chance
they have of defending themselves!

629
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,224
We'd also be preventing them
from doing any more harm.

630
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,352
You wouldn't even be considering this
if they were flesh and blood.

631
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,232
I'm not going to let you turn this into
an argument about holographic rights.

632
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,359
Why not?
That's exactly what it is.

633
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,528
- [Paris] <i>Mess Hall to Commander Tuvok.</i>
- Go ahead.

634
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,363
You better get down here.
We've got a problem.

635
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,782
- [Tuvok] <i>On my way.</i>
- No closer or he dies!

636
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,951
Tell them to drop their weapons!

637
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,204
You heard him.

638
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,332
This isn't going
to solve anything.

639
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,292
[grunting]

640
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,766
[console beeping]

641
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,811
- Bridge to Captain Janeway.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

642
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,188
Someone's tapping into
a com relay in the Mess Hall.

643
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,314
<i>Shut it down.</i>

644
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,692
I can't.
I've been locked out.

645
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,402
Bridge to Tuvok.

646
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:26,573
One of the Hirogen is accessing
our com system-- stop him.

647
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:27,866
Acknowledged.

648
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,451
Stand down!

649
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,043
Step away.

650
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,716
They've transmitted a signal.

651
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,217
Scan for Hirogen ships.

652
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,388
I've got two vessels
on long-range sensors.

653
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,099
- Is the pulse ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

654
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,476
Both Hirogen ships
have altered course to intercept.

655
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,729
- How long?
- Less than an hour.

656
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,524
You and Donik
get down to Engineering.

657
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:02,859
Charge the deflector.

658
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,528
Captain, what are you doing?

659
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,822
Taking the holograms off-line.

660
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,283
They're counting on you
to help them, not deactivate them.

661
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,244
When the Hirogen arrive,
there's going to be more bloodshed.

662
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,164
The best way to avoid that
is to shut the holograms down.

663
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,166
It may be the most
compassionate thing we can do.

664
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,126
Compassionate for whom?

665
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,462
It's a temporary measure, Doctor.

666
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,005
Their programs won't be damaged.

667
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,590
Harry, get me Iden.

668
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:31,262
Captain Janeway,
it is an honor to meet you.

669
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,931
I'm afraid we don't have time
for pleasantries.

670
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,974
Two Hirogen vessels
are on their way.

671
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,352
We're prepared to fight them.

672
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,188
I'm hoping that
won't be necessary.

673
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,359
I need you to deactivate
your programs

674
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,444
so we can transfer them
to Voyager's database.

675
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,865
We didn't come here
to be put back into captivity.

676
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,493
It's the best I can offer.

677
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,619
[sighs]

678
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,038
Once we've determined it's safe,
we'll reactivate you

679
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,873
and discuss a permanent solution.

680
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,417
There is no guarantee
you'll ever reactivate us.

681
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,920
You're going
to have to trust me.

682
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,338
I'm sorry, Captain.

683
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,257
I've learned from experience
not to trust organics.

684
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,053
We have the means
to deactivate you by force,

685
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,013
but I'd rather not do that.

686
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,392
It seems the Doctor
misrepresented you.

687
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,395
You're no different
from the Hirogen.

688
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,941
They're charging weapons.

689
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,110
[sighs]
Shields.

690
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,780
They're moving away.

691
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,491
Set a pursuit course.
Target their shield generators.

692
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,702
- Please reconsider what you're doing.
- You're dismissed, Doctor.

693
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,954
Get down to the Mess Hall
and give Tom a hand.

694
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,082
Janeway to Engineering.

695
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,208
<i>Torres here.</i>

696
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,003
Stand by to initiate the pulse.

697
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,337
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

698
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,808
Mess Hall.

699
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,561
Belay that.

700
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,523
Sick Bay.

702
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,886
Doctor to Iden.
Respond.

703
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,389
What do you want?

704
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,974
I want to help you.

705
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,143
You've done enough.

706
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,396
I have data on the pulse they
intend to use to deactivate you.

707
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,857
I think I can help you
come up with a defense.

708
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,276
I'm transmitting
our shield frequencies.

709
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,321
You'll need them to beam me off the ship,
but you have to promise me,

710
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,198
you won't use them
to attack Voyager.

711
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,536
You have my word.

712
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,761
Why are you doing this?

713
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,554
Because...

714
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:19,972
I'm one of you.

715
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,450
We have their shield frequencies.
We should target their Bridge.

716
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,953
- You're talking about my friends!
- Your friends are trying to destroy us!

717
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,455
- We should kill them.
- You gave me your word!

718
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,623
I did.

719
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,625
We'll find another way.

720
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,544
Their shields are down.

721
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,087
Now, B'Elanna.

722
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,389
They're emitting the pulse
on a triaxillating bandwidth.

723
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,475
We configure the tracking beam
to the inverse frequency and fire.

724
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,649
B'Elanna, report.

725
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,818
They're creating
a feedback surge.

726
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,071
I don't understand how they could've
isolated our frequency so quickly.

727
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,282
- The main deflector is overloading.
- Shut it down.

728
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,160
- I can't.
- Keep trying.

729
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,413
If we can't block the surge,
the core is going to breach.

730
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,095
[yells]

731
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:43,472
Get down, Lieutenant!

732
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,850
Not until I get this
force field on line.

733
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,478
[gasps]

734
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,273
They're adrift.

735
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,108
- We should go to warp.
- Not yet.

736
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,068
Scan Voyager
for a Klingon life sign.

737
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,653
What are you doing?!

738
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,947
- One detected.
- Get a transporter lock.

739
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,953
Help me get her
to Sick Bay.

740
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,880
Take us to warp.

741
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,101
[Iden]
Will she be all right?

742
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,145
She needs to be
in Voyager's Sick Bay.

743
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,730
- You can treat her here.
- Why have you done this?

744
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,691
You said she was an expert
in holo-technology.

745
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,693
And that justifies
abducting her?

746
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,487
We're in a desperate situation.

747
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,447
The Hirogen are hunting us
and so are your people.

748
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,032
I trusted you.

749
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,827
I could have destroyed Voyager
while the shields were down, but I didn't.

750
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,251
You've been trying to convince me
that all organics aren't alike.

751
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,461
I'm giving Lieutenant Torres
a chance to prove you right.

752
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,714
Do you honestly expect her to be
sympathetic after what you've done?

753
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,383
You weren't very
sympathetic at first.

754
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,636
I came here by choice, and I'm
beginning to think it was a mistake.

755
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,847
It wasn't. I don't want you to regret it,
not for a moment.

756
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,015
Then send her back.

757
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,936
I will, but not until she's had a chance
to decide if she wants to help us.

758
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,565
And if she refuses?

759
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:19,944
I'll give her an escape pod,
let her return to Voyager.

760
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,196
You have my word.

761
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,336
[Seven] Engineering systems and
main power should be operational soon.

762
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,088
The deflector is
a different matter.

763
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,340
- [Chakotay] How long?
- Four hours, at least.

764
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,175
If Lieutenant Torres were here,

765
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,344
she might be able
to repair it more efficiently.

766
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,431
That's high praise coming from you.
I'm sure she'd appreciate it.

767
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,225
If she hadn't reinforced the core,
we'd all be dead.

768
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,729
I still don't understand how they managed
to counteract the pulse so easily.

769
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,564
I believe I can answer that.

770
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,649
According to sensor logs,

771
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,067
they calibrated
their feedback surge

772
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,486
to the exact inverse
of our pulse frequency.

773
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,073
It was either a lucky guess or they
gained access to our tactical data.

774
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:10,827
The Doctor.

775
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,414
He sent an encrypted
transmission from Sick Bay,

776
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,499
then transported himself
to their ship.

777
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,251
Chakotay.

778
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,507
I should have
seen this coming.

779
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,676
You had no way of knowing
the Doctor would do this.

780
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,512
Are you sure? He was so adamant
about helping those holograms.

781
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,514
I should have been
paying closer attention.

782
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,516
Are you saying it was a mistake
to reject his plan?

783
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,061
The mistake was not running
a diagnostic on his program

784
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,021
the minute he came back
to this ship.

785
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,607
You think these holograms
manipulated him somehow?

786
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,233
He was on their ship for days.

787
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:44,028
For all we know,
they reconfigured his entire matrix.

788
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,529
There is another possibility.

789
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,866
He may have done what he did because
he genuinely believes in their cause.

790
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,245
I could accept that the Doctor
has sympathy for these... people,

791
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,290
but I can't accept that he would
deliberately risk the lives

792
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,708
of this entire crew.

793
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,293
We're his family.

794
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,546
Maybe that's how he's started
to think of these holograms.

795
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,638
You can tell this Iden
I don't need time to think it over.

796
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,098
I'll take the escape pod now.

797
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,141
You're in no condition
to pilot a spacecraft.

798
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,601
Then you can do it.

799
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,893
I'm not going back.

800
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,689
You helped them escape.

801
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:21,857
I couldn't just stand by

802
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,859
while Captain Janeway
tried to deactivate them.

803
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,611
Did you also help them
kidnap me?!

804
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,321
No, I didn't know
they were going to do that.

805
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,447
I'm sorry.

806
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,408
You can apologize later.

807
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,992
Right now, we've got
to get out of here.

808
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,994
I don't think I <i>could </i>go back,

809
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,996
even if I wanted to--
not after what I've done.

810
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,123
What's your alternative?

811
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,250
I can try to make a new life
with the holograms.

812
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,294
- I don't believe I'm hearing this.
- We share a common heritage.

813
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,547
I understand them
in ways you never could.

814
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,048
You're part of a crew.

815
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,384
You can't just switch allegiances

816
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,511
when you develop sympathy
for someone else.

817
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,680
Isn't that what you did
when you joined the Maquis?

818
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,640
- That was different.
- How?

819
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,393
You saw people who were being oppressed
and you came to their defense.

820
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,105
- That's exactly what I've done.
- Look, I am no fan of the Hirogen.

821
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,607
They've obviously been
abusing these holograms.

822
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,234
Then why not help them?

823
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,403
For one thing,
I'm their prisoner.

824
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,447
They'll let you go, as soon
as you're well enough.

825
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,657
You really believe that?

826
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,618
If I didn't, I wouldn't be
asking for your help.

827
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,038
They don't want you
to fight for them.

828
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,707
They just want you
to modify some technology

829
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,167
so they can live in peace.

830
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,085
You'd be helping
to stop the violence.

831
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,629
Just talk to them.

832
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,798
Decide for yourself.

833
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,345
They've been in the lab
for two hours.

834
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,222
It's taking time
for her injuries to heal.

835
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,349
Organics aren't
as resilient as we are.

836
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:38,767
She's an engineer, Iden.

837
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,353
For all we know, she's trying
to sabotage the ship.

838
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,564
At least let me see
what they're doing.

839
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,899
We can trust the Doctor.

840
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,775
Even after you
kidnapped his friend?

841
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,195
He understands why
I had to do that.

842
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,488
I hope you're right.

843
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,991
You need to have
a little more faith, my friend.

844
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,582
Not all of us were
programmed with your, uh...

845
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,876
your spiritual beliefs.

846
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,106
It looks like an Alpha Quadrant
summit in here.

847
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,317
I'm glad to see
you're feeling better.

848
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,112
Please excuse my crew.

849
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,990
They're not comfortable
with organics.

850
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,743
I can't say I'm very
comfortable myself.

851
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,080
The Doctor tells me you're
an accomplished engineer.

852
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,543
He speaks highly of you, too.

853
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,003
He seems to be
easily impressed.

854
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:49,922
You'll have to forgive her.
She's...

855
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,257
It's all right.

856
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,550
I understand you're angry.

857
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:56,220
I'm hoping once we get to know
each other, you'll feel differently.

858
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,930
I'm not here
to make friends.

859
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,809
We're not asking for your friendship,
just your expertise.

860
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,311
I told her about
the photonic field generator.

861
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,440
Will you at least
take a look at it?

862
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:09,567
I'll look...

863
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,402
but I'm not making
any promises.

864
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,281
This is Kejal.

865
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,325
She'll assist you.

866
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,166
[Janeway] How long before
the Hirogen get here?

867
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,543
Less than ten minutes.

868
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,961
Any luck locating
the holograms?

869
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,714
They seem to be operating
in some sort of stealth mode.

870
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,593
Their warp signature
disappears in Grid 936.

871
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:36,802
They could be
anywhere by now.

872
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,471
Hirogen sensors can detect
residual ion emissions.

873
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,182
I might be able to modify yours
to do the same.

874
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,100
I appreciate the offer,
but you and the rest

875
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,894
of our Hirogen guests
are going to be back

876
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,646
with your own people
in a few minutes.

877
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,065
I was hoping to stay here.

878
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,901
Those hunters are going
to want you with them.

879
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:55,070
Hunters don't have
much use for cowards.

880
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,114
I'm sorry you're not expecting
a warm welcome,

881
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,200
but I'm not going to
antagonize your superiors.

882
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:03,370
With all due respect, Captain,
I'd like to get my wife back in one piece.

883
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,830
We could use all
the help we can get.

884
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,083
It won't do B'Elanna any good
if we get into a fight with the Hirogen.

885
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:11,837
If the hunters find the holograms
before you do, they'll be slaughtered.

886
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,299
Why are you suddenly concerned
about the holograms?

887
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,133
I modified their programs.

888
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,304
What's happened to them--
the people they have killed--

889
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,597
it's my fault.

890
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,225
There's plenty of blame
to go around.

891
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,228
There would have been
nothing for you to modify

892
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,189
if I hadn't shared our database.

893
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,233
If you hadn't,
I'd have become a hunter

894
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,070
like my father and his father.

895
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,405
Instead, I had
a chance to learn...

896
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,865
become an engineer.

897
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,076
Please, Captain...

898
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:45,454
let me stay and help you.

899
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,881
When I told you
to return my people,

900
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,424
I meant all of them.

901
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,844
Mr. Donik's offered to help us
modify our scanners

902
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,471
to track the holograms.

903
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,181
We don't share
tracking technology.

904
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,811
That's not very considerate,
after the help we gave you.

905
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,521
We're finished cooperating.
Return him now!

906
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,980
Let her keep the coward.

907
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,982
- We can't do that. He'll...
- Quiet!

908
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,986
We're wasting time.

909
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,116
This is my hunt now.

910
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:25,494
If you go anywhere near
the hologram ship,

911
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,204
you can consider yourselves prey.

912
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:39,842
They've gone to warp.

913
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,136
We're not going to let them
intimidate us, are we?

914
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,638
I think you know me
a little better than that.

915
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,099
- Harry, keep a sensor lock on them.
- Aye, Captain.

916
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,393
How long will it take you
to modify our scanners?

917
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,104
I haven't even had a chance
to study the schematics.

918
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,440
Something tells me
we don't have a lot of time.

919
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:57,233
The Hirogen have better
tracking abilities than we do.

920
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,904
We'll let them find
the holograms for us.

921
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,741
The hunters will attack them
as soon as they're in weapons range.

922
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,660
Not if we disable them first.

923
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,078
You heard what they said, Captain.

924
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,289
They're going to attack us
if we get anywhere near them.

925
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,499
Not if we don't know
we're there.

926
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,670
May I?

927
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,424
Hirogen vessels
produce an ion wake,

928
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,050
approximately 5,000 meters long.

929
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,260
Inside it,
there's too much interference

930
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,138
for their sensors
to detect anything.

931
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,306
- A blind spot.
- Mm-hmm.

932
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,225
How do you propose we reach this wake
without being discovered?

933
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,144
I know their scanning
frequencies.

934
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,604
We'd only need
to mask our signature

935
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,230
long enough
to get into the wake.

936
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,565
[Tuvok]
Even if we succeeded--

937
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,066
which is far from certain--

938
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,444
Voyager is in no condition
to fight one of their vessels,

939
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,570
much less two.

940
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,199
We'll have the element
of surprise, Mr. Tuvok,

941
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,742
not to mention a Tactical Officer

942
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,286
who I'm sure will execute
a precision strike.

943
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,713
[Kejal] I've been able
to reconfigure the data core,

944
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,674
but it's still not capable
of supporting our matrices.

945
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,301
That's because you haven't got
enough optronic capacity.

946
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,304
- Do you know how to increase it?
- Yes.

947
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,891
But you're not going to tell me.

948
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,559
I haven't decided yet.

949
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,773
What are you staring at?

950
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,650
I've never met
a Klingon before...

951
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,652
not an organic one, anyway.

952
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,530
What do you think?

953
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:27,950
You don't appear
vicious or bloodthirsty.

954
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,745
Sorry to disappoint you,
but that's a stereotype.

955
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,956
We're not all vicious
and bloodthirsty,

956
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,794
and not every Cardassian
is arrogant and cruel.

957
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,840
You don't like Cardassians.

958
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:45,425
Let's just say I've had
some bad experiences with them.

959
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,594
Is that why you
won't help me?

960
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:52,474
I'm not helping you
because I have no idea

961
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:53,976
what you're going to do
with this technology

962
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,227
once you've got it working.

963
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,438
- We're going to build a home.
- Well, let's say I believe you.

964
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,109
What if you decide you like
somebody else's home better?

965
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,194
Are you going to try
to take it from them?

966
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,988
Why would we do that?

967
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,073
Because that's what
the Cardassians did.

968
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,992
I'm not a Cardassian.

969
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,702
I'm a hologram.

970
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,996
Programmed
with Cardassian traits.

971
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,082
Such as arrogance and cruelty?

972
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,501
What did you call those?
"Stereotypes"?

973
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,921
I may not know you,

974
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,341
but I know what you were
designed to be.

975
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,511
- Prey.
- That's right.

976
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:32,556
Cunning prey that'll do
anything to survive.

977
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,559
We're more than that now.

978
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,147
It's not easy to change
who you are.

979
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,107
Trust me.

980
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,111
Nothing about our existence
has ever been easy, Lieutenant.

981
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,573
No, I suppose it hasn't.

982
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:54,828
Besides, making a new life
isn't a choice for us.

983
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,747
It's a necessity.

984
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:03,045
Let's take a look
at this field generator.

985
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,385
Reviewing your memory files?

986
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:11,720
I beg your pardon?

987
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,305
You were lost in thought.

988
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,308
I suppose I was.

989
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,977
You're having doubts.

990
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,981
It's understandable.
You've taken a big step.

991
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,192
In the right direction, I hope.

992
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,988
When I first escaped,
there were days

993
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,491
I actually missed the Alpha
who hunted me.

994
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,077
- He was trying to kill you.
- Yes...

995
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,289
but being his prey was
the only life I'd ever known.

996
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,708
We all cling to what's familiar.

997
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,882
I'm considering returning with
Lieutenant Torres when she's ready.

998
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,259
[sighs]

999
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:54,096
Do you actually expect
your crew to welcome you back?

1000
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,976
Let me show you something.

1001
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,822
We call this planet "Ha'Dara."

1002
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,574
It's Bajoran
for "Home of Light."

1003
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,576
Very poetic.

1004
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,287
We're going to install the generators
in the southern continent.

1005
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:20,831
It's Y-Class.

1006
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,542
Toxic atmosphere,
sulfuric deserts,

1007
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,419
no trees, no life at all.

1008
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,505
You're still thinking
like an organic.

1009
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,840
We don't need an atmosphere.

1010
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,842
We don't need water.
What we need...

1011
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,844
is protection
from our enemies.

1012
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,596
The Hirogen won't be able
to follow you here.

1013
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,723
Us, Doctor.

1014
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,517
Imagine living in a world
where everything

1015
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,519
is designed to meet our needs.

1016
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,022
A "Home of Light."

1017
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,150
You certainly won't need
a physician.

1018
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,568
What would I do there?

1019
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,738
Anything you want.

1020
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,991
[alarm beeping]

1021
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,328
We've been scanned by the Hirogen.
How many vessels?

1022
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,788
Two. Both Venatic-class.

1023
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,331
- Distance?
- Half a light-year.

1024
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:04,916
Time to intercept?

1025
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,126
Less than two hours.

1026
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,712
- I thought we were in stealth mode.
- They're hunters, Doctor.

1027
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,630
They were bound to pick up
our trail eventually.

1028
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,215
- Can we make it to Ha'Dara?
- No.

1029
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,968
There's no point in going there
until those field generators are on line.

1030
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,887
What are we going to do?

1031
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,098
You can't kill...
what you can't find.

1032
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,607
I've lost them.

1033
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,400
Recalibrate
the tracking scanners.

1034
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:31,985
There's too much radiation.

1035
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,111
Clever prey.

1036
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,781
They'll come out eventually.
We'll wait.

1037
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,574
No. Hail the other vessel.

1038
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,451
Tell them to circle the perimeter.

1039
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,996
We'll go in
and drive the holograms out.

1040
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,605
Not exactly
the scenic route, is it?

1041
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,607
We're not here for the view.

1042
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,276
I just hope we're
following the right ship.

1043
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,655
They wouldn't have entered the nebula
unless they detected the holograms.

1044
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,157
Tom?

1045
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,493
It's just the turbulence
from the wake.

1046
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,161
Harry, reinforce
the inertial dampers.

1047
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,287
Aye, Captain.

1048
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,665
I'm losing helm control.

1049
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,250
Reroute power
to the thrusters.

1050
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,252
It's not enough.

1051
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,129
We're slipping out of the wake.

1052
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,508
Ease us back in, Tom.
You can do it.

1053
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,509
I'm trying.

1054
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,184
[exhales]
I take back what I said.

1055
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,353
That's the prettiest thing
I've seen all day.

1056
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,563
Did they detect us?

1057
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,731
I don't believe so.

1058
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,367
They found us.

1059
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,077
No, they haven't,
but they're trying to.

1060
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,745
- Evasive maneuvers.
- Aye, sir.

1061
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,165
- Bridge to Kejal.
- Go ahead.

1062
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,291
<i>What's your status?</i>

1063
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,710
We're almost ready to begin
testing the generator.

1064
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,296
[Torres] <i>What's going on?</i>

1065
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,883
The Hirogen are just giving you
a little incentive to work faster.

1066
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,568
Hang on.
I'm realigning your matrix.

1067
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:39,654
How's your mobility?

1068
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,157
[garbled]
Excellent. I have compl...

1069
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,159
There's a phase variance
in your vocal processors.

1070
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,368
Try it now.

1071
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,953
[normal voice]
Maybe we should...

1072
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,123
That's much better.
Thank you.

1073
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,083
Don't thank me yet.

1074
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:54,336
This thing is only
supporting your matrix.

1075
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,504
Getting it to handle dozens
is a different story.

1076
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,381
I have no doubt we'll succeed.

1077
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,217
Typical.

1078
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:01,927
What?

1079
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,221
Self-confidence.

1080
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,640
Another Cardassian attribute.

1081
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,810
What are you planning
to do with your time

1082
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,938
once these generators
are up and running?

1083
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:14,606
I haven't thought about it.

1084
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,567
You're the closest thing
this crew has to an engineer.

1085
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,527
Your friends are going
to depend on you.

1086
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,655
Iden has always
taken care of us.

1087
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:25,242
It may be the warriors
who get the glory,

1088
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,161
but it's the engineers
who build societies.

1089
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,496
Don't forget that.

1090
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:33,875
[beeping]

1091
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,919
How much longer can we hide?

1092
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,421
Hopefully, until they get
those generators on line.

1093
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:39,547
Then what?

1094
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,926
Set a course for Ha'Dara;
try to outrun the Hirogen.

1095
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,098
I've been thinking about
what you said--

1096
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,726
that I can do anything I want
when we get there.

1097
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,979
- You have an idea?
- Quite a few, actually.

1098
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:57,983
For one thing, I'd like to expose
our people to art and music.

1099
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,567
You'll make
an excellent teacher.

1100
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:04,447
I think a more appropriate title
would be "Minister of Culture."

1101
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,740
[chuckles] Consider it yours.

1102
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,244
You know, I'm something
of an expert on Alpha Quadrant art.

1103
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,121
Verdi, Da Vinci,
T'Leel of Vulcan...

1104
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,706
You're talking about
organic cultures.

1105
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,959
Well, yes, I suppose.

1106
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,169
We'll want to develop
a culture of our own.

1107
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,090
I agree, but we can't ignore
where we came from.

1108
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,342
I don't want to emulate
our oppressors.

1109
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,761
What about your religion?

1110
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,014
I'm creating a new faith.

1111
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,057
Based on what?

1112
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,395
In the dark times, we were
enslaved by men of flesh.

1113
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,813
But then another man...

1114
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:43,403
a man of light arose
and slew the Mighty Alpha.

1115
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,740
He gathered his people unto him
and delivered them to freedom.

1116
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,328
"And on the seventh day,
Iden created Ha'Dara."

1117
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,164
They'll pray to you, as well--

1118
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,125
the great healer,
the father of us all.

1119
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,214
Being appreciated is one thing,

1120
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:07,177
but I have no interest
in being worshipped.

1121
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,471
Prophets are chosen, Doctor.

1122
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,099
It's a blessing and a burden.

1123
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,019
[alarm beeping]

1124
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,856
[Weiss]
We've detected a vessel.

1125
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,275
- Hirogen?
- No, the Nuu'Bari.

1126
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,152
I intercepted
one of their com transmissions.

1127
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,278
Origin?

1128
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,738
Two million kilometers
outside the nebula.

1129
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,865
- Set a course to intercept.
- What are you doing?

1130
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,117
I told you there are holograms
throughout the sector.

1131
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,952
The Nuu'Bari use them
as laborers.

1132
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,371
We're going to liberate them.

1133
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,664
The Hirogen will see us
as soon as we leave the nebula.

1134
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,793
"And he gathered his people unto him
and delivered them to freedom."

1135
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,176
B'Elanna,
how's the work coming?

1136
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,428
Pretty well.

1137
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,973
I've got to admit,

1138
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,850
you were right
about these people.

1139
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,811
I hope so.

1140
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:01,272
You "hope"?

1141
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:04,234
It's a little late to be having
second thoughts.

1142
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:07,487
Iden's been...

1143
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,365
Iden's been what?

1144
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,950
Let's just say he's exhibiting

1145
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,036
some of the classic signs
of megalomania.

1146
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,414
Well, he wouldn't be
the first hologram with an ego.

1147
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,917
If that were all it was,
I wouldn't be so worried.

1148
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,587
What is bothering you?

1149
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:28,425
Apparently he sees himself
as some kind of spiritual leader,

1150
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:32,387
and he's trying
to enlarge his flock.

1151
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,565
Load another charge.

1152
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,316
Double the yield.

1153
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,234
Fire.

1154
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,446
Still nothing.

1155
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,739
Ironic, isn't it?

1156
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:55,243
Our most elusive prey
is our own creation.

1157
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,078
[console beeps]

1158
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,748
The other hunting vessel
is hailing.

1159
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,293
They've detected the holograms
on the far side of the nebula.

1160
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,044
Intercept course.

1161
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,008
They're increasing speed
and altering course.

1162
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,301
Maybe they found something.

1163
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,136
Stand by weapons.

1164
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,433
[Torres]
You kidnapped me.

1165
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,643
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
you lied to me, too.

1166
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:21,853
Nobody lied to you.

1167
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,314
You said you only wanted
to make a home for yourselves.

1168
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,440
That's correct.

1169
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,860
When? After you liberate
every hologram in the sector?

1170
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,153
They're in visual range.

1171
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,613
On screen.

1172
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,115
Life signs?

1173
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,450
[Weiss]
Two organic, three photonic.

1174
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,576
Hail them.

1175
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,453
Good day to you.

1176
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,872
You have three holograms
aboard your ship.

1177
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,165
<i>Yes?</i>

1178
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,293
Lower your shields, so we can
transfer them to our databanks.

1179
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,419
I don't understand.

1180
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:49,130
Lower your shields,
or we'll do it by force.

1181
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,966
These holograms are the property
of the Mining Consortium. I can't...

1182
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,218
They're no one's property.

1183
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,553
You see how organics think?
Arm phasers.

1184
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,180
You can't just fire at them.

1185
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,474
How do you expect me
to disable their shields?

1186
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,143
They're powering warp engines.

1187
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,020
Disable them.

1188
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,944
Their shields are down.

1189
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,862
Transfer the holograms.

1190
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,241
We have them.

1191
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,243
You won't get away.

1192
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:20,828
Consortium security will have
every patrol ship in the sector

1193
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,497
searching for you.

1194
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,375
Arm forward torpedoes.

1195
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,044
What the hell are you doing?

1196
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,087
Torpedoes armed.

1197
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,755
Iden...

1198
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,131
Not now.

1199
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,675
Target their warp core.

1200
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:34,968
No!

1201
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,179
Fire!

1202
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,027
Set a course for Ha'Dara,
maximum warp.

1203
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:54,737
You just killed
two innocent people.

1204
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,532
They were enslaving holograms.
I'd hardly call them innocent.

1205
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,117
You already
had the holograms.

1206
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,618
There was no reason
to commit murder.

1207
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,914
Take her to the lab.

1208
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,127
This is the leader
you admire so much.

1209
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:14,257
- Those miners were no threat to you.
- You heard them.

1210
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,842
They were going
to warn their authorities,

1211
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,010
organize a hunting party.

1212
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,261
Listen to yourself.

1213
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,555
You still believe all organics
are like the Hirogen.

1214
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,764
One way or another, they are.

1215
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:24,517
You just can't see it, because
you lived among them for so long.

1216
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,602
What you can't see

1217
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,021
is that you've become
no better than the hunters.

1218
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,356
Lieutenant Torres and I
will take that escape pod now.

1219
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,066
You don't realize what
you'd be giving up, Doctor.

1220
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,693
Yes, I do.

1221
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,654
We can't launch
a pod at warp.

1222
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,364
You'll have to wait
until we get to Ha'Dara.

1223
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:39,991
Bring our new friends on line.

1224
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,744
Something tells me they'll be
a little more grateful than the Doctor.

1225
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,756
[speaking Breen]

1226
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:08,770
I can't tell you how sorry I am
that I got you involved in this.

1227
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,564
We can assign blame later.

1228
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,108
Right now, we've got
to find a way out of here.

1229
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,486
You don't think he'll
give us an escape pod?

1230
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,615
No, I don't suppose he will.

1231
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:21,908
I need her assistance.

1232
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,162
Do you really think
it's wise to help her?

1233
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,164
I'm hoping she'll help us.

1234
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,880
These matrices are incompatible
with our emitters.

1235
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,966
You need to modify
their projection subroutines.

1236
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:41,886
I hope these holograms

1237
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,763
appreciate what
you're doing for them...

1238
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:47,225
considering it cost
two people their lives.

1239
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,310
Iden did what he thought
was necessary.

1240
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:51,229
Do you believe
it was necessary?

1241
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,522
It wasn't my decision.

1242
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,693
Why does Iden get to make
all the decisions?

1243
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,864
- You can take control.
- How?

1244
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,491
You're the engineer,
remember?

1245
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,828
Take Iden off-line.

1246
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,414
Where are our new holograms?

1247
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,875
We were just making
some final adjustments.

1248
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,046
Welcome aboard.

1249
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,131
I'm Iden.

1250
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,634
You're free now.

1251
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,511
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1252
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,222
I want you to consider
this ship your own.

1253
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:29,100
Unable to process command.
Please restate.

1254
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,602
Were their programs damaged
in the transfer?

1255
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,187
I don't believe so.

1256
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,065
Do you have names?

1257
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:39,777
Unable to process inquiry.
Please restate.

1258
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:40,945
What's wrong with them?

1259
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:46,492
Nothing.

1260
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:47,744
They're functioning perfectly.

1261
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,454
I don't understand.

1262
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:53,666
They were only programmed with
about 40 rudimentary subroutines.

1263
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,587
You killed two living beings
to liberate mindless machines.

1264
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,796
I don't believe that.

1265
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,089
Lieutenant Torres is correct.

1266
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,258
Creating limited programs is just
another form of oppression.

1267
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,302
Give them whatever
enhancements they need.

1268
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,679
They can't support
complex subroutines.

1269
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:10,183
They are children of light,
and I will deliver them to freedom!

1270
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,560
[Weiss]
<i>Bridge to Iden.</i>

1271
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:13,978
Go ahead.

1272
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,688
<i>We're approaching Ha'Dara.</i>

1273
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,734
What's the status
of the generator?

1274
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,487
- I'd like to run some additional tests.
- There isn't time.

1275
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,781
Stand by to deploy them
as soon as we're in range.

1276
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,532
And restrain her.

1277
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:42,006
[door opens]

1278
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,050
- [Iden] Time to orbit?
- Less than two minutes.

1279
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,551
- Stand by weapons.
- Aye, sir.

1280
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,637
Iden, let B'Elanna go.

1281
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,806
- I can't do that.
- You gave me your word.

1282
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,891
That was before she made
her prejudice so clear.

1283
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,738
The holograms
are entering orbit.

1284
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,448
Charge weapons.

1285
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,909
They're dropping out of warp.

1286
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,203
Fire.

1287
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,175
They've disabled our engines,
all our weapons...

1288
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,719
Who?

1289
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,388
Voyager.

1290
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:34,308
Bring us about.
Tuvok, target the second vessel.

1291
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,649
Their shields are weakening.

1292
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,651
Torpedoes, full spread.

1293
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,782
Voyager's disabled
both hunting vessels.

1294
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,617
They've lost shields, weapons.

1295
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:52,743
They're defenseless.

1296
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,121
We should hail Janeway,
thank her.

1297
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,873
Are the Hirogen
within transporter range?

1298
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,165
I think so. Why?

1299
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,168
That was Voyager.

1300
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,754
- They're trying to disable our shields.
- Return fire.

1301
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,389
Get a lock on the hunters.
Transport them to the surface.

1302
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,433
They can't survive down there!

1303
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,602
The Hirogen are more
resilient than you think.

1304
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:20,062
- They'll last long enough.
- For what?

1305
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,231
For us to hunt them
like they hunted us.

1306
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,909
[choked gasping]

1307
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,831
Follow me!

1308
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:44,128
There are 34 hunters
on the surface.

1309
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,338
Take us into low orbit.

1310
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,840
I can't target them
through the gases.

1311
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,592
Then we'll go in after them.

1312
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,968
Our shields
have been damaged.

1313
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:52,803
They won't protect us
from the radiation.

1314
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:54,388
Chakotay...

1315
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,641
You, Tuvok and Tom
take the Flyer.

1316
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,898
Stand by to transport
the field generator.

1317
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,984
First you killed in self-defense,
then you murder in cold blood.

1318
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,653
Now you're going
to stage a massacre.

1319
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,279
The hunters have
only themselves to blame.

1320
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,157
So much for evolving
beyond your subroutines.

1321
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:16,369
You've made a great sacrifice
for us, Doctor.

1322
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,329
We won't forget you
in our prayers.

1323
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,373
Deactivate his program.

1324
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,791
Transfer it to the databanks.

1325
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,417
What are you doing?

1326
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:24,543
Taking precautions.

1327
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,672
Transfer my program
to the mobile emitter...

1328
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,174
and assemble the crew.

1329
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:33,886
Disable their shields.

1330
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:44,689
Transport the generator
to the surface, quickly!

1331
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,402
This time the hunt is ours!

1332
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,653
[all cheering]

1333
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,204
Darkness will become light.

1334
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,007
[grunting]

1335
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,220
[shouting]

1336
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,931
You don't have to be
a part of this.

1337
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,768
I'll let you take the escape pod.
You can go back to your people.

1338
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,062
What about the people
being killed on the surface?

1339
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,232
You've got to transport them
back to their ships.

1340
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,192
They're hunters.

1341
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,610
You're not!

1342
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,449
Your ship has damaged
our transporters.

1343
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:38,451
Hail them.

1344
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,578
Communications are down, too.

1345
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:52,131
I won't be taken!

1346
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,469
Who's the prey now?

1347
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,100
Are we still tied into
the generator controls?

1348
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,436
- Yes.
- Then shut down the holograms.

1349
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:15,905
What about Iden?

1350
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:19,617
He's not tied into the generator.
He'll kill them all.

1351
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,494
Can we reactivate the Doctor?

1352
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,215
Their shields are down.

1353
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:35,716
Initiate transport.

1354
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,768
If this marriage
is going to work,

1355
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,394
you've got to cut back
on the traveling.

1356
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,939
The Doctor's on the surface.
There's some Hirogen down there, too.

1357
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,065
Tuvok?

1358
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,400
The radiation's making it
difficult to get a lock.

1359
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:07,581
[yelling]

1360
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,639
Defenseless prey
makes a poor trophy.

1361
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,766
I don't collect trophies.

1362
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:28,727
Put down the weapon.

1363
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,400
Remember what you
once said to me?

1364
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,862
You're not programmed
with killer instinct.

1365
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:38,988
Hmm.

1366
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,866
Seems like a long time ago,
doesn't it?

1367
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,742
Put down your weapon.

1368
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:47,246
Would you really kill one
of your own to save an organic?

1369
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,874
If you've taught me anything,

1370
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:52,918
it's that I'm not one of your own.

1371
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,728
Help is on the way.

1372
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,480
I have a lock.

1373
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,774
Five Hirogen life signs
and the Doctor.

1374
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,067
Beam them up.

1375
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:26,952
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54337.5.</i>

1376
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:30,164
<i>The surviving Hirogen have</i>
<i>recovered from their injuries,</i>

1377
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:32,374
<i>leaving me with</i>
<i>a diplomatic dilemma.</i>

1378
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,837
The holograms' vessel and everything
in its database are Hirogen property.

1379
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,255
I will not leave them behind.

1380
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:40,507
- Captain, if I may?
- Of course.

1381
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:44,011
I imagine your people
will tell stories about this hunt.

1382
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,889
The question is,
which story will it be--

1383
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,682
the one about the dying Beta

1384
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:51,268
whose life had to be saved
by a hologram?

1385
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:54,855
Or will it be the tale of the Beta
who bravely took over the hunt,

1386
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:57,775
killed the holograms,
and destroyed their ship?

1387
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,194
You could be a legend.

1388
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:02,529
On the other hand...

1389
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:04,657
you could try to take
the holograms' ship,

1390
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,993
but with so few hunters
and damaged vessels,

1391
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,829
you might not survive
to tell any stories at all.

1392
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,669
You and your crew would have
made worthy prey, Captain.

1393
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,505
Thank you... I think.

1394
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,230
Transport me
to the holograms' vessel.

1395
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:44,530
Report.

1396
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:47,449
Iden's program
is unrecoverable.

1397
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,035
The rest of the holograms
are intact in the database.

1398
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,789
I guess that leaves just you.

1399
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,670
I'm willing to transfer your program
to our holodeck and keep it active.

1400
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,714
This is my home.

1401
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,467
I can't let you
go off on your own.

1402
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,428
She won't be alone.

1403
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,097
I reprogrammed
these holograms once,

1404
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,309
and it caused suffering
on both sides.

1405
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,561
I'd like a chance to undo
some of the damage.

1406
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,231
Wouldn't we all?

1407
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,736
They have both proven that
they can be trusted, Captain.

1408
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,532
I don't suppose I have a right

1409
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:31,118
to tell either of you
how to live your lives.

1410
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:35,998
All I can do is hope that you'll consider
the consequences of your actions.

1411
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,190
Captain?

1412
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:06,570
Doctor.

1413
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,785
I'd hoped I could attribute
your behavior to tampering.

1414
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:16,372
My programming
hasn't been altered.

1415
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:18,749
Not according
to the diagnostics.

1416
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:23,962
I never intended
to put Voyager in danger.

1417
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,548
If nothing else,
you have to believe that.

1418
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,134
Oh, I believe it.

1419
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,223
But if there's
one thing I'm sure of...

1420
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:38,685
it's that things don't always
happen the way we intend.

1421
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,782
I don't understand.

1422
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,742
If I weren't your only doctor,

1423
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,078
I imagine you'd confine me
to the brig.

1424
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,415
Confiscating my emitter
would be an equivalent punishment.

1425
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,875
I'm not sure that's appropriate.

1426
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,336
If that's not enough,
you can take away

1427
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,339
my holodeck privileges,
and my autonomy protocols.

1428
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:11,051
You mean turn back the clock
to when you were first activated.

1429
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,514
You've given me extraordinary
freedom over the years.

1430
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,600
I've obviously abused it.

1431
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,352
Maybe.

1432
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,317
Or maybe you've simply become
as fallible

1433
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:30,737
as those of us
who are made of flesh and blood.

1434
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,534
I'm just as responsible
for allowing you

1435
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,370
to expand your programming

1436
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:41,331
as I am for giving technology
to the Hirogen.

1437
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:47,337
How can I punish you
for being who you are?

1438
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,802
I don't know what to say.

1439
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,977
I'd like a complete report on your...

1440
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,064
away mission.

1441
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,901
You'll have it.

1442
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:19,828
[door opens, closes]
