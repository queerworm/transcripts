<i>Final round to Janeway.</i>

<i>Winner, Janeway.</i>

4
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,274
Good game.

5
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,484
For you.

6
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,735
Oh, come on,
Seven.

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,987
You won four out
of 10 rounds.

8
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,321
Nothing to be
ashamed of.

9
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,656
On the contrary.

10
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,367
I have superior
visual acuity and stamina.

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,869
I should've won
every round.

12
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,745
Well, Velocity is more than
a test of stamina.

13
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,163
It's a game of wits.

14
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,291
You are a
frustrating opponent.

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,085
During the final round after
you dropped your phaser,

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,462
you did not even look
at the disk.

17
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,130
And yet you were able
to acquire the target.

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,340
Intuition.

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,843
Intuition is
a human fallacy,

20
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,720
the belief that you can
predict random events.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,304
Oh, belief had nothing
to do with it.

22
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,390
At some level,
conscious or otherwise,

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,058
I was aware of
several factors.

24
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,436
The trajectory of the disk
after I hit the wall,

25
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,855
the sound it made
on its return,

26
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,481
and the shadow it cast
on the hologrid.

27
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,234
Intriguing,
but implausible.

28
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,527
I won, didn't I?

29
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,820
Thanks for the match.

30
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,322
I wish to play again.
Not today.

31
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,741
You are fatigued
and concerned

32
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,576
that I will
defeat you.

33
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,453
Tired, yes.
Concerned, no.

34
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,080
Computer,
begin first round.

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,832
Belay that command.

36
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,044
Seven,
try to be a sport.

37
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,587

Oh! Well, then,
good morning.

54
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,907
I just heard
from Tom and Neelix.

55
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,658
They're about to leave
the trading colony.

56
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,368
Any luck?

57
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,787
According to Tom, the shuttle's
so loaded down with supplies

58
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,288
he won't make
half impulse.

59
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,582
Neelix is
asking permission

60
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,333
to bring one of
the locals on board.

61
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,920
He's been very helpful,
and Neelix wants to repay him

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,963
by giving him passage
to the next system.

63
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,423
Permission granted.

64
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,926
You might want
to grab some sleep.

65
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,219
We've got
a big day ahead.

66
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,720
I will in a while.

Still hunting
for buried treasure.

68
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,473
We've found the treasure.

I just can't pick the lock.

70
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,436
I've tried over
50 decryption algorithms.

71
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,146
Every time I piece together
a data block,

72
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,355
10 more come unraveled.

73
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,607
What did Starfleet
send us?

74
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,609
A map?
The location of a wormhole?

75
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,819
If I could decode this today,
Chakotay,

76
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,362
we could be home tomorrow.

77
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,157
Then again, it could be
Admiral Chapman's recipe

78
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,700
for the perfect pound cake.

79
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,369
I've been pinning
our hopes on this message,

80
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,955
but I'm starting
to wonder.

81
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,540
One way or another,
we've got to find out.

82
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,876
I'll talk to
B'Elanna.

83
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,087
You could enlist
Seven of Nine.

84
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,755
Hm...

85
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,508
She should have a few Borg
algorithms up her sleeve...

86
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,261
If she's in the mood.

87
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,845
Problems?

88
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,516
I don't know if she's restless
or if it's just me,

89
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,103
but we're butting heads
more than usual lately.

90
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,854
She seems to challenge
everything I say.

91

( sighing )

92
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,900
She's learned a lot from you
over the last year.

93
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,403
Maybe the pupil thinks
she's outgrowing the mentor.

94
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,657
Maybe.

95
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,911
Well, this mentor would like
another cup of coffee.

96
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,246
Will you join me?

97
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,039
Love to.

105

Captain,
this man is a genius.

106
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:55,272
I was trying to negotiate
with a xenon-based life-form

107
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,524
when the universal translator
went off-line.

108
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,775
Arturis here stepped in

109
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,028
and acted as
a perfect go-between,

110
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,779
and he'd never heard
either of our languages.

111
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,072
Oh,
they were simple.

112
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,074
Oh!
No insult intended.

On my way.

114
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,910

will excuse me.

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,288
Well,
welcome to<i> Voyager.</i>

Oh, my people have
a way with languages.

with basic Klingon.

all I needed.

It's all the same
to me.

do us another favor.

You weren't exaggerating,
Captain.

00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,977
This datastream
is badly damaged.

146
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,772

Yes.

150
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,613
You're much more
attractive

151
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,073
than
the average drone.

Is that what
you call us?

Yes. The Borg has never

162
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,136
been able to
assimilate them.

00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,305
Not yet.

164
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,889
Oh, it's all right,
Captain.

165
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,808
The Borg collective
is like a force of nature.

166
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,352
You don't feel anger
toward a storm on the horizon.

167
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,271
You just avoid it.

Ah.

169
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,024
Here it is.
It's a simple matter

170
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,110
of extracting
the iconometric elements

171
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,404
and triaxilating
a recursion matrix.

172
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,989
Now, why didn't I
think of that?

173
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,158
There's a great deal of
information here, Captain.

174
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,119
I think it might be useful
to utilize the other monitors.

00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,971
but a lot of it
is still garbled.

180
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,765
JANEWAY:
What about that data block,
14-beta?

181
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,935
That part of the message
is too degraded

182
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,729
to recover.

183
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,648
Captain, I've found
a spatial grid.

184
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,035
JANEWAY:
They've marked a set
of coordinates.

185
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,953
It's less than 10
light years from here.

186
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,373
Maybe Starfleet wants us
to proceed to that location.

187
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,125
Maybe. There's only
one way to find out.

188
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,886
We're approaching
the coordinates.

189
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,389
Take us out of warp.
Scan the vicinity.

190
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,099

193
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,316
Unless I am mistaken,
Captain,

194
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,608
the warp signature

195
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,528
is Starfleet.

(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

197
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,874
I'll be damned.
They came through.

No response.

Life signs?

202
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,759
There is no organic matter
of any kind.

203
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,844
No sign of damage
to the outer hull.

204

KIM:
Primary systems

205
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,473
including life support.

206
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,725
Something must have
happened to the crew.

207
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,644
The answer is somewhere
in that Starfleet transmission.

208
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,313
We need to finish
decoding it.

209
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,107
May I call on
your talents again?

210
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,358
Of course.

211
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,235
Take an away team.
Secure the vessel.

212
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,695
Tom, Tuvok.

00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,120
Captain, I won't pretend
to know you well,

you're not more...

this discovery.

217
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,420
I've learned to walk the line
between hope and caution.

218
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,672
We've had other opportunities
that didn't work out.

219
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,174
But I will admit,

220
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,303
I'm leaning toward
hope this time.

I think we've found
our engine core.

248
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,611
Some kind of
new warp drive?

249
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,321
It's not antimatter.
It's...

250

Energy from the quantum drive

is being routed through
the main deflector.

She has a point.

335
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,204
This would mean leaving
<i>Voyager</i> behind.

336

Is there any way we could modify
<i>Voyager</i> to create

338
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,335
In theory,
but I don't think the ship

339
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,797
would hold up very long
under the quantum stresses.

Try to make
the modifications.

00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,113
Dismissed.

354
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,741
( door opens )

355
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,326
Tuvok...

356
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,662
Big day.
( door closes )

357
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,079
Indeed.
A way home.

358
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,081
We've been waiting for
this moment for years.

359
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,584
Why don't I feel
more enthusiastic?

360
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,836
Perhaps my
mental discipline

361
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,838
is rubbing off
on you.

362
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,380
Perhaps.

363
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,216
What do you think about
this little miracle of ours?

364
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,761
I share your concern
about the crew's safety.

365
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,554
We must take
every precaution.

366
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,974
Somehow, I don't think
standard diagnostics

367
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,266
and security
protocols

368
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,477
are gonna make me
feel any better.

369
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,354
Captain?

370
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,318
All of this is just
a little too perfect.

371
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,611
The alien genius

372
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,488
with the answers
to all of our problems.

373
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,156
The message
from Starfleet

374
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,200
telling us everything
we wanna hear...

375
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,285
A starship delivered
to our doorstep.

376
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,996
What more could
we ask for?

377
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,998
They even turned down
the beds.

378
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,959
The only thing missing was
chocolates on the pillows.

379
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,795
It does
seem convenient.

380
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,380
( sighing )

381
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,341
I can't put
my finger on it,

382
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,510
but from the moment
this all started,

383
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,428
I sensed something
was wrong.

384
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,974
It started when Arturis
boarded<i> Voyager.</i>

385
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,643
Exactly.

386
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,649
We'll proceed as planned,
but I want you to investigate

387
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,611
that ship from stem to stern,
and keep an eye on our guest.

388
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,446
See if you can find out
more about him.

389
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,614
Understood.

390
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,991
Let's hope we're
just suffering

391
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,701
from some good
old-fashioned paranoia.

392
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,202
Keep me posted.

Quantum field strength
down to 90 percent.

80 percent.

424
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,414
It's leveling
off at 75.

425
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,001
We need to dampen the field
by at least 50 percent.

426
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,461
Try reversing the quantum field
polarities.

We did it.

We've got
our safety net.

434
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,355
One step closer
to home.

435
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,899
Tuvok wants us to run
a metallurgical analysis

436
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,401
of the bulkheads to look
for anything unusual.

437
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,569
Thank you.

438
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,946
You two run
the analysis.

439
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,781
I'll be on the Bridge
with Arturis.

440
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,450
Our resident genius said
he'd help me figure out

441
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,954
how to use the control
sequencers.

442
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,331
Lieutenant, you seem eager
to return to Earth.

443
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,376
Eager?

444
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,252
I wouldn't go
that far.

445
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,006
( beeping )

446
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,966
You were a member
of the Maquis.

447
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,509
Starfleet Command
will no doubt

448
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,220
hold you responsible
for a multitude of crimes.

449
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,764
You will find nothing on Earth
but adversity.

450
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,517
Well, that's looking
on the bright side.

451
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,227
Let's put it this way,

452
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,354
I'd rather face
the music at home

453
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,524
than spend the rest of my life
in the Delta Quadrant.

454
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,112
What about you?

455
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,364
Looking forward
to seeing Earth?

456
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,699
No.

457
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,410
I'm not surprised.

458
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,329
You think people are gonna
resent an ex-Maquis?

459
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,040
What about
an ex-drone?

460
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,543
We'll be
outcasts together.

461
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,628
I'm kidding,
Seven.

462
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,130
It's a joke.

463
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,134
Work on that
sense of humor.

464
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,636
It'll help you
make friends on Earth.

this section.

472

Believe me,
Seven,

473
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,164
one look at that big,
blue marble,

474
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,874
and you'll
fall in love.

475
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,877
It's got just about every
ecosystem you can think of,

476
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,089
and hundreds of different
humanoid species live there.

477

Vulcans, Bolians,
Ktarians...

478
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,928
If you like
Ktarians.

479
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,306
And there are several other
planets to choose from.

480
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,267
If you will
excuse me, Ensign,

481
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,393
I must speak
to the Captain.

482
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,271
Seven.

483
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,816
For what it's worth,

484
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,860
it won't be the same
without you.

I'm on the<i> Dauntless</i> 
in the Engine Room,

00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,612
and I found something

495
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,239
that qualifies
as unusual.

496
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,158
I'll be
right there.

500
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,180
Seven,
I could use your help.

501
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,894
I'm trying to reconstruct
the last fragment

502
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,729
of the
Starfleet message.

503
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,605
Arturis said it was
irreparably damaged.

504
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,235
I know, but I think
he gave up too easily.

505
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,443
Intuition.

506
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,779
It's intuition
if I'm right.

507
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,740
I've designed a new
decryption algorithm.

508
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,201
Let's give it
a try.

509
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,994
Captain...

510
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:36,040
I will not be going with you
to the Alpha Quadrant.

511
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,840
I can understand
your reluctance.

512
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,384
It's been
hard enough

513
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,220
dealing with a crew
of 150 individual humans.

514
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,930
The prospect of
an entire planet

515
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,223
must be
overwhelming.

516
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,557
I am not
overwhelmed.

517
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,642
I simply do not wish
to live among humans.

518
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,729
Well, whether you like it
or not, you're one of us.

519
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,190
You've come a long way
from that drone

520
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,235
who stepped out of a Borg
alcove nine months ago.

521
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,320
Don't turn your back
on humanity now,

522
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,573
not when you're about to
take your biggest step...

523
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,575
Earth.

524
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,035
Your home.

525
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,955
I may have come
a long way,

526
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,417
but not in the
direction you think.

527
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,796
You've attempted to
influence my development.

528
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,424
You exposed me to your culture,
your ideals.

529
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:29,927
You hoped to shape me
in your own image,

530
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,012
but you have failed.

531
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,391
You may have noticed
our tendency to disagree.

532
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,893
Oh, I've noticed.

533
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,729
Then you must also recognize
that I do not share your values.

534
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,274
Your desire to explore space
is inefficient.

535
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,859
Your need for familial
connections is a weakness.

536
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,737
Your infatuation with this
planet is irrational.

537
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,489
I won't argue
that you've turned out

538
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,534
differently
than I expected,

539
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,204
and that we often have
conflicting points of view.

540
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:02,835
But right now,
the stakes are higher.

541
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,545
This crew needs
your expertise.

542
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,840
Abandon them,
and you diminish their chances

543
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,467
of getting home.
Irrelevant.

544
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,717
No, it's not.

545
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,719
We've given you a lot,
Seven.

546
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,014
It's time you gave
something in return.

547
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,309
I have...
on many occasions.

548
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,644
Now I refuse.

549
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,279
What would you do,
go back to the Collective?

550
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,365
I don't know.

551
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,283
Then what exactly
do you have in mind?

552
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,035
I don't know.

553
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,496
That's my point. You're asking
me to cast you adrift

554
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,538
in the Delta Quadrant,
alone and without support.

555
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,916
I wouldn't grant that request
to any member of this crew,

556
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,918
because
it's too dangerous.

557
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,170
I will survive.

558
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,880
On what,
Borg perfection?

559
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,466
Precisely.

560
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,177
I don't buy it.

561
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,054
This isn't about
your independence,

562
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,722
your superiority.

563
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,352
This is about your fear.

564
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,312
You're not making
this choice

565
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,481
because you've
outgrown humanity.

566
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,607
( whispering ):
I think you're afraid

567
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,817
to go back to Earth.

568
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,529
( console beeping )

569
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,782
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

570
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,453
( in normal voice ):
The algorithm's working.

571
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,663
It's reconstructing
the data block.

572
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,214
(<i> distorted speech</i> )
That's strange.

573
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,799
I thought we already recovered
this part of the message.

574
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,761
Perhaps it is an addendum
from the Admiral.

575
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,931
You did designate him
a windbag.

576
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,058
Oh, I don't think so.

577
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,601
The data index doesn't match.

578
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,523
This is a completely
different message.

579
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,738
<i>Apologies from everyone</i>
<i>at Starfleet Command.</i>

580
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,575
<i>We've had our best people</i>
<i>working around the clock</i>

581
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,410
<i>trying to find</i>
<i>a wormhole,</i>

582
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,205
<i>a new means of propulsion,</i>
<i>anything to get you back home.</i>

583
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,873
<i>But despite</i>
<i>our best efforts...</i>

584
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,127
<i>I know it's not</i>
<i>what you were hoping.</i>

585
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,878
<i>But we have sent you</i>
<i>all the data</i>

586
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,964
<i>we've collected</i>
<i>on the Delta Quadrant.</i>

587
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,134
<i>With any luck, you'll find at</i>
<i>least some part of it useful,</i>

588
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,304
<i>maybe enough to shave</i>
<i>a few years off your trip.</i>

589
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,682
<i>Safe journey.</i>

590
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,393
<i>We hope to see you soon.</i>

591
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,191
Your intuition
was correct.

592
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,319
Unfortunately.

593
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,405
Arturis must have created
a false message.

594
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,656
It sure as hell
looks that way.

595
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,284
( comlink beeps )
Janeway to Tuvok.

596
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,119
TUVOK:
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

597
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,581
My suspicions
have been confirmed.

598
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,836
Arturis tampered with
Starfleet's message.

599
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,506
JANEWAY:
<i>The</i> Dauntless<i> isn't</i>
<i>what it appears to be.</i>

600
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,007
I agree.
We've discovered

601
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,883
alien technology
behind a bulkhead

602
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,261
<i>in Engineering.</i> 
<i>I can't identify it.</i>

603
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,971
Where's Arturis now?

604
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,557
On the<i> Dauntless</i> Bridge,
working with Lieutenant Torres.

605
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,767
JANEWAY:
<i>Go to the Bridge,</i>
<i>but don't tip our hand.</i>

606
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,479
I'll be there with a full
security team within minutes.

607
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,147
Understood.

608
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,940
Let's get weapons.

609
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,921
Don't touch that!

610
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,550
You almost kicked us
into slipstream drive.

611
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,011
Oh.
I wouldn't want to do that.

612
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,596
( speaks in Klingon )

613
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,515
No problem.

614
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,643
You speak Klingon.

615
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,811
I do now.
Your Captain was kind enough

616
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,272
to let me review
your linguistic database.

617
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,900
I only speak
a few phrases myself.

618
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,152
Oh, a shame.
It's a robust language.

619
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,739
A little too robust
for me.

620
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,115
( whooshing )

621
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,245
Evacuate
the repair teams.

622
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,247
Captain?
JANEWAY: Do it.

623
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,499
Explain yourself.

624
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,710
I don't know what
you're talking about.

625
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,170
You fabricated the message
from Starfleet.

626
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,590
I recovered
the real transmission,

627
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,758
the one you said
was irreparably damaged.

628
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,218
That's absurd.

629
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,802
Starfleet didn't send us
this vessel.

630
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,846
And you're not here to help.
Is this your ship?

631
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,557
Please, I--
Stay calm.

632
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,392
There must be
an explanation.

633
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,603
I tried to ignore
my gut feelings,

634
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:31,811
because I got carried away

635
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,272
with the excitement
of getting home.

636
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,065
But you preyed on that,
didn't you?

637
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,776
You took advantage of our hopes,
and now I want to know why.

638
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,320
I...

639
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,741
believe that there is
a threat here, Captain.

640
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:46,243
But not from me.

641
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,121
I didn't feel it was my place
to make accusations,

642
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,706
but I saw<i> her</i>

643
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,417
reconfigure several
key algorithms

644
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,543
two days ago

645
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,211
in the
Astrometrics Lab.

646
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,046
And it seemed obvious.

647
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,799
She must have been tampering
with the Starfleet message.

648
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,134
You are lying.

649
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,469
She's been sabotaging

650
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,512
your every effort
to reach Earth.

651
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,347
You don't have to believe me,
Captain.

652
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:11,851
You can find the evidence you
need in her personal database.

653
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,812
Evidence you undoubtedly
put there yourself,

654
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,773
just in case you got caught.
Take him to<i> Voyager.</i>

655
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,857
Throw him
in the brig.

656
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,192
( grunts )

657
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,569

658
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,030

659
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,749

00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,716
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

661
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,471
Janeway to<i> Voyager.</i>
Beam us out of here.

662
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,140
He's trying to deflect
our transporters.

663
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,725
Stand by.

664
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,532
I've got everyone
but Seven and the Captain.

665
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,116
He's found a way to block
their transport.

666
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,494
The ship's going
into slipstream mode.

667
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,412
Pursuit course.

668
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,792
( rumbling )

669
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,253
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

670
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,552
We lost them,
Commander.

671
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:35,185
Tom, bring the warp core
modifications online.

672
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,436
We're going
after them.

673
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,438
Sir, we haven't even had
a trial run yet.

674
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,067
There's no time
like the present.

675
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,239
( sighs )

676
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,162
Where are you
taking us?

677
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,456
Home.

678
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,876
How'd you create
the Starfleet Bridge?

679
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,502
Holograms?

680
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,212
Particle synthesis.

681
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,172
Beyond your
understanding.

682
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,965
Is this what
your people do?

683
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,718
Prey on
innocent ships?

684
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,135
Innocent.

685
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,929
Typical of
Captain Janeway.

686
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,347
Self-righteous.

687
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,393
If I've offended you
or your people in some way,

688
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,728
please tell me.

689
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,646
Diplomacy, Captain?

690
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,106
Your diplomacy

691
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,149
destroyed my world!

692
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,193
JANEWAY:
What? What are you saying?

693
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,696
You negotiated
an agreement

694
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,532
with the
Borg Collective.

695
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,869
Safe passage
through their space,

696
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,328
and in return,

697
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,664
you helped them defeat
one of their enemies.

698
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,165
Species 8472.

699
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,084
In your colorful
language, yes,

700
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,669
Species 8472.

701
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,671
Did it ever occur to you
that there were those of us

702
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,173
in the Delta Quadrant with
a vested interest in that war?

703
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,760
Victory would have meant
annihilation of the Borg,

704
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,262
but you couldn't see beyond
the bow of your own ship!

705
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,847
In my estimation,

706
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,392
Species 8472 posed
a greater threat than the Borg.

707
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,060
Who were you
to make that decision?

708
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,229
A stranger
to this Quadrant?

709
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,148
There wasn't exactly time
to take a poll.

710
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,817
I had to act quickly.

711
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:09,028
My people managed to elude
the Borg for centuries...

712
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:13,283
Outwitting them,
always one step ahead.

713
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:17,412
But in recent years, the Borg
began to weaken our defenses.

714
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,790
They were closing in,
and Species 8472

715
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,501
was our last hope
to defeat them.

716
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,419
You took that
away from us!

717
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,548
The outer colonies
were the first to fall.

718
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,134
Twenty-three
in a matter of hours.

719
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,386
Our sentry vessels
tossed aside.

720
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,221
No defense
against the storm.

721
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,141
And by the time they had
surrounded our star system,

722
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,977
hundreds of cubes...

723
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,522
We had already surrendered
to our own terror.

724
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,569
A few of us managed
to survive...ten, 20,000.

725
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,696
I was fortunate.

726
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,739
I escaped
with a vessel,

727
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,660
alone...
but alive.

728
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,077
I don't
blame them.

729
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,914
They were just drones,

730
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:04,167
acting with
their collective instinct.

731
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,418
You!

732
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,087
<i>You</i> had a choice!

733
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,091
I am sorry for what happened
to your people,

734
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,886
but try to understand.

735
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,261
I couldn't have known.

736
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,806
It took me months
to find you.

737
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,642
I watched and waited
for my opportunity

738
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,895
to make you pay
for what you'd done.

739
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,437
Then,
the Starfleet message.

740
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,858
And I knew that your
selfish desire to get home

741
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,401
would surface again,

742
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,237
that I could lure you
to this vessel.

743
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,114
That I could see to it that
you'd all be assimilated

744
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,702
and spend the rest
of eternity as Borg!

745
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,621
I was hoping...

746
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,916
to get your entire crew,

747
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,167
but I'll settle for
the two of you.

748
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,336
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

749
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,965
( console beeping )

750
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,175
In a matter of hours,
this ship

751
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,345
will return
to my homeworld...

752
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,100
...inside Borg space.

753
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,978
When that happens, you will
be assimilated as well.

754
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,439
That's irrelevant.

755
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,818
This is what you wanted
all along, isn't it?

756
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,654
To go back
to your Collective?

757
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,450
You should thank me.

758
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,539
(<i> ominous theme swells</i> )

759
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,800
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

760
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,595
Report.

761
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,639
( sighs ):
We're at full impulse,

762
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,100
but we're not breaking through
the quantum barrier.

763
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,226
I'm having trouble controlling
the field parameters.

764
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,812
I need more power to
the deflector.

765
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,106
Bridge to Torres.
B'ELANNA:<i> I'm already on it,</i>

766
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,732
Commander.
Stand by.

767
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,651
Reroute auxiliary power
to deflector control.

768
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,694
Make sure that quantum
warp field is stable.

769
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,404
MAN:
Aye, Lieutenant.

770
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,074
( rumbling )

771
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,366
Deflector at maximum.

772
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,327
I'm focusing
the quantum field.

773
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,495
Make it quick.

774
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,080
Hull temperature's
at critical.

775
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,586
We're at
slipstream velocity.

776
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,797
KIM:
Structural integrity
is down by 9 percent.

777
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,256
We've got less
than an hour

778
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,591
before the hull
starts to buckle.

779
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,677
I've located
their slipstream.

780
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,304
I'm aligning ours
to match.

781
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,973
We're right
behind them.

782
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,265
How far behind?

783
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,767
Just a few minutes.

784
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,936
TUVOK:
Is there any way
to increase our speed?

785
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,187
None.

786
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,814
We're at maximum.

787
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,357
Maintain course.

788
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,275
If I know
the Captain,

789
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,653
she's already
got a plan.

790
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,906
Any ideas?

791
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,074
Not presently.

792
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,575
We better
think of something.

793
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,452
We come face-to-face
with your former family

794
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,745
in less than an hour,

795
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,288
and that's one reunion
I'd like to miss.

796
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,957
Unless, of course,
you're looking forward

797
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,333
to rejoining
the Collective.

798
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,337
I do not
believe I am.

799
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,048
Not the
ringing opposition

800
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,424
I was hoping for,
but I'll take it.

801
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,927
A drone could walk
through this force field

802
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,679
like it was thin air.

803
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,639
Is there enough
Borg technology

804
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,933
left in your body
to let it adapt?

805
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,227
If I activate the
appropriate nanoprobes,

806
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,730
I could alter
my bioelectric field.

807
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,733
However, I would need to
adjust my cranial implant.

808
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,485
Would a microfilament
do the trick?

809
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,945
It might.

810
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,781
Then let's
get you one.

811
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,409
Once you get outside,
access that control panel

812
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,036
and disable
the force field.

813
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,246
Then we'll try to
reach the engine room.

814
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,249
And employ the emergency
shutdown procedure.

815
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,089
Sufficient.

816
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,715
You will need

817
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:42,135
to cross-link the third
and sixth nodules.

818
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,686
Déjà vu.

819
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,563
Captain?

820
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,773
If I recall,

821
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,692
this is where
our relationship began,

822
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,694
in a brig
nine months ago.

823
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,738
I severed you
from the Collective,

824
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,116
and you weren't exactly
happy about it.

825
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,702
No, I was not.

826
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,164
In case I never get
a chance to say this...

827
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,209
I realize that I've been
hard on you at times,

828
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,461
but it was never
out of anger

829
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,297
or regret that
I brought you on board.

830
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,715
I'm your Captain.

831
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,260
That means I can't
always be a friend.

832
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,594
Understand?

833
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,888
No.

834
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,057
However,
if we are assimilated,

835
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,558
our thoughts
will become one,

836
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,644
and I'm sure I will
understand perfectly.

837
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,773
A joke, Captain.

838
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:40,443
You yourself have encouraged me
to use my sense of humor.

839
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,280
Well,
it's nice to know

840
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,199
you've taken some
of my advice to heart.

841
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,914
You were correct,
Captain.

842
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,332
Hm?

843
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,835
My desire to remain
in the Delta Quadrant

844
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,420
was based on fear.

845
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,339
I am no longer
Borg,

846
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,050
but the prospect of
becoming human is...

847
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,970
unsettling.

848
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,806
I don't know
where I belong.

849
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,391
You belong with us.

850
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,853
( electronic crackling )

851
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,939
The adaptations
are complete.

852
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,448
( console beeping )

853
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,708
( force field whooshing )

854
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,418
We're in business.

855
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,839
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

856
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,899
I can't initiate
the emergency shutdown.

857
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,859
Our commands are being
blocked from the Bridge.

858
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,110
He's detected us.

859
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,570
( rumbling )

860
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,407
The ship's velocity
has just increased.

861
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,825
At our
present speed,

862
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,536
we will enter Borg space
in less than 12 minutes.

863
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,830
Do we still have access
to the power distribution grid?

864
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,415
Yes.

865
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,542
If we can't throw on the brakes,
let's swerve the wheel.

866
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,003
Send a power surge
into the starboard thrusters.

867
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,504
The torsional stress
at these speeds

868
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,756
could tear the ship apart.

869
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,424
It's either that
or join the hive. Do it.

870
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,884
If we're still
in one piece,

871
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,468
try to gain control
of navigation.

872
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,803
I'll be on
the Bridge.

873
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,264
We have a game
of Velocity

874
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,890
scheduled for tomorrow,
Holodeck One.

875
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,850
I expect you
to keep the appointment.

876
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,894
Aye, Captain.

877
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,528
( grunting )

878
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,325
( panting )

879
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:08,091
(<i> dramatic theme swells</i> )

880
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,765
( sighing )

881
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,059
Sorry about
the bumpy ride.

882
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,478
You can slow this ship down,

883
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,980
but you can't stop it.

884
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,523
In four minutes,
Captain Janeway will be gone,

885
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,443
and a new drone
will be born.

886
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:27,693
Don't count on it.

887
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,570
( rumbling )

888
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,407
Seven of Nine has accessed
your navigational systems.

889
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,242
You taught us how
to use this ship

890
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,743
a little too well.

891
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,829
I can't begin to
imagine your loss,

892
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,498
but try to see beyond
your desire for revenge.

893
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,208
Revenge is all
I have left.

894
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,836
No, no. As long as you're alive,
there's hope.

895
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,504
Your people's
accomplishments

896
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,382
their knowledge, their dignity
can survive in you.

897
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,634
End this.

898
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,433

00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,982
I've just destroyed
the navigational controls.

901
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,318
No one can stop
this ship now,

902
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,111
not even me.

903
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,365
Two minutes
to Borg space.

00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,116

(<i> dramatic theme continues</i> )

906
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,248
Direct hit.

907
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,875
The vessel's
shields are down.

908
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,169
Transporter
standing by.

909
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,214
Get a lock
on our people.

910
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,589

911
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,468

912
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,726

913
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,395
<i>Voyager.</i>

914
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:46,105
Come with me.
It's not too late.

915
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,024
It is for you.

916
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,237
I've got them, Commander.
Transporter Room Two.

917
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,613
Alter our slipstream,
hard starboard.

918
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,200
Take us back
the way we came.

933
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,751
Nice play.
You almost had me.

934
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,002
Almost.

935
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,254
Go again?

936
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,880
I must report
to the Astrometrics Lab.

937
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,507
There is work to be done.
Work?

938
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,302
I gave the crew strict orders
to take some R&amp;R

939
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,929
over the next few days,
and that includes you.

940
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,680
There are
more pressing needs.

941
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,309
I am attempting to design
another method of traveling

942
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,852
at slipstream velocities
without damaging<i> Voyager.</i>

943
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,605
I thought
that was impossible.

944
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,690
Impossible is a word
that humans use far too often.

945
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,651
I wish to continue
my efforts.

946
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,904
A few days ago,
you were ready to abandon ship,

947
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,741
and here you are, practically
laying in a course to Earth.

948
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:26,205
As we approached Borg space,
I began to reevaluate my future.

949
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:30,042
The prospect of
becoming a drone...

950
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,961
was unappealing.

951
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:34,422
Sometimes you've got
to look back

952
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,342
in order to move forward.

953
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,635
Sounds to me like
you're starting

954
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:40,094
to embrace
your humanity.

955
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,929
No.

956
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,390
But as I said,

957
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,185
nothing is impossible.
