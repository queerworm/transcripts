1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,302
Holding course 351 mark 10.
Warp 7.

2
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,388
We'll be passing a red dwarf
system in 40 minutes.

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,891
I can't tell yet if there
are any M-Class planets.

4
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,897
You ready?
No, I really want

5
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,608
to get on that transtator
assembly diagnostic.

6
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,819
Harry, I can't do this alone.

7
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,153
Sorry.

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,405
Oh, you're making a big mistake.

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,115
Can't you see
what's going to happen?

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,497
We're the only humans
out here, Harry.

11
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,708
People are going
to start pairing off

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,668
and if we don't get
to the Delaney sisters

13
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,712
in Stellar Cartography soon,
somebody else will.

14
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,714
I got a girl
back home.

15
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,131
So what?
I got five.

16
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,676
I plan on seeing mine again.

17
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,679
Harry, Harry, Harry,
Harry, Harry.

18
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,305
You really think
she's going to wait for you?

19
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,141
I hope so.
Let her go.

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,228
Let her have a husband
and kids and a good life,

21
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,355
while you and I have
the Delaney sisters.

22
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,901
I told you, I need to run
a transtator diagnostic.

23
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,819
You need to run
a self-diagnostic.

24
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,821
Look, they come as a pair.

25
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,073
It's a double date
or no date.

26
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,784
Come on.

27
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,411
I told them all about you.

28
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,039
What did you tell them
about me?

29
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,332
Uh, well, for one thing,

30
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,919
how you broke
the single-pilot speed record

31
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,169
at the Academy.

32
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,838
Record?

33
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,506
I never broke any record.

34
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,884
And who are they going
to check it with?

35
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,595
(<i> console beeping</i> )

36
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,304
(<i> deep rumbling</i> )

37
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,849
Report!

38
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,476
We're at the leading
edge of a shock wave.

39
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,160
Minor hull breach on Deck 3,
contained.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,621
Shields are holding.

41
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,123
TORRES:
<i>Engineering is undamaged,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

42
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,750
<i>All systems operational.</i>

43
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,797
Mr. Paris, can you identify
the source of the wave?

44
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,132
I'm not sure.

45
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,217
Scanners are picking
up a debris cloud

46
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,511
in the red dwarf system
we're approaching.

47
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,014
It consists of differentially
charged polaric ions,

48
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,599
Captain.

49
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,686
Differentially charged?

50
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,982
That would suggest
a massive detonation.

51
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,859
Are you familiar
with any intelligent life forms

52
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,402
in this system, Mr. Neelix?

53
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,821
Familiar?

54
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,657
Ah, not exactly,
uh, familiar.

55
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,660
Considerably less than
familiar, actually.

56
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,705
Adjust course to investigate.

57
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,124
Aye, Captain.

58
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,256
PARIS:
Entering the system, Captain.

59
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,342
Heading 010 mark 4.

60
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,718
NEELIX:
Kes...

61
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,804
what are you doing here?

62
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,889
I had to know.

63
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,142
Know? Know what?

64
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,519
The origin of the shock wave
is an M-Class planet, Captain.

65
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,895
We're within visual range.

66
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,188
On screen.

67
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,985
KIM:
All vegetation on the planet
has been destroyed.

68
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,445
No satellite system in orbit. No
evidence of spacecraft.

69
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,738
Life signs?

70
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,115
None.
PARIS: None.

71
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,533
But the polaric
radiation

72
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,409
may be interfering
with the scanners.

73
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,870
Take us into orbit.

74
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,329
Density patterns
on the surface

75
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,580
show artificial waterways

76
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,291
and a global
aqueduct system.

77
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,170
There is a civilization
down there, Captain.

78
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,588
Or there was.

79
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,423
What do we know
about surface conditions?

80
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,718
Radiation is within
acceptable levels.

81
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,386
Atmosphere:
breathable.

82
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,930
Mr. Paris, Tuvok,
you're with me.

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,557
Ms. Torres, meet us
in Transporter Room 2.

84
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,850
<i>On my way.</i>

85
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,560
Commander,
you have the Bridge.

86
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,756
TORRES:
The entire surface of the planet
was just... seared.

87
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,052
JANEWAY:
There was a chain reaction
in subspace,

88
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,012
very likely ignited
by the detonation

89
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,223
of one or more
polaric ion devices.

90
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,016
PARIS:
If that's what happened,

91
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,809
the people here
never had a chance.

92
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,645
TORRES:
They're gone... vaporized.

93
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,065
Everything organic
has basically been obliterated.

94
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,816
At least it
happened quickly.

95
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,193
Polaric detonation

96
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,278
would have swept through
this city in seconds.

97
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,322
TUVOK:
It recalls
the Chaltok IV incident.

98
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,990
TORRES:
Chaltok IV?

99
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,034
A Romulan research colony
was nearly destroyed

100
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,036
during a testing
of one of these devices.

101
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,331
It led to the Polaric
Test Ban Treaty of 2268.

102
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:59,169
So... we're looking
at the end of a war.

103
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,796
I wonder who won.

104
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,673
JANEWAY:
I'm not so sure
there was a war.

105
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,550
Look at these readings,
B'Elanna.

106
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,140
TORRES:
Polaric ion concentrations

107
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,394
are so high, I can't get
an accurate reading.

108
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,354
I'd say these conduits
were the source

109
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,688
of the explosion,
wouldn't you?

110
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,232
A civilization powered

111
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,858
by polaric ion energy?

112
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,861
That's what it looks like.

113
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,697
A time bomb
underneath every street,

114
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,824
running into every home.

115
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,747
NEELIX:
What do you mean,
you saw it?

116
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,791
How could
you see it?

117
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,542
I don't know.

118
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,505
What did you see?

119
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,469
(<i> sobbing</i> ):
I saw them...

120
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,140
burn...

121
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,436
their bodies...

122
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,732
ashes where they stood!

123
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,863
You felt the shock wave
in your sleep.

124
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,158
This is just
your imagination.

125
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,952
A strange coincidence.

126
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,329
I don't think so.

127
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,913
What else could it be?

128
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,166
It was...

129
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,002
it was almost
telepathic.

130
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:27,507
Telepathy is a message,
words, a voice...

131
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,845
What you're describing,
why, it's... almost like

132
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,348
the visions of Drakina
Forest dwellers.

133
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,266
Who?

134
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,726
A tribe with
paranormal abilities.

135
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,395
They can walk
into an empty room...

136
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:44,316
Neelix, my ancestors
were said to have

137
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:47,527
unusual mental abilities.

138
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,239
No one believes those stories.

139
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,075
I always have.

140
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,481
Look.

141
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,983
This may be some kind
of timepiece

142
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,028
stopped at the moment
of the explosion.

143
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,781
(<i> children laughing</i> )

144
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,161
What was that?
What?

145
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,747
Didn't you hear that?

146
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,291
Hear what,
Lieutenant?

147
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,876
Kids playing.

148
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,044
They were as close to me as...

149
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,589
(<i> children, adults talking</i> )

150
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,315
I don't understand.

151
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,778
I was here, in this square,
but there were people.

152
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,821
You never left here, Tom.

153
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,073
But I saw them.

154
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,409
Lots of people.

155
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,659
Children playing

156
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,869
and the sun was shining.

157
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,038
There was no evidence
of an explosion.

158
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,831
Everyone was alive and happy.

159
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,959
You were standing here
the whole time.

160
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,795
Your central nervous system
is showing a temporal flux,

161
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,671
but it's rapidly
returning to normal.

162
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,049
TUVOK:
The chain reaction has
shattered subspace, Captain.

163
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,427
I want everyone to stand
exactly where they are.

164
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,804
If Tuvok's right,
there may be subspace fractures

165
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,848
floating like icebergs
across the planet's surface.

166
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,225
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>

167
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,352
<i>Go ahead.</i> 
Four to beam up.

168
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,688
(<i> children, adults talking</i> )

169
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,942
Tuvok, B'Elanna?

170
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,444
(<i> screaming</i> )

171
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,241
Hey, calm down.

172
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,700
It's all right.

173
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,578
Now what's the problem?

174
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,996
I saw them!

175
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,498
They appeared
out of thin air!

176
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,584
They're some kind
of demons.

177
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,294
I saw them
with my own eyes.

178
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,754
I'm sorry we startled him.
We just came around the corner.

179
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,381
They're lying!

180
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,633
Shh, now.

181
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,384
Calm down.
You've been reading

182
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,803
too many of those<i> Darkstorm</i>
tales, young fellow.

183
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,181
There's no such thing
as demons.

184
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,390
But I'm telling you...

185
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,267
Ah, ah, ah,
run along now.

186
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,228
Have a confection bar
and calm down.

187
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,107
All right, everybody,
back to your business.

188
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,942
Nothing else to see here now.

189
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,404
Oh, sorry about that.

190
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,738
No problem.

191
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,991
Who knows what gets
into their heads, huh?

192
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,951
Oh, perhaps the
uniforms scared him.

193
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,495
We're not from
this area.

194
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,413
Come in on
the Continental Transport?

195
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,747
This morning.

196
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,667
Is, uh, that what
they're wearing

197
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,168
in Kalto province
these days?

198
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,588
Uh, this is, uh, a little
more formal than most.

199
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,089
You know how it is
when you travel.

200
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,883
We were actually looking
for a clothing shop.

201
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,303
We thought we'd change
into something more appropriate.

202
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,846
There's one
right over there.

203
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,973
I hope the rest of your stay
with us is more enjoyable.

204
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,686
I wish I could
say it will be.

205
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,405
MAN:
Need a timepiece?

206
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,157
Maybe you could help me.

207
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,951
I'm from... Kalto province.

208
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,828
I'm not used
to your timepieces.

209
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,248
They're no different
than Kalton timepieces.

210
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,083
Are you sure?
What do these numbers

211
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,959
stand for?

212
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,837
Rotations, intervals,
fractions.

213
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,631
Same as any timepiece.

214
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,924
14 kelodas.

215
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,219
A fair price.

216
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,012
I might stop back later.

217
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,305
If there's time.

218
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,685
If I understood correctly,

219
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,646
this world is going to be
destroyed sometime tomorrow.

220
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,114
CHAKOTAY:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

221
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,658
<i>There's been no sign of Captain</i>
<i>Janeway or Lieutenant Paris</i>

222
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,327
<i>since they were lost</i>
<i>in a subspace fracture.</i>

223
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,787
KIM:
This is one of the subspace
fractures we've located

224
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,873
with a magneton
scan of the surface.

225
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,626
This is the time
of the explosion

226
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,043
where the fracture opens.

227
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,920
The, as the shock waves
dissipate,

228
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,005
the fracture grows more narrow.

229
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,508
We believe that the Captain
and Lieutenant Paris

230
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,842
are trapped at the narrow end.

231
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,095
Shock waves from most
explosions dissipate

232
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,973
into the future, but we're
speculating-- Based in part

233
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,767
on what Paris
told us he saw--

234
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,769
That these dissipate
into the past.

235
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,061
That's consistent

236
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,812
with the subspace damage
we've observed.

237
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,690
Why haven't they
been able to return

238
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,317
as Mr. Paris did
the first time?

239
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,193
TORRES:
He wasn't all the way

240
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,570
inside a fracture.

241
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,029
Remember? We still saw Paris
standing there

242
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,822
even when he could
see the other side.

243
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,660
So it's possible the Captain
and Paris are existing

244
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,078
only hours and minutes
before the explosion occurs.

245
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,498
There's no way for us to measure

246
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,334
exactly how far back
these fractures go.

247
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,127
How do we find them?

248
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,004
If I know
Captain Janeway,

249
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,881
she would activate
a subspace beacon to assist us.

250
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,383
We're counting on it.

251
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,135
First, we have to find
a fracture

252
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,386
in a location where they've been

253
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,681
then we have to microscan
the fracture

254
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,808
to try to pick up the signal
from their subspace beacon.

255
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,851
Once we've identified
where and when they are,

256
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,563
then we have to widen
the fracture at that point.

257
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,107
How do you suggest we do that?

258
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,569
We're not sure yet.

259
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,995
Hmm.

260
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,834
Mm-hmm.

261
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,293
What?
Hmm?

262
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,586
Is something wrong?

263
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,796
Yes, terribly wrong.

264
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,882
Your brain is...
not on file.

265
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,925
Either your government
failed to transmit

266
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,846
the standard 15-501
Crew Personnel Report

267
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,639
or somebody at
Starfleet Medical

268
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,931
really fouled up.

269
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,851
I'm not a member
of the Starfleet crew.

270
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,061
We came aboard
at mid-expedition.

271
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,479
And no one asked you

272
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,606
for your medical histories
when you arrived?

273
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,026
Of course not--
That would be

274
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,695
the ship's
doctor's job.

275
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,238
My job.

276
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,033
If anyone had bothered
to tell me about new passengers,

277
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,451
but I seem to be
the last to know

278
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,412
just about everything
around here.

279
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,581
So. Tell me--

280
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,625
Just how many other
new arrivals are there?

281
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,918
Just us.
And the crew

282
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,420
from another ship
that was destroyed.

283
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,172
Another... crew?

284
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,049
That's nice.

285
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,762
This is the emergency
medical holographic system

286
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,012
to Captain Janeway.

287
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,347
She's not on board.

288
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,349
She's missing on the
surface of a planet.

289
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,560
Missing?

290
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,813
The Captain is missing?

291
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,318
It seems I've found myself
on the voyage of the damned.

292
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,987
Very well.

293
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,989
Please advise
the highest-ranking officer

294
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,950
who is not missing

295
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,787
to see me
at his earliest convenience.

296
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,538
You may shut off
my program now.

297
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,708
But you haven't told us anything
about her condition.

298
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,502
She's the healthiest member
of her species I've ever seen...

299
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,839
the only member of her species
I've ever seen.

300
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,884
You have a lovely brain.

301
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,511
It will make a fine
addition to our files.

302
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,597
I wouldn't worry.

303
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,932
If your species
has a history

304
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,600
of extraordinary
mental abilities,

305
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,311
this may simply be your way
of flexing those muscles

306
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,938
for the first time.

307
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,148
Living in space requires
the body to make

308
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,733
a variety of biological
adjustments.

309
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,778
This could be a side effect
of that process.

310
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,529
Go home.

311
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,241
Get a good night's sleep...
and drink plenty of fluids.

312
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,534
Fluids?

313
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,036
Everybody should drink
plenty of fluids.

314
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,080
Don't leave
without turning me off.

315
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,707
Computer, end program.

316
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,167
And call me in the morning.

317
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,091
We can assume that<i> Voyager</i>

318
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,135
will be looking for a way
to reach us.

319
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,930
I'll set my combadge
to emit a subspace beacon.

320
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,306
If they get close,
maybe they'll pick it up.

321
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,641
(<i> sighs</i> )

322
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,976
I know.

323
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,310
Maybe there's
some way...

324
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,103
Don't even think
about it, Tom.

325
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,982
The Prime Directive is clear.
We cannot allow our presence

326
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,984
to alter this planet's
natural course of events.

327
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,486
Even if the natural
course of events
is annihilation?

328
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,737
Yeah.

329
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,072
My father used to
talk at length to us

330
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,366
about the Prime Directive,

331
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,993
once a year-- Like
a holiday sermon.

332
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,577
He considered it
the guiding principle

333
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,829
of space exploration.

334
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,205
To be honest,

335
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,249
I tuned out most of
his sermons years ago.

336
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,502
Well, tune back into this one
because I agree with him.

337
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,295
You have no idea
what the consequences might be

338
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,006
once you involve yourself.

339
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,300
The consequences would have to
be better than mass destruction.

340
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,469
You're not to warn these people.

341
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,846
That's an order.

342
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,517
Oh, God. Come on.

343
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,857
I know you're lying.

344
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,026
Young man, we're here
on a business trip

345
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,945
and we have a lot
of work to do.

346
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,406
Officer told me you came here
on the Continental Transport.

347
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,616
That's right.
We're from Kalto province.

348
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,369
Yeah? Well, I just talked
to the transport attendant.

349
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,163
He told me four people
came today from Kalto.

350
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,457
Two of them were
a lot older than you

351
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,292
and they had a child with them.

352
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,003
Well, the attendant
was wrong.

353
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,254
That was us.

354
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,048
So where's the child?

355
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,841
We ate him.

356
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,886
Because we are demons
and we eat children.

357
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,930
And I haven't had
my supper yet.

358
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,347
(<i> gasps in fright</i> )

359
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,313
Sorry, I just figured
it was the quickest way.

360
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,190
Let's concentrate
on getting out of here.

361
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,993
The same subspace fractures
that brought us here

362
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,620
might still be around.

363
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,290
If they were caused
by a polaric explosion

364
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,002
is there any way we could use
polaric energy to get us back?

365
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,550
If we had access to
a polaric ion generator,

366
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,344
we could modify a tricorder
to emit a polaric field.

367
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,722
At the very least, it might
help us scan for a fracture.

368
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,350
I wonder where these
conduits get their power.

369
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,188
(<i> angry yelling</i> )

370
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,443
This is a lawful
demonstration.

371
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,695
We have a right
to be here!

372
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,784
Under normal
circumstances,

373
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,869
I'd say we should
come back tomorrow.

374
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,373
(<i> gunfire</i> )

375
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,084
(<i> gunfire continues</i> )

376
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,342
(<i> groaning</i> )

377
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,902
TORRES:
This device uses the
same polaric energy

378
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,403
that destroyed the planet.

379
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,073
At intense levels,
it can open a subspace fracture.

380
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,701
Wide enough for the Captain
and Paris to get through?

381
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,036
If we can
locate them,

382
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,829
this is capable
of bringing them back.

383
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,497
The logical place
to begin would be

384
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,124
at the same location
they disappeared.

385
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,712
The only problem is,
at the necessary intensity,

386
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,714
the polaric generator
will burn itself out

387
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,298
after 30 seconds at best.

388
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,801
Can't we reinitialize the
generator and try again?

389
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,594
Not at the same location.

390
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,097
Once we make an attempt
at any given location,

391
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,515
the damage to subspace

392
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,350
will make a second
attempt impossible.

393
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,145
How do we prevent one of us from
getting trapped in a fracture?

394
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,481
We've modified our tricorders
to detect the fractures

395
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,692
and all of us will be
wearing one of these.

396
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,777
It puts out an
anti-polaric field.

397
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,404
It should repel the fractures

398
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,156
when they get
within three meters.

399
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,615
Nice work.

400
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,160
NEELIX:
Ah, Commander.

401
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,789
Will you be going back
to the planet's surface?

402
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,166
We're getting ready
to leave right now.

403
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,709
I have to go with you.

404
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,587
There's nothing down there
you want to see, Kes.

405
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,922
That's what
I told her.

406
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,340
I've already seen it.
I have to go.

407
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,688
We're sorry
to involve you in this.

408
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,732
Pe'Nar Makull.

409
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,609
My colleague, Ny Terla.

410
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,485
Apparently, you just
happened to be

411
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,821
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

412
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,990
I was just thinking
the very same thing.

413
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,076
What were you
doing there?

414
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,869
We're from Kalto province.

415
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:30,206
We were hoping to tour
your power facility...

416
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,749
compare it
to our own.

417
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,043
I've never seen a Kalton
with your color hair.

418
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,088
Well, now you have.

419
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,339
My friend thinks
you were sent

420
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,008
by the government
to infiltrate us.

421
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,885
Infiltrate?

422
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,096
You were there
when she got this.

423
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,765
Perhaps you were told
to put on a good show for us.

424
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,559
We don't even know why someone
would<i> want</i> to infiltrate you.

425
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,936
(<i> laughs</i> )

426
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,938
That's hard to believe.

427
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,066
Even in Kalto, there are
protests against polaric energy.

428
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,525
We're not spies.

429
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,819
When was the last time

430
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,361
you were in a power plant?

431
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,863
Not since we left home.

432
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,740
You weren't
in that plant yesterday?

433
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,953
We were just getting there
when we stumbled into you.

434
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,039
We know you're not
telling the truth.

435
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,626
We have safety monitors
to measure polaric energy.

436
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,670
When you were brought here,

437
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,174
they registered five times
the normal readings.

438
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,093
To register levels this high,

439
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,096
you were either inside
that plant yesterday

440
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,514
or...

441
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,557
at the site
of a polaric disaster

442
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,269
worse than any in the history
of this planet.

443
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,046
What is it?

444
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:04,633
It's as though I can sense
the people who were here.

445
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,053
I know.

446
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,847
It's like walking
through a graveyard.

447
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,140
No.

448
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,433
It's more than that.

449
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,313
I almost feel...

450
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:21,108
as if I could touch
the people who were here.

451
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,117
What have you found?

452
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,745
TUVOK:
The scanners are not showing
any subspace fractures

453
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,454
in the area now.

454
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,623
That probably indicates
the subspace damage

455
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,042
is beginning to dissipate.

456
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,336
If that's true,
it's going to be harder

457
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,420
to locate Tom and the Captain.

458
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,215
Commander, I'm picking up
a signal from a combadge.

459
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,758
The subspace beacon?

460
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,177
No, it's not on subspace.

461
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,721
It's here... now.

462
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,431
Kim to Janeway.

463
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,185
Kim to Paris.

464
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,729
Can we locate
the source of the signal?

465
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,231
Yes, sir.

466
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,024
This way.

467
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,238
What's your name?

468
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,446
Janeway.

469
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,823
Unusual name.

470
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,242
Not where I'm from.

471
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,660
What part of Kalto province
was that again?

472
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,246
I don't see any point in this.

473
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,873
There is a point,
a very important one.

474
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,750
It has to do
with our schedule

475
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,378
and whether we
can keep it or not.

476
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,338
Can we?

477
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,632
I don't know.

478
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,676
Do they know our plan?

479
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,804
I have no idea.

480
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,055
Let me go!

481
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,224
Look what I caught

482
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,017
sneaking around
outside.

483
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,865
I'm still not showing
any life signs.

484
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,378
The boy has nothing
to do with any of this.

485
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,629
Is he yours?

486
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,797
No. He's just somebody

487
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,382
we met here.
Don't trust them.

488
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,134
They aren't
who they say they are.

489
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,677
Really?

490
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,262
Thanks, kid.

491
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,931
Look, this is all
a misunderstanding.

492
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,475
They lied about coming here

493
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,892
on the
Continental Transport.

494
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,187
I talked to
the attendant myself.

495
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,520
Let me go...

496
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,730
What do we do with him?

497
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,065
We can't let him go.

498
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,070
Just put him over there
with the other.

499
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,951
Now stay quiet.

500
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,011
The combadge is designed
to self-activate

501
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,888
when the casing is destroyed...

502
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,807
to help searchers
locate victims.

503
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,064
I guess it means they were
caught in the explosion.

504
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,024
It only means
their combadges

505
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,692
were caught in
the explosion.

506
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,195
Further speculation
serves no purpose.

507
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,073
I suggest we search for
other tangible evidence.

508
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,958
None of us have seen devices
like these before.

509
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,753
Terla believes
they're spy equipment.

510
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,923
They're for surveying property.

511
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,133
I've been thinking
of buying land here.

512
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,592
I need to survey it.

513
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,678
I'd be curious
to know how they work.

514
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,722
Would you show me?

515
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,812
But then one of them
might be a weapon.

516
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,189
And I wouldn't want
you to show me

517
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,482
how that works, would I?

518
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,823
Hey, kid.

519
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,117
You were right
about one thing.

520
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,078
I was lying.
I don't eat children.

521
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,122
You don't scare me.

522
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,957
My father works
for the Media Bureau.

523
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,833
And when I tell him
all about this, he'll...

524
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,794
What is he,
some kind of journalist?

525
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,255
Yes, and so am I.

526
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,715
Is that right?

527
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,968
I report for my school journal.

528
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,929
That's right where everyone's
going to find out about you

529
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,557
when I write about this
in next week's edition.

530
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,016
What's your name?

531
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,684
Latika.

532
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,812
Latika.

533
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,984
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,111
For what?

535
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,866
I just am.

536
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,785
MAKULL:
I realize how this
must appear to you,

537
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,120
but I'm just a patriot.

538
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,413
A patriot?

539
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,957
I sincerely believe
polaric energy

540
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,835
has the potential
to destroy this entire world.

541
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,712
And I take it, very few people
here agree with you?

542
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,634
We have more support
since the accident at Markov.

543
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,927
We know the companies
are afraid of us.

544
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,264
We know they've increased
security at all their plants,

545
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,808
but it will not be
enough to stop us.

546
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,064
We can't wait another week.

547
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,899
We have to move up
the schedule.

548
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,444
We know they're
not telling us the truth.

549
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,071
We have to assume
the government sent them.

550
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,950
Tell everyone we begin
at 0400 tomorrow.

551
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,743
Wait a minute.

552
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,539
Captain...?

553
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,209
Kes...

554
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,090
Do you have something
to tell me, Janeway--

555
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,676
If that's
your real name?

556
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,264
It is my real name.

557
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,099
Captain Kathryn Janeway

558
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,852
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

559
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,735
I can feel their presence.

560
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,278
Please elaborate.

561
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,779
How can you feel
their presence?

562
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,575
I don't know.

563
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,660
I just can.

564
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,544
They've been in this room.

565
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,128
I know it.

566
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,507
Is there a subspace fracture
anywhere in here?

567
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,758
Affirmative.

568
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,176
Set up the equipment.

569
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,517
You wanted the truth.
All right.

570
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,561
Here's the truth.

571
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:33,021
We're from the future--

572
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,275
Exactly one day in the future.

573
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,652
You mean I was right?

574
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,614
We weren't allowed to tell.

575
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,032
At least, I thought we weren't.

576
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,956
In a few hours from now,

577
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,000
there will be a serious accident
on this world.

578
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,045
It will be caused
by a polaric detonation.

579
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,298
We came here
in an interstellar ship

580
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,759
to investigate
that explosion.

581
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,009
When we arrived,

582
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,221
we were exposed
to the polaric radiation.

583
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:11,644
Showing a subspace fracture.
Coordinates: 141 by 21 by 14.

584
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,562
Five percent drift.
Range: four meters.

585
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,564
Got it.
Initiating generator.

586
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:19,526
Initiating microscan
of the subspace fracture.

587
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,362
It's very likely that whatever
you're planning to do

588
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,906
could be responsible
for this tragedy.

589
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,494
And somehow, you were able
to come back here to warn us?

590
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:32,331
The explosion had an aftereffect
that no one expected.

591
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,334
It created fractures
in time.

592
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,127
We fell through

593
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,045
one of those
fractures.

594
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,967
Interstellar ships,
fractures in time--

595
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,346
Do you honestly expect
us to believe all this?

596
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,600
I found them.

597
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,186
Scanners are picking up
a subspace beacon.

598
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,648
Adjusting penetration
coordinates to match.

599
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,025
I'll try to open up
the other end.

600
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,780
Chakotay to Janeway.

601
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,824
<i>Captain, can you read us?</i>

602
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,202
Eavesdropping devices.
No.

603
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,663
But they are for communication.

604
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,540
My crew is trying
to contact me.

605
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,750
From the future,
of course.

606
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,755
Get the particle injector.

607
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,680
Bring them with us.
The boy too.

608
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,557
I have an idea
how they can help.

609
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,068
<i>Chakotay to Janeway.</i>

610
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,778
<i>Can you read me?</i>

611
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,196
<i>Please respond.</i>

612
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,455
PARIS:
I don't get it, Captain.

613
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,123
This morning
you were giving orders

614
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,042
about not interfering
because of the Prime Directive.

615
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,586
Now you're telling them
everything.

616
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,880
I told them the truth
when I realized

617
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,882
we'd already violated
the Prime Directive

618
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,341
in the worst
possible manner.

619
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,176
How did we do that?

620
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,387
Just by being here.
Because if we hadn't been here,

621
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,098
it's very possible this world
would not have been destroyed.

622
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,433
What?

623
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,851
Think about it, Tom.

624
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,353
Before we got involved,
these people were planning

625
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,606
to commit some kind
of sabotage next week.

626
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,400
We were the ones who forced
a change in their schedule.

627
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,279
Because of us, they decided
to begin today at 400 rotations

628
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,448
and we know the detonation
takes place today

629
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,324
just after 401.

630
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,537
401:22:84.

631
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,372
Wait a minute.

632
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,041
You're saying we're
responsible for an explosion

633
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,669
even though it occurred
before our ship arrived here?

634
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,838
We've traveled back
to a point in time

635
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,214
before the explosion.

636
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,050
So, yes, we can be
responsible for it.

637
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,389
Let's say we never came

638
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,934
and their plans
didn't change.

639
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,352
Wouldn't the accident simply
have occurred next week

640
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,938
instead of today?

641
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:02,898
Who knows what might have
happened between now and then.

642
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,232
They could have
been arrested

643
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,818
before they got a chance
to carry it out.

644
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,026
Conditions at the plant

645
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,862
might not have been
the same next week.

646
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,865
But it's become
our problem now, Tom,

647
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,118
and we have got to find
a way to solve it.

648
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,168
We're running out of time.

649
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,837
The subspace fractures
are closing.

650
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,672
We've lost over 70 percent
of them.

651
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:29,215
At this point, we're suggesting
we concentrate our search

652
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,092
at the flash point.
May I ask

653
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,219
what you expect
to accomplish by doing that?

654
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,722
We figure the Captain and Paris
might have looked

655
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,474
for the origin of the explosion
to try and prevent it.

656
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,851
Unlikely.

657
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,894
It would be a highly
questionable decision

658
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,228
in light of the Prime Directive.

659
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,858
If it were me, I would
have tried to get there.

660
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:49,110
The issue is whether
Captain Janeway would go there,

661
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,612
not you, Commander.

662
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,907
You think you can
locate the flash point?

663
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,742
We already have.

664
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,119
Let's go.

665
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,043
Your job is to get us
past the guards.

666
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,586
We'll tell them
you're bringing us here

667
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,588
to negotiate a settlement
of our dispute

668
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,007
with the power company.

669
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,635
I cannot and will not
do anything to help you.

670
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,013
Think before
you say no.

671
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,556
Terla has a weapon
trained on the boy.

672
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,808
If shooting begins,
he'll be the first victim.

673
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,239
Is there something
I can do for you?

674
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,866
She's a government
representative

675
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,659
on official business.

676
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,046
I am a hostage.

677
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:51,048
These men are here
to break into the plant.

678
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:19,576
Their lives are
on your conscience, Janeway!

679
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,039
You saved my life.

680
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,084
Don't waste...

681
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,086
time with me, Captain.

682
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,546
Got to stop them.

683
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,674
Will you stay with him
until help arrives?

684
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,802
Sure he will.
The kid and I...

685
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,303
(<i> groaning</i> )

686
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,555
we're old friends now,
aren't we?

687
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,848
Yeah.

688
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,018
I'll be back for you.

689
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,149
We'll be here.

690
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,416
(<i> murmuring voices</i> )

691
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,532
The polaric levels
are higher here

692
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,200
than any place
we've been so far.

693
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,285
This was undoubtedly
the flash point

694
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,662
of the explosion.

695
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,290
Whatever went wrong,
it started here.

696
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,584
Do we have subspace fractures
to work with in here?

697
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,878
Affirmative.

698
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,880
They remain quite numerous
in this area.

699
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,715
Set up the equipment.

700
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,550
KIM:
Aye, sir.

701
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,011
I need the injector.

702
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,600
Just hand that bag
to me.

703
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,357
TUVOK:
41 by 310.

704
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,776
Two percent drift.

705
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,111
Range: 6 meters.

706
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,653
Mark.

707
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,905
I have it.

708
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:03,156
Initiating generator.

709
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,951
Scanning
for the subspace beacon.

710
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,248
It doesn't look like
they were here.

711
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,624
It is highly unlikely

712
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,834
that Captain Janeway
would come here to...

713
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,921
No, the Captain did come.

714
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,589
She was here.

715
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,593
This is where she died.

716
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,222
Everybody on this planet

717
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,348
has less than
three minutes to live

718
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,226
if you go through
with this, Makull.

719
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,770
Don't!

720
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,732
What exactly do you think
we are planning to do here?

721
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,526
I assume you're going
to sabotage the plant

722
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,862
probably by detonating
some kind of device.

723
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,823
We're not stupid enough
to blow up anything here.

724
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,660
That may be true,
but<i> something</i> will go wrong.

725
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,578
Nothing is going to go wrong

726
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,790
unless you fire that weapon
near a polaric conduit.

727
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,585
For everyone's safety,
I suggest you put it down.

728
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,588
Give me the bag.

729
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:12,309
All right, then... we'll wait.

730
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,311
If Kes is right,
the Captain was here

731
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,603
at the moment
the explosion occurred.

732
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,397
Is there any way
to break through subspace

733
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,358
a few minutes
before the detonation?

734
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,734
If the widest point
of the fracture

735
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,528
represents the time
of the explosion,

736
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,404
couldn't we open a hole
just before

737
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,865
the widest point?

738
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,783
There's no way we could pinpoint
the exact time

739
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,870
we'd be penetrating, but we
could make an educated guess.

740
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,205
TUVOK
I feel it is

741
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,123
my duty to point out
there is absolutely

742
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,458
no logical reason
to believe Kes is correct.

743
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,836
However,

744
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,088
since I have no alternative
course of action

745
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,716
to recommend at this time,
I suggest we proceed.

746
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,259
TORRES:
Commander?

747
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,808
What time is it?

748
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,857
401 rotations plus 21.

749
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:05,237
We'll just wait until... 23.

750
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,905
Twenty-three?

751
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,407
What's the importance of 23?

752
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,078
Oh.

753
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,999
This is all about
the alleged time

754
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,043
of our self-annihilation.

755
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:23,004
All right.

756
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:26,091
Let's just see
if we can all get through the...

757
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,802
What's going on?

758
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,014
They're cutting
through subspace.

759
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,768
My God.

760
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:41,231
It's going to intersect
with the conduit wall.

761
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,858
Our own rescue attempt.

762
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,693
That's what sets it off.

763
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,326
My weapon may be able
to seal that hole.

764
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,328
It's our only chance.

765
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,846
I'm getting nadion particle
resistance from the other side.

766
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,975
Increasing generator
to maximum output.

767
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,985
The generator's overloading.

768
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,112
I don't understand.
It's not working.

769
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,656
We're not penetrating
the fracture.

770
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,555
Harry, Harry, Harry,
Harry, Harry.

771
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,141
You really think
she's going to wait for you?

772
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,559
I hope so.
Let her go.

773
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,063
Let her have a husband
and kids and a good life,

774
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,565
while you and I have
the Delaney sisters.

775
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,861
I told you I need to run
a transtator diagnostic.

776
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,821
You need to run
a self-diagnostic.

777
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,614
Look, they come as a pair.

778
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,616
It's a double date
or no date.

779
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,411
Come on.

780
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,330
I told them all about you.

781
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,957
What did you tell them
about me?

782
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,168
Uh, well, for one thing,

783
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,795
how you broke
the single-pilot speed record

784
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,047
at the Academy.

785
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,715
Record?

786
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,342
I never broke any record.

787
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,886
And who are they going
to check it with?

788
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,180
Chakotay to Captain Janeway.

789
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,687
Yes, Commander.

790
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,272
We've identified
an M-Class planet

791
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,940
in the red dwarf system
we're approaching.

792
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,318
Do you want to change
course to investigate?

793
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,364
Are you familiar with
any intelligent life-forms

794
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,573
in this system, Mr. Neelix?

795
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,908
Familiar?

796
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,370
Ah, not exactly familiar.

797
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:05,083
Considerably less
than familiar, actually.

798
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,464
Kes...

799
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,883
what are you doing here?

800
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,344
I had to know.
Know?

801
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,054
Know what?

802
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,724
The planet...
everyone was killed.

803
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,143
There was this terrible
explosion.

804
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,020
You, you had a bad dream.

805
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,482
No. It was more
than a dream.

806
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:33,236
Mr. Tuvok, any
indications of trouble

807
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,571
on that M-Class
planet?

808
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:35,863
Negative, Captain.

809
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,615
Is it populated?

810
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,992
Sensors do show humanoid life.

811
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,495
There is
no satellite system

812
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,997
and no indications
of spacecraft
in the vicinity.

813
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,584
It appears to be
a pre-warp civilization.

814
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,921
Which means as a policy,

815
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,132
we don't involve ourselves
in their affairs.

816
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,925
Of course.

817
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,261
A most enlightened
philosophy.

818
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,429
Come on, Kes.

819
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,639
I'm sorry.
Captain...

820
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,808
Is it possible
to see this planet

821
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,226
on the viewscreen?

822
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,733
JANEWAY:
There it is.

823
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,616
Thank you.

824
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,372
Come on.

825
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,250
Just...

826
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,043
JANEWAY:
Enter the planet's

827
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,920
coordinates into the log

828
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,880
and maintain present heading,
Commander.

829
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,924
Warp 6.

830
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,968
CHAKOTAY:
Aye, Captain.
