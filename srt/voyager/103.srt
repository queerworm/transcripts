1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:03,504
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

2
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,217
She's not just out of control,
she's out of her mind!

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,261
If you will explain
what happened, Lieutenant.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,596
She hit me is what happened!

5
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,181
Your nose is broken
in three places.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,851
I'll need to reset
the ethmoid fossa.

7
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,393
Try not to move.

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,604
We were having a disagreement
about the power grid.

9
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,815
She wanted to realign
the lateral plasma conduit.

10
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,023
I told her,

11
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,985
that would cause
an overload.

12
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,235
As usual,

13
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,779
she wouldn't listen.

14
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,032
So I told her to step aside
and let me handle it.

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,659
She pushed me away
from the console.

16
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,994
I pushed back.

17
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,829
Next thing I knew,
I was lying on the deck

18
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,622
with blood pouring
down my face.

19
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,165
Then what happened?

20
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,084
She said, "Sorry. Maybe you
should go to Sick Bay."

21
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,044
At least she gave you
some good advice. Now...

22
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,755
Ow!
Hold still.

23
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,757
Don't worry, Lieutenant,
I'll take care of this.

24
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,718
You keep that woman
out of my Engine Room

25
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,011
and everything will be fine!

26
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,637
Ow!

27
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,599
Where is Ms. Torres?

28
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,976
I've confined
her to quarters.

29
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,394
I would like her moved
to the brig

30
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,145
until formal charges
can be filed.

31
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,231
Formal charges?
Come on, Tuvok.

32
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,107
We're 75 years away
from the nearest court.

33
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,401
You're really going

34
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,028
to hold her in the brig
for that long?

35
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,320
The Captain
has the authority

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,864
to try Ms. Torres
here on the ship,

37
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,866
considering the extenuating
circumstances.

38
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,534
Well, I'd like to
settle this on my own

39
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,744
without filing charges

40
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,328
and without involving
the Captain.

41
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,621
She struck
a fellow officer--

42
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,040
that is a court-martial
offense.

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,499
She's a Maquis,
and in the Maquis,

44
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,918
sometimes you
have to push people

45
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,961
out of your way
to get things done.

46
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,880
Ms. Torres is no longer
a member of the Maquis

47
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,507
and with all due respect,
Commander, neither are you.

48
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,384
Allowing Ms. Torres
to get away

49
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,053
with a clear violation
of regulations

50
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,221
sets a bad example
for the rest of the crew.

51
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,973
It makes it appear
as though you are

52
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,600
showing favoritism
toward the Maquis.

53
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,018
Look, Lieutenant,
I don't have

54
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,436
to explain myself to you.

55
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,271
I'll deal with
B'Elanna personally

56
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,814
and then I'll
inform the Captain.

57
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,816
You're to drop this matter.

58
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,109
That's an order.

59
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,196
I will yield my authority
in this case to you.

60
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,198
However, I will make
a full report

61
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,533
in my Security Log.

62
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,372
You do that.

63
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,967
Sir, we heard
what happened.

64
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,760
What are they going
to do with B'Elanna?

65
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,678
I don't know yet,
but I'll handle it.

66
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,138
We heard that
Captain Janeway

67
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,057
is going to put her in
the brig for two months.

68
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,433
And that all the
Maquis are going

69
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,726
to be restricted
to quarters

70
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,019
when they're not on duty?

71
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,228
Not true.

72
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,897
We just want
you to know,

73
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,690
that if things do
get out of hand,

74
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,776
we're ready to back you.

75
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,153
What does that mean?
In case you want

76
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,073
to take control of the ship,
you have our full support.

77
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,994
If I ever hear you
talk that way again,

78
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,162
I'll personally throw you
in the brig for mutiny.

79
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,543
( breathing heavily )

80
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,256
( door chimes )

81
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,675
( growls )

82
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,180
Here.

83
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,390
What's this?

84
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,143
The medical report
on Lieutenant Carey.

85
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,894
Lieutenant Carey is an idiot!

86
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,438
When I tell you--
I don't want to hear it!

87
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,150
You might be interested to know
that the impact fractures

88
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,152
along his cranium
were pretty severe.

89
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,778
If you'd hit him
just a little harder,

90
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,571
you could have driven
some of those bones

91
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,197
into his cerebellum.

92
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,742
I didn't even come close
to hitting him that hard.

93
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,452
So on the one side,
I'm facing a Vulcan

94
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,829
who wants to court-martial you,

95
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,622
and on the other,
I'm facing all the Maquis

96
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,457
who are ready to seize
this ship over this.

97
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,459
You've turned this into
one lousy day for me,

98
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,752
Torres.

99
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,052
So, how long do I
have to stay in here?

100
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,137
Rest of the trip-- 75 years.

101
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,097
I've never found
your twisted sense of humor

102
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,682
very funny, Chakotay.

103
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,101
Or I could send you back to work
with the understanding

104
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,268
that you'll apologize to--

105
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,188
Apologize?
He was the one who--

106
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,648
Not just a simple apology,
a personal one...

107
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,068
over a hot cup
of<i> pejuta.</i>

108
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,194
Bond with the man.

109
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,404
I am not going
to bond with him.

110
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,531
You're going to need
support from people like Carey.

111
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,491
I don't need support
from anybody.

112
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,078
You are if you're going to be
Chief Engineer of this ship.

113
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,288
Right.
This is not

114
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,374
another example of my twisted
sense of humor.

115
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,712
But Carey's next in line.

116
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,756
You're a better engineer
than he is.

117
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,428
What does the Captain have

118
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,763
to say about this?

119
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,098
She hasn't said a word...

120
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,559
because I haven't told her yet.

121
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,233
(<i> dramatic theme swells</i> )

122
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,821
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

123
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,678
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48439.7.</i>

124
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,222
<i>As we maintain a course</i>

125
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,807
<i>back to the Alpha Quadrant,</i>
<i>we're conducting</i>

126
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,392
<i>what would normally be routine</i>
<i>maintenance to the ship--</i>

127
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,730
<i>routine, that is, if we had</i>
<i>access to a starbase.</i>

128
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,816
Engine efficiency is down
another 14 percent.

129
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,651
If we don't get more power
to the warp drive,

130
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,653
we're all going to have
to get out and push.

131
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,947
What about
alternative energy sources?

132
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,491
Ensign Kim, have you had
any luck getting power

133
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,784
from the holodeck reactors?

134
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,078
Not yet.

135
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,829
We tried hooking them
to the power grid

136
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,123
and we ended up blowing out
half the relays.

137
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,542
The holodeck's energy matrix,
it just isn't compatible

138
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,919
with the other
power systems.

139
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,461
CHAKOTAY:
Captain, if we relocate

140
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,005
all security personnel
to Deck 7,

141
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,422
we can shut down power
on Deck 9

142
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,217
and reroute it
to propulsion.

143
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,929
That would be inconvenient,
but acceptable.

144
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,806
Fine. Now let's move on
to the personnel situation.

145
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,141
We still have...

146
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,517
(<i> door opening</i> )

147
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,104
Sorry we're late,
but I wasn't informed

148
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,273
there was a meeting
this morning.

149
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,901
Oh, there don't seem
to be enough chairs.

150
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,654
Neelix, this is a briefing
for the Senior Officers.

151
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,906
I see.

152
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,866
Well, I...

153
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,744
I am the senior
Talaxian on board.

154
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,164
Kes is the senior Ocampa.

155
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,541
And I do know more about
this region of space

156
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,919
than any other member
of the crew.

157
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,338
We have some excellent
suggestions, Captain.

158
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,425
Very well.

159
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,177
You're welcome to join us,
this time.

160
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,430
Here you are.

161
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,226
To be honest, we could use
some excellent suggestions

162
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,518
right now.

163
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,229
I've been thinking
that you might be able

164
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,772
to convert one of
your lower decks

165
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,317
into a hydroponics bay
to grow your own food.

166
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,402
I understand that
the replicators are down

167
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,155
and that the emergency rations
won't hold out much longer.

168
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,115
What about Cargo Bay 2?

169
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,533
It was designed
for organic storage

170
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,745
and it already has adjustable
environmental controls.

171
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,997
When can you start?

172
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,332
Me?

173
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,834
It's your idea.
It's your project.

174
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,669
Right away.

175
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,756
I can do some wonderful things
with vegetables, Captain.

176
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,883
My<i> feragoit</i> goulash

177
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,428
is known across
12 star systems.

178
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,013
Okay.

179
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,889
The personnel situation.

180
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,933
We've managed to
find a replacement

181
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,559
for the Transporter Chief,

182
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,437
but we still need
an Astrogation Plotter,

183
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,646
a Chief Engineer,

184
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,523
medical support
personnel.

185
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,859
I've made a list
of several Maquis crew members

186
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,444
who would make good officers.

187
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,198
B'Elanna Torres?

188
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,158
She was the one involved

189
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,035
in that incident
with Mr. Carey.

190
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,495
That's right.

191
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,873
Just what job do you
think she's suited for?

192
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,666
Chief Engineer.

193
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,211
You're serious.

194
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,795
Very.

195
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,134
Regarding Sick Bay...

196
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,720
we still need a Chief
Medical Officer.

197
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,639
What about that electronic
man down in Sick Bay?

198
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,475
It is an emergency
medical hologram

199
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,477
and its abilities are limited.

200
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,854
It can only operate
within the confines of Sick Bay.

201
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,357
Not to mention
its lousy bedside manner.

202
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,567
CHAKOTAY:
Perhaps we should assign
somebody to train

203
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,236
with the hologram
as a Field Medic.

204
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,321
Good idea.

205
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,325
Lieutenant, I understand
you studied biochemistry

206
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,659
at the Academy?

207
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,828
Uh, only two semesters.

208
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,206
Close enough. You just
volunteered to become

209
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,749
a Field Medic.

210
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,918
Report to Sick Bay as soon
as we're finished here.

211
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,169
But, Captain-- Unh.

212
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,504
JANEWAY:
Stations, everyone.

213
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,339
( alarm blaring )

214
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,840
Report!

215
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,134
We're running into some kind
of spatial distortions.

216
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,011
Mr. Tuvok?
The distortions are emanating

217
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,596
from a highly
localized disturbance

218
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,473
in the space-time continuum.

219
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,767
Distance-- 20,000 kilometers
off the port bow.

220
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,227
All stop.

221
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,272
On screen.

222
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,028
Gravimetric flux density
is over 2,000 percent.

223
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,654
If I'm not mistaken,

224
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,033
we're looking at a type-4
quantum singularity.

225
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,952
( console beeping )

226
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,121
Captain, I am receiving
an audio transmission...

227
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,498
from within the singularity.

228
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,292
On speakers.

229
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,044
VOICE ( over speakers ):
<i>This is...</i>
<i>ship...singularity...</i>

230
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,588
(<i> static obscures transmission</i> )

231
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,715
I think I've found
the source of the transmission.

232
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,343
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

233
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,308
Does it look like any ship
you're familiar with?

234
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,435
No.

235
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,770
Nothing I recognize...

236
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,566
but then it's, it's
so hard to make out.

237
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,943
They may be trapped
in the event horizon.

238
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,070
Open a channel.

239
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,864
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Starship<i> Voyager</i>

240
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,867
to the vessel near
the quantum singularity.

241
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,077
Do you need help?

242
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,329
Event horizon?

243
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,998
A singularity is a star

244
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,917
that's collapsed in on itself.

245
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,171
The event horizon is
a very powerful energy field

246
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,713
surrounding it.

247
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:17,051
Why, once on a particularly
dangerous trade mission

248
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,053
to the twin stars of Keloda,

249
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,264
I myself was almost
trapped inside...

250
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,016
No response to our hail,
Captain.

251
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,809
Can we tractor the vessel out?

252
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,562
No. The subspace interference
is too heavy.

253
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,898
Captain, we're less
than three light-years

254
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,066
from Ilidaria.

255
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,361
They have sophisticated
technology.

256
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,612
They might be able to help

257
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,864
and they're quite friendly...

258
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,616
most of the time.

259
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,409
No. It looks like
it's being pulled in

260
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,701
toward the singularity.

261
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,454
We have to get it out
of the event horizon.

262
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,080
Bridge to Torres.

263
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,583
We need a way to get that ship
out of there. Any ideas?

264
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,919
TORRES ( over intercom ):
<i>I was thinking we could</i>
<i>remodulate a tractor beam</i>

265
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,547
to match the subspace
interference.

266
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,756
It<i> might</i> be enough to cut
through the event horizon.

267
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,758
A subspace tractor beam.
TORRES:<i> Exactly.</i>

268
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,052
When can you
have it ready?

269
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,803
TORRES:
<i>Two hours, maybe three.</i>

270
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,929
Get right on it.

271
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,306
Use as many people
as you need.

272
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,934
Mr. Carey,
what do you think?

273
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,354
With the right field modulation,
it might work

274
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,398
but we'll need more power
to the emitter array.

275
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,525
Very well.
You're in charge, Mr. Carey.

276
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,027
Report to me
when the tractor beam is ready.

277
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,612
Aye, Captain.

278
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,076
Mr. Paris.

279
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,952
Hold our position here.

280
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,668
I'd like to see you
in private.

281
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,302
We have a problem

282
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,304
and I think it's
time we discuss it.

283
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,931
Captain, I appreciate
your concerns

284
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,433
about Torres,
but I promise you...

285
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,101
You don't understand,
Commander.

286
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,768
This isn't about Torres.

287
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,646
My problem is with you.

288
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,356
Me?

289
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,773
Let me be blunt.

290
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,817
What you tried to do
just now was out of line.

291
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,446
In what way?
When you decided

292
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,821
to call Torres in Engineering.

293
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,156
I've worked with her.

294
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,575
I know what she's capable of.

295
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,951
We needed an answer right away

296
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,411
and I knew
she could give us one.

297
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,622
Carey is the Senior Officer
in Engineering.

298
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,415
If you look at it that way,

299
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,667
none of my people
will ever have seniority.

300
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,462
That's the problem, right there.
They're not<i> your</i> people.

301
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,171
You're treating
the Maquis on this ship

302
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,797
like they're still your crew.

303
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,384
I'm doing everything I can
to integrate them into your crew

304
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,678
but frankly, you're not
making it easy for me, Captain.

305
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,347
I can't make it easy, Commander.
Surely you can understand that.

306
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,016
They don't have the discipline.
They don't have the training.

307
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,436
But some of them, like B'Elanna
Torres have the ability.

308
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,187
The Starfleet officers
on this ship

309
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,649
have worked all their lives
to earn their commissions.

310
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,191
How am I supposed to ask them

311
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,486
to accept a Maquis
as their superior officer

312
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,862
just because circumstances
have forced us together?

313
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,740
You're asking them to accept me.

314
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,032
You're qualified.

315
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,367
You're a graduate of the Academy

316
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,620
and you have
Starfleet command experience.

317
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,872
Permission to speak freely.

318
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,874
Go ahead.

319
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,253
I have no intention of being
your token Maquis officer.

320
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,590
Show me another qualified
Maquis candidate

321
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,550
and I'll consider him.
B'Elanna Torres.

322
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,302
Who cannot control herself

323
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,387
and who could not make it
through the Academy.

324
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,181
She's the best engineer
I've ever known.

325
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,724
She could<i> teach</i> at the Academy.

326
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,563
You're right, Captain.

327
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,691
I do consider these my people

328
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,857
because nobody else on this ship

329
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,443
will look out for them
like I will.

330
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,944
And I'm telling you,

331
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,988
you're going to have
to give them more authority

332
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,948
if you want their loyalty.
Theirs...

333
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,659
or yours, Commander?

334
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,578
I'm trying to help you.

335
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,331
I'm sorry you don't see that.

336
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,544
I strongly recommend
you get to know Torres

337
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,546
before you choose
a new Chief Engineer.

338
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,465
Permission to leave.

339
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,301
Dismissed.

340
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,638
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

341
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,738
Computer, activate the emergency
medical holographic system.

342
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,281
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

343
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,450
Actually, there is no emergency.

344
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,285
I'm creating a hydroponics bay.

345
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,704
I was told you could provide me

346
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,873
with some nitrogenated
soil samples.

347
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,249
That's it?

348
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,710
I'm sorry if--
So it begins.

349
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,547
The trivia of medicine
is my domain now.

350
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:26,259
Every runny nose,
stubbed toe, pimple on a cheek

351
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,219
becomes my responsibility.

352
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,721
You are the only
doctor we have.

353
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,223
I am not just a doctor.

354
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,684
I've been designed
with the information

355
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,936
from 2,000
medical reference sources

356
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,898
and the experience of 47
individual medical officers.

357
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,443
I am the embodiment
of modern medicine.

358
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,152
( sighs )

359
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,321
How much dirt do you need?

360
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,031
Four samples
will be enough.

361
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,367
( sighs )

362
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,286
Now I know how Hippocrates felt

363
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,247
when the king needed
him to trim a hangnail.

364
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,166
You're very sensitive,
aren't you?

365
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,547
As a medical practitioner,

366
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,007
I require a certain
sensitivity

367
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,176
to properly
address a patient.

368
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,347
I'm talking about you
as a person.

369
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,102
I am merely a hologram.

370
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,480
Doctor, has your program
altered your appearance

371
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,898
since I came to Sick Bay?

372
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,357
No.

373
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,818
Why?

374
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,028
When I first came in

375
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,197
your head was at the same
height as this cabinet

376
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:34,285
but now you look at least
ten centimeters shorter.

377
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,590
I've just run a diagnostic
on my imaging processor.

378
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,135
It shows that I've been reduced
in height by 10.4 centimeters.

379
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,431
Sick Bay to Operations.

380
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,016
This is Kim.

381
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,393
The holographic projector
in here is malfunctioning.

382
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,354
Would you send a repair crew
down right away?

383
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,605
We're a little busy right now.

384
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,607
We'll get to it
as soon as we can.

385
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,609
It's just that I'm--
<i>Kim out.</i>

386
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,406
Well...

387
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,660
seems like a very busy day
in Operations.

388
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,704
I'm sorry
I bothered you with this.

389
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,121
No trouble at all.

390
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,957
Just turn off the program
before you leave.

391
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,292
What's your name?

392
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,837
What purpose would a name
serve a hologram?

393
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,339
I'd just like to know what
to call you besides "Doctor."

394
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,592
I guess they never thought

395
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,469
I'd be around
long enough to need one.

396
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,137
What's your name?

397
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,389
Kes.

398
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,140
Kes.

399
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,227
I'm glad I could help you today.

400
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,854
Computer, end program.

401
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,231
( computer beeps )

402
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,316
(<i> gentle theme playing</i> )

403
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,572
( over intercom ):<i> </i>
<i>Carey to Bridge.</i>
<i>The subspace tractor beam</i>

404
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,782
<i>is on line</i>
<i>and ready to go, Captain.</i>

405
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,075
Acknowledged.

406
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,702
Mr. Tuvok, lock onto that ship.

407
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,995
Engaging tractor beam.

408
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,375
It's working.

409
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,794
The beam is penetrating
the event horizon.

410
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,462
Engineering,
check your power levels.

411
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,673
I'm showing massive
fluctuations.

412
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,509
Damn it! The new relays on
the power grid aren't holding!

413
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,553
We're being pulled
toward the singularity!

414
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,971
What's going on?

415
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,890
Power to the tractor beam
is down 80 percent.

416
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,683
The gravimetric force
of the singularity

417
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,519
is pulling us in.
Impulse engines, full reverse.

418
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,896
Disengage the tractor beam.

419
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,146
I can't shut it down!

420
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,607
The emitter relays are locked.

421
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,483
I'm picking up hull stress
all over the ship.

422
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,193
If we keep engines
at full reverse while

423
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,613
the tractor beam's engaged,
it'll pull the ship apart.

424
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,822
Cut the engines!

425
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,449
We're moving forward again.

426
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,785
Engineering, get that
tractor beam off-line!

427
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,287
Captain, I can shut it down, but
I'll have to get in there

428
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,081
and physically cut
the main power feed.

429
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,999
Do it!

430
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,133
Tractor beam disengaged.

431
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,177
Move us to a safe distance,
Mr. Paris.

432
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,890
Are we abandoning
the rescue attempt?

433
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,350
No, but we are going
to need some help.

434
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,728
Lay in a course for
the Ilidaria system.

435
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,105
Full impulse.

436
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,189
Have Mr. Neelix
report to the Bridge.

437
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,608
It looks like we're

438
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,526
going to follow his
suggestion after all.

439
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,468
( door chimes )

440
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,846
Come in.

441
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,222
You asked to see me,
Captain.

442
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,100
Have a seat.

443
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,685
I just want you to know

444
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,022
that I have personally gone over
every emitter relay again

445
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,940
and refitted
four of them myself.

446
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,441
No one blames you
for what happened.

447
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,569
Commander Chakotay
thinks very highly of you.

448
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,405
He's recommended you
for Chief Engineer.

449
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,409
Well, uh...

450
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,954
we've, uh, we've been
through a few scrapes together.

451
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,457
Do you think you're ready?

452
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,209
Ready?

453
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,547
Ready to be Chief Engineer
on a starship.

454
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,133
Well, I think I know my way
around an Engine Room,

455
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,342
if that's what you mean.

456
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,137
It's part of what I mean.

457
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,140
There's also the matter

458
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,475
of your ability
to command others.

459
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,895
I'm not sure
I'd be doing you a favor

460
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,313
by putting you in charge
down there.

461
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,315
There'd be a lot
of hard feelings toward you

462
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,275
from many
of the Starfleet people.

463
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:39,197
I'm not bothered
by what people think of me.

464
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:42,158
And the job requires knowledge
of Starfleet protocol,

465
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,243
experience with Starfleet
methodologies...

466
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,536
Listen, Captain

467
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,830
if you don't think
I'm right for this job

468
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,165
just say so.

469
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,960
I'll be honest.

470
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,089
I'm not sure whether
you are or not.

471
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,381
That's why I wanted to meet,

472
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,217
try to get to know
you a little better.

473
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,139
I've been studying
your Academy record.

474
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,642
Where did you get that?

475
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,770
Thanks to Tuvok,
we had the names

476
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,981
of your entire crew
by the time we left DS9.

477
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,194
Four disciplinary hearings,
one suspension.

478
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,029
You had quite a turbulent
couple of years,

479
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,614
didn't you?

480
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,323
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

481
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,951
What do you think
the problem was?

482
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,494
The problem?
The problem was a system

483
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,371
that didn't give anyone
a chance to breathe.

484
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,540
We work under that same system
on this ship.

485
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,627
Then I guess maybe
this is just a bad idea.

486
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,462
Why did you quit
the Academy, B'Elanna?

487
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,260
I didn't want to have anything
to do with Starfleet then,

488
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,220
and I'm sorry
that I have to now.

489
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,974
( sighs )

490
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,350
DOCTOR (over intercom ):
<i>Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.</i>

491
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,852
Yes, Doctor?

492
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,481
<i>May I request you activate</i>
<i>monitor input 47--</i>

493
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,858
<i>your emergency</i>
<i>medical holograph channel?</i>

494
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,277
Of course.

495
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,367
I'm getting
a distorted transmission.

496
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,496
<i>No. In fact, that is</i>
<i>how I appear at present.</i>

497
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,706
<i>I'm...shrinking.</i>

498
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,208
Shrinking?

499
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,751
<i>There appears</i>
<i>to be a malfunction</i>

500
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,919
<i>in my imaging system.</i>

501
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,254
<i>It's been reducing</i>
<i>my height</i>

502
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,713
<i>by five centimeters every hour.</i>

503
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,049
<i>I've been waiting all day</i>
<i>for repairs.</i>

504
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,468
<i>That is not, however,</i>
<i>what I am calling about.</i>

505
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,054
<i>Over the past three hours,</i>
<i>nine crew members have reported</i>

506
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,515
<i>unusual symptoms--</i>
<i>severe headaches,</i>

507
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,434
<i>muscle spasms</i>
<i>and sudden waves of dizziness.</i>

508
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,688
All of this could be related
to the quantum singularity.

509
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,439
<i>Quantum singularity?</i>

510
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,860
It was sending out
strong spatial distortions.

511
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,361
They might have affected
the crew

512
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,947
and your systems as well.

513
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,866
<i>You know, Captain,</i>
<i>if we were in the vicinity</i>

514
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,827
<i>of a quantum singularity,</i>
<i>I should have been informed.</i>

515
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,537
You're right.

516
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,165
I'll look into linking your
program into the ship's data.

517
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,877
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

518
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,503
<i>Hello? Captain?</i>

519
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,714
( door opens )<i> </i>
<i>Hello!</i>

520
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,341
Report.

521
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,759
It looks like we're running
into more spatial distortions.

522
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,054
KIM:
I'm picking up a highly
localized disturbance

523
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,638
off the port bow.
On screen.

524
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,642
Mr. Tuvok?

525
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,228
It is another type-4

526
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,603
quantum
singularity.

527
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,939
Physical and temporal
dimensions are identical

528
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,816
to the one
we encountered earlier.

529
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,651
Captain, according
to these readings,

530
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,778
we've returned
to our previous coordinates.

531
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,158
This isn't another singularity.

532
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,368
It's the same one.

533
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,829
(<i> suspenseful theme playing )</i>

534
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,386
Check the navigational logs.
Confirm our position.

535
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,636
Well, they show we've travelled

536
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,347
1.4 light years away
from the anomaly,

537
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,682
but I've confirmed our position
against the star chart.

538
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,852
We're definitely back where we
started. Doesn't make sense.

539
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,396
They can't
both be right.

540
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,856
We're either still at
the singularity or we're not.

541
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,983
Well, we can
see the singularity

542
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,403
so I tend to believe that the
external sensors are correct.

543
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,405
TUVOK:
That would imply
there was something

544
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,949
wrong with the warp drive
and the navigational logs.

545
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,493
Mister Paris, lay in a course
away from the singularity.

546
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,453
This time at maximum warp.

547
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,582
Ensign Kim, I want you to keep a
sensor lock on the singularity.

548
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,626
Verify that we're
moving away from it.

549
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,087
Engage.

(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

551
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,428
Distance from the singularity

552
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,263
is 10 million kilometers
and increasing.

553
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:36,267

All systems report normal.

554
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,561

( console beeping )

556
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,442
I don't get it.

557
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,068
Mr. Paris,
have we altered course?

558
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:50,948
No, we're still steady
on 310 mark 215.

559
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,616
Then something's
really wrong here.

560
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,368
It's ahead of us again.

561
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,786
Confirmed.

562
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,413
We're back
at the same coordinates.

563
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,123
All stop.

564
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,503

Who will represent

Lieutenant Carey.

574
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,565
You should invite
B'Elanna Torres as well,

575

unless you've removed her
from consideration.

576
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,527
Fine.

Well, I'll give you

I'll be there, too.

583

Just remember, Torres,
I'm the Senior Officer

584
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,850
and I speak for Engineering.

585
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,060
Try not to say anything

586
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,811

asks you a question.

You should have broken
more than his nose.

591
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,209
I've taken a look
at every major subsystem

592
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,668
and there's no sign
of any trouble.

593
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,337
What about the
navigational array?

594
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,047
We'll have the results
in about an hour.

595
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,425
So, I hear there's been
some trouble

596
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,093
down in Engineering.

597
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,429
There was an altercation,
but it has been resolved.

598
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,804
Oh, that's not
what I hear.

599
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,765
I hear that the whole
department's up in arms.

600
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,350
That the Maquis
and Starfleet people

601
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,809
are almost at
each other's throats.

602
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,144
I will never
cease to be amazed

603
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,230
by the human capacity
for hyperbole.

604
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,691
The situation may be
characterized as tense,

605
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,943
but one could hardly say

606
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,529
that they are about
to become violent.

607
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,114
Well, I just hope
you're right.

608
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,533
I mean, things are bad enough
around here without... ow!

Yeah. I just have this

coming from the singularity.

I can give you a long, boring
analysis.

628

Suffice it to say, I don't
know what's going on.

629

The readings
are confused,

630
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,709
the data is contradictory.
None of it

631
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,919
makes any sense.

632
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,297
Anyone have anything
more constructive?

633
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,881
Ship-wide diagnostics

634
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,800
have revealed nothing
out of the ordinary.

635
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,385
I tried sending out
a tachyon signal,

636
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,430
to scan the singularity,
but all I got back was static.

637
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,599
B'Elanna, do you think
you can work with Mr. Carey

638
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,891
to clean up that signal?

639
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,936
Yes.

640
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,355
Good.

641
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,688
But it won't work.

642
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,484
I mean, it was
a good idea to try it,

643
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,444
but... it won't work.

644
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,946
You have another idea?

645
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,159
I was just thinking
about the problem

646
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,453
with the Doctor's
holographic projectors.

647
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,664
It seems like
the spatial distortions

648
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:27,831
might be interfering

649
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,625
with the projector's
phase alignment.

650
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,251
That was my guess, too.

651
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,752
If that's the case,

652
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,796
I could screen out those
distortions by setting up

653
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,049
a localized damping field
around the projectors.

654
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,468
Is our priority here really
the medical holograph system?

655
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,846
My point is that if
the spatial distortions

656
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,848
are also interfering
with the transmission

657
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,808
we received from
the other ship--

658
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,268
We could set up
a similar field

659
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,645
around our
external sensors

660
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,730
and communicate with them.
Exactly.

661
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,107
And they may know more about
what's going on than we do.

662

00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,826
looking back at you.

706
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,369
And in this case,
we'd be staring up

707
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,329
at the surface
of the event horizon

708
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,873
and seeing a time-delayed
reflection of ourselves.

709
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,124
Are you saying...

710
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,793
we're the ones trapped
in the singularity?

711
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,294
Unfortunately, yes.

712
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,171
You're right. It's the only
theory that explains

713
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,173
everything that's happened
to us. We've probably

714
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,467
been in this singularity since
we felt the first jolt.

715
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,926
PARIS:
Wait a minute, wait.

716
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,637
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

717
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,930
We were cruising along
at warp seven.

718
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,267
Then we pick up a distress call
and moved in to investigate.

719
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,895
But now, you're saying
that the other ship

720
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,438
is actually just
a reflection of us

721
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,441
and that the distress call
is actually

722
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,776
just the Captain's opening hail.

723
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,071
But we picked up
the distress call

724
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,865
<i>before</i> she sent the hail.

725
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,908
How could we have been seeing

726
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,202
a reflection of something
we hadn't even done yet?

727
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,290
Am I making any sense here?

728
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,167
No, but that's okay.

729
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,211
One of the more difficult
concepts to grasp

730
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,629
in temporal mechanics

731
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,048
is that sometimes
effect can precede cause.

732
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,342
A reaction
can be observed

733
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,803
before the action
which initiated it.

734
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,513
So, what do we do to get out?

735
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,806
I'm not sure,

736
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,725
but I do know one thing.

737
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,727
That as we slide deeper
into the singularity,

738
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,104
the spatial distortions
are increasing.

739
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,980
According to my calculations,

740
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,483
within nine hours,
they'll crush the ship.

741
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,151
If your analogy's correct,

742
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,195
how do we get
through that sheet of ice?

743
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,947
Look for a crack.
Or make a crack.

744
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,075
Take something and smack it
into the ice until it buckles.

745
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,453
Wait a minute. What if we've
already made a crack in the ice?

746
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,288
When we first entered
the event horizon.

747
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,706
If we could find
our entry point,

748
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,541
we might be able to slip out
the way we came in.

749
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,127
We'd be looking for a subspace
instability in event horizon.

750
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,296
What would make it show
up on our sensors?

751
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,881
BOTH ( in unison ):
Warp particles.

752
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,091
If we saturate the event horizon
with warp particles,

753
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,635
we might be able to
see them escaping

754
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,763
through the rupture we
made when we entered.

755
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,432
Mr. Tuvok, take the main
deflector off-line.

756
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,726
Mr. Kim, reroute the port
and starboard plasma flow

757
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,977
to the main deflector.

758
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,562
We can use it to
generate a warp field.

759
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,814
Deflectors off-line.

760
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,399
Initializing plasma flow.

761
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,401
Release the warp particles.

762
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:12,365
(<i> suspenseful theme playing )</i>

763
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,201
Scanning the singularity.
Anything?

764
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,369
Not yet.

765
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,538
Warp particles
at full intensity.

766
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,373
I'm picking up something--

767
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,292
a slight irregularity.

768
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,169
It could be a rupture
in the event horizon.

769
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,464
Put it on screen.

770
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,093
It is a rupture, Captain.

771
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,763
It's 50 meters by...

772
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,264
ten meters.

773
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,808
Oh, it's too small.

774
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,143
It must have collapsed since
we first passed through it.

775
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,145
We found the crack. That's the
important thing.

776
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,480
Now, how do we
make it bigger?

777
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,398
Put a wedge in it
and force it open.

778
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,900
We could try
a dekyon beam.

779
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,276
All right,
a dekyon beam.

780
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,112
Mr. Paris,
bring us closer.

781
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,948
Captain, if we get too close
to the rupture,

782
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,157
our warp engines

783
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,826
might make it collapse
even further.

784
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,661
Can we emit
a beam from here?

785
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,705
The rupture's over 50 million
kilometers away.

786
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,207
We don't have enough power to
project a dekyon beam that far.

787
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,125
We'll have to take
a shuttlecraft.

788
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,878
You'll need the best pilot

789
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,546
you've got in that
shuttle, Captain.

790
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,422
That'll be me.

791
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,383
Getting there is
the easy part, Mr. Paris.

792
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,676
We need someone who's familiar

793
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,594
with the finer points
of temporal mechanics,

794
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,722
and unless you've been
hiding your credentials,

795
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,598
I don't think that's you.

796
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,183
B'Elanna, you're with me.

797
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,685
The Bridge is yours,
Commander.

798
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:46,209
We've cleared<i> Voyager.</i>

799
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,461
Shields at
full strength.

800
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,671
We'll reach the rupture

801
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,840
in approximately
four and a half minutes.

802
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,633
Let's get that dekyon beam
on line.

803
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,134
Remodulating
emitters.

804
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,478
Captain... I want
to apologize

805
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,941
for losing my temper.

806
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,817
In your ready room.

807
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,903
I think maybe
you were hitting

808
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,781
a little bit too close
to home, you know?

809
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,533
I respect Chakotay,

810
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,910
but he's wrong.

811
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,746
I'm not officer material
and we both know it.

812
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,750
The truth is, I quit
the Academy because...

813
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,795
I realized I couldn't
make it in Starfleet.

814
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,047
And, believe me, no one
was sorry to see me go.

815
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,551
Professor Chapman was.

816
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,886
What?

817
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,766
He put a letter
in your permanent file

818
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,769
saying that, should you ever
reapply, he would support you.

819
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,104
He thought you were
one of the most

820
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,606
promising cadets
he'd ever taught.

821
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,987
I fought with him
almost every day.

822
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:59,074
I was always questioning his,
his methods, his assumptions,

823
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:02,077
and he was always slapping
me down like some upstart kid.

824
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,746
I was surprised he didn't
help me pack my bags.

825
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,748
Some professors like students

826
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,834
who challenge their assumptions,
B'Elanna.

827
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,295
And so do some captains.

828
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,172
Professor Chapman
wasn't alone.

829
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,466
Many of your teachers
thought you had the potential

830
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,010
to be an outstanding officer.

831
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,263
You had more friends at the
Academy than you realized.

832
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,560
We're 15 kilometers
from the rupture.

833
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,938
Start charging
the dekyon beam.

834
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,107
Dekyon beam on line.

835
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,151
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

836
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,277
Shields down to 62 percent.

837
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,487
Increase speed.

838
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,947
We have to get to that rupture

839
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,658
before these spatial distortions
tear us apart.

840
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,623
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

841
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,209
All right.

842
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,879
Let's open this hole in the ice
a little wider.

843
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,755
Initiate the dekyon beam.

844
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,465
( alarm beeping )

845
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,218
They've widened the rupture
by almost 35 percent.

846
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,220
PARIS:
They'll have to widen it
twice that much

847
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,847
before<i> Voyager</i> can
make it through.

848
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,807
Hold our position.

849
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,601
Mr. Tuvok, report.

850
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,562
The spatial distortions
are increasing.

851
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,147
KIM:
Hull integrity
has dropped

852
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,606
18 percent.

853
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,567
We've widened the opening
by over 65 percent.

854
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,110
I'd like another five
for safety.

855
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,695
We're losing power.

856
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,031
I don't think we're going
to get any more, Captain.

857
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,619
Let's get back to<i> Voyager.</i>

858
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,081
TUVOK:
The shuttle is returning,
Commander.

859
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,332
It appears as though
they've been damaged.

860
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,126
Their com system's down.

861
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,544
I am unable to raise them.

862
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,337
KIM:
The rupture's
now 120 meters

863
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,464
in diameter. That leaves us with
less

864
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,508
than two meters' clearance
on either side.

865
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:45,097
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

866
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:49,101
Mr. Paris, as soon as we've
recovered the shuttlecraft,

867
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,977
lay in a course
toward the rupture

868
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,771
and take us out.

869
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,106
PARIS:
Aye, sir.

870
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,195
(<i> dramatic theme swells</i> )

871
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,199
Well, this is a problem.

872
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,202
JANEWAY:
One of them is
a temporal reflection

873
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,662
but which one?

874
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,748
I'm getting identical readings
from both ships.

875
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:12,999
TORRES:
Captain, the rupture

876
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,375
is starting to
collapse again.

877
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,335
If<i> Voyager</i> doesn't
get through it

878
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,588
within the next five minutes,
they'll never get out.

879
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,924
That means we have one chance
to pick the correct ship.

880
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,842
TORRES:
Simple choice--

881
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,762
port or starboard?

882
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,680
Starboard.
Port.

883
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,060
The port ship is more likely
to be the real one.

884
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,478
It's closer to the rupture.

885
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,773
That means-- That means
they're holding position

886
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,483
as close as they can
to the rupture,

887
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,027
waiting for us to dock
before they head out.

888
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,695
No. It may be closer
to the rupture,

889
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,239
but it's facing
the wrong direction.

890
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,158
The starboard ship is
facing away from us.

891
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,659
That means they're
trying to give us

892
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,994
easy access to the shuttlebay.

893
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,703
There has to be some way
to tell them apart

894
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,580
besides which direction
they're facing.

895
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,000
The starboard ship's thrusters
are at standby.

896
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,459
They're holding position

897
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,504
But the port ship is
moving toward the rupture.

898
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,131
Then I was right.
It's the port ship.

899
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,133
They're heading out.
Don't you see?

900
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,926
<i>Voyager</i> did move
toward the rupture

901
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,886
20 minutes ago when
we first discovered it.

902
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,721
That's why the port
ship is moving

903
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,307
toward it now.

904
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,767
It's a time-delayed reflection
of what we did before.

905
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,602
The starboard ship's
the real one.

906
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,395
They're waiting for us.

907
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,940
If you're wrong...

908
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,611
we're going to have
a long time to debate it.

909
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,780
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

910
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,548
We're ready to dock.

911
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,008
All right.

912
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,259
Cut the thrusters.

913
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,636
Let's see what happens.

914
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,687
( sighs )

915
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,315
Feels like
a real ship to me.

916
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,774
Let's get back
to the Bridge.

917
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,447
Commander Chakotay, report.

918
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,034
We're almost to the rupture.
Mr. Paris is about to impress us

919
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,702
with his piloting skills.

920
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,121
The rupture's collapsing.
It's down to 110 meters wide.

921
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,249
That's too narrow.
We're not going to make it.

922
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,630
In command school, they taught
us to always remember

923
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,676
that maneuvering a starship
is a very delicate process,

924
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,764
but over the years,
I've learned that sometimes

925
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,101
you just have to punch
your way through.

926
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:40,813
Mr. Paris, full impulse power.

927
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,943
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

928
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,362
Shields are down.

929
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,155
( crew chattering )

930
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,532
I'm losing power
to the port impulse engine.

931
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,909
Switching to auxiliary power.

932
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,453
Hull integrity failing.

933
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,081
Keep it together, Mr. Paris.

934
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,836
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

935
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,009
We've cleared
the event horizon, Captain.

936
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,844
We've returned
to normal space.

937
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,471
PARIS:
"Sometimes you just have

938
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,223
to punch your way through."

939
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,892
I'll have to remember that one.

940
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,727
JANEWAY:
Set a course.

941
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,562
I want to be at least
100 million kilometers

942
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,399
away from the singularity
before we begin repairs.

943
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,164
There they are-- your staff.

944
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,044
I'll try not to break
any of their noses.

945
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,797
First order of the day:

946
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,715
The Captain wants
the warp drive

947
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,009
back on line
by 1300 hours.

948
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,551
1300?
That's impossible.

949
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,762
Then maybe you need
to go break a few noses,

950
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,474
or at least... bend a few.

951
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,227
Lieutenant.

952
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,152
All right.

953
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,112
Get that isolinear bank
up and running,

954
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,073
and lock down
those plasma relays.

955
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,869
Please.

956
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:27,295
I'm going to be counting on you,
Lieutenant.

957
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:31,174
I'm not up-to-date on
the latest Starfleet protocols

958
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,801
and I know that you're
probably more familiar

959
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,970
with the quirks
of this warp engine

960
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,805
than I am right now.

961
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,600
I<i> hope...</i>
that I can depend on you.

962
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,897
I assure you, you'll never get
less than my best.

963
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,860
Lieutenant...

964
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,281
congratulations.

965
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,242
Welcome aboard.

966

(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

967
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,591
Are you checking up
on your new Chief Engineer?

968
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,301
Observing.

969
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,762
And?

970
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,347
Two crew members
have already

971
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,433
filed complaints
about her promotion,

972
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:25,603
and she may be in for
a tough period of adjustment,

973
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,146
but I think B'Elanna's
going to make

974
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,065
a fine addition
to this crew.

975
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,945
<i>Our</i> crew.

976
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,322
Can I ask you a question...

977
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,408
off the record?

978
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,659
If things had happened
differently

979
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,122
and we were on the Maquis
ship now instead of<i> Voyager,</i>

980
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,082
would you have served under me?

981
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,379
One of the nice things
about being Captain

982
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,006
is that you can keep
some things to yourself.

983
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,218
DOCTOR ( over intercom ):
<i>Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.</i>

984
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,595
Go ahead.

985
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:00,305
<i>Is someone ever going</i>
<i>to come down here</i>

986
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,181
<i>and fix</i>
<i>my holographic projectors?</i>

987
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,682
We're a little busy
right now, Doctor,

988
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,977
<i>but I'll send a crew down</i>
<i>as soon as I can.</i>

989
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,813
I would appreciate a certain
expediency in the matter.

990
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:12,233
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Janeway out.</i>

991
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,901
I'm sorry, Lieutenant
but whatever it is,

992
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,903
you're going to have
to take care of it yourself.

993
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,449
Oh, it's all right.
It's just a scratch, really.

994
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:20,908
