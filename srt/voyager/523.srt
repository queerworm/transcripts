1
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,176
Good morning!
Morning.

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,928
Requisition reports
for the week.

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,513
Thanks.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,639
What can you tell me

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,098
about the Great
Wall of China?

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,517
Pardon?

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,102
The Great Wall of China,
on Earth. Who built it?

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,312
The Chinese.

9
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,856
What for?

10
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,482
Why does anybody build a wall?
To keep people out.

11
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,733
Deck 1.

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,402
In fact, it was
the first Qin emperor

13
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,071
who connected the walls
built by a previous dynasty.

14
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,825
He did it to prevent an invasion
by nomads to the north.

15
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,201
How big is it?

16
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,953
I have a feeling
you're going to tell me.

17
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,956
2,400 kilometers long,
median width 3.8 meters.

18
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,541
Before the 22nd century,

19
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,584
it was one of the
only manmade objects

20
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,085
that could be seen
from Earth's orbit

21
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,254
with the naked eye.
Very impressive, Neelix.

22
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,174
I had no idea you knew so much
about my homeworld.

23
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,677
Status?

24
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,387
We're on a course
for the class-Y cluster.

25
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,805
We should be there
in about three days.

26
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,348
Gives us some time
to relax. Carry on.

27
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,809
Why this sudden interest
in the Great Wall?

28
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,936
I've been studying
Earth landmarks.

29
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,730
Mr. Paris and I
have been exchanging

30
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,523
a little cross-cultural
trivia.

31
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,775
He's become quite an expert
on Talaxian geography.

32
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,610
All right,
here's one for you.

33
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,279
What can you tell me
about the Millennium Gate?

34
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,491
The Millennium Gate--
Constructed in the 21st century

35
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,117
in the United States of America.

36
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,995
It was another
one of the objects

37
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,955
that could be seen from orbit.

38
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,041
Uh, 3.2 kilometers at the base.

39
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,500
One kilometer in height.

40
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,752
Surface covered with

41
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,587
highly reflective
solar panels.

42
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,338
A self-contained
ecosystem.

43
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,008
It became a model for
the first colony on Mars.

44
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,053
Did you know that one of
my ancestors built it?

45
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,220
Really?

46
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,056
Not with a hammer
and nails,

47
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,307
but with words and
a lot of courage.

48
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,101
Shannon O'Donnel, one of
the first woman astronauts--

49
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,521
She was the driving force
behind the project.

50
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,147
That's something
to be proud of.

51
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,524
We were always told stories

52
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,735
about her at family
gatherings--

53
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,738
"The first of a long line
of Janeway explorers."

54
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,114
Tell me more.

55
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,201
I want something
to stump Mr. Paris with.

56
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,494
Where to begin?

57
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,704
The Millennium Gate.

58
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,581
How did she get
involved with that?

59
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,125
Well, at that time, she was
still in the space program,

60
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,294
but she'd also become something
of an entrepreneur.

61
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,213
I believe she was asked
to join the project

62
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,966
by the Governor of Indiana.

63
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,510
He wanted her expertise on
recyclic life-support systems.

64
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,471
The way my Aunt Martha
tells it,

65
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,223
they flew her in
on a private aircraft.

66
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,857
5:00 am, December 27, 2000.

67
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,193
I'm in the great state
of... Indiana, I think.

68
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:36,364
I saw the world's largest ball
of string this morning

69
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,119
and the world's largest
beefsteak tomato this afternoon.

70
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,121
It was the size
of a Volkswagen--

71
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,206
The string, not the tomato.

72
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,208
At least Christmas is over.

73
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,961
(<i> engine knocking</i> )

74
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,047
(<i> groaning</i> ):
Oh, no...

75
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,769
Excuse me.
I think I made a wrong turn.

76
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,021
Is there a Millennium Gate
around here?

77
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,397
You're looking at it.

78
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,191
The sign said
"Gas, Food, Lodging."

79
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,442
I need all three.

80
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,278
You won't find
any of that here.

81
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,697
Get back on the interstate
and go to Exit Nine.

82
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,241
I don't think
I'm going to make it.

83
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,826
Good luck.

84
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:30,330
Tell me, are people a little
friendlier off Exit Nine?

85
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,374
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Oh, no.

86
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,592
You stopped.

87
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,178
You didn't.

88
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,013
You got a pen?

89
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,388
I... I just
didn't see you.

90
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,224
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

91
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,475
Insurance?

92
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
Not really.

93
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,978
"Not really"?

94
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,688
It ran out.

95
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,648
Oh, it's not too bad.

96
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,984
200 bucks ought
to cover it.

97
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,360
200 bucks?

98
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,656
Let me guess--
The money ran out too.

99
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,285
(<i> sighs</i> )

100
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,443
Hi.

101
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,945
Hi.

102
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,654
The sign said "open"?

103
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,365
Yes, that's right.

104
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,700
Till 6:00.

105
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,161
Can we be of assistance?

106
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,290
It's cold outside, and I-I
wondered if I could wait here.

107
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,250
For what?

108
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,668
For the tow truck.
My car broke down.

109
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,130
I'm trying to get to Florida.

110
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,632
She doesn't look like
a corporate hit man.

111
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,761
I assure you I'm not...
at least not anymore.

112
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:54,724
Well, in any case, she's unarmed
and chilled to the bone.

113
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,143
(<i> chuckles</i> )

114
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,270
I think we can handle her.

115
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,273
Zeus himself
watched over travelers.

116
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,817
We should follow his example.

117
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,110
Make yourself at home.

118
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,403
Thank you.

119
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,744
Where's your car?
Down the street

120
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,121
next to the coffee shop...

121
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,580
or what used to be
the coffee shop.

122
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,583
It looks like this whole town
is closed down.

123
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,835
It is.

124
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,296
Except for you, huh?

125
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,672
This ship will
never sink.

126
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,382
Right, Dad?

127
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,675
Decaf.

128
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,013
Not exactly
the nectar of the gods.

129
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,265
It'll do. Thank you.

130
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,187
What's this about,
if I may ask?

131
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,396
Preserving the past.

132
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,190
I'm Jason,
by the way.

133
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,066
Shannon O'Donnel.

134
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,777
I'm Henry...
Henry Janeway.

135
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,280
Hi. So you're trying
to get them

136
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,158
to stop building
this millennium whatever-it-is?

137
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,327
The Millennium Gate,
the world's first

138
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,037
self-sustaining
civic environment.

139
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,705
That's what
the propaganda calls it.

140
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,249
It's nothing
but hype.

141
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,960
It's actually
a glorified shopping mall.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,171
They've talked
all of my neighbors

143
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,922
into selling their businesses.

144
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,175
Only one thing stands
in their way.

145
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,928
You're the last holdout?

146
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,390
This time,
Rome withstands the barbarians.

147
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,237
I may be able
to help you

148
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,113
if you'd be willing
to hire me.

149
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,907
Believe me, you don't want
to be licking stamps

150
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,158
for the next two days.

151
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,743
We could do all this
on a computer.

152
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,995
Yeah, but my dad doesn't
believe in computers.

153
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,330
We don't even have one.

154
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,457
Well, I do. We can e-mail
every computer

155
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,624
within a hundred
miles.

156
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,293
It'll just take
a few hours.

157
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,254
It's easy.

158
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,631
I'm not hiring anybody
right now.

159
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,468
Besides, you're going
to Florida.

160
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,812
Uh... maybe the tow
truck is waiting.

161
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,983
Thanks for
the coffee.

162
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,402
You're welcome.

163
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,088
I wouldn't ask you for a lot;
just enough to fix the car.

164
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,466
I really...

165
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:36,261
I kind of need
a job right now.

166
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,845
Dad?

167
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,894
I suppose we could use
some help.

168
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,533
You do believe in electricity,
don't you?

169
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,538
Yeah!

170
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,206
All right!

171
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,505
So who are these
"barbarians," anyway?

172
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,381
A company
down in Texas.

173
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,715
Well, why come here?

174
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,469
The city fathers
made it easy for them--

175
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,472
Free building permits,
deferred taxes, new roads--

176
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,641
So the invaders,
they return the favor.

177
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,769
They have offered us 20 percent
above the market price

178
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,396
for our properties.

179
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,897
You know what
the catch is?

180
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,358
We've all got to sell.

181
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,567
Everybody must love you.

182
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,943
Hmm, yeah.

183
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,903
The people I knew
when I was growing up--

184
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,032
Family friends-- It seems like
they've all turned against me.

185
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,536
If this were Roman times,
they'd feed me to the lions.

186
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,703
To the good old days.

187
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,873
You know, I was born
in the wrong millennium.

188
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,125
I'll stick with the modern age.
The classical age--

189
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,586
Greatest literature
mankind ever produced.

190
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,962
No antibiotics.

191
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,922
Families would take
care of one another.

192
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,132
No cars.

193
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,426
Air you can breathe.
No telephones.

194
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,761
What a pleasure.
Shorter life spans.

195
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,305
Lives that were
worth living.

196
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,391
No cold beer.

197
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,269
There you got me.

198
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,979
Speaking of the modern age,

199
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,066
do you have any plans
for the Millennium Eve?

200
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,193
No different than
last year's Millennium Eve.

201
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,403
I plan to be asleep.

202
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,029
Life of the party.

203
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,490
Don't tell me you bought
into all that hype again.

204
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,908
Oh, maybe
just a little.

205
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,494
Last year, when 2000 arrived?

206
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,954
Everyone was convinced
it was the dawn of a new era.

207
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,290
But when the world didn't end
and flying saucers didn't land,

208
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,044
and the Y2K bug didn't turn on
a single light bulb,

209
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,589
you'd think everybody would have
realized it was a number on a
calendar.

210
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,883
But, oh, no, they had to listen
to all those hucksters

211
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,177
who told them the real
millennium was 2001.

212
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,431
So this New Year's Eve
will be as boring as last year.

213
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,848
Come to think of it,

214
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,351
I have sold an awful
lot of doomsday books.

215
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,768
See what I mean?

216
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,022
So, what's in Florida?

217
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,691
I have a cousin down there.

218
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,527
I'll stay with her for a while
until I can get back on my feet.

219
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,529
If you don't
mind my asking,

220
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,740
did you lose your job?

221
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,076
I'm in a transitional period.

222
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,620
From what to what?

223
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,748
From what I was doing
to what I'm going to do.

224
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,876
Your son tells me
that your bookstore's

225
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,211
belonged in your family
for generations--

226
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,837
That you've never done
anything else.

227
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,550
Yes, that's right.
You know, I'm just the opposite.

228
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,303
I love to see places
I've never been,

229
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,638
try new things...

230
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,347
I'm kind of an explorer.

231
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,932
Really?

232
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,976
Hmm. That station
wagon of yours

233
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,395
doesn't exactly look
like a sailing ship.

234
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,021
It's a rocket ship.

235
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,357
My mistake.

236
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,926
We have every intention

237
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,345
of breaking ground
on Monday,

238
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,638
Day One
of the next millennium.

239
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,888
The people of this town

240
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,349
have given us
their full cooperation.

241
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,100
That's not true!

242
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,144
If you'll let me
finish, Mr. Janeway.

243
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,188
With the exception
of Mr. Janeway here.

244
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,398
Mr. Janeway, would
you like to comment?

245
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,776
Yes. Yes, I would.

246
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,778
You-you just can't...

247
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,613
you can't bulldoze
this town away.

248
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,615
This-this is our heritage!
This is our past!

249
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,116
We're trying to give
Portage Creek a future.

250
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,410
Can't you see that?
Yeah, yeah. Your future!

251
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,079
Your future! Not ours!

252
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,707
Mr. Moss, we've heard
that you're considering

253
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,416
moving the project to one
of your alternate sites.

254
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,751
Can you shed any light
on that rumor?

255
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,628
I'm afraid that's
more than a rumor.

256
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,505
If we can't work
out an arrangement
in Portage Creek,

257
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,131
we'll have no choice but
to select another location.

258
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,258
REPORTER: What city?
MOSS: No comment.

259
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,844
REPORTER:
Is it true that
Canton, Ohio,

260
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,261
has been chosen
for the alter...?

261
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,013
Thank you for your time.
Thank you, Mr. Moss.

262
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,640
Well, that's that.

263
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,851
All we have to do is stand
firm till New Year's.

264
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,644
Easy for you to say.

265
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,229
I have to go to school
with their kids.

266
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,605
Your school is one
of the first places

267
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,273
they're going
to tear down.

268
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,609
They said they'd build
a new one-- A better one.

269
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,820
Whose side
are you on?

270
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,156
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,243
We're all in
this together.

272
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,452
Come on.

273
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,538
Let's head back to civilization.

274
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,884
Where shall we dine
tonight?

275
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,888
Ah, how does Paris sound?

276
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,305
It's Friday night.

277
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,599
Can we get
a reservation?

278
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,225
Well, I think
I can arrange it.

279
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,643
I know the maitre d'.

280
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,645
Too bad I don't
speak French.

281
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,982
Well, we'll keep
it to ourselves.

282
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,780
There.

283
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,533
To new friends.

284
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,368
And a gracious host.

285
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,787
Bon appétit.

286
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,207
I wouldn't mind
visiting Paris one day.

287
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,626
Yes, it would be nice.

288
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,001
You haven't been?

289
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,921
I haven't been
outside Indiana.

290
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,172
These are my
traveling companions.

291
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,258
They'll take me
anywhere anytime.

292
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,509
It's not such a bad idea

293
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,761
to experience
the real thing

294
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,138
every now and then.
I prefer my books.

295
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,182
Maybe you just never
had the right guide.

296
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,559
Is that an offer?

297
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,855
I could make
a similar argument.

298
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,106
Not such a bad idea

299
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,317
to settle down
every now and then.

300
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,777
Is that an offer?

301
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,824
You're a peculiar man,
Mr. Janeway--

302
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,576
Cloistered away
with all your books...

303
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,035
shutting out the world...

304
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,663
Any more
peculiar than

305
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,916
exploring the Midwest
in an ailing station wagon?

306
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,584
Only slightly.

307
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,836
(<i> chuckling</i> )

308
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,671
Any word on my car?

309
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,923
It's got a brand-new oil pan.

310
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,676
You forgot to tell me that.

311
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,052
Well, we were busy today.

312
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,472
It's parked behind the garage--
Whenever you're ready.

313
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,391
First thing in the morning.

314
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,977
Not so fast.

315
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,228
Jason told me you promised
to show him a few tricks

316
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,939
on the computer.

317
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,651
I could use
another day of rest.

318
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,861
Great.

319
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,570
Jason'll be pleased.

320
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,907
And when you're done with him,

321
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,995
perhaps we'll take a stroll
along the Boulevard St. Germain.

322
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,749
You're making it difficult
to say goodbye.

323
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,377
Maybe that's the idea.

324
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,477
You wished to
see me, Captain?

325
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,521
I need your help
with this--

326
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,314
The Millennium Gate.

327
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,774
Impressive.

328
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,526
It was built by one
of my ancestors

329
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,361
over 300 years ago.

330
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,654
I've been
digging through

331
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,823
the historical
database,

332
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,366
but a lot of the information
from that era

333
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,159
has been lost or damaged.
I thought you might be able

334
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,413
to help me
reconstruct some of it.

335
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,499
Is this relevant to
our present mission?

336
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,125
It's relevant to me.

337
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,923
This ancestor of yours is
15 generations removed.

338
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,884
You only possess
a small fraction of
her genetic material.

339
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,134
Insignificant.

340
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,095
This isn't about
chromosomes, Seven.

341
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,722
It's about character.

342
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,600
Explain.

343
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,562
Shannon O'Donnel
inspired me

344
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,188
when I was a girl.

345
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,148
She had a...

346
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,193
an influence
on my imagination...

347
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,987
on my goals.

348
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,238
I never realized

349
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,491
genealogy could
have such an impact.

350
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,327
I wouldn't have become
a Starfleet Captain

351
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,996
if it wasn't for her.

352
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,373
Temple of Artemis
at Ephesus.

353
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,792
That's four.

354
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,167
The Colossus of Rhodes.

355
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,586
No, in chronological
order.

356
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,879
Right. Uh...

357
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,965
The Mausoleum
of Halicarnassus.

358
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,340
The Colossus
of Rhodes.

359
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,093
That leaves
just one more.

360
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,763
The seventh wonder of
the ancient world is...

361
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,432
Uh-huh. Can't remember?

362
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,725
Oh, it's right...

363
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,268
right on the tip
of my tongue.

364
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,479
It... la...

365
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,939
Forget it. I give up.

366
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,774
Ha! I got you.

367
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,484
It's the, uh...

368
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,360
Uh...

369
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,195
Can't remember?

370
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,031
The Lighthouse
of Alexandria

371
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,117
built by Ptolemy II
in 280 BC.

372
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,661
Behold the wonder
of the modern world--

373
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,203
Borg photographic memory.

374
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,289
We'll call this one a draw.

375
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,501
Brushing up on Earth's history?

376
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,294
Captain Janeway
requested that

377
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,379
I research one
of her ancestors.

378
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,007
Shannon O'Donnel.

379
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,382
You've heard of her?

380
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,217
Who hasn't?

381
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,261
You mind
if I lend a hand?

382
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,680
If you wish.

383
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,519
Sven "Buttercup" Hansen.

384
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,646
He was one of
my progenitors--

385
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,439
A 22nd century
prizefighter.

386
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,274
The Captain
encouraged me

387
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,610
to investigate my
genealogy, as well.

388
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,822
Well, your ancestors can
tell you a lot about yourself.

389
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,825
Somehow, I doubt "Buttercup"
has much relevance to me.

390
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,870
The connection could
be deeper than you think.

391
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,622
"Sven"... "Seven."

392
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,207
A coincidence.

393
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,250
The point is,
there's some of him in you,

394
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,129
just as there'll be some
of you in your descendants.

395
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,381
If I choose
to procreate.

396
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,300
Well, I wouldn't
dismiss it so lightly.

397
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,427
Someday, you might
enjoy a little

398
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,263
Seven of Nine point five
running around.

399
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,558
Or not. Or not.

400
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,018
My research
has failed.

401
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,228
I've found no references
to this individual.

402
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,647
Well, genealogy's
a lot like fishing--

403
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,400
You've... you've
got to cast a wide net.

404
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,903
Uh... computer,
expand record search

405
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,779
for subject
Shannon O'Donnel

406
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,323
to include
non-Federation databases,

407
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,283
personal archives,

408
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,244
and photographic
indexes, as well.

409
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,914
COMPUTER:
<i>Reference found.</i>

410
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,832
Take a look at this.

411
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,876
NEELIX:
Shannon Janeway.

412
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,294
Where in the world
did you find this?

413
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,047
NEELIX:
A Ferengi
database.

414
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,256
Ferengi?

415
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,466
11 years ago,
one of their historians

416
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,301
collected massive
amounts of data

417
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,054
about the origin
of space travel

418
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,471
in the Federation.

419
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,681
He wanted
to market it

420
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,058
as a nostalgic
gift item.

421
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,935
I would have been
his first customer.

422
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,812
It's a handsome family, Captain.

423
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,355
These must be her sons

424
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,983
and daughters...
grandchildren...

425
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,443
Great-grandchildren.

426
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,486
I've also discovered
journalistic accounts

427
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,905
in the historical
archives--

428
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,782
Mostly articles
concerning resistance

429
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,200
to the Millennium Gate.

430
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,285
The whole town
was against her.

431
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,580
Download this image for me,
will you, Neelix?

432
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,249
I'm going to frame it.

433
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,583
Yes, Captain.

434
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,293
The citizens of Canton, Ohio,

435
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,254
greeted Millennium Gate
representatives

436
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:37,546
with a small parade today.

437
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,339
Canton is one of three

438
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,968
<i>alternate sites now being</i>
<i>considered by gate officials.</i>

439
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,720
<i>Vowing not to bow to pressure,</i>

440
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,225
<i>Henry Janeway, owner of Portage</i>
<i>Creek's Alexandria Books,</i>

441
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,394
<i>says he has no intention</i>
<i>of closing down.</i>

442
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,688
<i>Marci Collins,</i>
<i>Channel Three news.</i>

443
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,151
"Next stop, Mars."

444
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,112
I used to be in
media relations with NASA.

445
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,657
As I recall, your class
came up with that slogan.

446
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,325
Do you mind?

447
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,624
It's a shame
you didn't make the cut.

448
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,251
Not good enough,
I guess.

449
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,503
Do you still keep in touch
with any of the others?

450
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,796
No.
I do.

451
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,339
In fact, I made
a few calls last night.

452
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,842
Remember Lieutenant McMillan?

453
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,552
How's she doing?

454
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,139
Copilot on a joint mission
with the Europeans

455
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,556
scheduled for '03.

456
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,391
Four months
on the space station.

457
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,314
Not bad for a girl
with claustrophobia.

458
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,690
She got over it.

459
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,858
Sorry to hear

460
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,358
about your last job.

461
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,903
All this downsizing
in aerospace...

462
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,324
Engineers aren't given
the respect they deserve.

463
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:49,493
Who told you I lost my job?

464
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,995
I made a few calls.

465
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,413
You don't have
to live like this--

466
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,209
Borrowing money,
sleeping in your car...

467
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,128
You've got no business
checking up on me.

468
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,547
Actually, I do.

469
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,800
We run a history
on all our candidates.

470
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,220
Are you trying to make me
some kind of an offer?

471
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,223
We know you've been working
closely with Henry Janeway.

472
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,932
He'll listen to you.

473
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,352
Oh.

474
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,394
You want me to talk to him--

475
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,480
Get him to change his mind.

476
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,982
If you can.

477
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,317
And in return?

478
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,152
We'd give you a job--

479
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,113
Make you a consulting engineer
on the project.

480
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,574
You certainly have
the credentials.

481
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,078
Well?

482
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,916
I'll think about it.

483
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,751
Think quickly.

484
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,545
We can't wait
another thousand years.

485
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,313
MISSION CONTROL:
Roger that and go ahead.

486
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:03,276
NEIL ARMSTRONG:
That's one small step for man...

487
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,821
one giant leap for mankind.

488
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,042
(<i> keyboard keys clicking</i> )

489
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:24,964
Morning.

490
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,425
Morning.
I didn't think you'd mind.

491
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,176
You've got some really
great games on this thing.

492
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,552
Don't worry about it.

493
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,221
Have you tried Matrix of Doom?

494
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,640
Uh, yeah. I got vaporized
on level six.

495
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,559
Try launching a flare before
you enter the steel fortress.

496
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,103
Cool.

497
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,438
Coffee?

498
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,688
Please.

499
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,316
Where is your father?

500
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,483
Bloomington. All the suppliers
in town are boycotting us,

501
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,445
so he went up there
to place some orders.

502
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:50,072
He left you in charge?
Alexandria Books.

503
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,489
May I help you?

504
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,534
Sounds like
you've got it down.

505
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,287
I pay the bills too.

506
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,831
Dad's not very
good at accounting.

507
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,124
You have any kids?

508
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,459
Nope.

509
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,419
Not a priority?

510
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,004
I wouldn't say that.

511
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,922
I just never got around to it.

512
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,632
If you don't mind me asking...

513
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,925
where's your mom?

514
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,677
She died.

515
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,097
Oh. I'm sorry.

516
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,640
I was really young.

517
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,976
I don't remember her much.

518
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,687
Dad says none of
the great heroes

519
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,814
grew up in a
nuclear family.

520
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,442
Hercules, Achilles,
Odysseus--

521
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,236
They all grew up
with single parents.

522
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,155
You're in good company.

523
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,990
You like working here, Jason?

524
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,242
It's okay.

525
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,036
You know, I get the feeling

526
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,413
you don't share
your father's enthusiasm

527
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,081
about preserving the past.

528
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,292
I don't know.

529
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:47,838
The Millennium Gate
could be pretty cool.

530
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,424
Did you ever see the first
landing on the moon?

531
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,468
"One small step for man..."

532
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,721
They showed it in
science class one time.

533
00:25:55,721 --> 00:26:00,100
I saw it on TV
when I was 11 years old.

534
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,768
The whole world watched it.

535
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,645
It must have been great.

536
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,897
Oh...

537
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,190
it was.

538
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:11,153
So do you have any heroes?

539
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,780
"We are not living
in a heroic age."

540
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,449
That's what my dad says.

541
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,993
Come on, there's
got to be somebody.

542
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,080
Dad.

543
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,873
I mean, he's a pain
sometimes, but...

544
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,375
he's pretty cool.

545

546
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,212

547
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,505
May I help you?

548
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,426
That's all right.

549
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,514
First call in three days
and it's a wrong number.

bringing much-needed supplies
to the embattled city of Troy.

00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,448
Hey, Dad--

555
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,950
You're famous.

556
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,617
"Local business owner

557
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,869
Let it fall.

558
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,246
Any customers this morning?

559
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,914
No one here but
us galliforms.

560
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,666
That's "chickens" for the
nonscientists in the crowd.

561
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,294
You two are dangerous together.

562
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,920
Portage Creek will
thank us one day.

563
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,630
You don't sacrifice history
for a shopping mall.

564
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,550
It's a little more
than that, Henry.

565
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,759
I beg your pardon?

566
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,553
I said it's not
just a mall.

567
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,055
Have you read
the "promotional
literature"?

568
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,475
"Over 600 retail
spaces available.

569
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,185
Franchise potential."

570
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,812
There's a commercial
dimension to the project,

571
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,355
but that's not
its only function.

572
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,608
What's your point?
I've learned a few details

573
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,650
about the Millennium Gate.

574
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,654
It's a self-sustaining city,
an experimental biosphere.

575
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,365
It's never been done before.

576
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,867
What's wrong with the biosphere
we're living in now?

577
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,495
Nothing.
Exactly.

578
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,121
But this project
will help scientists

579
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,789
learn more about
our environment--

580
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,124
Possibly even recreate it
on other worlds.

581
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,750
Other worlds?

582
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,710
Don't we have enough problems
on the one we're on?

583
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,755
Yeah. Which is why I'd like
to get the hell off it one day.

584
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,090
I think
you're taking

585
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,842
this exploring
a little too far.

586
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,552
And you're so afraid of change,

587
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,929
you can barely walk
out that front door.

588
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,267
The Millennium Gate
has a lot of potential, Henry.

589
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,560
You just can't see it.

590
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,145
All you can see
is these books.

591
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,647
You're living in the past.

592
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:12,566
Sounds like you've been
sleeping with the enemy.

593
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,319
Having a beer, anyway.

594
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,404
Moss.

595
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,864
He offered me a job.

596
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,282
Doing what?

597
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,492
Consulting engineer.

598
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,160
On the Millennium Gate.

599
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,786
I said I'd think about it.

600
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,288
And he said, "Get Janeway

601
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,998
to sign on the dotted
line and you're hired."

602
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,125
That's one way
of looking at it.

603
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,793
And when I say no,
then what?

604
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,962
You're going to go
with them, right?

605
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,674
To Canton, Ohio,
or the Third Circle of Hell

606
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,801
or wherever it is they decide
to build this damn thing.

607
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,803
I can't keep living
out of my car.

608
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,181
You don't have to. Stay here.
No.

609
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,683
Why not?
Because I can't.

610
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,059
That's not a reason.

611
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,311
Because I don't want to.

612
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,439
You've been really
nice to me, Henry,

613
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,940
but I can't get stuck here.

614
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,401
"Stuck"?

615
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,610
Like me?

616
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,861
I didn't say that.

617
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,572
You can live
however you want to.

618
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,156
And so can you.

619
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,662
What's going on?

620
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,830
We're helping our guest
resume her journey.

621
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,709
But I thought you were
staying here for a while.

622
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,044
Something came up.
We can manage by ourselves.

623
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,214
I guess saying good-bye isn't
that difficult after all.

624
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,976
Jason.

625
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,811
Jason, where you going?

626
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,146
Aunt Pat's.

627
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,190
Happy New Year.

628
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,617
Jason!

629
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,120
Jason!

630
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,713
It was around 2210.

631
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,798
My Uncle Jack was on
a deep space mission

632
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,383
to Beta Capricus.

633
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,553
That's when "deep space"
meant the next star over.

634
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,431
And that was when they still
had to go into stasis.

635
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,517
So Jack put his crew under
as soon as they left orbit

636
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,061
and piloted the ship
by himself for six months.

637
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,439
No contact with anybody
along the way?

638
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,107
There wasn't anybody
along the way.

639
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,400
Not back then.

640
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,068
The transmitter
wasn't even subspace.

641
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,613
It took weeks to get
a message back to Earth.

642
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,863
I would prefer stasis.

643
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,240
PARIS:
Me too.
That long alone,

644
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,451
I'd probably go
a little batty.

645
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,328
So six months
to Beta Capricus

646
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,081
and when they finally arrive...
there's nothing there.

647
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,417
No planets?

648
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,002
No. No star, no nothing.

649
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,213
It turns out Beta Capricus
was just an EM echo

650
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,423
of a distant galaxy.

651
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,175
What was his
course of action?

652
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,468
What else could he do?

653
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,553
He turned the ship around
and headed home.

654
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,347
And the crew?

655
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,016
He figured there was
no reason to bother them.

656
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,393
There's nothing to see,
nothing to do,

657
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,021
so six months later
he gets back to Earth,

658
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,773
brings everybody
out of stasis

659
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:01,067
and they wake up wondering
why they haven't left orbit.

660
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,319
(<i> door chimes</i> )

661
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,363
Come in.

662
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,574
Oh. I didn't realize
you were in a briefing.

663
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,910
Not at all. We're talking
about our family histories.

664
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,746
Oh. This can wait.

665
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,164
May I... join you?

666
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,708
Please.

667
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,502
I, too, come
from a distinguished line.

668
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,714
His cousin's
an electric shaver.

669
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:25,551
Hardly. My program was compiled
from the most advanced

670
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,636
holo-matrices in
the Federation.

671
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,514
My cousin was a prize-winning
chess program.

672
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,765
Ensign Paris,

673
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:32,932
you have yet
to elaborate

674
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,267
on your
family origins.

675
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,563
Well, they were
a pretty ordinary bunch,

676
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,981
salt-of-the-earth
type people.

677
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,569
Farmers, mostly,
some planetary colonists...

678
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,530
but there was one--
He was a pilot.

679
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,409
He flew the first orbital glider
over the lower Martian plateau.

680
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,869
Mars.

681
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,580
Your ancestor must
have known the Captain's.

682
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,374
She did work
on all the early Mars projects.

683
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,835
Looks like we go way back,
Mr. Paris.

684
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,755
What was her name?
Shannon O'Donnel.

685
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,882
O'Donnel...

686
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,842
Um...

687
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,761
I don't think so.

688
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,178
What do you mean?

689
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,849
I know all the Mars
projects from the 1970s on--

690
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,602
Unmanned, manned, who's who...

691
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,730
there were no O'Donnels
in any of them.

692
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,114
(<i> door chimes</i> )

693
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,365
JANEWAY:
Come in.

694
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,825
Ship's status report.

695
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,285
Let me guess.

696
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,536
The holographic engineer

697
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,663
is having problems
with her program;

698
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,875
Neelix, the Cardassian
cook, is low on supplies;

699
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,168
Seven of 12 is regenerating

700
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,464
and Captain Chakotay
is doing just fine.

701
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,300
Just wondering how they'll
piece together our lives

702
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,760
a few hundred years from now.

703
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,428
Depends on
how big the pieces are.

704
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,179
A padd here,
a Captain's log there,

705
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,181
maybe a couple of
holodeck programs.

706
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,310
It won't be as much to
go on as we might think.

707
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,270
I've gone through
dozens of histories

708
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,272
written about
21st century Earth.

709
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,983
All of them biased
in one way or another.

710
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,235
The Vulcans describe
first contact

711
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,279
with a "savagely
illogical" race.

712
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,074
Ferengi talk about
Wall Street as if
it were holy ground.

713
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,660
The Bolians express dismay

714
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,496
at the low quality
of human plumbing.

715
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,415
And human historians--
Exact same story.

716
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,542
Every culture saw it
a different way.

717
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,294
So I go back to
the raw material--

718
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,379
Birth certificates,
death certificates

719
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,381
marriage certificates,
census surveys,

720
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,801
voter registration forms,
housing records,

721
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,219
medical, employment...
court records.

722
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,597
It's all fragmented
and incomplete.

723
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,976
So... did she exist?

724
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,770
Her name was Shannon O'Donnel.

725
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,982
She did train to be
an astronaut...

726
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,025
but she didn't finish.

727
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,944
She was an engineer...

728
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,613
but never worked on
the Mars missions.

729
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,615
Did she work
on the Millennium Gate?

730
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,576
Only as a consultant.

731
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,829
What about all the opposition
you spoke of?

732
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,540
You said she fought
to get the project underway.

733
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,458
There was no opposition.

734
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,086
In fact, the Millennium Gate
was greeted with open arms

735
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,840
by the local population...

736
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,092
except for one man.

737
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,594
"Henry Janeway."

738
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,056
She married him...
and changed her name,

739
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,893
but she certainly
never changed history.

740
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,310
Don't be too hard on her.

741
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,854
She may not have known

742
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,023
she was supposed to live up
to your expectations.

743
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,566
Oh, I'll get over it.

744
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,861
But the question is:
When we get back to Earth,

745
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,031
how will I break the news
to Aunt Martha?

746
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,492
With less
than three hours to go,

747
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,578
Henry Janeway still refuses
to cooperate

748
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,329
with Millennium Gate
representatives.

749
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:45,250
<i>I'll return with live updates</i>
<i>as midnight approaches.</i>

750
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,293
<i>Marci Collins,</i>
<i>Channel Three news.</i>

751
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,713
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This has been</i>
<i>a Channel Three Special Report.</i>

752
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:52,257
I don't suppose there's any
chance he'll change his mind.

753
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,802
By midnight? Doubtful.
Then it looks like

754
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,303
we'll have to
scrub the launch.

755
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,138
At least where Portage
Creek is concerned.

756
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,767
It's a shame how one ignorant
man can stand in the way

757
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,977
of progress.
It's not that simple.

758
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,104
Henry's a very likable guy,

759
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,356
but he's playing
for the wrong team.

760
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,983
He's looking back.

761
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,652
This town needs people who
look towards the future.

762
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,404
Well, while you're
looking forward,

763
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,864
I'll be driving to Florida.

764
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,365
Wait a minute.

765
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,158
I'm not about to turn
a fellow explorer

766
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,452
out into the cold.

767
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,203
I didn't hold up
my end of the bargain.

768
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,538
If we didn't think

769
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,457
you had something to
add to this project,

770
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,293
we never would have made
the offer in the first place.

771
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,337
Henry Janeway's pigheadedness
doesn't change that.

772
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,465
We could still
use your help--

773
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,467
Just not here.

774
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,135
My associate in Canton.

775
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,220
I'll tell him
you're on the way.

776
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,973
He'll find
a place for you.

777
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,474
JASON:
Shannon!

778
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,810
What's the matter?

779
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,645
It's Dad.

780
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,772
See you in Ohio?

781
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,231
He won't leave the shop.

782
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,067
There's all these
people outside.

783
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,443
The police are there.

784
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,695
Your father can
take care of himself.

785
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,447
Please, won't you talk to him?
He'll listen to you.

786
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,407
No, he doesn't, Jason.

787
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,993
Where are you going?

788
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,786
And what's this about
"I'll see you in Ohio"?

789
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,412
Ohio... Florida...

790
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,789
What's wrong
with this place?

791
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,957
It didn't work out.

792
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,333
I thought
you liked us.

793
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,584
I do.

794
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,169
Then why are you leaving?

795
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,545
I'm sorry.

796
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:21,429
December 31, 2000.
11:15 p.m.

797
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,474
I've got 95 miles of interstate

798
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,519
before I have to decide
whether I head east or south,

799
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,271
but those 95 miles
won't be uneventful.

800
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,066
My guidebook tells me
that I'm not too far

801
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,694
from Leonardo da Vinci's
<i>Last Supper...</i>

802
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,613
re-created entirely in corn.

803
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:49,582
The last few days have been
memorable, to say the least.

804
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,335
I met Henry Janeway.

805
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,670
Interesting man.

806
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,421
Liked to talk.

807
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,925
Unfortunately, he doesn't listen
to anybody but himself.

808
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,303
He gave me a place
to stay, though...

809
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,681
and we had dinner...

810
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,684
in Paris, no less.

811
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,269
He has a son.

812
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,647
Good kid.

813
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,900
Bright, like his father.

814
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,630
MOSS:
I personally don't regret
a single day

815
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,883
I've spent in this lovely town,
and I want to thank you all

816
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,593
for your encouragement
and support.

817
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,636
REPORTER:
Would you consider
extending your deadline?

818
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,222
MOSS:
I'm afraid that's not possible.

819
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,973
We'd like to express
our deepest regret

820
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,141
to the town of Portage Creek

821
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,227
and on behalf of...
Excuse me.

822
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,561
Get this.

823
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,356
Let her through.

824
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,790
(<i> knocking at door</i> )

825
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,167
We're closed.

826
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,002
It's me.

827
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,091
I said, we're closed.

828
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,509
That's not what the sign says.

829
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,059
Damn it, Henry,
it's cold out here.

830
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,519
Who's with you?

831
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,897
Nobody but us galliforms.

832
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,989
Thought you'd be
in Ohio by now.

833
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,698
Car break down again?

834
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,533
What the hell
are you doing?

835
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,702
Get your things.
We're leaving.

836
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,663
I'm not going
anywhere.

837
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,498
Do I have to drag you
out the front door?

838
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,666
You can try.
Henry...

839
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,251
I won't leave.
It's over.

840
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,836
Well, then I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

841
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,254
Half the town is out there.
You're on the news.

842
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,630
Maybe you'll even go
down in history.

843
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,007
You have made
your point.

844
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,716
Obviously, I haven't,
because if I had,

845
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,593
you wouldn't be asking me
to sign my life away.

846
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,262
Maybe if you'd looked up
from your books once in a while,

847
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,805
you'd see what's
in front of you.

848
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,849
Oh, please, no more
speeches about the future.

849
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,143
As long as I don't have to hear
you pontificate about the past.

850
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,895
It's a deal. Glad we had
this chat. Goodbye.

851
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,773
It's almost midnight, Henry.
Exactly. I've won.

852
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,608
What have you won? The right
to hide behind these shelves

853
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,819
for the rest of your life?
It's worked so far.

854
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,487
Well, it isn't working
for your son...

855
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,448
or this town...
or me.

856
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,075
Look, I know you've
got a job to do.

857
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,660
Oh, this isn't
about the job.

858
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,204
Then why are you here?

859
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,040
It was the cookies.

860
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,916
"Cookies"?

861
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,504
I was on the interstate.

862
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,922
I stopped for gas

863
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,884
and I bought a bag of
chocolate chip cookies

864
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,468
at a convenience store.

865
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,221
It's a little
ritual of mine.

866
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,847
Whenever I get back
on the highway,

867
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,140
I like to treat myself.

868
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,976
I see.

869
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,396
Well, uh...
what does this

870
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,315
have to do
with anything?

871
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:07,030
They didn't taste good, Henry.

872
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,115
It wasn't the same.

873
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,994
I just kept thinking about you

874
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,705
and how I wish
you'd been there.

875
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,417
Actually,
I prefer oatmeal cookies.

876
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,086
I'm allergic to chocolate.

877
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,255
Oh, you don't know
what you're missing.

878
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,467
It's been a long time...

879
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,928
but I'm starting to feel

880
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,471
like maybe
I found a place where...

881
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,394
I'd like to stick around
for a while,

882
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,229
with you and Jason.

883
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,773
And we'd like to have you.

884
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,068
But I can't work in a bookstore
for the rest of my life.

885
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,612
I've been given
a second chance, Henry,

886
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,822
and I can't lose that.

887
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,242
I'm stuck
in the future.

888
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,826
You're stuck
in the past.

889
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:58,248
But maybe we could... get
unstuck in the present.

890
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,253
I... I don't see how

891
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:06,005
with-without
sacrificing my...

892
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,340
You know, Mr. Moss
offered me

893
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,967
a job in Canton,
even though I failed

894
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,969
to keep up my end
of the bargain.

895
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,720
I guess he felt
sorry for me.

896
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,683
But I'm prepared
to turn him down...

897
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,269
if you want me to stay with you.

898
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:30,029
I suppose I could...
reopen my shop

899
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,949
in that monstrosity
you want to build.

900
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,661
Well, I'll have
a few connections.

901
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,998
I could probably get you
a nice remote location

902
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,833
so nobody would bother you.

903
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,584
Not much profit in that.

904
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,297
You sure you won't
drive away again?

905
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,966
No.

906
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:54,553
But if I do, we'll make
the trip together.

907
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,140
What time is it?

908
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,517
A minute to midnight.

909
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,144
Then we're not too late.

910
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,399
(<i> door opens</i> )

911
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,746
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

912
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,317
<i>Neelix to Captain Janeway.</i>

913
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,613
Yes?

914
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,367
<i>Captain, would you mind</i>
<i>coming to the Mess Hall?</i>

915
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,494
Is there a problem?<i> </i>
<i>No, no emergency.</i>

916
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:03,956
<i>But I need to speak with you.</i>
<i>A personal matter.</i>

917
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,376
Give me a minute.

918
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,756
Happy Ancestor's Eve!

919
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,758
ALL:
Happy Ancestor's Eve!

920
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,260
What's all this?

921
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,387
It's April 22,
Ancestor's Eve.

922
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,805
It's a holiday
first established...

923
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,766
Well, uh, today actually

924
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,809
with the Captain's permission.

925
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,395
Neelix...

926
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,230
CHAKOTAY:
I think he's
onto something, Captain.

927
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,606
An evening
of reflection

928
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,191
in honor of those
who came before.

929
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,817
Hear, hear. Uncle Jack
would approve.

930
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,611
It got me out from
under a warp conduit.

931
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,613
I'm all for it.

932
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,031
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, but...

933
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,741
PARIS:
Neelix, the gift.

934
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,701
What gift?

935
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,705
Shannon O'Donnel Janeway,

936
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,832
circa 2050.

937
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,751
We did a little
more research.

938
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,379
This photograph was taken
in a small park

939
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,881
near Portage Creek,
38 years after

940
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,550
the dedication of
the Millennium Gate.

941
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,470
I thought it would look
nice in your ready room

942
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,513
on the shelf
next to your desk.

943
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,056
Thank you.

944
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,434
But I'm not so sure she
has a place there anymore.

945
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,935
You are mistaken,
Captain.

946
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,104
Oh?
Her life captured

947
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,355
your imagination.

948
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,149
Historical details
are irrelevant.

949
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,942
I concur
with that analysis.

950
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,902
CHAKOTAY:
If it weren't for
Shannon O'Donnel,

951
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,154
you never would have
joined Starfleet.

952
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,614
Yeah, and I would have never

953
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:19,574
got you all stuck here
in the Delta Quadrant.

954
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,576
It gave us all time
to get to know each other.

955
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,995
Time for a family portrait
of our own.

956
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:29,375
Everyone gather 'round
the Captain, please.

957
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,879
Face the camera.

958
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,756
Smile.

959
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,217
To family.

960
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,011
ALL:
To family.

961
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,513
Another one for posterity.
No, no...

962
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,264
PARIS:
I think we should
get out of here.

963
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,476
KIM: I don't think so.
JANEWAY: Enough is enough.

964
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,023
(<i> camera shutter clicks</i> )

965
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,941
Knock it off, Kieran.

966
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,234
That's an order.

967
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,452
(<i> camera shutter clicks</i> )
