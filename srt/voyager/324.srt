1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,379
Where are you going?
You were doing great.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,841
You were in perfect position
to deliver the death blow.

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,383
All you had to do
was follow through.

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,844
Come on.
Let's try it again.

5
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,303
Don't push me, Tom.

6
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:14,222
Huh! I am not pushing you.
I'm encouraging you.

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,683
To do what?

8
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,352
Try something new.
This martial-arts program

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,020
is the best workout
I've ever had.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,021
No, it's more than that.

11
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,107
Working with
a<i> bat'leth</i> is an art.

12
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,401
You have to use your mind
and body, your movements--

13
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,320
Look, you may find
all of this Klingon stuff

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,071
really fascinating,
but I don't.

15
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,615
I'm not going
to waste my time

16
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,951
trying to disembowel a bunch
of holographic monsters.

17
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,036
I only came down here
because you tricked me

18
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,205
into that stupid bet.
Would you watch it.

19
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,374
You could take somebody's
head off with that thing.

20
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,584
( panting )

21
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,128
I have tried this,
and now I am finished.

22
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,797
Got it?

23
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,091
Look, if you don't like
the program, that's fine,

24
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,177
but why do you always
have to get so hostile?

25
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,972
I am not hostile!

26
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,562
Where am I?

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,633
Paris to Bridge. We have
an alien visitor on Deck 6.

28
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,637
What do you want with me?
Why have I been abducted?

29
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,056
We didn't abduct you.

30
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:05,268
You just appeared here.
We had nothing to do with it.

31
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,023
What is this place?

32
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,358
You're on a starship
called<i> Voyager.</i>

33
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,110
Where were you before?

34
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,529
My colony on Nyria III.

35
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,867
I was walking home
and... then I was here.

36
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,284
What's wrong?

37
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,538
It's cold here...
and too bright.

38
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,498
Let us take you
to Sick Bay.

39
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,501
Our Doctor can run some scans.
Maybe we can get some answers.

40
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,632
I've increased the temperature
to 45 degrees Celsius.

41
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,258
And the light
level should be

42
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,760
more comfortable
for you now.

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,263
Yes, thank you.
You're very considerate.

44
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,850
I hope you'll excuse
my initial suspicion.

45
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,144
This experience
has been very unnerving.

46
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,270
I'd feel the same way
in your place.

47
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,106
Do your people
possess technology

48
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,816
which could have
transported you here?

49
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,985
Not that I know of.

50
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,820
I've heard of other races
that have it.

51
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,321
Maybe one of them
brought me here,

52
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,781
but I can't imagine why.

53
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,992
Please describe the
physical sensation

54
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,661
of your experience.

55
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,914
First, I felt lightheaded

56
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,124
and then everything
around me

57
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,126
seemed to bend or ripple.

58
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,461
There-- There was
a moment of blackness

59
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,173
and I felt
a curious sensation

60
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,259
of insects crawling
on my skin

61
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,179
and then I found myself
on your ship.

62
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,931
Interesting.

63
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,517
I'll run a microcellular
scan for residual energy traces.

64
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,353
Can you tell us
where your colony is located?

65
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,191
We're on the third planet
of the Nyrian system.

66
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,359
A red giant star

67
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,779
with a large cloud
of interstellar dust

68
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,405
just beyond the fifth planet.

69
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,283
Doesn't sound like any
system we've encountered.

70
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,952
Unfortunately,
our knowledge

71
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,912
of this area of
space is limited.

72
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,663
I'd like you to look
at a star chart

73
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,208
to see if you recognize
any astronomical markers.

74
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,751
Of course.

75
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,003
In the meantime, my crew
has begun scanning the area

76
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,755
for any clues about
what happened to you.

77
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,133
DOCTOR:
Lieutenant,
if you don't mind.

78
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,842
Where is Kes today?

79
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,136
I don't know.

80
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,595
She's late for
her duty shift.

81
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,013
Computer, locate Kes.

82
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,724
COMPUTER:
<i>Kes is not on board</i> Voyager.

83
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,559
When did she leave?

84
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,687
<i>1132 hours.</i>

85
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,690
What time did our alien
visitor come on board?

86
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,944
<i>1132 hours.</i>

87
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,910
There's nothing to indicate
that any other ships

88
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,328
have been in this area for weeks

89
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,871
and the nearest
inhabited world

90
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,372
is over ten
light-years away.

91
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,582
Whoever or whatever did this

92
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,417
had to leave
some kind of energy trace.

93
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,711
Internal sensors aren't
showing anything unusual

94
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,505
in the corridor
where the Nyrian appeared

95
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,299
or at Kes's
last known location.

96
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,218
Then let's concentrate
on the time.

97
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,679
Run a level-1 analysis
on all sensor readings,

98
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,598
internal and external, taken at
the exact moment it happened.

99
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,310
I'll get it started,
but it may take a while.

100
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,273
You don't think
I'm hostile, do you?

101
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,358
I, uh... wouldn't describe you
that way, no.

102
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,736
I know that I have a temper,
but that doesn't mean

103
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,780
that I'm always hostile,
does it?

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,282
No, of course not.

105
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,450
I am forthright.
I speak my mind.

106
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,953
That is very different
from being hostile.

107
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,370
Very different.

108
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,915
And if someone
described me that way,

109
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,543
they'd be way off
the mark, wouldn't they?

110
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,377
Way off.

111
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,050
Then why do you look like
you're afraid for your life?

112
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,178
( console beeping )

113
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,679
What is this?

114
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,764
Looks like a surge
of polaron particles.

115
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,183
Localize the source.

116
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,601
I'll try to increase
the sensor resolution.

117
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,021
You have anything yet?

118
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,773
Harry?

119
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,488
Torres to Bridge.

120
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,615
Ensign Kim just disappeared.

121
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,078
And we just got
another visitor.

122
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,066
Mr. Tuvok, have you
made any progress?

123
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,902
Increasing the shield strength
has had no apparent effect.

124
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,113
However, if--

125
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,080
Oh...

126
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,842
Welcome to Sick Bay.

127
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,178
Take a number.

128
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,014
In the last three hours,
we've lost 22 of our people.

129
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,515
According to the Nyrians,

130
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,184
they've all shown up
on their colony

131
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,936
as though
we're switching places.

132
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,021
I went over our navigational
charts with Dammar,

133
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,690
but he's completely unfamiliar
with this part of space.

134
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,401
For all we know,
that colony could be

135
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,153
thousands
of light-years away.

136
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,655
Any idea what might be
causing these transfers?

137
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,198
I'm not sure.

138
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,826
Harry and I detected
a surge of polaron particles

139
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,369
right before he disappeared.

140
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,913
They created a spatial
distortion field around him,

141
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,790
but it collapsed
as soon as he vanished.

142
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,584
Could it have been some
kind of spatial anomaly?

143
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,044
It could
have been anything.

144
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,964
A naturally occurring
phenomenon like a wormhole,

145
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,425
or a subspace
flow field or a kind

146
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,177
of technology
like our transporters.

147
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,594
JANEWAY:
All right.

148
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,472
Get back to your stations
and keep looking.

149
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,723
Confine the Nyrians
to the cargo bays

150
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,851
and post security details
at every access point.

151
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,394
CHAKOTAY:
In all fairness,

152
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,604
Captain, they haven't been
threatening in any way.

153
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,564
They seem as puzzled
by all this as we are.

154
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,650
Chakotay, I don't care
how they seem.

155
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,861
All I care about is that I've
had a knot in my stomach

156
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,612
since the first Nyrian arrived.

157
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,823
Something about this is wrong;
I can smell it.

158
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,492
Look at us,
running around the ship

159
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,535
checking sensors
and spinning theories

160
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,579
while the Nyrians slowly replace
our crew.

161
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,499
Consider this:

162
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,459
There has been
a consistent interval

163
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,795
of nine minutes and 20 seconds
between these exchanges.

164
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,008
At that rate, our entire crew
will be gone in 18 hours.

165
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,469
Tell me that doesn't put
a knot in your stomach.

166
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,262
You have your orders.

167
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:27,108
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50912.4.</i>

168
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,609
<i>It's been 12 hours</i>

169
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,071
<i>since these</i>
<i>mysterious exchanges began</i>

170
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,198
<i>and we still haven't discovered</i>
<i>their cause.</i>

171
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,243
<i>I've already lost</i>
<i>over half my crew.</i>

172
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,040
Cargo Bay 2 is almost full.

173
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,125
We'll have to start
converting the shuttle bays.

174
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,627
Then do it. I want them where
we can keep an eye on them.

175
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,922
I'll have to reassign
more crew members to security.

176
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,631
Our ranks are getting
a little thin.

177
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,134
Shut down everything but the
ship's essential functions.

178
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,096
We'll be operating on a
skeleton crew before long.

179
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,722
B'Elanna,

180
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,891
you've developed a theory
about what's happening.

181
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,436
A Nyrian astrophysicist who
arrived about an hour ago

182
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,729
told me about some strange
graviton fluctuations

183
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,440
they detected
at their colony.

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,943
I ran some scans on this end
and found the same thing.

185
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,528
JANEWAY:
A wormhole?

186
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,239
Possibly a baby one.
And if I'm right,

187
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,657
one end is opening
intermittently inside<i> Voyager.</i>

188
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,411
We could have passed through it
while it was forming

189
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,787
and snagged on it somehow.

190
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,539
Then how do we
get it unsnagged?

191
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,707
Well, now that I have
this new information I'd like

192
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,210
to have another talk with
Rislan, the Nyrian scientist.

193
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,296
Is Neelix still helping out
with the new arrivals?

194
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,671
I think he's
in Cargo Bay 2 now.

195
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,006
Janeway to Neelix.

196
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,259
<i>Neelix here, Captain.</i>

197
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,053
I'd like you to find
one of the Nyrians who--

198
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,142
<i>Neelix to Captain Janeway.</i>
<i>I lost contact.</i>

199
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,644
<i>What did you say?</i> 
Chakotay to Neelix.

200
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,229
The Captain's gone.

201
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,856
We need you to find
a Nyrian scientist called Rislan

202
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,900
and get him to Engineering
as soon as you can.

203
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,569
<i>Right away, Commander.</i>

204
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,696
Do what you have to do
to get some answers, B'Elanna.

205
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,080
Excuse me.
Aren't you Dr. Rislan?

206
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,166
It's still
too cold in here.

207
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,003
I'll adjust the environmental
controls... again.

208
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,463
But I must ask you...

209
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,798
And the air is too humid.

210
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,925
I'll take care of it
right away.

211
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,512
But I must ask you to go
to our Engineering room.

212
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,556
I believe you're
urgently needed.

213
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,977
I trust it will be suitably
warm and dark there?

214
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,686
We'll make sure
you're comfortable.

215
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,272
A security guard
will escort you.

216
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,607
GUARD:
Right away, sir.

217
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,029
Commander, there's a problem

218
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,989
with the internal sensors
on Deck 4.

219
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,450
It looks like a circuit relay
malfunction.

220
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,035
I can't spare anyone
for repairs.

221
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,662
You'll have to make do.

222
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,627
How do you like your first day
as Chief of Security, Ensign?

223
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,421
It's everything
I dreamed of, sir.

224
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,965
Who says there's no room for
advancement on this ship?

225
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,384
( beeping )

226
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,261
Another disappearance.
It's Neelix.

227
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,888
How many people
does that leave us?

228
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,097
Forty.

229
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,517
And more than
a hundred Nyrians.

230
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,394
I want access to all systems

231
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,021
restricted to authorized
voiceprints only.

232
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,649
Seal off any part of the ship
that we're not using

233
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,236
and place security force fields
around sensitive areas.

234
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,030
Warp core, armory,
torpedo bays.

235
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,533
And let's hope
I'm just being paranoid.

236
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:28,789
RISLAN:
If you ask me, a tetryon scan
is a waste of time.

237
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,001
A multispectral sweep
would be much more useful.

238
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,087
TORRES:
Actually, I didn't ask

239
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,507
and I've already initiated
the tetryon scan.

240
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,259
You're the expert.

241
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,263
Neutrinos, ionized hydrogen,
theta-band radiation...

242
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,640
Just what you'd expect
to find in a wormhole.

243
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,060
But it's what we're not finding
that I'm interested in.

244
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,398
The scan shows no quantum level
fluctuations whatsoever.

245
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,734
That's not so unusual.

246
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,653
It's more than unusual;
it's impossible.

247
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,864
I don't think this is
a wormhole at all.

248
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,159
Perhaps it's a subspace
flow field then.

249
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,869
I'm going to run
a pattern analysis

250
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,663
from the original data.

251
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,333
( beeping )

252
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,669
Nope, definitely not
a flow field.

253
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,130
The spatial harmonics
are incompatible.

254
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,382
I don't think this is
a natural phenomenon.

255
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,925
( grunts )

256
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,139
Don't move.

257
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,848
I won't hurt you
unless you force me to.

258
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,560
Your people have been
behind this all along.

259
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,606
What are you doing?

260
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,108
Moving you
to the head of the line.

261
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,627
B'Elanna, are
you all right?

262
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,170
Captain, the Nyrians

263
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,713
are responsible
for the exchanges.

264
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,007
I think they have
some kind of technology...

265
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,528
What do they want with us?
I don't know.

266
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,946
They refuse to answer
any questions.

267
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,491
They've given us food,
water and medical supplies,

268
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,993
everything but information.
Where's the rest of the crew?

269
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,578
In other compounds
just like this one

270
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,079
scattered
throughout the woods.

271
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,832
This doesn't seem
like a Nyrian colony.

272
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,750
It's not warm enough
or dark enough for them.

273
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,919
Exactly. It's more like
an idyllic version of Earth,

274
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,130
as though it were created
specifically for us.

275
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,675
Do we have any idea
what planet we're on?

276
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,177
Not yet. I sent Tuvok to
investigate the other compounds

277
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,763
and see what he can find out.
Until he gets back,

278
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,808
all we have are
unanswered questions.

279
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,398
Decks 11 through 15
are completely shut down.

280
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,567
Most of the remaining crew
are on security detail

281
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,151
near the cargo
and shuttle bays.

282
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,738
What, all 13 of them?
Twelve, sir.

283
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,113
( beeping )

284
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,866
<i>Crewman Gennaro to Bridge.</i>

285
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,869
<i>I'm in Engineering,</i>
<i>and I just found Ensign Molina.</i>

286
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,412
<i>He's unconscious but okay.</i>

287
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,581
What about the Nyrian
scientist he was watching?

288
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,123
<i>There's no sign of him, sir.</i>

289
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,958
Find him.
That's a priority.

290
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,085
Where are you going?

291
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,254
To have a talk
with the Nyrians.

292
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,566
Chakotay to all hands.
Security alert.

293
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,736
The Nyrians may be trying
to take control of the ship.

294
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,113
Everyone get to the Bridge
or Main Engineering

295
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,866
and secure them
against possible intruders.

296
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,429
Second team,
take control of weapons.

297
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,228
( door opens )

298
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,898
Start by reinforcing
the containment fields.

299
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,691
( thumping )

300
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,027
Reroute emergency power.
We've got to seal those doors.

301
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,367
( grunts )

302
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,374
( groans )

303
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,130
( indistinct commands )

304
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,314
They're everywhere.

305
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,275
They're even decrypting
our access codes.

306
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,363
The Nyrians obviously
prepared for this

307
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,031
before they got here.

308
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,450
They must have tapped into
our computer somehow

309
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,160
and gotten enough information

310
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,621
to plan this mission
down to the letter.

311
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,542
Larson?

312
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,425
Chakotay to anybody who's left.

313
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,927
Please respond.

314
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,303
<i>Gennaro here, sir.</i>

315
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,140
Anybody else?

316
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,893
The two of us
aren't going to win this.

317
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,185
So we might as well make life

318
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,979
as difficult for the Nyrians
as we can.

319
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,481
Sabotage everything
you can get your hands on.

320
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,149
<i>Understood.</i>

321
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,276
Good luck.

322
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,323
What's our status?

323
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,451
We have shut off their security
measures on all decks.

324
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,621
We should have full
computer access soon.

325
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,124
But their navigational
controls are not working.

326
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,626
Not working?

327
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,837
There are two humans still
moving through the ship.

328
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,548
They seem intent
on causing damage.

329
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,174
Find them.

330
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,962
( engine powering down )

331
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,969
They're sabotaging
the power systems.

332
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,430
The antimatter reactor's
shutting down.

333
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,916
FEMALE: I can't see.
MALE: What happened?

334
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,375
This way.

335
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,724
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning. Disabling</i>
<i>lateral EPS relays</i>

336
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,978
<i>may disrupt computer functions</i>
<i>throughout the ship.</i>

337
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,271
Let's hope so.

338
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,982
Chakotay to Gennaro.

339
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,192
They're trying to delete
the Doctor's program.

340
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,486
Are you anywhere near Sick Bay?

341
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,115
Gennaro?

342
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,533
Computer...

343
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,869
how long ago did Crewman Gennaro
leave the ship?

344
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,872
COMPUTER:
<i>Seven minutes and 20 seconds.</i>

345
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,170
I've located
the last human.

346
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,714
He's on the fifth deck.

347
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,801
Send a patrol
to stop him.

348
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,511
I already have.

349
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,267
Activate emergency
medical holographic program.

350
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,311
DOCTOR:
Please state the nature...

351
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,857
Hello?
Doctor, over here.

352
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,652
Commander, what's happening?

353
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,237
Your program's
going to be deleted

354
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,322
unless I can download you
into the mobile emitter

355
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,950
before I disappear,
which should be any second now.

356
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,369
( thudding )

357
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,378
Got it.

358
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,260
All right.

359
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,262
I know when to quit.

360
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:12,105
I've never been completely
cut off from the ship before.

361
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,941
What if the emitter's
power supply runs out?

362
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,568
Let's hope we're not stuck here
long enough to find out.

363
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:21,114
Tuvok, what did you learn?

364
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,532
There are ten compounds
like this one

365
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,868
spread over approximately
four square kilometers.

366
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,579
They are surrounded
on all sides by wilderness.

367
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,749
FEMALE:
Could I have your attention?

368
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,501
Now that you've
all arrived here safely,

369
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,670
I'd like to welcome you
to your new home.

370
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,506
I'm not particularly
interested in being welcomed.

371
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,300
Why have you brought us here?

372
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,343
Your vessel will
be used to defend

373
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,553
Nyrian acquisitions.

374
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,013
Is this the way
you operate?

375
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,224
Gradually changing places
with the crew of a ship?

376
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,269
Ships, colonies,
space stations.

377
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,813
We've found it's far more
effective than warfare.

378
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,856
We aren't
a cruel people.

379
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,151
We've tried to make
this experience

380
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:02,362
as painless as possible,
and as you can see,

381
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,116
we've gone to great lengths
to create an environment

382
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,826
in which you
will be comfortable.

383
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,828
Nonetheless,
we are being held here

384
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,204
against our will.

385
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,832
Well, I'm afraid
that's unavoidable.

386
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,209
But I think
you'll be happy here.

387
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,586
The food dispensers
have been programmed

388
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,339
with selections
from your own computer files.

389
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,134
We have even downloaded
literature and entertainment

390
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,927
from your cultural database.

391
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,345
What happens if we try to leave
this little paradise?

392
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,474
I think you'll find
there's nowhere to go.

393
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,059
We don't accept that.

394
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,187
We will find a way
out of here.

395
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,480
Captain...

396
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,399
your lack of gratitude
is unbecoming.

397
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,986
You and your crew
could have found yourselves

398
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,322
somewhere far less hospitable.

399
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:47,033
It's still
a prison.

400
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,869
If you want to be miserable
here, that is your choice.

401
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,330
But since there's nothing
you can do about your situation,

402
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,000
I suggest you accept it...
gracefully.

403
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,589
We're ready now.

404
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,346
Tuvok... tell me about
this wilderness you found.

405
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,388
How rugged is it?
Can we walk out?

406
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:13,267
I don't believe so.
In every direction I went,

407
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,228
I encountered
a natural barrier.

408
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,938
A sheer cliff,
an impassable river.

409
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,440
These obstacles completely
surround the colony.

410
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,818
A perfectly isolated area.

411
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,904
Doesn't that seem
a bit convenient?

412
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,781
This place does have
an artificial quality.

413
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,910
I wouldn't be surprised if
the whole thing is holographic

414
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,410
and the wilderness
was created

415
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,705
to keep us
from exploring too far.

416
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,123
Captain.

417
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,717
Uh...

418
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,595
sorry for the intrusion,

419
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,681
but I-I wanted to welcome you.

420
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,726
I'm, uh... Jarleth...

421
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,228
your neighbor.

422
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,364
Where did you come from?

423
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,657
My people live in
the other environment,

424
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,243
uh, through that portal.

425
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,078
It's, uh, quite different.

426
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,871
More, uh... desert-like.

427
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,791
This place, it's
so, uh... green.

428
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,294
But I'm sure
it's suitable for you.

429
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,087
The Nyrians undoubtedly
had a good look

430
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,380
through your data banks.

431
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,382
Were your people brought
here by the Nyrians?

432
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,259
They took us one by one.

433
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,137
Oh, is this what you eat?

434
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,306
JANEWAY:
They took you from your colony.

435
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,349
They claimed not to know
what was happening.

436
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,809
By the time we
got suspicious,

437
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,311
there were
too many of them.

438
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,229
We've been here
ever since.

439
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,898
Do you have any idea
where "here" is?

440
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,733
No. Uh-uh.

441
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,277
Mmm.

442
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,694
Not bad.

443
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,114
Um, would you
be interested

444
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,158
in trading for
some of these?

445
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,118
The last inhabitants of this
environment

446
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,454
had no concept
of a barter system,

447
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,914
but you strike me
as a much more, uh...

448
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,041
sophisticated group.

449
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,837
If there were people here before
us,

450
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,214
maybe we could
get out the same way.

451
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,133
Oh, I... I don't think

452
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,884
you'd like their method
of escape.

453
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,720
Uh... they all died
from a plague.

454
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,931
Captain,
there must be some kind of

455
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,724
force field here,
but I can't find it.

456
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,226
Pretty well-camouflaged,
isn't it?

457
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,146
It took me almost nine years to
find the portal.

458
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,397
How did you get it open?

459
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,024
Well, I...

460
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,650
I have my ways.

461
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,777
I'd consider that
information

462
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,738
a valuable commodity.

463
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,492
Well, I'd be happy
to make a trade,

464
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:37,203
but the portal only leads
into our environment.

465
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,538
You're welcome
to, uh, visit, of course.

466
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,334
There may be
other portals...

467
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:47,254
if you can show us
how to find them.

468
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,299
I look forward
to our collaboration.

469
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,735
What do you see now?

470
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,278
Fascinating.

471
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,947
Everything is glowing with its
own energy.

472
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,616
Even the plants are emitting
a faint thermal signature.

473
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,035
It's really
quite lovely.

474
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,828
Aside from
the aesthetic consideration,

475
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,288
how's your optical resolution?

476
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,707
The Captain sent me down
to get an update.

477
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,418
Well, we're
just about ready.

478
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,545
I've reconfigured
the Doctor's optical sensors.

479
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,172
And, as soon as they're aligned,
he should be able to detect

480
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,091
the microwave signature
of the portals.

481
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,885
Then I can begin my new career
as a tricorder.

482
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,346
About the other day...

483
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,099
I might have been a bit...

484
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,519
oversensitive, uh,
about the Klingon program.

485
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,230
Don't worry about it.

486
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,776
That should
just about do it.

487
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,486
I think we can
start scanning now.

488
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,905
Good. I'll tell
the Captain.

489
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,615
Um...

490
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,826
about the program...

491
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,661
I-I didn't mean to push you.

492
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,039
I know. You didn't.

493
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,001
And I didn't mean to, um,
lash out at you like that.

494
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,045
A typical defensive reaction,

495
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,548
using an aggressive outburst
as a shield

496
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,134
against a perceived
emotional threat.

497
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,219
That says it, all right.

498
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,139
Oh, that's very funny
coming from you.

499
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,099
And what is that
supposed to mean?

500
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,102
Well, you're hardly one
to talk about being defensive.

501
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,188
And why is that exactly?

502
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,524
Well, you just pretend
that nothing bothers you,

503
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,526
and then you turn everything
into a joke.

504
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,445
DOCTOR:
That's a valid observation.

505
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,989
Defense mechanisms
come in many forms.

506
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,283
That's ridiculous.
I am an easygoing person...

507
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,909
( chuckles )

508
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,744
who is just trying to be
friendly to someone

509
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,165
who is obviously terrified
of having a friend.

510
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,084
Fear of intimacy is a common
indication of low self-esteem.

511
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,295
Perhaps if you stopped
to analyze the root cause,

512
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,381
you might--

513
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,883
If you find it so difficult
to be my friend,

514
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,302
then why keep trying?

515
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,012
That's a good question.

516
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,973
I think I'll stop
wasting my time.

517
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,019
( sighs )

518
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,955
I pulled a power cell
and some relay circuits

519
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,999
out of a food dispenser.

520
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,085
And this little thing looks
like some sort of capacitor.

521
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,587
It should do.

522
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,548
If you can find
another like this one,

523
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,757
we'll be able to construct
a second weapon.

524
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,759
You're assuming
the first one will work.

525
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,762
Yes.
I'll get on it right away.

526
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:46,517
Maybe if I take apart
the sonic shower assembly.

527
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,189
I've got to give
you credit, Tuvok.

528
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,317
Working on the fly
with nothing but random parts

529
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,486
with no guide
to follow...

530
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,821
I never thought Vulcans
had much of a knack

531
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,490
for improvising.

532
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,119
Our circumstances seem to
require a certain flexibility.

533
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,663
You could say that.

534
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,748
This reminds me
of those survival classes

535
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,833
they put us through
at the Academy.

536
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,545
Surprise tactical simulations.

537
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,129
Getting dropped off
in the woods

538
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,173
with no chance to prepare.

539
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,926
They certainly taught you
to live by your wits.

540
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,221
That was a lesson
I had already learned.

541
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,640
During the Rite of<i> tal'oth,</i>

542
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,851
I survived in the Vulcan
desert for four months

543
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,979
with a ritual blade
as my only possession.

544
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,899
After that, Starfleet
training exercises

545
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,235
seemed less
of a challenge.

546
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,986
I guess so.

547
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,363
( beeping softly )

548
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,031
This weapon is complete.

549
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,201
When Mr. Neelix returns
with a second capacitor, I'll...

550
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,454
improvise another.

551
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,840
Lieutenant, I haven't seen
any sign of a portal.

552
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,926
Frankly, I'm getting
tired of this.

553
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,053
Holograms don't get tired.

554
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,222
Keep looking.

555
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,475
We've tried to get
out of here for years.

556
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,560
The closest I ever came
was finding the portal

557
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,186
between our two
environments.

558
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,230
I-I don't mean
to be pessimistic,

559
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,940
but I don't think
there is a way out.

560
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,776
There must be-- we just
have to keep looking.

561
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,986
Well, I know it's too early
for you to accept this,

562
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,904
but life here isn't so bad.

563
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,698
Once we stopped
trying to escape,

564
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,075
we actually began
enjoying ourselves.

565
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,828
TORRES:
Captain, we found something.

566
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,416
It's directly in front of me.

567
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,838
Here?
Yes, right there.

568
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,392
Well, if my scanning services
are no longer required,

569
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,603
I'll return
to my medical duties.

570
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,249
We can cover more ground
if we split up.

571
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,917
Tuvok and I will take
this direction.

572
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,294
You three go that way.

573
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,547
We'll meet back here
in 20 minutes.

574
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,069
I don't think we're
supposed to be in here.

575
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,243
B'Elanna, over here.

576
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,060
There's another one.

577
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,365
Self-contained biospheres.

578
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,285
Every one of them different.

579
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,636
It's definitely some kind
of control station.

580
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,053
I can bring up information,

581
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,222
but I can't understand
what it says.

582
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,392
If the Nyrians downloaded
<i>Voyager's</i> cultural database,

583
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,854
you may be able to tap into
the translation algorithm.

584
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,067
Oh, much better.

585
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:12,574
"The Federation habitat.
Population: 148."

586
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,160
At least they haven't detected
that anyone's missing.

587
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,456
Here's another environment.

588
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,458
And another.

589
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,669
How many are there?

590
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:30,300
Captain, there's data here
for 94 different environments.

591
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,928
They're holding
thousands of prisoners.

592
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,972
There's got to be something
that'll tell us about

593
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,890
the layout of this place.
( buzzing )

594
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,475
Authorized access only.

595
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,394
I'll try to bypass
their security codes.

596
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,607
Good.
I'm getting something.

597
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,277
Incredible, Tuvok.

598
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,821
We're on a ship.

599
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,906
We should attempt
to locate the Bridge.

600
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,575
If there is one,
I can't find it, but...

601
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,953
( door opening )

602
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,997
There seems to be a more
extensive command center

603
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,166
four decks above us.
Maybe I can access it from here.

604
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,793
( beeping )

605
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,419
More security lockouts.

606
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,547
We may need to disable
the entire security subroutine.

607
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,216
( alarm blaring )

608
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:31,403
<i>There's been an unauthorized</i>
<i>access at one of the terminals.</i>

609
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,697
<i>Some of the life-forms</i>
<i>have escaped their habitat.</i>

610
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,073
Find them
and put them back.

611
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,659
<i>We are attempting</i>
<i>to do that now.</i>

612
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,202
<i>However, if they resist,</i>

613
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,830
<i>stronger measures</i>
<i>may become necessary.</i>

614
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:47,544
If they leave you
no other alternative...

615
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,296
you have the authorization
to use force.

616
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,428
How soon can we go to warp?
I want to get back there.

617
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,847
Just a few minutes.

618
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,812
Let's go back.

619
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,648
No. We've got to find
the Captain and Tuvok.

620
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,191
They might need our help.

621
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,027
We have to help ourselves.

622
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,654
This is our chance to get back
into our own environments.

623
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,741
If you want to go, then go.
We're not leaving them behind.

624
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,246
MALE:
Don't move.

625
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,041
I surrender.

626
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,168
I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea.
They made me come along.

627
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,629
They, uh...

628
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,881
went around that corner.
Follow them.

629
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,114
He just activated
a translocator control.

630
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,449
One life-form was sent
from an access tunnel

631
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,326
to the biosphere
adjacent to ours.

632
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,370
That must have been Jarleth.

633
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,581
This translocator is
what the Nyrians used

634
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,792
to get on our ship.
Then we should be able

635
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,794
to use the same method
to return to<i> Voyager.</i>

636
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,755
Assuming we can figure
out how to use it.

637
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,385
( console beeping )

638
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,179
We're getting
an incoming transmission

639
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,056
from the biosphere vessel.
Audio only.

640
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,433
<i>Taleen to Dammar.</i>
<i>Some of the life-forms have</i>

641
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,061
<i>accessed the control systems.</i>
<i>They have weapons.</i>

642
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,395
<i>We need reinforcements.</i>

643
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,731
We're on our way to you now.

644
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,568
Increase speed
to maximum velocity

645
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,362
and take us close enough
to translocate

646
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,405
my entire security force
at once!

647
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,907
Yes, sir.

648
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,164
Something's wrong
with the phaser.

649
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,915
The power cell's
probably running out.

650
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,667
These aren't exactly
Starfleet issue.

651
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,169
We've got to get out
of these tunnels.

652
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,712
There must be
somewhere to hide

653
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,048
in one of
these habitats.

654
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,766
Tom, I think I found one.

655
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,780
Here it is.

656
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,952
Remember how we had

657
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,080
to warm up the ship
for the Nyrians?

658
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,498
This is the last place
they'd want to follow us.

659
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,713
Stop!

660
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,970
Follow them.

661
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,680
That's an order.

662
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,854
This translocator has
an extremely long range,

663
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,940
over ten light-years.

664
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,692
Great distances must
limit its capacity.

665
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,527
That's why the Nyrians could
only send

666
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,280
one person to<i> Voyager</i> at a time
and bring one of us here.

667
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,032
Their method has
the added advantage

668
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,159
of appearing innocent,
at least in the beginning.

669
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,744
I can't find
the command pathways

670
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,454
to get the system operative

671
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,623
and I don't imagine
we have much longer

672
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,541
before they find us.

673
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:21,299
Maybe coming in here
wasn't such a good idea.

674
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,219
Let's hope it's worse
for them than it is for us.

675
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,101
Careful.
That phaser's just about dead.

676
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,449
They can't last much longer.

677
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,576
We've just got to stay
one step ahead of them.

678
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,787
We don't want to get too
far away from the portal.

679
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,123
Maybe we should find
a place to hide.

680
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,131
( panting )

681
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,510
Let me see the phaser.

682
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,184
My hands are completely numb.

683
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:15,145
Here.

684
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,272
I would have thought all
that hot Klingon blood

685
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,899
would have kept you warm.

686
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,861
Shows how much you know
about Klingons.

687
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,031
They have much less tolerance
for the cold than humans do.

688
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,868
Really? I thought
that was Cardassians.

689
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,079
No, they just complain
about it more.

690
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,791
Better?

691
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,509
I think that'll amplify
the power cell...

692
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,761
enough for one more shot.

693
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,807
( footsteps approach )

694
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,101
( groaning )

695
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,112
B'Elanna.

696
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,163
Nice shot.

697
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,583
Now, let's get out of here
before we freeze to death.

698
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,256
JANEWAY:
I've got the basic
operation down,

699
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,716
but I can't quite figure out
how to lock on to a target.

700
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,093
Can you access anything

701
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,178
that might function
like our targeting scanners?

702
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,888
There are bio-sensors
contained within

703
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,015
the monitoring programs
of each habitat.

704
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,393
Perhaps...
What is it?

705
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:39,979
I'm detecting human life-forms
in one of the environments.

706
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,148
The Argala habitat.

707
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,649
Tom and B'Elanna.

708
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,318
Possibly.

709
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,446
They may have taken refuge there
to hide from the Nyrians.

710
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,031
Doesn't look very inviting,
does it?

711
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,909
The temperature
is minus 20 degrees Celsius.

712
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,287
They can't last long in that.
We've got to get them out.

713
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,080
( beeping )

714
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,877
Captain, there's a ship
approaching at high warp.

715
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,629
It's<i> Voyager.</i>

716
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,798
If the Nyrians are
bringing in reinforcements,

717
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,343
we're in trouble. Keep
working on those bio-scanners.

718
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,267
I didn't think we were this far
from the portal.

719
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,102
( cries out )

720
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,396
I don't think
I can go on any farther.

721
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,481
You have to
keep moving.

722
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,735
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

723
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,404
No, B'Elanna, get up.

724
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,364
No, you go on.
I'm just going to rest here.

725
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,408
If you do that, you'll die.
No, I'll be fine.

726
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,160
I just have to close my eyes
for a minute.

727
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,828
Oh, no, I am not going
to let you do this.

728
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,914
On your feet now, Torres.
That's an order!

729
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,375
You can't give me orders.
We're the same rank.

730
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,253
I am a Bridge officer,
and I have seniority.

731
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,505
Oh, yeah,
by about two days.

732
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,425
On your feet, now! Come on.

733
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,385
You been wanting to take
a swing at me for days.

734
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,762
Now's your chance.

735
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,639
You're just trying
to get me moving.

736
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,099
You will keep moving.

737
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,934
Or do I have to throw you
over my shoulder

738
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,895
and carry you out?
Don't even try it.

739
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,537
Where are we?

740
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,249
The... Argala habitat, sir.

741
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,835
Get us out of here.

742
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,629
Where's the portal?

743
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,757
You did this.

744
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,261
I've taken control
of your translocation system.

745
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,722
My Tactical Officer
is standing by

746
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,807
waiting for my next order.

747
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,061
And-And what
would that be?

748
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,813
That depends on you.

749
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,107
Surrender my ship...

750
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,318
and release
all the prisoners here.

751
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,321
Unacceptable.

752
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,115
All right.

753
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,950
You can stay where you are,

754
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,577
and greet
your fellow crew members

755
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,455
as we translocate them here
to join you.

756
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,666
And if we do surrender?

757
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,919
We'll find you
a nice, warm habitat

758
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,587
where you'll be comfortable

759
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,549
while we contact the native
worlds of your prisoners

760
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,926
and arrange for their return.

761
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,304
And once we've disabled
your translocator...

762
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,432
you'll be free to go.

763
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,854
I'm sorry you don't wish
to be reasonable.

764
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,441
Mr. Tuvok, get me out of here
and prepare to--

765
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:30,858
No! Wait!

766
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,912
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50929.6.</i>

767
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,123
<i>The Nyrians</i>
<i>have surrendered</i> Voyager,

768
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,375
<i>and my crew</i>
<i>is safely back onboard.</i>

769
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,419
<i>The former prisoners</i>
<i>on the habitat vessel</i>

770
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,463
<i>have contacted</i>
<i>their native worlds</i>

771
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:53,756
<i>and are waiting</i>
<i>to be taken home.</i>

772
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,614
Nice day.

773
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,326
Beautiful.

774
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,868
( sighs )

775
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:26,080
Things were pretty chilly
there for a while.

776
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,544
I guess they were.

777
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,133
Feels good to be warm again.

778
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,928
Yeah.

779
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,347
Sure does.

780
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,811
(<i> sighs</i> )
