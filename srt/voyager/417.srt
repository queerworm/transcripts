1
00:00:00,835 --> 00:00:03,002
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

2
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,219
Direct hit.

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,932
The target buoy
is solid monotanium,

4
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,433
ten meters thick,

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,894
shielded by a chromoelectric
force field.

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,020
Impressive.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,355
I'm glad
you agree.

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,857
It's not wise to
travel this region

9
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,399
without adequate
defenses.

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,943
I've seen
scuttled ships

11
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,320
with more firepower
than<i> Voyager.</i>

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,906
I'm sure you have.

13
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,283
Imagine what you'll be capable
of once the isokinetic cannon

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,661
is integrated into
your defensive systems.

15
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,162
One projectile

16
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,374
can penetrate the shields
of any heavily armored

17
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,376
vessel.

18
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,004
Hostile species will
know to avoid<i> Voyager</i>

19
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,964
by reputation alone.

20
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,216
You've made your point,
Mr. Kovin.

21
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,676
I want the cannon.

22
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,098
And I'm prepared
to give you...

23
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,564
astrometric charts
spanning 12 sectors.

24
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,441
You'll find them
unusually precise.

25
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,029
Even the most sophisticated
charts become obsolete.

26
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:13,448
One random anomaly, and
they're no longer accurate.

27
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,825
However...

28
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,453
I could be persuaded
if you were to include

29
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,539
the mapping technology
that created them.

30
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,790
Sorry.

31
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,458
Our astrometric sensors

32
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,293
were designed specifically
for this ship.

33
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,170
They'd be of no use
to you.

34
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,339
What I<i> can</i> offer you

35
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,802
is a generous supply of
isolinear processing chips.

36
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,637
We'll even show you
how to integrate them

37
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,848
into your existing
sensor technology.

38
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,434
How generous a supply?

39
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,769
One hundred chips.

40
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,186
One hundred fifty.

41
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,646
115.
125--

42
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,274
Done. Escort our guest
to engineering.

43
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,777
You'll be
supervising

44
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,361
the installation
of the cannon?

45
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,364
Of course...
for a modest fee.

46
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,200
Five additional chips.
No more.

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,119
It's good to see
the art of negotiation

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,663
isn't lost on you,
captain.

49
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,583
( door closes )

50
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,086
That guy is worse
than a Ferengi.

51
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,796
Assign Seven of Nine
to work on this.

52
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,132
She's got a knack for adapting
alien technology.

53
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,467
Should I give her
complete access

54
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,927
to the engineering
control systems?

55
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,262
I'm ready to give her
some latitude.

56
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,306
She's been behaving herself
lately.

57
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,144
( door opens )

58
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,563
( beeping )

59
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,818
What are
you working on?

60
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,611
I'm trying to
decode the message

61
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,362
Starfleet Command sent us
several weeks ago.

62
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,697
Any progress?

63
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,365
None.

64
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,077
I'm working on a new
decryption algorithm.

65
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,037
I'd like you to set it
aside for a while.

66
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,580
I have another
assignment for you.

67
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,206
( beeping )
What is it?

68
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,750
The Captain wants you
to help Kovin

69
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,627
integrate
the new weapon system.

70
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,837
I'd rather not.

71
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,672
I find him inefficient.

72
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,716
Maybe so, but you seem
to work well with him.

73
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,635
You've been asking
for more responsibilities.

74
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,886
I thought you'd be pleased.

75
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,721
The captain gives me
greater liberty

76
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,556
only when she needs
my expertise.

77
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,851
You violated her trust,

78
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,979
and if you want it back,
you're gonna have to earn it,

79
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,313
one step at a time.

80
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,026
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

81
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,490
I will report to engineering.

82
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,830
You'll need to install
isolinear buffer circuits

83
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,915
here and here.

84
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,416
The main
power relay

85
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,209
should be protected
by a containment field.

86
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,087
Unnecessary.
All the buffer circuits

87
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,630
would have to fail
simultaneously

88
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,007
for there to be
any danger.

89
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,177
We prefer to play it safe.

90
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,637
I'll check the inventory logs
to see if we have

91
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,681
a field generator
available.

92
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,897
( beeping )

93
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,318
What are you doing?

94
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,946
I'm reconfiguring
the tactical control systems.

95
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,032
The isokinetic circuits
requires

96
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,575
a specialized protocol.

97
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,784
Let me
take care of it.

98
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,369
That won't be
necessary.

99
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,413
( beeping continues )

100
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,123
No. No!

101
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,000
The subroutines need
to be arranged

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,501
in cascading sequence!

103
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,794
Let me show you.

104
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,922
( grunts )

105
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,217
(<i> dramatic theme continues</i> )

106
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,801
TORRES:
Seven, stop.

107
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,890
( sighing )

108
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,689
(<i> triumphant theme playing</i> )

109
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,961
DOCTOR:
There's a hairline fracture
of the premaxilla bone.

110
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,338
( Kovin gasping )

111
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,422
Do you see this, Captain?
She shattered it.

112
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,924
It's easily repaired.

113
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,468
Do you have any idea<i> why</i> 
Seven attacked you?

114
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,555
It was unprovoked.
She came at me like an animal.

115
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,432
Well, I wouldn't put it
like that.

116
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,353
I was at another console
about 10 meters away.

117
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,521
I heard Kovin raise his voice,
and when I looked around,

118
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,981
I saw that he was holding
her arm.

119
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,317
I barely touched her!

120
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,736
A gentle gesture
to move her out of my way,

121
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,987
so I could get to
the console.

122
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,698
Then she turned on me,
attacked me.

123
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,242
What did you say
to her?

124
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,534
I told her
how to reconfigure

125
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,162
the tactical control
systems properly.

126
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,248
Is that all?
That's all.

127
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,167
And that's when
she knocked him down.

128
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,253
Ashmore and I
had to hold her back.

129
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,380
She would have killed me.
That woman is dangerous.

130
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,714
It's a miracle you survived.

131
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,967
Now hold still,
or this won't heal properly.

132
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,386
Why are you questioning me
on this?

133
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,428
You should be disciplining
your crew member.

134
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,972
Believe me,
I'll deal with it.

135
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,891
Please accept
my sincere apology.

136
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,642
Now,
if you'll excuse me.

137
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,313
Good as new.

138
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,566
( groaning )

139
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,402
( door chimes )

140
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,778
Come in.

141
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,248
Here we are again.

142
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,334
Oh, I'm tired of having
this conversation.

143
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,710
You know what
I'm going to say.

144
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,087
I know how
you're going to respond,

145
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,964
so it seems pointless
to say anything.

146
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,425
Shall I consider my privileges
restricted

147
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,010
and confine myself
to the cargo bay?

148
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,304
I think we've
established that

149
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,180
traditional
disciplinary actions

150
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,433
don't work with you.

151
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,311
The question is,
what will?

152
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,813
Are you asking for
my opinion?

153
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,731
I suppose I am...

154
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,609
Because frankly,
I'm running out of options.

155
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,778
Throwing you in the brig
isn't gonna solve anything.

156
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,488
Neither is slapping you
on the wrist.

157
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,198
And it's not as though
I don't understand

158
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,699
your feelings about Kovin.

159
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,785
There have been a few times
when I'd have liked

160
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,329
to pop him in the nose
myself,

161
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,205
but you have to start learning
the difference

162
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,915
between having an impulse

163
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,918
and acting on it.

164
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,337
Does that make
any sense to you?

165
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,547
I believe so.

166
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,924
I will give it more thought.

167
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,634
( sighs )

168
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,345
Well, that's a start.

169
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,476
I hear there was some
excitement this morning.

170
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,187
When I started helping you
improve your social skills,

171
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,606
I'm fairly certain I didn't
include a boxing lesson.

172
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,608
You weren't hurt,
were you?

173
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,943
No.

174
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,737
Still a bit tense?

175
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,782
Perhaps.

176
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,617
I understand
the burden you carry...

177
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,412
constantly being obligated
to deal with those

178
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,580
who fall short of
excellence.

179
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,749
I often find
my own patience

180
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,294
being tested by someone
like Mr. Kovin.

181
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,921
Of course, I generally respond
with a devastating quip

182
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,423
rather than a left hook.

183
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,134
( beeping )

184
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,802
We must both accept
the fact that

185
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,014
very few life-forms will
ever meet our high standards.

186
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,516
So when you
get irritated,

187
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,267
just try to be tolerant,

188
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,312
and remember...they can't help
being what they are.

189
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,442
Hm...I'm reading some
increased engramatic activity

190
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,529
and your adrenaline levels
are slightly elevated.

191
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,988
What does that indicate?

192
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,032
It's consistent with a state
of heightened tension.

193
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,992
Lie down and
I'll run some scans.

194
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,204
In a typical human,

195
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,997
I would consider this
a mood swing,

196
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,583
but with your unique physiology,
I'd like to rule out

197
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,211
the possibility of
a chemical imbalance.

198
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,088
( beeping )

199
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,841
( gasps )

200
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,843
Have you been experiencing
any other symptoms...

201
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,430
headaches,
disorientation?

202
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,181
No.

203
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,308
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

204
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,768
( heavy breathing )

205
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,686
( beeping )

206
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,398
Physiological scans
seem normal.

207
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,691
I'm going to check
your Borg implants now.

208
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,235
( gasps )

209
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,487
Seven, what's wrong?

210
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,406
Let me out.

211
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,950
I will. Stay calm.

212
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,285
( gasping )

213
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,623
No more procedures.

214
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,292
All right.
Stay away!

215
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,210
You mustn't do this.

216
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,378
Do what?

217
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,464
Seven,
what are you so afraid of?

218
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,552
I don't know.

219
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,725
She experienced an episode
of acute anxiety

220
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,145
with all the trimmings--
Intense apprehension,

221
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,813
shortness of breath,
dizziness.

222
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,357
I finally managed
to sedate her.

223
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,692
Could this have been caused
by her cortical implants?

224
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,320
I don't think so.

225
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,739
I think the problem has to do
with memory suppression.

226
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,492
I've detected
a high concentration

227
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,701
of biogenic amines
in Seven's hippocampus,

228
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,454
a substance
I haven't noticed before.

229
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,623
It's blocking several portions
of her memory center.

230
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,832
Do you know
where it came from?

231
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,543
No, but it seems to be
dissipating.

232
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,003
Seven's unusual

233
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,630
behavior may be the result

234
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,756
of the blocked memories
beginning to surface,

235
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,967
memories which she can't
identify yet.

236
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,302
Can you treat her?

237
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,845
Treatment would
involve integrating

238
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,764
the repressed memories
into Seven's consciousness.

239
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,766
I may be able to use
a standard therapeutic

240
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,101
regression technique.

241
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,727
I wasn't aware
that you were programmed

242
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,647
with psychotherapeutic
capabilities.

243
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,441
I wasn't, but in the absence
of a ship's counselor,

244
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,943
I've been developing
a psychiatric subroutine

245
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,111
to add to my program.

246
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,530
I'll be even more
valuable to you

247
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,739
than I am now.

248
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,992
Keep me informed,
doctor.

249
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,787
Hm.

250
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,289
DOCTOR:
A Jungian therapist

251
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,707
would attempt to retrieve
unconscious memories

252
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:52,253
by exploring synchronicities
in recent events.

253
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,755
On the other hand,
Amanin of Betazed would argue

254
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,092
that a combination of
sensory isolation

255
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,346
and focused breathing techniques
would be more effective.

256
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,098
I've integrated
the finer points of both

257
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,185
to create my own approach
to memory reconstruction.

258
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,521
What does this approach
involve?

259
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,231
First,
putting you at ease

260
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,983
by performing the treatment
here in your own environment.

261
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,235
Once the
cortical probes

262
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,195
have reinforced
the neural pathways,

263
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,531
I'll use a directed
imagery technique

264
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,241
to guide you through
the regression.

265
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,328
You may proceed.

266
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,123
Please,
close your eyes.

267
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,251
Clear your mind.

268
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,129
Try not to think
or to analyze.

269
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,839
My mind
is now clear.

270
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,177
Seven, this isn't
an exercise in efficiency.

271
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,596
Close your eyes.

272
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,307
Breathe deeply.

273
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,143
Now concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

274
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,229
Let go of the present.

275
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,274
Leave the cargo bay behind.

276
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,651
Allow yourself...

277
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,486
to drift.

278
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,822
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

279
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,952
Describe the first image
that enters your mind.

280
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,039
A medical tricorder.

281
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,751
Duratanium casing,

7.6 centimeters
by 9.8 centimeters

283
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,922
by 3.2 centimeters.

display--

285
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,676
That's enough.

286
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,010
So...

287
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,141
You're in Sickbay.

288
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,727
How does the tricorder
make you feel?

289
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,105
SEVEN:
<i>It disturbs me.</i>

290
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,690
DOCTOR:
<i>Why does it</i>
<i>disturb you?</i>

291
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,776
I'm afraid
it will hurt me.

292
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,152
Is there anything
else there

293
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,862
that causes you
to anticipate pain?

294
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,991
The diagnostic bed.

295
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,076
SEVEN:
<i>It's closing around me.</i>

296
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,454
DOCTOR:<i> </i>
<i>You feel restrained,</i>
<i>confined.</i>

297
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,206
SEVEN:
<i>Yes. I'm uneasy.</i>

298
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,375
DOCTOR:
<i>About what?</i>

299
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,129
It's Kovin.

300
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,922
DOCTOR:
What is he doing?

301
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,216

<i>He's restraining me.</i>

302

<i>I want to get away from him,</i>
<i>but I can't.</i>

303
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,770
SEVEN:
<i>Kovin's using some kind</i>
<i>of instrument on me.</i>

304
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,565
( gasps )

305
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,693
Seven?

306
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,446
I didn't recall this before.

307
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,156
Recall what?

308
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:29,035
Kovin, he...

309
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,830
He performed
a surgical procedure on me.

310
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,666
He...
extracted Borg technology

311
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,043
from my body.

312
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,588
He violated me.

313
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,179
DOCTOR:
We're making progress.

314
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,889
Now, tell me.

315
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,558
This surgical procedure...

316
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,768
When did it happen?

317
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,186
I don't know.

318
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,271
The details are vague.
There are only images.

319
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,065
And you're sure
it was Kovin?

320
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,443
Did you see Kovin?

321
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,611
Yes.

322
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,780
You said
he was restraining you,

323
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,947
using an instrument

324
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,742
of some sort.
He was.

325
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,702
Were you on<i> Voyager</i> 
when this happened?

326
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,121
No.

327
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,623
It must have been
when we were

328
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,500
testing the weapons
on the surface.

329
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,919
Then concentrate on
that away mission.

330
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,757
Focus on the first image
that enters your mind.

331
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,345
Describe it for me.

332
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,097
A large, granitic stone...

333
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,767
approximately
one-half meter high.

334
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,020
Now, allow that memory
to develop beyond the image.

335
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,898
Integrate it into
your consciousness.

336
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,651
Let the memory
take shape.

337
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,363
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

338
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,824
SEVEN:
<i>I'm at the weapons range.</i>

339
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,242
<i>Kovin had taken us there</i>

340
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,327
<i>to evaluate</i>
<i>various handheld firearms</i>

341
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,663
<i>he wished to offer</i>
<i>in trade.</i>

342
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,464
<i>He attempted to impress us</i>
<i>with a demonstration</i>

343
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,925
<i>of the weapons'</i>
<i>destructive capabilities.</i>

344
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,303
<i>My role was to provide</i>
<i>a more objective analysis.</i>

345
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,179
Terawatt powered
particle-beam rifle.

346
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,933
Four microsecond
recharge cycle.

347
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,768
Ten kilometer range.

348
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,896
Definitely not standard
Starfleet issue.

349
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,397
What do you think?

350
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,485
72 percent fragmentation,
28 percent vaporization.

351
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,862
Crude, but efficient.

352
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,282
It's not as accurate
as our compression rifles,

353
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,700
but it's a lot easier
to handle.

354
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,828
I wouldn't mind
carrying one of these

355
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,746
the next time we run
into the Hirogen.

356
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,373
SEVEN:
The targeting mechanism
could be augmented

357
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,668
with a thermal
guidance sensor.

358
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,086
That would increase
accuracy by 24 percent.

359
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,839
I can do that now.

360
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,342
Care to join me?

361
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,885
You can make sure
that the adjustments

362
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,553
are performed
to your specifications.

363
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,054
PARIS:
If you don't mind,
I'd like to

364
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,974
test some of
the other firearms.

365
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,892
Go right ahead.

366
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,102
This way.

367
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,025
SEVEN:
<i>Kovin took me</i>
<i>to a small laboratory.</i>

368
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,944
DOCTOR:
<i>Describe it.</i>

369
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,779
SEVEN:
<i>It was poorly illuminated.</i>

370
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,491
<i>I saw various instruments,</i>
<i>technology unfamiliar to me.</i>

371
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,619
<i>I assumed this was where he</i>
<i>developed new weapon designs.</i>

372
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,246
( beeping )

373
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,541
This weapon
is thoron-based.

374
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,376
Most of these handheld
disruptors are.

375
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,212
Thoron can be unstable
in weapons.

376
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,422
Not if you polarize
the emitter matrix.

377
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:32,677
That compensates
for any instabilities.

378
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,178
Watch.

379
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,101
What are you doing?

380
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,187
He turned
the weapon on me.

381
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,856
He fired?

382
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,858
Yes,
I remember it now.

383
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,484
What happened next?

384
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,196
I'm not sure.

385
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,447
Concentrate.

386
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,117
See the laboratory
in your mind.

387
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,537
There was a light
in my eyes.

388
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,168
DOCTOR:
<i>Was Kovin still</i>
<i>in the room with you?</i>

389
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,963
SEVEN:<i> Yes.</i> 
Restrain her. Quickly.

390
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:12,800
SEVEN:
<i>And another Entharan</i>
<i>was assisting him.</i>

391
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,218
This is
Borg technology.

392
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,471
KOVIN:
That's what I've been
telling you.

393
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,265
Let me go.

394
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,684
They bound me
to an examination table.

395
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,143
What did they do to you?

396
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:27,273
Did they scan you?

397
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,193
The bio-ablation pump
is engaged and pressurized.

398
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,788
( groaning, panting)

399
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,918
The growth medium
is activating the implants.

400
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,962
The nanoprobes are
multiplying.

401
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,633
( gasping )

402
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,426
They put a device
near my head.

403
00:18:55,426 --> 00:19:00,598
SEVEN:
<i>They removed</i>
<i>my ocular implant.</i>

404
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,683
And...

405
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,352
some of the implants in my arm
were activated.

406
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,774
Which ones?
Can you be more specific?

407
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,359
KOVIN:
Use the maximum setting
of the metagenic pulse

408
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,861
to stimulate
the implants.

409
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,783
WOMAN:
The assimilation tubules
are ready.

410
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,662
Prepare to harvest
the nanoprobes.

411
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,208
SEVEN:
<i>They extracted nanoprobes</i>

412
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,169
<i>through my</i>
<i>assimilation tubules.</i>

413
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,507
<i>I was powerless,</i>
<i>unable to stop them.</i>

414
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,342
DOCTOR:
<i>You couldn't be expected to.</i>

415
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,054
<i>You were restrained.</i>
<i>Then what happened?</i>

416
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,974
SEVEN:
<i>They took the nanoprobes</i>
<i>to another subject,</i>

417
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:46,769
<i>also restrained,</i>
<i>and they...</i>

418
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,312
<i>...they assimilated him.</i>

419
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,029
Well done.

420
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,161
<i>The next thing I remember,</i>
<i>I was back in Kovin's lab.</i>

421
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,454
<i>He claimed the particle-beam</i>
<i>rifle overloaded,</i>

422
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,875
<i>that it burned my hand,</i>
<i>but it was a lie.</i>

423
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,376
<i>They had attacked me.</i>

424
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:14,130
I'm sorry.
I should have been more careful.

425
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,008
Do you have
a dermal regenerator?

426
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,718
Of course.

427
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,690
I'll inform the captain.

428
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,405
( door opens, closes )

429
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,781
There's no doubt

430
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,325
that Seven was the victim
of a brutal assault.

431
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,493
How is she?

432
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,162
As well as can
be expected.

433
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,122
She's regenerating
in her alcove.

434
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:52,418
I predict her emotional recovery
will take some time.

435
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,628
I certainly hope you intend
to hold Kovin responsible

436
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,338
for what he's done.
First, I want to know 

437
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,758
how much of her story
we can corroborate.

438
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,176
Tom, you were with her
on the planet.

439
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,594
How long was she alone
with Kovin?

440
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,554
At least two hours.

441
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,224
When she came back, did she say
anything about what happened?

442
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,308
Only that they'd finished
their work on the rifle.

443
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,685
She seemed fine.

444
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,687
Clearly, Mr. Kovin used
some artificial means

445
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,940
to suppress her memory
of the event.

446
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,234
That would explain the unusual
engramatic activity

447
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,152
I found
in her neurological scans.

448
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,779
Did you find any other
physical evidence

449
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,115
of the medical procedures
she described?

450
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,533
No.

451
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,703
I suspect Mr. Kovin
used Seven's own nanoprobes

452
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,248
to repair
any cellular damage.

453
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,917
She distinctly remembers
Kovin extracting them.

454
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,503
You seen to be accepting Seven's
recovered memories as fact.

455
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,006
Are you suggesting
otherwise?

456
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,634
Historically, recovered memories
have often proven unreliable.

457
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,386
Yes, in cases where
a traumatic experience

458
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,264
has been repressed
for years.

459
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,224
But we're dealing with
a very recent memory here

460
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,601
that was blocked by
artificial means.

461
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,936
When I removed
that mechanism,

462
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,938
Seven remembered
everything that happened.

463
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,274
Human memory
is rarely perfect.

464
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,067
What are you saying,
Tuvok?

465
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,986
That Seven
is making this up?

466
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,446
No,
but we must remember

467
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,116
that she's experienced
hallucinatory images before.

468
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,700
That was in direct response

469
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,203
to a signal from the ship
where she was assimilated.

470
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,289
She's not having
hallucinations now.

471
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,040
She's remembering
what happened to her.

472
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,458
I've confirmed this

473
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,335
by analyzing the specific
engramatic activity

474
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,879
in her hippocampus. We're not
talking about conjecture.

475
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,380
We're talking about science.

476
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,300
Let's not
get bogged down.

477
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,928
Seven has made
serious accusations,

478
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,388
and I won't
dismiss them.

479
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,099
If Kovin assaulted her

480
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,852
and took a sample
of her Borg technology,

481
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,312
we can't stand by
and do nothing.

482
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,522
In the wrong hands,
a single nanoprobe

483
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,149
could lead to disaster.

484
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,193
Doctor, I want you
to keep searching

485
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,361
for any physical evidence
to back up Seven's claim.

486
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,866
I will talk to Kovin.
Dismissed.

487
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,787
( door opens, closes )

488
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,165
This is offensive
and absurd!

489
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,708
She's obviously
lying.

490
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,918
Why would she
do that?

491
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,628
Maybe you can answer that.

492
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,921
She's your crew member.

493
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,340
First,
she attacks me,

494
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,382
then she invents
these ridiculous stories,

495
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,384
and you try
to place the blame on me.

496
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,428
Is this some kind
of negotiating tactic?

497
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,930
I have
no hidden agenda.

498
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,807
I'm simply trying
to clarify what happened.

499
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,268
I told you already.
We went to my laboratory

500
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,021
to adjust the guidance system
on the particle-beam rifle.

501
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,898
And that took two hours?

502
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,568
She insisted on
absolute precision.

503
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,486
We've confirmed
that Seven was exposed

504
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,655
to an intense
thoron discharge.

505
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,950
She was. After the rifle's
power cell overloaded.

506
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,161
We reported
the accident immediately.

507
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,539
She now remembers that you fired
the weapon at her deliberately.

508
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,125
That's preposterous.
The doctor tells me

509
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,878
the blast could have been enough
to render her unconscious.

510
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,171
But it didn't.

511
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,590
We were both startled
for a moment,

512
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,384
and after I apologized
for the accident,

513
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,468
she asked if I had
a dermal regenerator,

514
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,888
which I did,
and I used it on her arm,

515
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,015
the one with
the mechanical implants.

516
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,934
Which you recognized
as Borg.

517
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,394
I was aware
she'd been a Borg.

518
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,937
She told me herself.

519
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,982
Did you ever express curiosity
in that technology,

520
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,234
or try to examine it

521
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,652
more closely?
No.

522
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,406
You never considered
the potential value

523
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,074
it might have
as a weapon?

524
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,786
Is that what you think
I've done?

525
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,579
You may not realize

526
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,124
how dangerous
Borg technology can be.

527
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,042
If you've taken even
a single nanoprobe,

528
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,668
I need to know
about it right now.

529
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,503
I haven't taken anything.

530
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,425
I'd like to examine
your laboratory

531
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,302
to be absolutely sure.

532
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,552
No.

533
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,805
This has already gone
too far.

534
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,516
Then I'll have to contact
the authorities.

535
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,518
Maybe they'll be
more helpful.

536
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,813
Are you willing to risk
our trade agreement

537
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,400
all on the basis of
one crew member's delusions?

538
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,943
Yes.

539
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,445
Now...

540
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:50,406
are you going to cooperate
with our investigation?

541
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,492
I don't seem to have
much choice.

542
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,255
You stated that the rifle's
power cell overloaded

543
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,882
as a result of a faulty
oscillator adjustment.

544
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,135
That's right.

545
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:18,642
Can you describe in more detail
how that occurred?

546
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,354
I was showing her how to
polarize the emitter matrix.

547
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,398
I must have tuned the
induction frequency too high.

548
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,317
Were you unfamiliar
with that procedure?

549
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,567
No.

550
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,986
I have done it 100 times.

551
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,404
It was
a careless mistake.

552
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,406
How many times do I need
to apologize?

553
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,741
I am not seeking
a statement of remorse.

554
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,243
Then what do you want?

555
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,371
Are you trying to catch me
in a lie?

556
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,289
Trick me into confessing?

557
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,167
You can't, because there's
nothing for me to confess!

558
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,169
I haven't done
anything wrong!

559
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,964
One of our crew members
claims that you have.

560
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,552
Your crew member,
Seven of Nine...

561
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,638
she's very fortunate.

562
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,224
How so?

563
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,559
She has an entire crew
leaping to her defense.

564
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,021
I have no one.

565
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,857
The Entharan representative
will be here shortly.

566
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,151
You mean the Magistrate?

567
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,819
He won't help me.

568
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,531
He's more interested in
protecting diplomatic relations

569
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:14,990
with people like you.

570
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,994
Surely,
he'll want to know the truth.

571
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,413
That's all we're seeking.

572
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,955
You don't
understand.

573
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,958
On my world, we depend on trade
with alien species.

574
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,338
There are strict protocols
about those relationships.

575
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,465
Even being<i> accused</i> of
violating them

576
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,050
is a serious offense.

577
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,678
You will have the opportunity
to refute any charges.

578
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,305
It won't matter.

579
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,849
Once they're made,
the damage is done.

580
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,809
I won't be trusted
any longer.

581
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,353
I'll be ruined.

582
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,813
Please...

583
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,944
I never hurt
your crew member.

584
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,862
Don't do this.

585
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,490
I'm afraid
I have no choice.

586
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,451
But I assure you,

587
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,826
our investigation
will be conducted

588
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,580
in a fair and
impartial manner.

589
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,500
You strike me as a man
of your word.

590
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:12,214
If you tell me
I won't be prejudged,

591
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,092
then I believe you.

592
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:19,930
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

593
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,891
How are you feeling?

594
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,810
I am undamaged.

595
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,396
But how do you<i> feel?</i>

596
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:31,150
Seven, your physical
scars have healed,

597
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,944
but the psychological effects
are still there.

598
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,404
You'll have to deal
with them.

599
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,947
For what purpose?

600
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,532
In order to heal.

601
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,243
Kovin attacked you...

602
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,621
violated your rights
as an individual.

603
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,623
It's important that you
recognize that

604
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,292
so you can understand
any hostility or resentment

605
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,502
you might be feeling.

606
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,420
Resentment
is a human trait.

607
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,797
It has no structure,
no function.

608
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,633
I want no part of it.

609
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,217
You're going to have
to begin accepting

610
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,844
the fact that your
human feelings exist,

611
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,555
and that suppressing them
can damage you.

612
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:05,142
If I am not aware of
these feelings,

613
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,060
how can I
express them?

614
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,604
Let me ask you this.

615
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,232
What would have happened

616
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,277
if Kovin had tried to
take Borg technology

617
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,237
directly from
the Collective?

618
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,905
He would have been
assimilated.

619
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,116
Precisely.
Which is why he chose you.

620
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,576
He could get
what he wanted

621
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,620
without running
any risks.

622
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,833
It was my individuality
which made me vulnerable.

623
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,252
Exactly.

624
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,380
He violated
that individuality.

625
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,714
What he did is an affront
to everything you are.

626
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,258
Borg and human.

627
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,553
It was the act of a coward.

628
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:41,845
Yes!

629
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,972
Someone who was
willing to use you

630
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,182
in the cruelest way

631
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,685
so that he could
create new weapons

632
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,395
and sell them.

633
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:53,899
I believe I'm beginning
to experience anger.

634
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,734
Anger toward Kovin.

635
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,821
Good. That's a perfectly
healthy, normal response.

636
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,365
And when Kovin gets
what he deserves,

637
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:04,159
you're going to feel
much better.

(<i> dramatic theme continues</i>

642
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,007
There are no

643
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,884
I told you.
Just workbenches.

644
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,595
Is this
the entire facility?

645
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,845
Yes.

646
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,389
We should scan
for signs

647
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,141
that the room may have been
altered recently.

648
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,022
During her regression,

649
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,483
Seven described instruments
similar to these.

650
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,777
Of course she did.
She was here.

651
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,404
DOCTOR:
She said a device

652
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,990
like this was used to remove
her optic implant.

653
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,492
That's a micro-caliper.

654
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,745
I used it
to remove the casings

655
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,539
over the guidance system
on the particle-beam rifle.

656
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,670
And isn't this
an electrodynamic probe?

657
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,338
Yes.

658
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,924
Hm.

659
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,218
It's equipped with
a monofilament stimulator.

660
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,596
Could it be used to manipulate
the neurotransmitter levels

661
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:06,846
in a human brain?

662
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,098
Not as it is.

663
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,808
But with the proper
modifications?

664
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,143
With the proper
modifications,

665
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,519
I could reconfigure
your combadge

666
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,146

neurotransmitters.

overloaded.

The dispersal pattern
is consistent

00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,485
with a
dermal rupture.

686
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,571
These nanoprobes were
recently regenerated.

687
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,615
If this were nothing more
than cellular residue

688
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,783
from Seven's injury,

689
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,951
the nanoprobes
would be dormant.

690
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,330
But these have been activated
in a very specific pattern.

691
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,415
I've seen enough.

692
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,376
Kovin,

693
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,836
there is sufficient
evidence here

00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,466
Yes, but I'd like
to join you.

715
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,845
JANEWAY:
<i>Very well. We'll beam you</i>
<i>to</i> Voyager.<i> Stand by.</i>

716
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,180
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

717
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:18,478
Kovin's ship is on a heading
of one-eight mark two-five.

718
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,979
Set an intercept course.

719
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,107
Get ready to lock on
a tractor beam.

720
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,859
He's only at
half impulse.

721
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,569
His ship may not have
warp engines.

722
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,447
We're at 9,000 kilometers
and closing.

723
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,365
I'm engaging
the tractor beam.

724
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,330
I can't find him.

725
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,918
All of my sensor readings
have disappeared.

726
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,252
He generated
a photonic pulse.

727
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,045
It took them off-line.

728
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,089
We'll have to reinitialize
the entire sensor array.

729
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,049
Do it.
( beeping )

730
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,806
Our investigation has suddenly
turned into a manhunt.

731
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,308
The fact that he's running shows
that he's got something to hide.

732
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,227
Until we find out what that is,
we can't risk letting him go.

733
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:03,189
(<i> dramatic theme continues</i>
<i>playing</i> )

734
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,238
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 51679.4.</i>

735
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,574
<i>We've detected the warp</i>
<i>signature from Kovin's ship</i>

736
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,743
<i>and we're now in pursuit.</i>
<i>In the meantime,</i>

737
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,622
<i>Tuvok and I have been examining</i>
<i>the tools from Kovin's lab.</i>

738
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,040
This isn't getting
us anywhere.

739
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,794
Seven's cellular residue
is on every one of these,

740
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,045
but that would be true
if she simply handled them.

741
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,800
My examination of the rifle
is equally inconclusive.

742
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,510
It may have overloaded
accidentally...

743
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,845
Or not.

744
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:38,016
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this, Tuvok.

745
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,393
We aren't finding anything
that implicates Kovin.

746
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,355
I told him
our investigation

747
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,815
would be impartial.

748
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,984
I believe it has been.
It has...

749
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:51,237
But I'll admit I had some
preconceptions about him.

750
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,949
They may have influenced
my judgment.

751
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,408
The strongest evidence
so far

752
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,661
is the nanoprobes
the doctor found.

753
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,204
The fact that they
were regenerated

754
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,916
suggests that Kovin
was experimenting with them.

755
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,084
We don't know a great deal
about the interaction

756
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,086
between nanoprobes
and Borg physiology.

757
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,505
It might be
worthwhile

758
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,132
to simulate the effect
of the rifle blast

759
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,425
on Seven's arm

760
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,302
and see what happens
to the nanoprobes.

761
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,554
Good.

762
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,389
Maybe that'll give us
some answers.

763
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,310
Is this really necessary,
Captain?

764
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,979
She's suffered
enough trauma already.

765
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,397
We don't want
to make accusations

766
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,524
against
an innocent man.

767
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,984
We have to do
everything we can

768
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,444
to find some
concrete evidence.

769
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,279
He is not
an innocent man.

770
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,907
I know
what he did to me.

771
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,366
But we must have
proof.

772
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,077
And this experiment
may provide us with it.

773
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,412
We've configured
this hypospray

774
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,164
to simulate the energy
of a thoron blast.

775
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,042
We'll collect thin layers
of your skin tissue

776
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,419
and examine the effects.
It won't be painful.

777
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,422
I am not afraid.
I am angry.

778
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,465
I know.
Try to be patient.

779
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,217
We may have
some answers soon.

780
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,056
All right,
let's see what we've got.

781
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,451
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

782
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,954
I think you better
take a look.

783
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,548
What do you see?

784
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,138
The nanoprobes...
are regenerating

785
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,932
in exactly
the same pattern

786
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,349
we saw
in Kovin's laboratory.

787
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,936
It appears to be
a spontaneous response

788
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,353
which could have
been caused by

789
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,272
the energy released
from the thoron weapon.

790
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,608
It doesn't matter.
Kovin is guilty.

791
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,526
Seven...

792
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,820
there's no doubt
in my mind

793
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,279
that you believe
what you're saying,

794
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,698
but is it possible...
just possible...

795
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,409
That the memories you
and the doctor recovered

796
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,661
aren't accurate?

797
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,997
How could that be?

798
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,373
During your time
with the Borg,

799
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,835
you were subjected
to invasive

800
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,294
medical procedures.

801
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,212
You undoubtedly witnessed
other victims

802
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,798
being assimilated.

803
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,050
Could that be
what you're remembering?

804
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,095
You know that's not right.

805
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,638
Tell them.

806
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,641
Everything led me to believe
that you were a victim.

807
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,102
Your extreme response
to Kovin in engineering,

808
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,437
your irrational fear
when I was examining you...

809
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,940
Something prompted that
behavior, and I believed

810
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,317
it was a repressed memory
of your ordeal

811
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,778
with Kovin.
That is what it was.

812
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,824
But if I'm to be impartial,
I have to acknowledge

813
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,910
that your neurology is still
something of a mystery to me.

814
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,373
I can't be certain what
triggered those memories.

815
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,833
And we can't ignore
the fact

816
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,418
that this evidence supports
Kovin's story...

817
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,087
and not yours.

818
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:57,883
You were the one who helped me
to understand what happened

819
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,634
and now you're denying it.

820
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,261
Seven, no one's abandoning you,
but we have to do what's right.

821
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,264
We have to find Kovin
and tell him what we learned.

822
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,310
The doctor told me
I would feel better

823
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,479
when Kovin gets
what he deserves.

824
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,108
I want him
to be punished.

825
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,610
I won't settle for
anything less.

826
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,865
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

827
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,540

Mr. Paris.

829
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,587
He's in range.

830
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,838
Visual.

831
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,382
Hail him.
( beeping )

832
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,218
No response.

833
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,220
He's charging weapons.

834
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,013
Open a channel.
All frequencies.

835
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,974
Mr. Kovin,
this is Captain Janeway.

836
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,309
We believe we've made a mistake
in accusing you.

837
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,771
We only want to correct
the situation.

838
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,856
Stand down your weapons.

839
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,818
( machine beeps )
He's responding.

840
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,237
Stop your pursuit.

841
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:01,738
I can damage your ship.

842
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,782
We're not here
to take you by force.

843
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,617
Then let me go.

844
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,202
Kovin, listen to me.

845
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,995
The proceedings
must be resolved.

846
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,915
This is a trap.
JANEWAY: No.

847
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,459
We've discovered information
that supports your story.

848
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,419
I don't believe you.

849
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,256
We've reexamined
the evidence.

850
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:21,340
Finding the nanoprobes led us
to the wrong conclusion.

851
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,887
We know now that
your thoron rifle did overload.

852
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,346
DOCTOR:
Please...

853
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,975
( console beeping )

854
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,060
He's firing a spread
of photon pulses.

855
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,979
( crash )

856
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,274
Shields down
to 82 percent.

857
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,192
JANEWAY:
Back off. Give him some
breathing room.

858
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,569
He's coming about,
heading right for us.

859
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,367
Direct hit
to the power grid.

860
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,411
Innocent or not, he's going
to destroy your vessel.

861
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,080
Captain?

862
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,332
He's come under enough fire
from us already.

863
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,084
Harry, try to beam him
off his ship.

864
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,836
He's thrown up
a scattering field.

865
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,171
I can't get a lock.

866
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,713
Keep trying.

00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,967
Shields are down.

869
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,636
He's shunting all power
to his photonic emitters.

870
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,388
We must protect ourselves.
Disable his ship.

871
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,184
No. Evasive maneuvers,
hard to port, full thrusters.

872
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,601
Aye.

873
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,522
KIM:
I've almost got a lock on him.
A few more seconds.

874
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,857
He's charging weapons
again.

875
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,817
Captain,
his emitters are overloading.

876
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,278
All his systems
are destabilizing.

877
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,529
Open a channel.

878
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,531
Kovin, shut down
your scattering field.

879
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,075
Let us beam
you aboard.

880
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,119
Kovin!
He's firing.

There's nothing more
we could have done.

Stand down red alert.

00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,866
Mr. Paris, set a course
back to the Entharan colony.

889
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,326
( beeping )

890
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,641
DOCTOR:
<i>Chief medical officer's log,</i>
<i>stardate 51658.2.</i>

891
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,311
<i>I've spent the past three days</i>
<i>being cross-examined</i>

892
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,063
<i>by the Entharan authorities,</i>

893
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,815
<i>but the matter</i>
<i>is finally resolved.</i>

894
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,283
Doctor.

895
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,909
Yes.

896
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,869
I'm here for
my weekly maintenance.

897
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,621
Oh, of course.

898
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,956
This way, please.

899
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,922
Metabolic rate
is stable.

900
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:11,344
Electro-optic implant
is aligned.

901
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,222
Your blood pressure
is...slightly off,

902
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,057
but within tolerance.

903
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,516
You're in
perfect health.

904
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,726
See you next week.

905
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,896
I do not
feel perfect.

906
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,189
What do you mean?

907
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,567
I am preoccupied
by Kovin's death.

908
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,740
Join the club.

909
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,867
It's all
I can think about.

910
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,370
As a Borg,
I was responsible

911
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,538
for the destruction
of countless millions

912
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,416
and I felt nothing,

913
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,251
but now...

914
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,795
I regret the destruction
of this single being.

915
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:49,132
It's called remorse,
Seven.

916
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:53,094
It comes into play
when you make a mistake...

917
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,222
and you feel guilt
about what you've done.

918
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,474
Another new emotion

919
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:00,393
for you to experience.

920
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,562
I do not enjoy this remorse
any more than I enjoyed anger.

921
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,191
Will the feeling subside?

922
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,319
Yes, but not quickly.

923
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,737
I would rather
not have to wait.

924
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,157
I'm afraid
you don't have much choice.

925
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,284
(<i> somber theme playing</i> )

926
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,711
But maybe I do.

927
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,839
I've isolated the algorithms
responsible for my desire

928
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,010
to expand beyond
my original programming.

929
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,970
I want to delete them.

930
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,390
Why?

931
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,640
It was my...

932
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,976
urge to experiment,

933
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,853
my infatuation
with improving myself

934
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:47,190
that led to this tragedy.

935
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,528
I fancied myself a psychologist,
a ship's counselor,

936
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,821
but I wasn't prepared
for the complexities that come

937
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,407
with such
a responsibility.

938
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,700
In my enthusiasm
to help Seven of Nine,

939
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,619
I lost
my medical objectivity.

940
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,163
I became
a self-righteous advocate.

941
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,874
I didn't stop to think
for one second...

942
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,919
...that I might be wrong.

943
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,923
That mustn't happen again.

944
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,426
You want to go back
to the state you were in

945
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:16,261
when we first activated you?

946
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,929
I'll still be capable
of treating

947
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,556
any and all
medical conditions,

948
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:23,226
but without the risk
of overstepping my bounds.

949
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,312
It's for the best,
Captain.

950
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,732
Oh, I'm not so sure.

951
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,484
This crew has
benefited greatly

952
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,861
from your improvements
over the years.

953
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,780
Request denied.

954
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,323
Captain--
I won't turn back

955
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,784
the clock because of
one mistake,

956
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,369
no matter how serious...

957
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,206
...and no matter
how you might feel.

958
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,342
I'm a physician.

959
00:43:56,342 --> 00:44:01,306
I'm supposed to preserve life,
not destroy it.

960
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,724
I can't live with
the thought that...

961
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,144
I might do it again.

962
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,398
With any luck...

963
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,485
...that knowledge will prevent
it from happening again.

964
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:17,614
We all rallied around Seven,
doctor, myself included.

965
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:22,368
I wanted her to know that
she was part of this family,

966
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,370
that we would support her,
fight for her,

967
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,622
no matter what.

968
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:28,458
We let our good intentions
blind us.

969
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:32,837
We all bear responsibility
for Kovin's death.

970
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,757
And we all
have to live with it.

971
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,553
But to delete that burden

972
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,764
would be the last thing
any of us should do.
