Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

12
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,550
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53447.2.</i>

13
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,594
<i>The crew's enjoying</i>
<i>a much needed shore leave</i>

14
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,930
<i>on the Norcadian</i>
<i>homeworld.</i>

15
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,599
<i>While I visit Pendari,</i>
<i>a planet in the</i>
<i>neighboring system,</i>

16
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,061
<i>I'm leaving</i>
<i>Commander Chakotay</i>
<i>in charge of</i> Voyager.

17
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,105
You may want to run a diagnostic
on the shield generators.

18
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,523
It's way overdue.
Consider it done.

19
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,568
And don't forget to keep tabs
on Neelix's little project
in the Mess Hall.

20
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,112
He's still trying
to enhance

21
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,780
the plasma burners
in his stove?

22
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,241
With some of Seven's
Borg technology.

23
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,535
I don't want him accidentally
turning the galley into
an assimilation chamber.

24
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,913
I'll assign
a security detail
to keep tabs on him--

25
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,415
unless you think
we need to take more
drastic measures.

26
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,334
And most important,
be sure to tell your Captain

27
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,921
when she's being overprotective.
I'll do that.

28
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,923
Thanks again
for minding the store.

29
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,884
Even the Captain deserves
a vacation once in a while.

30
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,428
And her First Officer?
He's looking forward

31
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,430
to putting his feet up
on your desk.

32
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,644
Chakotay.

33
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,271
Fun last night, wasn't it?

34
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,606
There's another match
scheduled at 1500.

35
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,734
I've got a systems diagnostic.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

36
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,028
but you're in command until
the Captain gets back.

37
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,947
What's your point?
Delegate.

38
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,158
I happen to know that
Harry's free this afternoon.

39
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,952
Lieutenant, you're
not suggesting
I abuse my power.

40
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,746
(<i> chuckling</i> )

41
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,916
Tell me that's
not lunch.

42
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,377
It's<i> leola</i> ointment
for my skin.

43
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,754
What happened?

44
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,464
I was so excited to visit

45
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,509
one of those beautiful
Norcadian beaches, uh,

46
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,512
that I forgot to take
my dermaline hypospray.

47
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,098
I fell asleep...

48
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,143
under two suns.

49
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,603
Ouch.
(<i> chuckling weakly</i> )

50
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,898
A little more color
than I was hoping for,

51
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,235
but it'll be a beautiful amber
before you know it.

52
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,361
How's your shore leave been?

53
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,449
Well, we've spent the last few
days at the Tsunkatse matches.

54
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,409
Tsunkatse.

55
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,038
I heard some crewmen talking
about that during breakfast.

56
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,790
It's exciting--
a real test of
strength and agility.

57
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,959
You should come to the match
with us this afternoon.

58
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,171
From what I've heard,
Tsunkatse is crude
and pointless.

59
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,506
Well, I guess we won't be
saving you a seat.

60
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,050
What about
you, Tuvok?

61
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,718
You appreciate
the martial arts.

62
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,512
I have other plans.
There's a micronebula

63
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,724
approximately 1.6
light-years from here
on the verge of collapse.

64
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,391
SEVEN:
We'd like to take
a shuttle to study it.

65
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,937
Ah. An away mission
during shore leave?

66
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,440
Commander Tuvok and I don't
require recreational activities.

67
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,736
The Borg wouldn't know fun
if they assimilated
an amusement park.

68
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,240
It's your shore leave,

69
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,575
but try to enjoy yourselves.

70
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,160
That's an order.

71
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,883
Here's the navigational
data you asked for.

72
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,927
Thank you.

73
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,763
How long are you
planning on being gone?

74
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,765
Approximately 48 hours.

75
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,601
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Just like B'Elanna.

76
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,894
Clarify.

77
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,938
Well, she
overpacks, too.

78
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,148
I haven't overpacked.

79
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,068
I simply wish to be prepared
for any contingency.

80
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,239
And what contingency
is this for?

81
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,909
That's an iso-modulator,
enhanced to correct
hull ablation

82
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,453
in the event
we encounter
a meteoroid stream.

83
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,956
Well, couldn't you just
replicate an iso-modulator?

84
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,665
I prefer this one.

85
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,376
Oh, I get it.

86
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,378
You like to have your
own things with you.

87
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,463
B'Elanna's
the same way.

88
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,257
You know, she'd never admit it,

89
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,301
but she still takes
a stuffed animal with her

90
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,970
whenever she's
going to be away
for more than a day.

91
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,555
Toby the<i> targ.</i>

92
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,101
Can Toby the<i> targ</i>
<i>correct hull ablation?</i>

93
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,686
Your comparison is flawed.

94
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,445
Just the person
I was looking for.

95
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,488
You require my assistance?
Your company.

96
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,740
I was wondering
if you'd care to
join me on a tour

97
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,034
of Norcadia's
cultural hot spots.

98
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,996
I hear their museums
are among the finest
in this sector.

99
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,622
I'm busy.
With what?

100
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,207
Commander Tuvok and I
are leaving

101
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,959
to study a collapsing
micronebula.

102
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,627
During shore leave?

103
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,798
I thought we'd
discussed this.

104
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,967
Shore leave is
a perfect opportunity

105
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,052
for you to spend time
with other members
of the crew

106
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,054
to develop
your social skills.

107
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,183
Then I suppose I'll have
to develop them with
Commander Tuvok.

108
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,979
Vulcans aren't exactly known
for their winning personalities.

109
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,190
You'd prefer I spent my time

110
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,443
with more sociable individuals,
such as yourself?

111
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,778
You could do worse.

112
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,199
In that case, perhaps
you'd care to join us.

113
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,950
To study the
micronebula?

114
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,827
You can assist us
with our analysis

115
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,662
of veridium-oxide particulates.

116
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,747
On second thought,

117
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,958
you and Tuvok
have a good time.

118
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,379
I'll give the Commander
your regrets.

119
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,880
Uh, do that.

120
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,882
And if the nebula
isn't as riveting

121
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,386
as you'd hoped,
try to remember Lesson 36--

122
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,596
"Pleasant Parlor Games
to Pass the Time."

123
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,309
(<i> quietly</i> ):
You'll need it.

124
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,784
Two hours, 37 minutes,
13 seconds.

125
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,787
That's how long
we've gone without
verbal communication.

126
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,332
Why is that remarkable?

127
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,377
The Doctor encourages me
to engage in conversation

128
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,670
during awkward silences.

129
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,092
Did you find
the silence awkward?

130
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,303
No.

131
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,264
Nor did I.

132
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,308
(<i> console beeping</i> )

133
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,894
There's a vessel approaching
on an intercept course.

134
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,230
The hull configuration
is unfamiliar.

135
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,856
Distance?

136
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,900
Approximately
300,000 kilometers.

137
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,278
Hail them.

138
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,987
No response.

139
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,204
Tuvok to<i> Voyager.</i>

140
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,750
The vessel is
emitting some kind
of dampening field.

141
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,129
We've lost engines,
weapons, shields.

142
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,006
(<i> whoosh of active transport)</i>

143
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,269
It's an explosive device
of some sort.

144
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,438
Transporters are down.
I can't beam it off.

145
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,356
I'll try to disarm it.

146
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:04,456
Borg-enhanced physiology.

147
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,917
You should have
superior strength, agility,

148
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,461
stamina,

149
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,254
visual acuity.

150
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,092
Welcome to Tsunkatse.

151
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,969
Since the game's inception,

152
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,887
our audience has never had
the pleasure

153
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,680
of seeing a
drone compete.

154
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,683
<i>You</i> are going to be

155
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,021
a very popular attraction.

156
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,531
Where is Commander Tuvok?

157
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,324
MALE:
Your comrade
from the shuttle?

158
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,742
I'm afraid
he was injured
in the explosion.

159
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,787
I wish to see him<i> now.</i>

160
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,498
Certainly.

161
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,627
You'll learn nothing
is more important to me

162
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,171
than the comfort and happiness
of my fighters.

163
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:58,051
Yes, Penk's generosity
is... legendary.

164
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,803
(<i> laughing</i> )

165
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,180
Quiet!

166
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,311
He's envious because I've found
a new favorite.

167
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,523
I have no intention
of participating in your game.

168
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,317
Aggressive. I like that.

169
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,902
(<i> hatch opens</i> )

170
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,447
(<i> panting</i> )

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,912
He requires
medical attention.

172
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,581
That can be arranged.

173
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,457
Then arrange it.

174
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,292
You haven't won
a single bout

175
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,253
and already you're
making demands
like a champion.

176
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,795
Will you treat him or not?

177
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,797
Will you fight?

178
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,217
TUVOK:
Do not comply.

179
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,636
My condition is not severe.

180
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,346
Spoken like
a true competitor,

181
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,098
willing to ignore
his injuries

182
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,683
for the sake
of the contest.

183
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,476
Schedule a
bout for him.

184
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,811
A Red Match against
the Pensarkan.

185
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,731
HUNTER:
A Red Match

186
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,900
does not end until one
of the competitors is killed.

187
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,612
Your friend would not survive.

188
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,988
But<i> you</i> might.

189
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,033
HUNTER:
Give her a Blue Match, Penk.

190
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,411
You wouldn't want to lose
your new favorite

191
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,663
her first time in the pit.

192
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,086
Yes. We should
start you off slowly.

193
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,965
(<i> moaning</i> )

194
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,426
Treat him...

195
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,553
and I will comply.

196
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,565
What about the seventh match?
I'm picking the Vensiddian.

197
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,525
He lost
his last two times out.

198
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,736
But he's undefeated
against left-handed fighters.

199
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,613
You should
trust him, Harry.

200
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,782
Chakotay knows a thing or two
about southpaws.

201
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,493
He was 23 and 0
as a light heavyweight.

202
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,369
23 and one,
actually...

203
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,372
a Nausicaan with
a mean right hook.

204
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,334
You think that's bad?
Try taking a parrises
mallet to the ribs.

205
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,960
I didn't know you played.

206
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,962
Three-time Academy champion.

207
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,880
Now, that's a tough sport.

208
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,550
I boxed a few parrises players
in my day.

209
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,344
And?

210
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,886
Let's just say
they went back

211
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,722
to playing parrises
squares after that.

212
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,641
(<i> all laugh</i> )

213
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,559
Oh, is that a challenge,
Commander?

214
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,520
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
I wouldn't want

215
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,563
to put my Ops Officer out
of commission, now, would I?

216
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,065
Oh... I can take a punch.

217
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,695
Careful, Harry.
Legend has it that
the "Tattooed Terror"

218
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,698
has put more men in Sick Bay
than the Ankaran flu.

219
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,284
Yeah, you wouldn't want
to bruise your clarinet fingers.

220
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,745
(<i> laughter</i> )

221
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,331
Hey, you want
to go a few rounds,
or all you all talk?

222
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,916
Any time, any place.

223
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,002
Oh, you punch
like a Ferengi.

224
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,462
(<i> laughter</i> )

225
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,551
I don't care
what Harry says.

226
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,053
The Pensarkan-Bendali match
is too close to call.

227
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,014
I'll let you know
how it turns out.
Excuse me?

228
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,892
I rearranged the duty
schedules this morning.

229
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,269
You've got the Bridge
starting at 1400 hours.

230
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,146
You're sticking me
with that shift

231
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,690
so that you can go to the fight.

232
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,692
I'm delegating.

233
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,611
Oh, me and my big mouth.

234
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,781
I thought you'd be pleased
that I took your advice.

235
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,949
Words fail me.
Now, remind me.

236
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,703
The reason that you have
to see that fight
is because...?

237
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,663
I'm an anthropologist.

238
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,956
What does that have
to do with Tsunkatse?

239
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,792
It's a cultural phenomenon.

240
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,799
You're having
an allergic reaction

241
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,093
to your
<i>leola</i> ointment.

242
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,928
I hope you've
learned your lesson.

243
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,471
Talaxian homeopathy

244
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,807
is no substitute
for medical science.

245
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:36,227
This should help with the
swelling and discoloration.
Ow.

246
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,396
But you'll have
to stay out of the sun.

247
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,356
But what about the rest
of my shore leave?

248
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,192
I suggest you limit it
to indoor activities.

249
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,904
Commander Chakotay
and B'Elanna invited me

250
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,530
to the Tsunkatse matches.

251
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,115
I guess I'll go.

252
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,950
I'm disappointed in
you, Mr. Neelix.

253
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,535
Cheering for one individual

254
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,412
to inflict
serious injury on another

255
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,997
hardly seems like
an activity you'd enjoy.

256
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,958
Well, Commander Chakotay says

257
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,586
that it's a wonderful
demonstration of
athletic prowess.

258
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,504
You seem to be forgetting
that Commander Chakotay

259
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,548
is an aficionado of boxing,

260
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,384
arguably the most barbaric sport
in Earth's history.

261
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,219
Surely you can find some way
to occupy your free time

262
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,680
that doesn't involve
alien fisticuffs.

263
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,933
Do you have any suggestions?

264
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,518
As a matter of fact,
I was planning a visit

265
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,814
to the Norcadian
Museum of Entomology
this afternoon.

266
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,023
There's a fascinating
exhibit of beetle larvae

267
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,776
from the equatorial
subcontinent.

268
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,111
You're welcome
to join me.

269
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:31,741
Hmm, alien bugs
or alien fisticuffs.

270
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,910
Oh, that's a tough one.

271
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,203
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

272
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,298
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

273
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,469
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

274
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,474
(<i> whooping</i> )

275
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,735
You were right, Commander.
This is exciting.

276
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,697
Two opponents alone in the pit
with only their strength

277
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,281
and agility
to protect them.

278
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,701
I'm glad
you're enjoying yourself.

279
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,202
I still don't understand
the rules.

280
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,412
It's simple.
A Tsunkatse fighter

281
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,081
wears a polaron disruptor
on both hands and feet.

282
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,835
Each disruptor delivers
a bioplasmic charge

283
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,504
when it comes in contact
with one of the opponent's
target sensors.

284
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,464
So there is strategy involved.

285
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,884
A fighter has to attack
his rival's sensors

286
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,677
without exposing his own.

287
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,179
Are you two going to talk
or you here to watch?

288
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,016
(<i> buzzer sounds</i> )

289
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,447
(<i> crowd cheering wildly</i> )

290
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,175
He looks like he could
pick up a shuttlecraft.

291
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,220
He's a Pendari.
They're known for their
superior strength.

292
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,638
And their bad temper.

293
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,139
I hear they have a tendency

294
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,267
to throw their opponents
into the stands.

295
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,685
Be ready to duck.

296
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,353
(<i> chuckles</i> )

297
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,490
(<i> crowd jeering</i> )

298
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,245
Seven?

299
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,968
Seven!

300
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,677
Seven!

301
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,807
You're no bigger than
a Tarkanian field mouse.

302
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,268
Penk's insulting me by putting
you in the pit to face me.

303
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,688
I must warn you,
I possess superior strength.

304
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,189
I'm trembling.

305
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,944
(<i> laughter</i> )

306
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,447
Seven!

307
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,532
Seven!

308
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,118
NEELIX:
Seven!

309
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,413
I assure you,
resistance is futile.

310
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,582
So is all your talk.

311
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,756
Seven!
It's no use.
She can't hear us.

312
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,843
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

313
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,096
Calling to give me
a blow-by-blow description
of the match, Commander?

314
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,473
Seven of Nine is in the pit.
What?

315
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,309
No time to explain.
Beam her out of there!

316
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,532
I have no desire to
inflict further damage.

317
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,742
I'm afraid I can't
say the same.

318
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,171
I'm locked onto
the coordinates of the pit.

319
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,505
Seven's not there.

320
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm looking right at her!

321
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,299
Not according to these sensors.

322
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,259
Maybe their life signs
are masked.

323
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,804
Try recalibrating
the bio-scanners.

324
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,764
Acknowledged.

325
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,768
TORRES:
There's nothing to lock on to.

326
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,479
The only readings I'm picking up
are photonic.

327
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,606
Holograms?
They're transmitting
the fight

328
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,067
from another location.

329
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,651
(<i> grunting</i> )

330
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,506
(<i> beeping</i> )

331
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,176
Transmission to one of
the arenas on Norcadia Prime

332
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,096
is being disrupted.
Compensate.

333
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,909
(<i> crowd shouting</i> )

334
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,081
CROWD:
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

335

00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,922

<i>Voyager,</i> four to beam up.

339
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,557
CHAKOTAY:
We've scanned
the Norcadian surface, Captain.

340
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,351
There's no sign of them.
Any luck tracing
the transmission?

341
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,437
We're trying, but it's not easy.

342
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,149
There are transmissions
being sent to every
planet in the sector.

343
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,358
I guess you aren't the only ones
who enjoy this sport.

344
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,153
It could take days
before we can figure out

345
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,196
where Seven and Tuvok
are being held.

346
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,323
What about diplomatic channels?
Neelix is meeting

347
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,117
with a group of
Norcadian officials.

348
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,368
Well, let's hope he gets
their cooperation.

349
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,246
CHAKOTAY:
When can we
expect you back?

350
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,414
I'm at the outer rim
of the Pendari system.

351
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,625
At best, I'm 48 hours away.

352
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,502
Sorry to cut your
vacation short.

353
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,087
That's okay, Commander.

354
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,214
Keep me informed.
Janeway out.

355
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,143
(<i> gasps</i> )

356
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,853
Stay away from me.

357
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,230
It's a dermal regenerator.

358
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,774
The Pendari you
fought injured you.

359
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,777
Now, keep still.
It's almost out
of power.

360
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,113
I'd prefer that you use it
to treat Commander Tuvok.

361
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,614
I already have.

362
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,074
He's sleeping.

363
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,577
Why are you helping us?

364
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,332
I recognize fellow hunters
when I see them.

365
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm no hunter.

366
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,754
I saw your match today.

367
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,840
Your skills are impressive.

368
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,010
The Pendari would disagree.

369
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,929
You almost defeated him,
but at the last moment,

370
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,016
you hesitated.
You... questioned
your desire

371
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,976
to destroy your prey.

372
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,603
I have no such desire.

373
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,356
Don't you?

374
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,151
I thought I saw it in your eyes.

375
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,486
With the
proper training,

376
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,239
you could become a champion.

377
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,115
Until our ship comes
to rescue us,

378
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,159
my only goal is to survive.

379
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,245
Do you know the difference

380
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:36,123
between a survivor
and a champion here?

381
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,626
There isn't one.

382
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,795
(<i> hatch opens,</i>
<i>footsteps approach</i> )

383
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,094
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you.

384
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,636
I lost.

385
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,389
Exactly.

386
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,349
There's a great deal
of hostility toward the Borg

387
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,226
in this sector.

388
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,604
Whenever the Pendari landed
a blow, our audience grew.

389
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:02,191
We're getting
tens of thousands of requests

390
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,859
to see you fight again.

391
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,611
HUNTER:
She needs time
to recuperate--

392
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,739
to prepare for her next bout.

393
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,783
I agree.
There's a Red Match

394
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,576
scheduled for the day
after tomorrow.

395
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,203
The Pendari
was supposed to compete,

396
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,454
but I've entered
you in his place.

397
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,498
(<i> chuckling</i> )

398
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:24,713
If three billion people paid
to see you hurt,

399
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:28,259
imagine how many will pay
to see you die.

400
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,434
Survival may be more difficult
than I imagined.

401
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,103
You will win the match.

402
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,813
What makes you say that?

403
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:44,775
I know your opponent;
I know his weaknesses.

404
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,819
I can train you to defeat him.

405
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,156
I told you, I will not kill
anyone in that arena.

406
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,699
Consider the alternative.

407
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,715
Teach me.

408
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,769
You're letting
your elbow fall,
exposing your target.

409
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,856
You're mistaken.
My arm is positioned properly.

410
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,859
"When executing
the Tanyk Defense,
the blocking elbow must remain

411
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,610
parallel
to the median sensor."

412
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,654
Ah, the<i> Book of Tsunkatse.</i>

413
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,948
Commander Tuvok borrowed it
from one of the other fighters.

414
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,035
It is obvious
you've studied it well.

415
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,619
I'm attempting to perfect
a defense against...

416
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,372
(<i> grunts</i> )

417
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:44,251
That was not one of
the 33 sanctioned
maneuvers.

418
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,170
There must be 34.

419
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,588
I was unprepared
for your attack.

420
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,175
Is that what you're going to say
to your opponent?

421
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,635
Stop thinking like a drone.

422
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,887
Sanctioned maneuvers,

423
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,805
perfecting
defenses.

424
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:00,267
You cannot assimilate Tsunkatse
from a book.

425
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,187
You must live it, feel it.

426
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,149
In here.

427
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:11,237
Your movements
must become instinct.

428
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,490
An attack could come at any time
from any direction.

429
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,451
You must learn to improvise.

430
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,994
Like this?

431
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,829
(<i> yells in pain</i> )

432
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,581
I've observed you often favor
your left side.

433
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,419
Very perceptive.

434
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,297
It's a wound I sustained
in one of my first matches.

435
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,133
After 19 years,
it still hasn't healed properly.

436
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,097
You've been here a long time.

437
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:44,270
I was taken during
my son's first hunt.

438
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,813
He was so proud
to be with his father.

439
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,941
Watching every
movement I made,

440
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,444
imitating
my gestures.

441
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,695
But instead of bringing
home his first trophy,

442
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,908
he saw his father become
someone else's prey.

443
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,701
Do you know
what happened to him?

444
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,620
I never saw him again.

445
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,831
All Penk would say

446
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:09,169
was that the boy was
too small for competition.

447
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,339
Perhaps he managed
to return home.

448
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,591
(<i> grunts</i> )

449
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,052
You let down your defenses.

450
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,345
Why?

451
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,930
I was...
What?

452
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,433
Feeling sorry for me?
My tragic past?

453
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,017
Yes.

454
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,687
You must never sympathize
with your prey.

455
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:32,776
Unless you accept that,
you will die.

456
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,239
We'll continue.

457
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,640
How did it go?

458
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,433
Oh, the Norcadians

459
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,519
were shocked to learn
that off-worlders might be

460
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,646
participating against
their will.

461
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,189
Uh, the Ambassador
promised to begin

462
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,773
an immediate
investigation.

463
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,067
You don't sound
too convinced.
I'm not.

464
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,487
I spoke to one
of the Pendari delegates.

465
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,948
According to him,
a huge percentage
of the planet's revenue

466
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,950
is derived from Tsunkatse.

467
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,453
Nobody wants to do anything
that might interfere
with the game.

468
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,997
So they turn
a blind eye to the
recruitment tactics.

469
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,791
We're not going
to get any help through
official channels.

470
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,252
It's hard to believe
a-a-a civilization

471
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,547
whose favorite pastime
is cheering

472
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,756
while innocent people
fight each other.

473
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,051
If Seven and Tuvok
hadn't been abducted,

474
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,345
we might still
be cheering, too.

475
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,603
What have you got?

476
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,605
Well, one of the reasons
we were having trouble

477
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,691
isolating the source
of the transmissions

478
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,359
was because they never
seem to be coming

479
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,611
from the same
place twice.

480
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,279
At first, we thought
the matches

481
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,947
were being held
in various locations.

482
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,492
But when we
connected the dots,

483
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:06,328
we realized the pattern
conformed to a flight path.

484
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,581
One that spanned
the entire sector.

485
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,916
They're transmitting
the fights from a ship.

486
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,918
Like a traveling carnival.

487
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,794
Oh, this is
no carnival.

488
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,547
Five million
metric tons,

489
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,382
reinforced hull plating

490
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,134
protected
by covariant shielding,
neutronic weaponry.

491
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,637
It's way out
of our weight class.

492
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,472
The bigger they come,
Lieutenant.

493
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,225
Transmit these coordinates
to the Captain.

494
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,685
Tell her
we could use a hand.

495
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,505
Excellent.

496
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,173
When your opponent
enters the arena,

497
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,592
what do you see?

498
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,009
My prey.

499
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,762
And what do you do
to your prey?

500
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,389
Hunt it down
and kill it.

501
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,313
Go rest before
your match.

502
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,862
Thank you.

503
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,324
Thank me...

504
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,033
by winning.

505
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,460
Penk's guards are making
their inspection rounds.

506
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,170
Progress?

507
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,005
Both the dampening field
and the shielding

508
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,132
of this vessel
are tetryon-based.

509
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,593
But without access to
the control interface,

510
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,845
I can't disable either.

511
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,639
Your training?

512
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,307
Complete.

513
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,059
Are you adequately
prepared?

514
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,229
The Hirogen
is an efficient instructor.

515
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,939
He believes I'll win.

516
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,192
That troubles you.

517
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,194
The idea
of killing someone

518
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,530
for the entertainment
of others is detestable.

519
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,240
Is the idea
of losing your own life

520
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,660
for the entertainment of others
more palatable?

521
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:13,246
As a drone,
you took many lives.

522
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,541
I was acting as part
of the collective.

523
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,585
You're worried
you won't have the strength

524
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,796
to accomplish the task
on your own.

525
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,298
I'm worried that I will.

526
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,852
It's time.

527
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,778
Do whatever it takes
to survive.

528
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,973
(<i> crowd shouting,</i>
<i>loud music playing</i> )

529
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,227
(<i> loud chatter</i> )

530
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,404
(<i> crowd jeering</i> )

531
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,539
(<i> booing continues</i> )

532
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,210
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

533
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,150
You knew.

534
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,819
Yes.

535
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,528
(<i> buzzer sounds</i> )

536
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,657
Training me was
a deception.

537
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,451
You wished to familiarize
yourself with my weaknesses.

538
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,830
I was helping you
to overcome them.

539
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,038
Why?

540
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,669
19 years is a long time.

541
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,253
I've grown tired.

542
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,881
You wish to be killed
in the arena.

543
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:32,218
I want a death my son
would be proud of.

544
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,387
I won't be the one
to provide it.

545
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,809
Then I'll be forced
to kill you.

546
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,018
Ya!

547
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,395
(<i> loud cheering</i> )

548
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,238
Approaching the vessel.

549
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,824
Take us out of warp.

550
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,701
Raise shields
and charge weapons.

551
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,327
Any sign of Tuvok and Seven?

552
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,997
Our sensors can't penetrate
their shields.

553
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,999
Hail them.

554
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,795
This is not a convenient time.

555
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,339
I'm Commander Chakotay of
the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

556
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,174
You're holding
two of my people.

557
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,259
You'll have to be more specific.

558
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,345
Commander Tuvok
and Seven of Nine.

559
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,305
Return them, now.

560
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,641
The Borg drone and her friend.

561
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,101
I'm afraid
she's occupied at the moment.

562
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,771
You have 30 seconds
before I open fire.

563
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,900
A fighter.

564
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:31,444
I respect that,
but you're no match for me.

565
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,668
We can still find
another way out of this.

566
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,295
There is no other way.

567
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,674
You're still
dropping your elbow.

568
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,015
Make a choice,
hunter or prey?

569
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,308
(<i> pained grunt</i> )

570
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,644
Hunter or prey?

571
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,501
Direct hit to their
aft shield generators.

572
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,046
Still no sign of Seven,
but I've got a lock
on Tuvok.

573
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:35,174
Beam him to Sick Bay.
Keep targeting
those generators.

574
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,927
Transport complete.

575
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,136
Bridge to Tuvok.

576
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,429
Go ahead, Commander.

577
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,139
Do you know Seven's status?

578
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,893
She's being forced to fight...
to the death.

579
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,186
I believe
they're on the uppermost deck.

580
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,564
That section's protected
by multiphasic force fields.

581
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,274
I can't penetrate them.

582
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,988
Shields down to 40 percent.

583
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,531
32 percent.

584
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,120
You're getting weak.

585
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,538
I should have found
worthier prey.

586
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,339
You're imperfect.

587
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,850
Is that the best you can do?

588
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,153
Shields are down.

589
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,737
Evasive maneuvers.

590
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,073
Harry?
Still can't get a lock.

591
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,534
Should I get us out of here
before they knock out
our propulsion?

592
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,577
Not yet.
If we can't beam her out,

593
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,705
maybe we can shut down
the transmission.

594
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,124
If nobody's watching,
then why continue the fight?

595
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,334
Start targeting
their signal generators.

596
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,962
Hull breach on Deck 11.

597
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,172
Seal it.

598
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,097
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

599
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,766
We've lost weapons.

600
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,643
Another vessel is approaching.

601
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,353
Great. Now they're
bringing in reinforcements.

602
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,731
PARIS:
No, this one's
on our side.

603
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,816
It's the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

604
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,324
CHAKOTAY:
Good to see you, Captain.

605
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,911
Nothing like getting back
to work after a long vacation.

606
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,287
We need you to target
their signal generators.

607
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,831
Understood.

608
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,093
(<i> jeering and booing</i> )

609
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,555
(<i> console beeping</i> )

610
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,849
We've lost more
than half our audience.

611
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,476
Reroute power
to Transmitters 5 and 6.

612
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,731
They've reduced power
to their force fields.

613
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,109
I've got two life
signs in there--
Seven and a Hirogen--

614
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,402
but I can't get
an individual lock.

615
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,987
Transport them both
if you have to.

616
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,864
Tom.
Aye, sir.

617
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,220
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

618
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:29,474
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

619
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,977
(<i> gasping weakly</i> )

620
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,272
Never... let your prey suffer.

621
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,732
Kill it.

622
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,828
Seven, stand away.

623
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,455
It's all right.

624
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,836
This fight is over.

625
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,106
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53529.4.</i>

626
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,441
<i>We've resumed course</i>
<i>for the Alpha Quadrant</i>

627
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,943
<i>and initiated repairs.</i>

628
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,820
<i>I can't say I'm sorry</i>

629
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,198
<i>to see this shore leave</i>
<i>come to an end.</i>

630
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,283
CHAKOTAY:
We've located
an Hirogen hunting party

631
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:29,701
three light-years away.

632
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,744
They've agreed
to rendezvous with us.

633
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,371
I'm grateful.

634
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,086
Would you excuse us?

635
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,797
Very well,

636
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,924
but if you should
need anything--

637
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,886
an analgesic,
a phaser rifle...

638
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,556
...don't hesitate
to ask.

639
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,977
I apologize for the Doctor.

640
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,396
He's very
protective of me.

641
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:04,027
He doesn't realize how
well you defend yourself.

642
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,575
A trophy.

643
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,333
What will you do now,
search for new prey?

644
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:23,922
No, this time I will be
searching for my son.

645
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,216
If he is as clever
as his father,

646
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,051
he may be difficult to locate.

647
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,678
I've been wondering.

648
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,433
Would you have killed me?

649
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,358
I don't know.

650
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,527
Ah...

651
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,197
Fortunately, you were right.

652
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,657
There was another way out.

653
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,089
I thought you might
require assistance.

654
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,757
Thank you.

655
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:22,063
I realize we share an
affinity for silences,

656
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,107
but in this instance...

657
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,735
I feel compelled
to speak.

658
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:31,239
If you hadn't offered
to take my place in the arena,

659
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,283
it's likely I would have
been killed.

660
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:36,661
I made the logical choice,
as you would have.

661
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,248
Still, I owe you
a debt of gratitude.

662
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,210
Assisting me
with these recalibrations
will be sufficient, thanks.

663
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,965
Have you
fully recovered?

664
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,759
I'm experiencing
minor pain

665
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,845
beneath my
occipital implant,

666
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,972
but the Doctor believes
it is temporary.

667
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,351
I wasn't referring to
your physical condition.

668
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:09,110
When the Hirogen referred
to me as weak,

669
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,112
he was correct.

670
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,366
But you overpowered him.

671
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,742
Because I
lost control.

672
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,495
Given the circumstances,

673
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,913
your behavior
was understandable.

674
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,041
I've spent the last three years

675
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,960
struggling to regain
my humanity.

676
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,340
I'm afraid I may have
lost it again in that arena.

677
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:33,843
You're experiencing
difficult emotions.

678
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,512
Guilt...

679
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,930
shame...
remorse.

680
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,434
Then you haven't lost
your humanity.

681
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,646
You have reaffirmed it.
