Cold, patronizing,

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,053
I know
she can be difficult.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,889
"Difficult"?
She's impossible.

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,557
I'm getting tired
of playing referee

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,434
every time you two
have a disagreement.

7
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,436
If you have a problem,
talk to her yourself.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,480
Does the word "irrelevant"
mean anything to you?

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,773
She won't listen.

10
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,566
She may look human,
she may sound human,

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,943
but she's all Borg.

12
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,653
Part of the problem
is your attitude.

13
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,863
You've never tried

14
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,531
to accept Seven
as part of the crew.

15
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,699
And with good reason.

16
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,992
Guess what she
did this morning.

17
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:34,326
She took an isolinear
processor

18
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,870
out of Engineering
without asking,

19
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,746
and when I went
to Astrometrics to get it back,

20
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,665
she had<i> locked</i> the door.
Like that lab

21
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,583
is her own
private domain.

22
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,042
What do you want me to do?

23
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,962
Throw her in the brig
for the rest of the trip home?

24
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,463

It was.

44
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,838
I've been working
to increase the range

of the astrometric

46
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,591

50
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,433

00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,261
The ship we're seeing is
in the Alpha Quadrant.

55
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,513
You couldn't
have extended

56
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,931
the astrometric
sensors that far.

57
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,641
No, but I increased
the range far enough

58
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,102
to detect a large network
of relay stations.

59
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,311
They are alien in origin,

60
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,897
abandoned,
but still functioning.

61
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,066
By establishing a sensor link
with the nearest station,

62
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,275
I'm getting readings
from the entire network.

63
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,652
The Starfleet ship
is within range

64
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,029
of one of the farthest sensors

65
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,864
near the outer edges
of the Alpha Quadrant.

66
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,827
It must be
on a deep-space mission.

67
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,662
I've extrapolated
its course.

68
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,288
It doesn't look
like we'll be able

69
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,749
to keep track
of it very long.

70
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,043
The ship should move
out of range in 41 minutes.

71
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,420
Can we use the network
to transmit a message?

72
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,338
Yes, but we'll have
to remodulate our signal

73
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,216
to match the network's
interlink frequency.

74
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,759
We don't have much time.

75
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,053
Get it done, Chakotay.

I don't understand.

103
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,796
My readings show that the
station picked up our message

104
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,840
and relayed it
across the entire network.

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,675
We should try widening
the subspace bandwidth

106
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,302
and sending
the message again.

107
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,304

115

As our carrier wave moves
along the network,

116
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,407
it may be degrading.

117
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,743
Oh. Can we try
a different kind of signal?

118
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,953
Something stronger?

119
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,830
A holographic datastream
might work.

120
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,748
It wouldn't degrade
so quickly.

121
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,043

to reconfigure the message.

what all this is about?

When I requested
more away missions,

135

You may be our

with that ship.

you'll be downloaded
into their EMH system.

How am I supposed
to get back here?

When you've completed
your mission,

146
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,341
instruct them to move within
range of the sensor network.

147
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,467
With any luck, they'll be
able to send you back

148
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,886
the same way you came.
"Luck"?

149
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,179
I won't lie
to you, doctor.

150
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,680
A lot of things could go wrong.

151
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,933
We're relying

00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,936
Restricted?
But this is important.

182
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,314
Isn't there some sort of
emergency com channel availa--

183
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,496
( groans )

184
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,301
Try to lie still. You have
severe phaser burns.

185
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,013
What happened here?

186
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,476
( hoarsely ):
Romulans.

187
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,020
They've taken over the ship.

188
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,857
( groans )

189
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,027
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

190
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,034
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

191
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,414
Commander, there's
a vessel approaching

192
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,165
on an intercept course.

193
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,209
It's Starfleet.

194
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,794
I told you to mask
our warp trail.

195
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,046
I've been trying.

196
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,506
These new systems
are unfamiliar.

197
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,383
We should have left
some of the crew alive.

198
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,802
You'd be surprised
how stubborn humans can be.

199
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,846
The Starfleet ship
is closing.

200
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,224
Raise shields and prepare
to fire phasers.

201
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,227
( tricorder emits steady tone )

202
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,981
Computer, how many Romulans
are on board?

203
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,442
<i>Twenty-seven.</i>

204
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,985
Are there
any Starfleet crew members?

205
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,362
<i>None alive.</i>

206
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,618
Computer, display the design
schematic of this ship

207
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,455
and list general specifications.

208
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,998
<i>USS</i> Prometheus.
<i>Experimental prototype</i>

209
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,793

<i>Primary battle systems</i>

211
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,133
<i>include regenerative shielding,</i>
<i>ablative hull armor,</i>

212

<i>multivector assault mode.</i>

213
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,514
Multivector
assault mode? Describe.

214
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,184
<i>Access to tactical data</i>
<i>requires level-4 clearance.</i>

215
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,272
What can you show me
at<i> my</i> clearance level?

216
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,482
( rumbling )

217
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,443
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

218
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,990
Shields are holding.

219
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,866
Engage the multivector
assault mode.

220
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,868
That system has
never been tested.

221
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,163
Then we'll test it now.

222
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,540
( rumbling )
( computer beeps )

223
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,251
I gave you an order,
and I expect you to follow it.

224
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,378
Multivector assault mode<i> now.</i>

225
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,839
FEMALE:
Yes, Commander.

226
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,215
( alarm blaring )

227
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,427
COMPUTER:
<i>Initiating decoupling sequence.</i>

00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,352
<i>Six, five...</i>
Computer?

<i>Two, one.</i>

00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,570
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

235
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,412
We're in attack
formation.

236
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,164
Each section
is armed

237
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,249
and responding
to our command.

238
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,502
( rumbling )
( screams )

239
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,922
Attack pattern beta-four-seven.

240
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,299
<i>Specify target.</i>

241
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,470
The Starfleet vessel,
bearing 162 mark 7.

242
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,556
<i>Pattern and target confirmed.</i>

243
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,567
I think we should consider that
a successful test.

244
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,194
Begin the reintegration
sequence.

245
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,862
Then get me
a full damage report.

246
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,280
Yes, Commander.

247
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,242
( male groaning )

248
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,999
He's hurt.

249
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,834
Take him to the medical bay.

250
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,637
<i>Reintegration sequence</i>
<i>complete.</i>

251
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,849
Computer, is there any way

252
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,935
for me to gain access
to the communication system

253
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,187
to send a message
to another ship?

254
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,064
<i>Negative.</i>

255
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,816
<i>Communications access requires</i>
<i>level-4 clearance or above.</i>

256
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,903
( door opens )

257
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,779
( footsteps approaching )

258
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,409
( groaning )

259
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,544
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

260
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,337
Who activated you?

261
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,714
You did.

262
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,424
Automatically, when
you entered Sickbay.

263
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,968
Can you treat him?

264
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,345
Of course.
That's my function.

265
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:29,392
Third-degree burns,
hairline jaw fracture

266
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,145
and a ruptured blood
vessel in his brain.

267
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,396
I'll have to operate.

268
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,315
You're a Starfleet program.

269
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,608
Why should
I trust you?

270
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,318
I'm a doctor.

271
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,613
Whether my patient
is human or Romulan,

272
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,324
I'll do everything
in my power to save him.

273
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,451
You're welcome to assist me
if you'd like.

274
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,953
Or maybe you'd just prefer
to supervise.

275
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,461
Report to me
when you're finished.

276
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,045
Mm-hmm.

277
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,675
( door opens and closes )

278
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,428
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

279
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,351
Computer, can I access
this ship's EMH program

280
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,603
or do I need some kind
of clearance for that, too?

281
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,397
Access to that program
is unrestricted.

282
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,856
Activate it.

283
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,735
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

284
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,446
What the hell are you doing
in my Sickbay?

285
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,121
I've been programmed to identify
every member of this crew.

286
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,331
You aren't one of them.

287
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,582
That's because I'm...

288
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,501
State your rank
and security clearance.

289
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,711
I don't have clearance.

290
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,212
I'm an Emergency
Medical Hologram.

291
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,714
I've been sent here to...

292
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,216
<i>Yes,</i> yes, yes, yes.

293
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,428
You're the Mark-1 EMH.
The inferior program.

294
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,888
Inferior?

295
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:53,017
Beady eyes, terrible bedside
manner. I recognize you.

296
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,144
But you're not part
of this database.

297
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,396
What are you doing here?

298
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,356
If you disengage
your vocal subroutines

299
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,858
for one second,
I'd explain.

300
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,235
I was transmitted
onto this ship

301
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,405
by a Starfleet vessel over
60,000 light-years from here.

302
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,240
60,000 light-years?

303
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,659
We don't have ships
that far out.

304
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,661
It's the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

305
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,830
We were taken
into the Delta Quadrant

306
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,041
four years ago
by an alien force...

307
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,168
What are you doing?
Activating intruder alert.

308
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,628
That's the last thing
you want to do.

309
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,088
Securit--
Listen to me!

310
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,882
This vessel has been
taken over by Romulans.

311
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,717
The crew is dead.

312
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,677
You and I are the only
Starfleet officers on board.

313
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,512
Do you understand?
( muffled agreement )

314
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,434
Computer, deactivate EMH.

315
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,733
Computer, activate EMH.

316
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,318
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

317
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,946
Now what?
I need your help!

318
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,157
Starfleet Security Protocol
28, Subsection D:

319
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,034
"In the event of
hostile alien takeover,

320
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,913
"the EMH is to deactivate
and wait for rescue."

321
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,706
I'm afraid you don't
<i>have</i> that luxury.

322
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,166
There are two ships at stake
here. Yours and mine.

323
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,754
Now, I need to know more
about what's happening.

324
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,005
Is the Federation at war
with the Romulans?

325
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,300
No. The Romulans
haven't gotten involved

326
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,635
in our fight with the Dominion.

327
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,886
The who?

328
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,138
Long story.

329
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,892
In any case, we need to take
control of this situation.

330
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,853
I'm a doctor,
not a commando.

331
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,396
It's time you became
a little of both.

332
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,066
You don't understand. The
<i>Prometheus</i>

333
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,402
is an experimental
prototype, and so am I.

334
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,990
I... I... I haven't even
been field-tested yet.

335
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,075
I'm not designed
for this kind of duty.

336
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,702
( gasps )

337
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,370
Try to calm down.

338
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,414
You'll do fine as
long as I'm here.

339
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,541
I have plenty of expertise
in this area.

340
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,043
Now, first things first.
We've got a patient.

341
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,421
You treat his burns.
I'll repair the bone fracture.

342
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,631
You're not serious.

343
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,925
I certainly am.
He's the enemy.

344
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,384
He needs our help.

345
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,553
I assume you're familiar
with the Hippocratic Oath?

346
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,514
You see? You see
what's happening.

347
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,223
The Romulans
are using you.

348
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,017
Hmm.
Hmm, what?

349
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,352
Your holo-matrix
is unstable.

350
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,145
It may explain
your erratic behavior.

351
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,814
I told you, I'm a
work in progress.

352
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,649
I was only installed
six weeks ago.

353
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,860
Stable or not, I need you,
and so does he.

354
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,654
He'll live.

355
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,865
I say we leave him and
deactivate ourselves.

356
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,073
No!

357
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,492
You're free
to do as you please.

358
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,828
Go cower inside the data
processor if you'd like.

359
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,162
I'll work alone.

360
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,291
We're medical holograms.

361
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,501
What can we
expect to do

362
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,753
against a ship
full of Romulans?

363
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,339
I'm not sure. Not yet.

364
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,758
But I've faced
my share of challenges.

365
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,386
Alien invasions,
macroviral infestations.

366
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,513
I've crossed Borg space,
traveled through time.

367
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,932
Have you run
a self-diagnostic lately?

368
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,519
The EMH-1 is designed
to function in Sickbay only.

369
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,855
<i>Voyager</i> lost its Chief Medical
Officer four years ago.

370
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,439
I've been active ever since.

371
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,691
Four years?

372
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,317
No wonder you're delusional.

373
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,070
Your program's degrading
after being active for so long.

374
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,822
I assure you I am
in perfect health.

375
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,448
I was saving<i> Voyager</i>
from annihilation

376
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,617
when you were only a gleam
in your programmer's eye.

377
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,912
Now are you going to help me
take back this ship or not?

378
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,999
Get me
the thrombic modulator.

379
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,924
DOCTOR:
Hmm. Ah.

380
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,592
Hmm?

381
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,053
It's the cone-shaped device.

382
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,804
Hand it to me, please.

383
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,895
Medical science has
made a few advances

384
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,438
while you've
been off in the...

385
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,814
Delta Quadrant,
did you say?

386
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,148
That's right.

387
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,526
We don't use scalpels
or leeches anymore.

388
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,987
I suggest you
let me handle

389
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,280
the medical side
of things.

390
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,115
As for retaking the ship,

391
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,078
I'll leave that in
your<i> experienced</i> hands.

392
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,287
( computer beeps )

393
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,749
(<i> light theme playing</i> )

394
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,125
( sighs )

395
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,509
( console beeping )

396
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,430
( sighs )

397
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,224
No word.

398
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,436
Our link to the sensor net
is stable.

399
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,688
Seven of Nine is standing
watch in Astrometrics.

400
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,816
I tried
to relieve her,

401
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,317
but she doesn't want
to leave her post.

402
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,902
She says she doesn't
need to regenerate

403
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,153
for the next few days.

404
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,823
What are you doing?

405
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,701
Letters home.

406
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,829
I started them a year ago.

407
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,081
One to my family...

408
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,291
one to Mark.

409
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,461
I'm making a few updates
just in case.

410
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,796
I know.

411
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,089
It's premature.

412
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,298
You're right.

413
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,758
It's probably
a mistake for us

414
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,259
to get our hopes
up at all.

415
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,719
We've been through
this before.

416
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,724
All right,
I'll admit it.

417
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,102
I just finished a letter
to my cousin in Ohio.

418
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,561
( both chuckle )

419
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,651
( both groaning )

420
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,032
( door opens )

421
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,867
Doctor is in.

422
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,326
Lieutenant, thank
God you're here.

423
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,661
What seems to be
the trouble?

424
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,246
Well, one minute, they
were eating lunch,

425
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,999
and the next, they
started perspiring

426
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,750
and complaining
of chest pain.

427
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,711
Hmm, no wonder.

428
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,963
Acute functional dyspepsia.

429
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,173
What's that?

430
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,841
Heartburn.

431
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,218
Oh, I'm terribly
sorry.

432
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,845
I don't know how this
could have happened.

433
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,305
I'll replicate
some antacid.

434
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,307
We'll have you feeling
better in no time.

435
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,354
They're going to be
all right, aren't they?

436
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:34,525
It's heartburn, Neelix,
not the Terrellian plague.

437
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,195
What did you feed
them anyway?

438
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,197
"Rodeo Red's Red Hot,
Rootin' Tootin' Chili."

439
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,574
( laughs )

440
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,409
Where did you find
that recipe?

441
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,204
I've been brushing up on
classic American cuisine.

442
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:49,331
When we get back to Earth,
I want to make sure I have

443
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,209
marketable
job skills.

444
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,335
Don't you think you're
jumping the gun a little bit?

445
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,588
The doctor is going
to make it back,

446
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,632
and he's going to bring a plan
for Starfleet to rescue us.

447
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,551
I have complete
confidence in him.

448
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,095
I hope you're right.

449
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,555
If not, I'm going to spend
the rest of this trip

450
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,890
treating upset stomachs.

451
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,349
Oh, believe me,

452
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,227
this is never going
to happen again.

453
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:12,063
It's just a matter of
perfecting the recipe.

454
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,483
Next time, I'll use
a few less chilapenos.

455
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,029
(<i> light theme playing</i> )

456
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,828
I've accessed the
navigational logs.

457
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,163
We're at warp 9.9.

458
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,331
Heading straight
for Romulan space.

459
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,085
This vessel was designed
to go faster than anything

460
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,920
in the fleet,
so we'll never be rescued.

461
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,172
We've got to find a way
to turn this ship around.

462
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,967
How? Waltz onto the Bridge
and take over the helm?

463
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,676
Refresh my memory.

464
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,678
Which of us has
the terrible bedside manner?

465
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,139
You're not my patient.

466
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,348
My first bit of good news.

467
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,477
We have to incapacitate
the Romulans somehow.

468
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,355
What kind of anesthetics
do you have handy?

469
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,317
Only the best.
Axonol, neurozine,

470
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,526
anesthezine.

471
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,778
Neurozine will do nicely.

472
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,863
It can be distributed
in gaseous form.

473
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,158
Show me a schematic of the
ship's ventilation system.

474
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,620
Please.

475
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,164
( computer beeping )

476
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,457
All primary systems have
been rerouted to the Bridge,

477
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,375
including
environmental control.

478
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,087
It looks like there are
holo-emitters on every deck.

479
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,505
There are.

480
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,758
Unlike<i> you,</i> I'm not
condemned to a Sickbay.

481
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,510
Get three canisters
of neurozine.

482
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:31,600
As a matter of record,
I have free rein on<i> Voyager</i>

483
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,560
and I can even leave
the ship as well.

484
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,438
Leave your ship? How?

485
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,398
My mobile emitter.

486
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,733
A little piece

487
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,028
of 29th-century
technology we obtained.

488
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,237
Really?

489
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,114
I'm as close
to a sentient life-form

490
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,158
as any hologram
could hope to be.

491
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,202
I socialize with the crew,
fraternize with aliens.

492
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,870
I've even had
sexual relations.

493
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,788
Sex?

494
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,499
How's that possible?
We're not equipped--

495
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,709
Let's just say,

496
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,003
I made an addition
to my program.

497
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,922
Before you leave,
maybe you could

498
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,508
download those subroutines
into my database.

499
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,384
We'll see.

500
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,223
( beeping )

501
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,473
It looks like
the only place

502
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,892
I can access
environmental control

503
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,268
is from the Ops console
on the Bridge.

504
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,646
The Bridge is swarming
with Romulans.

505
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,939
That's the first
thing you learn

506
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,941
in the real world--
think on your feet.

507
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,484
Well, good luck then.

508
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,403
Computer, deactivate--
Not so fast.

509
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,447
You're going
to Jefferies Tube 17.

510
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,325
The moment I unlock
the controls,

511
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,702
you release the gas
into the ventilation system.

512
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,372
Jefferies Tube 17?
That's five decks up.

513
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,789
What if I run
into Romulans?

514
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,166
Improvise.

515
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,960
Your journey begins here.

516
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:52,223
Traditionally,
one crawls in headfirst.

517
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,724
Thanks.

518
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,864
ROMULAN:
There you are, doctor.

519
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,574
Have you completed
the surgery?

520
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,826
Yes. Your friend
is recovering nicely.

521
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,329
However, I found something
disturbing in his blood work.

522
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,663
It seems he's been exposed

523
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,874
to a nasty strain
of the Torothka virus,

524
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,127
and if he was, you
may all have been.

525
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,711
I've come to run
some scans.

526
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,922
No one here is sick.

527
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,299
Not yet.

528
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,550
I understand the stomach
cramps are unbearable,

529
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,469
although some say
the rash is worse.

530
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,222
Conduct your scans.

531
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,765
( device humming )

532
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,271
How far are we from our border?

533
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,982
At our present
velocity, 40 minutes.

534
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,776
Alter our heading
to 118 mark 26.

535
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,197
That will take us
off our course to Romulus.

536
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,740
There's been
a change of plans.

537
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,075
We're giving this ship
to someone

538
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,701
who will make use
of its full potential--

539
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,911
the Tal Shiar.

540
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,413
I've made arrangements
to rendezvous

541
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,956
with their fleet
within the hour.

542
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,083
ROMULAN:
But, Commander, they're
expecting us--

543
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,751
COMMANDER:
You have your orders.

544
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:07,006
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

545
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,924
What are you doing?

546
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,094
I'm checking the biofilters
for evidence of the virus.

547
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,223
You haven't taken
any readings at all.

548
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,144
Hmm.

549
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,524
( device humming )

550
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,237
Next time...

551
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,655
order the chicken salad.

552
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,575
( door opens )

553
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,037
Oh! Am I glad to see you.

554
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,288
What's the emergency?

555
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,081
Ah. Take a look
around you, Harry.

556
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,212
What do you see?

557
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,463
Sickbay?

558
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,755
Exactly.

559
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,049
So?

560
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,634
So, it's not the helm
of a starship, is it?

561
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,761
Did you accidentally
inject yourself

562
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,181
with some kind
of psychotropic agent?

563
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,475
I am a pilot, Harry,
not a doctor.

564
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,268
This is a temporary
assignment--

565
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,520
just till the doc gets back.

566
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,146
What if he doesn't
get back?

567
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,398
He'll be back.

568
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,274
I need your help, Harry.

569
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,109
Rescue me from
medical exile.

570
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,777
How?

571
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,987
( sighs )

572
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,990
You're an expert
in holo-technology.

573
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,410
You have got to
design a new doctor.

574
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,660
( snickers )

575
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,578
You really<i> are</i> delirious.

576
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,082
It took the greatest
holo-engineers in Starfleet

577
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,458
years to develop the EMH.

578
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,253
I can't just<i> design</i> 
a new doctor.

579
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,754
( sighs )

580
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,424
Think of it
as a challenge, Harry--

581
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,009
a chance to make history

582
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,178
and save your best friend
all at the same time.

583
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,769
Lieutenant Torres.

584
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,525
( computers beeping )

585
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,282
You are recalibrating
the relay interface.

586
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,117
That's right.

587
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,370
State your reasons for
making these modifications.

588
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,039
"State your reasons,
<i>please."</i>

589
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,623
It's not what
you say, Seven.

590
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,833
It's how you say it.

591
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,794
I don't understand.

592
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,797
( sighs )

593
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,342
You may have noticed

594
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,929
that some of the crew
seem a bit...on edge

595
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,180
when you're around.

596
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,390
I was Borg.

597
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,891
I elicit apprehension.

598
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,977
No, that's not what I mean.

599
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,396
We're not afraid that you're
going to assimilate us.

600
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,148
We're just not used to...

601
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,899
You just...

602
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,320
You're rude.

603
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,822
I am rude.

604
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,366
Yes. Yes. You order
people around.

605
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,742
You do things
without permission.

606
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,077
and whether
you realize it or not,

607
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,496
you come off
as a little insulting.

608
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,832
You don't even say
"please" or "thank you."

609
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,919
Look, I don't expect you
to change overnight, but...

610
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,129
try to remember

611
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,590
that we are not just
a bunch of drones.

612
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,388
( computer beeping )

613
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,973
Your attempt
to recalibrate

614
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,933
the interface
is ill-advised.

615
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,227
The risk of disrupting
our link is too great.

616
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,729
In your opinion.

617
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,731
That is exactly
what I'm talking about.

618
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,317
You haven't even been
listening to me.

619
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,361
I don't know why I try to talk
to you if you don't even...

620
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,694
( staticky fritzing )

621
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:17,904
Are we losing the link?

622
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,323
No. We're receiving
a transmission

623
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,534
from the relay station.
The doctor?

624
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,119
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

625
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,579
<i>What are you?</i>

626
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,624
I'm Lieutenant Torres
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

627
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,293
<i>You are using our technology.</i>

628
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,337
You mean
the sensor network?

629
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,880
We thought
that it was abandoned.

630
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,384
<i>It belongs to the Hirogen.</i>
<i>Terminate your link.</i>

631
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,968
No, no, wait, please.
We just...

632
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,389
The link has
been severed.

633
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,272
What else have you
done to this ship?

634
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,193
I will deactivate you

635
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,445
unless you start
answering my questions.

636
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,779
If I answer them,

637
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,407
you'll very likely
deactivate me anyway,

638
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,618
so I fail to
see the point.

639
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,245
You are nothing

640
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,331
but a computer-generated
projection.

641
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,957
I find it hard to believe

642
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,169
you're capable of taking
these actions independently.

643
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,795
How flattering.

644
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,675
Tell me who is
operating your program.

645
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,010
Is it someone
on this ship?

646
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,846
A Starfleet crew
member we missed

647
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,973
or one of my own men?

648
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,935
Paranoia is a way of life
for you, isn't it?

649
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,022
( door opens )

650
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,444
The computer log shows

651
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,280
the ship received an optronic
datastream transmission

652
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,408
approximately six hours ago.

653
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,494
It contained
a holographic subroutine.

654
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,954
Who sent it?

655
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,374
Unknown. The data pattern
had a Starfleet signature.

656
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,546
So, Starfleet has managed

657
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,799
to sneak a holographic
operative aboard.

658
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,008
Very clever.

659
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,052
Were you only sent
to spy on us,

660
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,473
or does your mission
include sabotage?

661
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,724
( sighs )

662
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,975
The datastream
you detected

663
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,393
came from an alien
sensor network.

664
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,770
It transferred me

665
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,689
from a Starfleet ship
in the Delta Quadrant.

666
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,733
The Delta Quadrant?

667
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,985
That's absurd.
This is pointless.

668
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,403
I couldn't agree more.

669
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,657
Maybe there's a better way

670
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,951
to retrieve information
from a hologram.

671
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,788
I suggest a complete
algorithm extraction.

672
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:34,249
We can analyze
his subroutines one by one.

673
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,126
Proceed.

674
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,670
( computer beeping )

675
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,838
Isn't there some kind
of convention

676
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,132
regarding the treatment
of prisoners?

677
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,511
( Romulans gasping
and coughing )

678
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,763
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

679
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,936
Did it work?

680
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,522
Sorry to interrupt.

681
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,398
Did you anesthetize
the entire ship?

682
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,733
I did, I did.

683
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,401
How did you manage
to release the neurozine?

684
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,861
I never opened
the ventilation system.

685
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,530
Trapped in
the Jefferies tube,

686
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,824
alone, nowhere to run,

687
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:10,619
his smug comrade
captured by Romulans,

688
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,539
EMH-2 had to improvise.

689
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,082
Inspiration. He
accessed the main computer

690
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,584
and simulated a shipwide

691
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,461
biohazard, making the
computer think there was

692
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,005
a microbiotic contamination
on all decks.

693
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,424
And the ventilation system
opened automatically.

694
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,885
Presto. He then crawled
back out of the tube,

695
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,471
accessed the holo-emitters,
transferred here,

696
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,848
excused the Romulan,

697
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,266
saw the dumbfounded look
on his comrade's face...

698
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,643
The end.

699
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,562
You know, you really should
keep a personal log.

700
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,605
Why bore others needlessly?

701
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,065
( sighs )

702
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,233
We have to get to the Bridge.

703
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,735
This ship needs a crew,
and we're it.

704
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,986
Oh. Trouble.

705
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,197
The<i> Prometheus</i> is
a prototype-- top secret.

706
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,907
Only four people

707
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,744
in all of Starfleet were
trained to operate it.

708
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:55,080
I hope
your myriad adventures

709
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,082
included piloting lessons

710
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,625
because there's nothing
in my program

711
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,001
that will help us
fly this thing.

712
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:04,214
I've had my share of
piloting experience.

713
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,924
Actually...
only two lessons

714
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,051
and they were in
a shuttlecraft...

715
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,219
on the holodeck,

716
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,597
but I showed
great intuition.

717
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,015
Where's the helm?

718
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,935
You'd better<i> intuit</i> 
it fast.

719
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,605
We're only about eight minutes
from the Romulan border.

720
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,064
Ah, there it is.

721
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,324
EMH-2:
This is all very...

722
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,534
complicated.

723
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,911
Stop breathing
down my neck.

724
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,495
My breathing is
merely a simulation.

725
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,205
So is my neck.
Stop it anyway.

726
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,665
Is this
a thruster control?

727
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,375
Don't touch that.
We don't know what it does.

728
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,001
It could be
the self-destruct.

729
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,003
You look worried.

730
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,548
I'm just...concentrating.

731
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,508
You don't know
what you're doing, do you?

732
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,927
This is not a shuttle

733
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,970
and we are not on a holodeck.
Shh.

734
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,430
Mr. "I can
leave my ship."

735
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,807
The voice
of experience.

736
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,683
Let me think.

737
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,518
Ah, here it is.

738
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,353
This looks like
the nacelle power control.

739
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,688
So? So?

740
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,398
There's a little trick
I saw Mr. Paris do once.

741
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,400
If I can generate
a slight overload

742
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,278
to the nacelle coils,
it'll collapse the warp field.

743
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,655
( both grunting )

744
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,989
What happened?

745
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,576
I did it. We've stopped.

746
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,454
Ah. All we have to
do now is find a way

747
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,372
to send Starfleet
a distress signal and...

748
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,040
( shrill beeping )

749
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,335
Beep-beep-beep.
Beep-beep-beep?

750
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,378
I've never heard
that one before.

751
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,047
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

752
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,928
Oh, no.
What?

753
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,388
I'm not sure, but I
think whatever I did

754
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,432
initiated a warp
core overload.

755
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,643
You mean the ship's
going to explode?

756
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,186
You've got to stop it.

757
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,190
( beeping stops )

758
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,651
Ah. No problem.

759
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,820
( strident beeping )

760
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,616
What now?

761
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,248
Unless I'm mistaken,

762
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,876
and for once, I
sincerely hope I am,

763
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,461
there are three
Romulan warbirds

764
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,046
on an intercept course.

765
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:15,595
(<i> suspenseful theme calming</i> )

766
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,724
We're boosting the signal gain
as high as it'll go.

767
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,726
I think we can cut through
the alien's jamming signal.

768
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,769
ALIEN:
<i>I warned you.</i>

769
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,688
JANEWAY:
I apologize
for our intrusion.

770
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,105
Allow me to explain.

771
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,107
<i>No explanations.</i>

772
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,485
Your relay network
gave us the unique opportunity

773
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,195
to communicate with our people.

774
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,906
They are very far away,

775
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,699
and we're expecting
a message back from them.

776
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,660
<i>All messages</i>
<i>will be intercepted.</i>

777
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,412
( beeping )

778
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,080
He's trying to jam
the link again.

779
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,749
There must be some room
for negotiation.

780
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,001
Isn't there anything you might
accept in exchange for...?

781
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,420
<i>( screaming )</i>
What happened?

782
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,880
I generated
a feedback surge

783
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,965
along our sensor link.

784
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,427
You killed him?

785
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,179
It was a mild shock.
He will recover.

786
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,681
And when he does?

787
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,393
He wasn't responding
to diplomacy.

788
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,273
Is the sensor link stable?

789
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,025
( console beeping )

790
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,526
Yes, Captain.

791
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,362
Keep watching for the doctor.

792
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,533
Let me know if our friend
gives us any more trouble.

793
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,620
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

794
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,164
"Mild shock."
( door opens and closes)

795
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,208
Not bad.

796
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,086
Thank you.

797
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,798
( beeping )

798
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,173
There. I finished inputting

799
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,968
the doctor's physical
characteristics.

800
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,970
Let's have a look.

801
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,805
Computer, activate
the Emergency

802
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,807
Medical Hologram
Replacement Program.

803
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,600
( computer beeps )

804
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,896
Do you think
we should give him

805
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,648
a little more hair?

806
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,150
What do you say we try
to get him working first,

807
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,653
then we can worry
about personal grooming.

808
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,946
Right. You're the boss.

809
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,155
What do we do next?

810
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,907
I've downloaded
the ship's entire

811
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,994
medical library and compressed
it into a single data file.

812
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,870
It's got all the classics
from<i> Gray's Anatomy</i>

813
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,581
to Leonard McCoy's
<i>Comparative Alien Physiology.</i>

814
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,835
And once we transfer
all the data

815
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,879
into stone face's matrix,

816
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,214
we'll have ourselves
a brand-new medical expert.

817
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,009
That's what I'm hoping.

818
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,844
Harry, you are a genius.

819
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,013
Don't congratulate me yet.

820
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,681
This is only the first step.

821
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,891
PARIS:
Yeah, but it's a step
in the right direction.

822
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,145
I'm telling you, this probably
isn't going to work.

823
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,523
What happened
to all that youthful optimism?

824
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,942
Being a doctor is a lot more
than knowing the facts.

825
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,986
We still have to create
analytical subroutines

826
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,570
to help him diagnose patients,

827
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,032
tactile protocols,
so he can perform surgery,

828
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,449
not to mention
a personality profile.

829
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,660
Oh, you know, I've been
thinking about that.

830
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,040
Maybe we should make this one
a little more...pleasant

831
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,374
than the old doc.

832
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,255
All right. I'm ready
to transfer the data.

833
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,467
Computer, transfer
medical library master file

834
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,846

Nothing.
Why isn't this working?

They're charging weapons!

892
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,797
See if you can access
the shields.

893
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,132
I said...

894
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,424
I said shields!

895
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,260
Already done. Shields up.

something wrong

917
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,685
You'd better not

sure it's safe.

They're Starfleet.

00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,712
Firing on<i> us.</i>

932
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,463
They must think
Romulans are on board.

933
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,631
They're right!

00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,968

It's no use.
They can't hear us.

939
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,070
The Romulans have scrambled
the com frequencies.

941
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,698

942
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,950
Specifically?

943
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,492
The secondary

I'm just reading
what it says here.

947
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,750
I'll try to
stabilize the ship.

948
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,001
Transfer auxiliary power

949
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,420

Transferring

Good work, Mark-2.

952
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,096
Thanks.
You'd better get to tactical.

953
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,931
We're going to have
to defend ourselves.

954
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,474

There are so many controls.

00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,649
Find the one that says "fire"
and push it!

959
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:29,446
It's not working. It says here
the phasers are off-line.

960
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:30,655
Well, then fire a torpedo!

00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,872
You hit the wrong ship.

It wasn't my fault.

964
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,126
Well, then, whose fault was it,
the torpedo's?

965
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,627
You're supposed
to tell it what to do.

Everything is off-line--

It gets worse.

970
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,304
There are two warbirds
coming right at us.

I think the Romulans
did this before.
