AND WELCOME TO
<i>A BRIEFING WITH NEELIX.</i>

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,135
IT'S A CATCHY TITLE, ISN'T IT?

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,012
I'LL BE COMING TO YOU
EACH AND EVERY DAY

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,056
WITH NEWS OF GENERAL INTEREST,

MUSICAL PERFORMANCES,

00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,897

AND, OF COURSE,
PREVIEWS OF UPCOMING MEALS--

00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,613
EVERYTHING FROM HLAKA SOUP

<i>A BRIEFING WITH NEELIX</i>
WILL HELP YOU STAY INFORMED

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,577
ABOUT SHIP'S ACTIVITIES,

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,830
UH, KEEP YOU ABREAST OF
YOUR COLLEAGUES' ACCOMPLISHMENTS

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,041
AND BROADEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT A WEALTH OF SUBJECTS.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,379
BUT MOST OF ALL,
IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD,

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,549
BECAUSE WHAT YOU SEE HERE
WILL ALWAYS BE

17
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,050
THE MOST UPLIFTING,
OPTIMISTIC VIEW

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,970
OF EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS ON OUR SHIP.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,514
AFTER ALL,
AS YOUR MORALE OFFICER

20
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,975
ISN'T IT MY JOB
TO BRING A LITTLE JOY

21
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,310
INTO EVERYONE'S DAY, HMM?

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,480
CAPTAIN JANEWAY HAS AGREED
TO APPEAR ON THE SHOW

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,025
WITH REGULAR UPDATES
ABOUT THE SHIP'S PROGRESS,

AND COMMANDER CHAKOTAY WILL
COMMEND OUTSTANDING CREW MEMBERS

25
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,281
SO, SNAP TO, AND KEEP THOSE
BOOTS POLISHED TO A SHINE.

26
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,867
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU MIGHT BE FEATURED

27
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,370
ON<i> A BRIEFING WITH NEELIX.</i>

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,205
READY, ENSIGN?
Ensign: ALL SET, NEELIX.

29
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,876
IN JUST A MOMENT,
AN AMAZING TALENT.

30
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,545
ENSIGN PABLO BAYTART
WILL ASTOUND YOU

31
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,171
WITH HIS JUGGLING ABILITY.

32
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,633
HE'LL KEEP PADDS, HYPOSPRAYS,
EVEN PHASERS IN THE AIR

33
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,885
FOR MINUTES AT A TIME.

34
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,262
I DON'T... BUT BEFORE THAT,

35
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,725
WHAT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL BETTER
THAN A LITTLE ROMANCE?

36
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:43,102
AND WHAT LIEUTENANT
IN A GOLD UNIFORM

37
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,188
WAS RECENTLY HUDDLED
IN THE MESS HALL

38
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,982
WITH WHAT CREWMAN IN BLUE,

39
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,985
HAVING A VERY INTIMATE
CONVERSATION

40
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,446
OVER A CARAFE OF SILMIC WINE?

41
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,450
WELL, I'D NEVER NAME NAMES,
BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

42
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,744
BEST WISHES
TO A HANDSOME PAIR OF LOVEBIRDS.

43
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,161
AND NOW...

44
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:05,000
ladies and gentlemen,
Ensign Pablo Baytart.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,796
WELL? WHAT DID YOU THINK?

46
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,171
I'M A DOCTOR,
NOT A PERFORMER.

47
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,966
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR SUCH NONSENSE.

48
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,051
I CAN SEE
"HINTS FOR HEALTHFUL LIVING"

49
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,136
BECOMING A VERY POPULAR
SEGMENT, DOCTOR.

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,972
I DON'T THINK SO.

51
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,514
YOU'D BE LIFTED TO

52
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,516
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL
IN THE CREW'S EYES.

53
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,603
THEY'D HANG ON YOUR EVERY WORD.

54
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,398
YOU'D ENJOY A POPULARITY,
A CELEBRITY

55
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,025
THAT YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN BEFORE.

56
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,820
I WOULD?

57
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,238
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER RIGHT AWAY.

58
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:39,451
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

59
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,125
AH! MR. KIM!

60
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,751
JUST THE PERSON
I WANTED TO SEE.

61
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,003
SEE YOU LATER.

62
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,420
DID YOU WATCH

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,171
<i>A BRIEFING WITH NEELIX</i>
THIS MORNING?

64
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:56,175
UH, YES. YES, I DID.

65
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,387
IS THERE SOMETHING
ABOUT THE PROGRAM YOU DISLIKED?

66
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,850
I'M NOT SURE I CARE
FOR ALL THE FROSTING.

67
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,144
FROSTING?
DECK FOUR.

68
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,937
RECIPES, MUSIC, JUGGLERS--

69
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,897
IT'S SORT OF LIKE A
STEADY DIET OF DESSERT,

70
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,066
WHICH IS FINE,
BUT PRETTY SOON,

71
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,568
YOU WANT SOME MEAT
AND POTATOES.

72
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,862
YOU DO?

73
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,404
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL

74
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,866
I WAS EDITOR OF THE ACADEMY
NEWSPAPER FOR A YEAR.

75
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,909
I MONITORED SUBSPACE
TRANSMISSIONS.

76
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,120
I GOT REPORTS ON SOME
OF THE FIRST ACTIVITY

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,288
BY THE MAQUIS AGAINST
THE CARDASSIANS.

78
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,874
I WROTE AN EDITORIAL
ABOUT IT,

79
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,710
AND THE STUDENTS BECAME
POLARIZED ON THE ISSUE.

80
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,503
THEY DEBATED THE
PROS AND CONS

81
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,173
AND GAINED AN INSIGHT
INTO THE ENTIRE HISTORY

82
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,924
OF THE POLITICAL REBELLION.

83
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,844
NOW, THAT'S THE
POWER OF JOURNALISM.

84
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,596
WHAT DID YOUR PROFESSOR SAY
WHEN YOU TOLD HIM

85
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,098
YOU WERE GOING
TO PUBLISH THE EDITORIAL?

86
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,766
I DIDN'T TELL THEM.

87
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:49,813
IT'S THE JOB OF A JOURNALIST
TO BE INDEPENDENT.

88
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,106
Woman:
Bridge to Mr. Neelix.

89
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,775
You have
an incoming transmission.

90
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,194
I'M HEADING FOR MY QUARTERS.

91
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,444
PUT IT THROUGH THERE.

92
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,779
Yes, sir.

93
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,619
Neelix, my friend, how are you?

94
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,788
LAXETH, YOU OLD
DILITHIUM SCRUBBER!

95
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,248
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

96
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,499
CALLING TO TRADE ME

97
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,793
SOME OF YOUR
ILL-GOTTEN GOODS AGAIN?

98
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,170
I PROMISE YOU
I NEVER WANT TO SEE

99
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,339
ANOTHER WHEEL
OF PENDRASHIAN CHEESE.

100
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,258
Oh, those days are behind me.

101
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,094
I'm legitimate now.

102
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,889
I'm Communications Master
of a Talaxian convoy.

103
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,515
COMMUNICATIONS MASTER...

104
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,059
WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY
COME UP IN THE WORLD.

105
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,476
CONGRATULATIONS.

106
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,938
Looks like I'll be seeing you
in a few days.

107
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,606
HOW'S THAT?
We've been asked

108
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,233
to rendezvous
with your ship.

109
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,859
We're going to pick up
a passenger.

110
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,654
PASSENGER?
WE DON'T CARRY ANY PASSENGERS.

111
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,950
Apparently,
it's a member of your crew.

112
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,744
All I know is
someone wants to leave your ship

113
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,038
and come to work for us.

114
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,984
JUST HOW, EXACTLY, DID YOU HEAR

115
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,363
THAT SOMEONE
WAS LEAVING THE SHIP?

116
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,448
AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE IS SERVING
WITH A TALAXIAN CONVOY.

117
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,201
HE TOLD ME
THEY'D BE RENDEZVOUSING WITH US

118
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,869
IN A FEW DAYS.

119
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,996
JANEWAY TO TUVOK.
Yes, Captain?

120
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,165
COULD YOU JOIN US IN
MY READY ROOM, PLEASE?

121
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,457
Right away.

122
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,343
LIEUTENANT, MR. NEELIX HAS HEARD
ON GOOD AUTHORITY

123
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,220
THAT ONE OF OUR CREW
WILL BE LEAVING THE SHIP

124
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,554
IN A FEW DAYS.

125
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,056
NATURALLY,
HE'S CURIOUS

126
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,974
ABOUT THE IDENTITY
OF THIS PERSON.

127
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,560
WHAT ARE THE SECURITY
ISSUES HERE?

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,272
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE
ANY SERIOUS CONCERNS, CAPTAIN.

129
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,149
THERE IS NO NEED TO WITHHOLD
THIS INFORMATION ANY LONGER.

130
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,570
LIEUTENANT PARIS...

131
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,697
HAS ASKED TO BE
PUT OFF THE SHIP.

132
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,075
TOM?
I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE

133
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,910
THAT HE'S HAD SOME
PROBLEMS LATELY.

134
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,161
WELL, YES.

135
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
Tuvok:
HE HAS BEEN DISRUPTIVE,

136
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,791
AND OFTEN SETS A BAD EXAMPLE
FOR THE REST OF THE CREW.

137
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,129
BUT... HE SEEMED SO DETERMINED
TO GET THOSE THINGS BEHIND HIM.

138
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,548
IT MEANS A LOT TO HIM
TO BE RESPECTED BY THIS CREW.

139
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,427
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT
WHEN HE WAS RELIEVED OF DUTY,

140
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,471
HE ASKED ME TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE SHIP.

141
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,932
I TRIED TO TALK HIM OUT
OF IT, BUT HE WAS ADAMANT.

142
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,059
WE DETECTED THE
TALAXIAN CONVOY

143
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,104
AND THEY WERE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO GET A
PILOT OF TOM'S ABILITY.

144
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,440
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

145
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,359
I NEVER THOUGHT...

146
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,569
CAPTAIN, MAY I SPEAK WITH HIM?

147
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,862
OF COURSE.

148
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,364
HE'S IN HIS QUARTERS.

149
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,790
(<i> door chimes</i> )

150
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,541
COME IN.

151
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,880
HELLO, TOM.

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,133
NEELIX. HOW'S IT GOING?

153
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,682
NOT GOOD, IT LOOKS LIKE.

154
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,225
WHAT'S WRONG?

155
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,145
I HEAR YOU'RE LEAVING THE SHIP?

156
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,817
GOOD NEWS TRAVELS FAST, I GUESS.

157
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,153
YEAH, I FIGURED THERE WAS

158
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,071
QUITE A BIT MORE OPPORTUNITY
FOR ADVANCEMENT

159
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,949
ON A TALAXIAN CONVOY
THAN THERE WAS

160
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,828
ON THE ONLY STARFLEET SHIP
IN THE QUADRANT.

161
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,913
WHEN DID YOU MAKE
THIS DECISION?

162
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,625
TRUTHFULLY? UH, ABOUT
A MINUTE AND A HALF

163
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,919
AFTER I SET FOOT
ON THIS SHIP A YEAR AGO.

164
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,382
I KNEW IT WAS A MISTAKE TO TRY
TO FIT INTO STARFLEET AGAIN,

165
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,050
AND I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO MYSELF.

166
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,135
A FEW MORE MONTHS
IN THAT REHAB COLONY

167
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,470
WOULD HAVE BEEN
A HELL OF A LOT BETTER

168
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,929
THAN BEING HERE.

169
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,766
TOM, YOU AND I HAVE
HAD OUR DIFFERENCES

170
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,354
BUT I THOUGHT WE PUT
THOSE BEHIND US. I...

171
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:26,983
I JUST HOPE I HAVEN'T...
CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR DECISION.

172
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,904
NEELIX, NO.

173
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,490
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ANYBODY
EXCEPT ME.

174
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,829
I'VE DONE THIS TO MYSELF
JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

175
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,457
NO MATTER WHERE I GO
OR WHO I'M WITH,

176
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,710
I MAKE A MESS OF THINGS.

177
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,838
THE UNMISTAKABLE CONCLUSION
HAS TO BE THAT DEEP DOWN

178
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:53,927
I DON'T WANT ANY FRIENDS
OR A FAMILY OR A HOME.

179
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,054
OTHERWISE,
I WOULDN'T KEEP SABOTAGING

180
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,347
THE POSSIBILITIES.

181
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,224
I THOUGHT YOU FOUND
THOSE THINGS HERE.

182
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,975
I TRIED,
OR MAYBE

183
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,727
I JUST TOLD MYSELF I WAS TRYING.

184
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,063
I'M NOT SURE.

185
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,023
EITHER WAY,
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING.

186
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,068
FRANKLY, I'D LIKE TO GET OUT
BEFORE I COMPLETELY DESTROY

187
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,528
MY IMAGE.

188
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,820
THERE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE

189
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,283
WHO STILL HAVE
A GOOD OPINION OF ME.

190
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,700
I'M ONE OF THEM, TOM...

191
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,039
AND I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO.

192
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,544
WELL, I THANK YOU...
BUT, THE TRUTH IS

193
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,670
I'VE ALWAYS
CONSIDERED MYSELF A DRIFTER.

194
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,424
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT'S LIKE, NEELIX.

195
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,469
FREEDOM TO DO WHAT YOU WANT,
WHEN YOU WANT.

196
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,638
NO RULES TO FOLLOW,
NOBODY DEPENDING ON YOU, RIGHT?

197
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,864
Doctor:
Well, there you are.

198
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,576
I've been waiting
for what seems like hours.

199
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,868
DOCTOR, WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

200
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,579
I want to discuss the details

201
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,414
of my participation
on your program.

202
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,832
I've been giving it
a great deal of thought

203
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,250
and I've come up
with a number of ideas

204
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,710
I think you'll find quite
intriguing.

205
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,379
WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

206
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,340
I'M DELIGHTED YOU'VE DECIDED
TO BECOME A CONTRIBUTOR.

207
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,801
BUT I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DISCUSS IT RIGHT NOW.

208
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,262
But I've already prepared
today's topic:

209
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,055
"How To Keep
Your Nostrils Happy."

210
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,599
THAT IS FASCINATING.

211
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,852
BUT I'M AFRAID
THERE'S A MORE IMPORTANT STORY

212
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,228
I HAVE TO WORK ON TODAY.

213
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,398
You mean...
I'm not going to appear today?

214
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,861
WHEN YOU SEE IT,
I'M SURE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.

215
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,614
Hmm. But I will be on tomorrow?

216
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,492
DEFINITELY.
WITHOUT FAIL, I PROMISE YOU.

217
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,744
Very well, but tomorrow,
I'll want to cover two topics.

218
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,580
I have a most entertaining idea.

219
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,417
"Uncovering the Hidden Mysteries
of the Adrenal Gland."

220
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,878
FINE, FINE. GOODBYE, DOCTOR.

221
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,145
GOOD MORNING,<i> VOYAGER.</i>

222
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:13,107
I WANT TO TELL YOU
ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE.

223
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,735
I FIRST MET THIS MAN
ALMOST A YEAR AGO

224
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,906
AND, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I DIDN'T LIKE HIM MUCH.

225
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:24,494
HE SEEMED A LITTLE TOO COCKY,
A LITTLE TOO SURE OF HIMSELF.

226
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,915
A lot of people had questions
about him.

227
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,042
He'd proven he'd pretty much
sell himself out

228
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,294
to the highest bidder,
go wherever the wind blew him.

229
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,589
So people wondered,
could you trust this person

230
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,465
when things got tough?

231
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,009
Would he stand
side by side with you,

232
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,971
or would he let you down
when you needed him most?

233
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,973
But the fact of the matter is

234
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:51,062
he proved himself
right from the beginning.

235
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:55,066
I wouldn't be alive right now
if it weren't for him.

236
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,068
And the same goes
for many of you.

237
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,029
It took me a while
to realize it.

238
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,157
Like a lot of people,
I was too caught up

239
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,618
in first impressions

240
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,621
to see the truth
that was right in front of me.

241
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:12,166
I overlooked his bravery because
I was focusing on his brashness.

242
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:17,171
I ignored his courage
because I saw it as arrogance

243
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,466
and I resented his friendliness

244
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,052
because I mistook it
for licentiousness.

245
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,431
So while this man
was giving us his best

246
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,975
every minute of every day,

247
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,560
I was busy judging him.

248
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,687
<i>AND NOW, HE'S LEAVING.</i>

249
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,940
<i>I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT IN SPITE</i>
<i>OF MY NARROW-MINDEDNESS</i>

250
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,193
<i>THOMAS EUGENE PARIS</i>
<i>BECAME MY FRIEND.</i>

251
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,154
<i>I'M GOING TO MISS HIM.</i>

252
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,198
<i>NO MORE LAUGHS</i>
<i>OVER A GAME OF POOL.</i>

253
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,576
<i>NO MORE SITTING UP</i>
<i>INTO THE WEE HOURS</i>

254
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,161
<i>SWAPPING STORIES.</i>

255
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,330
<i>NO MORE COMPLAINTS</i>
<i>ABOUT MY COOKING.</i>

256
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,166
(<i> chuckling</i> )

257
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,793
<i>GOODBYE, TOM.</i>

258
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,043
<i>I THINK I SPEAK FOR MORE OF US</i>

259
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,920
<i>THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE</i>
<i>WHEN I SAY</i>

260
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,799
<i>YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE</i> <i> AN EMPTY</i>
<i>SPACE WHEN YOU GO.</i>

261
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,760
<i>I HOPE YOU FIND</i>
<i>WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.</i>

262
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,782
OPERATIONS HAS DETECTED
A MINUTE INCREASE

263
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,368
IN THE ENGINE CORE TEMPERATURE.
ARE YOU AWARE OF IT?

264
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,370
YES, CAPTAIN. THERE'S A SLIGHT
IMBALANCE

265
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,038
IN THE MAGNETIC
CONSTRICTORS.

266
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,123
IT'S CAUSING THE PLASMA
STREAM TO OVERHEAT.

267
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,958
I HAVE A TEAM
WORKING ON IT.

268
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,460
KEEP ME POSTED.

269
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,296
MR. NEELIX, I'M VERY
PLEASED WITH YOUR PROGRAM

270
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,257
ESPECIALLY YOUR TRIBUTE
TO LIEUTENANT PARIS.

271
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,259
THANK YOU.

272
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,303
CAPTAIN, HAVE YOU DECIDED
WHO'S GOING TO REPLACE PARIS?

273
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,222
I HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE IN MIND.

274
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,641
BAYTART IS ONE. HAMILTON.

275
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,101
CAPTAIN, DO YOU THINK..?

276
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,105
I MEAN, IT'S POSSIBLE TOM MIGHT
CHANGE HIS MIND, TO COME BACK.

277
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,401
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
REPLACE HIM SO QUICKLY.

278
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,696
HARRY, LIEUTENANT PARIS
MADE HIS DECISION

279
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,365
WITH NO INDICATION THAT HE HAD
ANY DOUBTS ABOUT IT

280
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,117
OR THAT HE MIGHT CHANGE
HIS MIND IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

281
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,746
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT AND MOVE ON.

282
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,540
WHAT'S OUR
TACTICAL STATUS?

283
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,833
ALL SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONAL.

284
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,334
Jonas:
Engineering to Torres.

285
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,669
GO AHEAD.

286
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,920
We have a problem here.

287
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,756
WHAT IS IT?

288
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,716
THE MAGNETIC CONSTRICTORS
HAVE LOST ALIGNMENT.

289
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,301
THE PLASMA STREAM
IS WAY TOO HOT.

290
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,637
IT'S STARTING TO INFECT
THE INJECTOR VALVES.

291
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,180
I'M ON MY WAY.

292
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,807
WE'RE FINISHED
HERE. DISMISSED.

293
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,435
LIEUTENANT, IF I MAY...

294
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,271
THIS SOUNDS LIKE NEWS
OF SUBSTANCE TO ME.

295
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,567
JUST STAY OUT OF OUR WAY.

296
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,739
IT'S GOTTEN WORSE.

297
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,574
I CAN'T GET
THE INJECTOR VALVES CLOSED.

298
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,785
ANTIMATTER IS STARTING TO SEEP
INTO THE WARP CORE.

299
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,161
HAVE YOU TRIED ADJUSTING
THE POWER TRANSFER CONDUITS?

300
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,747
YES. NO EFFECT.

301
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,832
WE HAVE TO TRY TO CONTAIN
THE REACTION IN THE CORE.

302
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,252
DON'T LET THE P.T.C. TEMPERATURE
GET ABOVE 3.2. MILLION KELVINS.

303
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,797
IT'S AT 2.9 MILLION NOW.

304
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:08,426
(<i> high-pitched whine</i> )

305
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,345
P.T.C. TEMPERATURE NOW
AT THREE MILLION KELVINS.

306
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,972
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO VENT SOME PLASMA.

307
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,850
IF YOU VENT PLASMA THAT HOT
THROUGH THE NACELLES

308
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,936
THE WARP COILS
ARE GOING TO FRY.

309
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,480
BETTER THAT THAN A CORE BREACH.

310
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,440
REINFORCE THE STRUCTURAL FIELD

311
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,275
AROUND THE POWER
TRANSFER CONDUITS,

312
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,027
AND THEN PREPARE
TO BEGIN VENTING PLASMA.

313
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,990
P.T.C. TEMPERATURE NOW
3.2 MILLION KELVINS!

314
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,283
IT'S CASCADING.

315
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,993
GET AWAY FROM THAT CONSOLE.

316
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,495
I CAN STOP IT FROM HERE.

317
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,704
GET AWAY, JONAS!

318
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,289
(<i> Jonas groaning</i> )

319
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,040
COMPUTER,
INITIATE PLASMA VENTING.

320
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,297
ARE WE ALL RIGHT?

321
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,676
P.T.C. TEMPERATURE
IS DROPPING.

322
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,427
APPROACHING SAFE LEVELS.

323
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,179
WE'RE UNDER CONTROL.

324
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,347
NEELIX TO SICK BAY.

325
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,807
PREPARE FOR
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT.

326
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,517
WE HAVE THREE WOUNDED.

327
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,354
THIS ONE'S NOT BADLY HURT.

328
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,190
20 MILLIGRAMS IMPEDRAZINE.

329
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,733
VITAL SIGNS STEADY.

330
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,569
SECOND DEGREE BURNS
TO FACE AND CHEST.

331
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,990
TREAT HIM WITH
THE DERMAL REGENERATOR.

332
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,741
THE SITUATION
HAS BEEN STABILIZED.

333
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,035
NONE OF THE VICTIMS
IS IN DANGER ANY LONGER.

334
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,538
MAY I INTERVIEW
ONE OF THEM NOW?

335
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,122
ONE OF THE PATIENTS?

336
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,582
I'D THINK YOU'D BE
MORE INTERESTED

337
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,710
IN MY ASSESSMENT
OF THE MEDICAL SITUATION.

338
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,127
WELL, I AM, OF COURSE.

339
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,504
WOULD YOU CARE
TO MAKE A STATEMENT?

340
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,548
YES.

341
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,800
THE FIRST TASK IS TO TRIAGE

342
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,635
OR TO ASSESS
THE RELATIVE CONDITION

343
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,220
OF EACH OF THE VICTIMS,

344
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,597
AND THEN TO PRIORITIZE
TREATMENT ACCORDINGLY.

345
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,224
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

346
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,434
I'M SURE THAT WILL BE OF GREAT
INTEREST TO THE CREW.

347
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,228
I WASN'T FINISHED.

348
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,355
NEXT, THE TREATMENT, PER SE,
MUST BE SUPERVISED.

349
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,899
VERY INTERESTING.

350
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,318
NOW, I KNOW THE CREW WOULD
LOVE TO HEAR A FEW WORDS

351
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,070
FROM THE MAN
WHO RISKED HIS LIFE

352
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,363
TO SAVE THE SHIP.

353
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,907
WOULD YOU CONSENT
TO AN INTERVIEW?

354
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,575
I WAS JUST DOING
MY JOB, NEELIX.

355
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,578
LIEUTENANT TORRES IS
THE ONE YOU SHOULD TALK TO.

356
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,913
Janeway to Neelix.

357
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,748
RIGHT HERE, CAPTAIN.

358
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,583
Could you join us
on the bridge, please?

359
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,292
I'M ON MY WAY.

360
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:12,341
I'LL CONTACT YOU LATER
ABOUT THE INTERVIEW.

361
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,719
THE PLASMA BURST IRRADIATED
THE ENGINE NACELLES.

362
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,179
THE INNER LAYER OF
THE WARP COILS WAS BURNED AWAY.

363
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,306
WHICH MEANS
THE WARP ENGINES ARE USELESS

364
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,683
UNTIL WE CAN REBUILD THEM.

365
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,268
THEY'RE MADE
FROM A SUBSTANCE

366
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,811
KNOWN AS VERTERIUM
CORTENIDE.

367
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,646
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE
CAN FIND A SOURCE?

368
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,440
VERTERIUM CORTENIDE.
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN

369
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,777
THAT'S A DENSIFIED
COMPOSITE MATERIAL.

370
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,695
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S COMPOSED
OF POLYSILICATE VERTERIUM

371
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,238
AND MONOCRYSTAL CORTENUM.

372
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,990
DO YOU KNOW
OF ANY NEARBY SOURCE?

373
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,868
LET'S SEE.

374
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,080
THERE'S A YELLOW DWARF
SYSTEM CALLED HEMIKEK

375
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,833
WITH AN M-CLASS PLANET
QUITE RICH IN MINERALS.

376
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,543
MINING RIGHTS BELONG

377
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,796
TO A CONSORTIUM OF
NONAGGRESSIVE PEOPLE.

378
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,213
I'M SURE WE COULD
MAKE ARRANGEMENTS

379
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,549
TO PURCHASE SOME
VERTERIUM AND CORTENUM.

380
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,134
GOOD WORK, NEELIX.

381
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,846
CAPTAIN, MESSAGE COMING IN
FROM THE TALAXIAN CONVOY.

382
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,016
PUT IN ON SCREEN.

383
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,810
Laxeth: Captain Janeway...
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

384
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,853
We were attacked
by the Kazon-Nistrim.

385
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,022
DO YOU HAVE CASUALTIES?
HOW CAN WE HELP?

386
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,607
We have no serious casualties,

387
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,692
and they didn't take
any of our cargo.

388
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,736
The<i> one</i> thing
they were interested in

389
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,072
was your former crewman,
Thomas Paris.

390
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,908
They took him aboard their ship
and then left.

391
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,701
I thought you'd want to know.

392
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,976
TOM PARIS...

393
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,394
HELLO, SESKA.

394
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,814
YOU'RE LOOKING
RADIANTLY MATERNAL.

395
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:53,609
IN ANOTHER MONTH,
CHAKOTAY WILL HAVE A SON...

396
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,444
OR A DAUGHTER.

397
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,571
I REALLY DIDN'T
WANT TO KNOW WHICH.

398
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,407
MAKES IT MORE INTERESTING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

399
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,242
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

400
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:06,580
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHICH ONE CHAKOTAY WOULD PREFER.

401
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,792
HE AND I RARELY SEE
EYE TO EYE.

402
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,628
YOU'VE HAD YOUR PROBLEMS
WITH HIM LATELY TOO.

403
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,505
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

404
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,717
YOUR SUDDEN INABILITY
TO BE STARFLEET'S GOOD BOY.

405
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,760
IT'S NOT SUDDEN.

406
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,180
I NEVER REALLY FIT IN THERE.

407
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,766
THEN "LIEUTENANT TOM PARIS"
WAS JUST A PRETENSE.

408
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,226
NO.

409
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,228
NO, IT WAS ME TRYING VERY HARD

410
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,773
TO BE SOMEONE
I FINALLY COULDN'T BE.

411
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,650
I NEVER LIKED YOU, TOM.

412
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,030
I DIDN'T TRUST YOU.

413
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,448
I DON'T TRUST YOU NOW.

414
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,702
I CAN ASSURE YOU
THE FEELING IS MUTUAL.

415
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,204
FINE.

416
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:49,123
BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP EACH OTHER...

417
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,375
IF YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.

418
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,212
IS THAT WHY YOU KIDNAPPED ME
AND DRAGGED ME HERE

419
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,130
SO WE CAN BE PALS NOW?

420
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,424
I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO YOU.

421
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,842
AND IF IT DOESN'T?

422
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,261
THE KAZON TEND TO BE EXCESSIVE

423
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,304
IN THEIR USE OF FORCE.

424
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,390
IT'S NOTHING I CAN CHANGE.

425
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,725
BUT I CAN PROMISE

426
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,936
YOU'LL BE WELL-TREATED
ON THIS SHIP

427
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,271
IF WE DECIDE
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.

428
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,523
WHAT EXACTLY WOULD THAT MEAN?

429
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,900
YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT PILOT.

430
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,277
WE COULD MAKE GOOD USE
OF YOUR SKILLS

431
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,363
AND, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE
INFORMATION ABOUT<i> VOYAGER</i>

432
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,616
THAT COULD BE QUITE VALUABLE.

433
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,202
IT SEEMS TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY GETTING

434
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,956
A LOT OF VALUABLE INFORMATION
ABOUT<i> VOYAGER</i> FROM SOMEWHERE.

435
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,335
THINK ABOUT IT, TOM.

436
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,756
THINK ABOUT
WHERE YOU WANT TO BE

437
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,883
WHEN THE NISTRIM
SEIZE<i> VOYAGER</i>

438
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,843
AND START TAKING CONTROL
OF THE QUADRANT

439
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,180
SECTOR BY SECTOR.

440
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,099
JUST LET ME KNOW.

441
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,473
CAPTAIN'S LOG, STARDATE 49485.2.

442
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,017
IN SPITE OF THE FACT
THAT TOM PARIS

443
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,977
HAS BEEN ABDUCTED
BY THE KAZON,

444
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,813
WE MUST CONTINUE ON COURSE
FOR THE HEMIKEK SYSTEM.

445
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,564
SOMETHING JUST DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE.

446
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,525
I MEAN, HE WASN'T OFF THE SHIP
FOR A DAY WHEN THE KAZON

447
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,027
ATTACKED THAT CONVOY.

448
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,612
HOW DID THEY FIND
OUT SO FAST THAT TOM WAS THERE?

449
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,363
MAYBE SOMEONE ON THE CONVOY
TOLD THEM?

450
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,824
A TALAXIAN CONVOY

451
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,492
WOULD NEVER LET THE KAZON
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

452
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,536
THAT WOULD BE LIKE COMMITTING 
SUICIDE.

453
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,412
MAYBE THEY CAME
TO ROB THE CARGO

454
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:56,125
BUT WHEN THEY REALIZED
THERE WAS A STARFLEET OFFICER...

455
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,252
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE STOPPED THEM
FROM TAKING THE CARGO TOO.

456
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,254
AND ACCORDING
TO MY FRIEND, LAXETH,

457
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,924
IT WAS A SWIFT,
EFFICIENT STRIKE.

458
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,384
IT SOUNDS LIKE
THEY KNEW TOM WAS THERE

459
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,013
AND THEY CAME
JUST TO GET HIM.

460
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,806
BUT WHO WOULD HAVE
TOLD THEM?

461
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,809
ONE POSSIBILITY I CAN THINK OF

462
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,187
IS THAT IT WAS SOMEONE
ON THIS SHIP.

463
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,730
ON<i> VOYAGER?</i>

464
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,981
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

465
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,734
I DON'T KNOW...

466
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,486
BUT A RESPONSIBLE JOURNALIST
WOULD FIND OUT.

467
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,580
B'ELANNA, I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO FIND YOU HERE.

468
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,165
ARE YOU WORKING
THE NIGHT SHIFT?

469
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,834
I HAVE BEEN
SINCE THE ACCIDENT.

470
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,669
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

471
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,629
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD SHOW ME

472
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,008
HOW TO ACCESS THE SUBSPACE
COMMUNICATIONS LOGS?

473
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,885
WHY WOULD YOU
BE INTERESTED
IN THE COM LOGS?

474
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,012
WELL, JUST PART
OF MY NEWS PROGRAM.

475
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,681
WELL I CAN GET YOU INTO THEM,
BUT THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

476
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,559
I'M STILL TRYING TO BRING
THE MAGNETIC CONSTRICTORS INTO
ALIGNMENT.

477
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,895
I UNDERSTAND.
JUST GET ME STARTED.

478
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,527
HOW FAR BACK
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

479
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,738
OH, MAYBE A MONTH OR TWO.

480
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,490
OKAY, THE FILE'S OPEN.

481
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,326
TRANSMISSIONS ARE LOGGED
BY DATE AND TIME.

482
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,660
ANYTHING ELSE?

483
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,621
NO, I'LL BE FINE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

484
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,332
MIKE, WE'RE GOING
INTO THE COMPUTER CORE

485
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,667
TO LOOK OVER THE
CONSTRICTOR CIRCUITRY.

486
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,211
HOLD DOWN THE FORT, ALL RIGHT?

487
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,629
OKAY, LIEUTENANT.

488
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,677
<i>VOYAGER</i> TO MITHREN.

489
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,555
MITHREN AGAIN.

490
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,183
<i>VOYAGER</i> TO KOTATI...

491
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,603
WERE YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING
IN PARTICULAR?

492
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,522
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

493
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,233
SOMETHING ANOMALOUS.

494
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,483
WHY?

495
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,237
AN INCIDENT I'M INVESTIGATING.

496
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,365
TELL ME, MR. HERO,

497
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,328
IF SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE
A SECRET SUBSPACE TRANSMISSION,

498
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,536
HOW WOULD HE DO IT?

499
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,206
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO KNOW THAT?

500
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,500
I CAN'T BE TOO FORTHCOMING
RIGHT NOW,

501
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,087
BUT IF I FIND
WHAT I THINK I'M GOING TO,

502
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,048
WELL, LET ME JUST SAY
THAT THIS SHIP

503
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,134
WILL BE STUNNED.

504
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,803
A SECRET TRANSMISSION, HUH?

505
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,596
WELL, THAT WOULD BE TOUGH,
NEELIX.

506
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,974
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF
SECURITY ROUTINES IN PLACE,

507
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,769
AND ANY TIME A SUBSPACE
ANTENNA ARRAY IS IN USE,

508
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,646
THE SENSORS MAKE
A RECORD OF IT.

509
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,523
I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING
ANOMALOUS HERE.

510
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,151
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

511
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,320
WHAT?
THAT... GAP.

512
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,864
AS IF SOME OF THE LOG ENTRIES

513
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,199
HAVE BEEN DELETED.

514
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,867
WELL THAT'S JUST A DATA
FRAGMENTATION.

515
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,910
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
IT PROBABLY HAPPENED

516
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,954
WHEN THE PLASMA
OVERLOADED THE SYSTEM.

517
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,665
LITTLE GLITCHES LIKE THIS WILL
BE POPPING UP FOR WEEKS, I'D
IMAGINE.

518
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,083
HERE IT IS AGAIN.

519
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,584
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

520
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,296
MAYBE LIEUTENANT TORRES
CAN EXPLAIN IT.

521
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,173
THERE'S NOTHING
TO EXPLAIN.

522
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:53,677
BELIEVE ME, NEELIX,
YOU'RE MAKING TOO MUCH OF IT.

523
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,180
Neelix:
AH, HERE IT IS AGAIN.

524
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,890
GAPS IN THE LOG ENTRIES.

525
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,810
AND FRANKLY, IT LOOKS LIKE MORE
THAN DATA FRAGMENTATION TO ME.

526
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,983
THE GAPS ARE SHOWING UP
IN LOGS

527
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,736
ENTERED OVER
THE LAST MONTH,

528
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,405
BUT NOT BEFORE THAT.

529
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,780
Doctor:
So there you are!

530
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,741
I've been looking for you,
Mr. Neelix.

531
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,868
DOCTOR, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

532
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,829
You again neglected to include
me in your news program.

533
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,748
If you remember, I was to have
two segments today

534
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,208
because I was excluded
yesterday.

535
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,293
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.

536
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,212
I'VE BEEN SO PREOCCUPIED
WITH THIS OTHER MATTER.

537
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,796
In the interest of time,

538
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,258
I'm willing to forego
my story on the adrenal gland.

539
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,760
I will concentrate instead
on my latest idea

540
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,430
"The Klingon Glottis:
Friend or Foe?"

541
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,265
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING,

542
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,434
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT
IT OFF UNTIL TOMORROW.

543
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,935
That's what you said yesterday.

544
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,896
I'M SORRY, DOCTOR,
BUT I REALLY HAVE TO GO NOW.

545
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,533
Neelix:
ALL THROUGH

546
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,494
THE SUBSPACE COMMUNICATION LOGS,
THERE WERE THESE GAPS,

547
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,746
AS THOUGH SOMETHING
HAD BEEN ERASED.

548
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,415
WE HAVE RECENTLY
EXPERIENCED

549
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,623
A PLASMA OVERLOAD.

550
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,042
THAT COULD
EASILY ACCOUNT

551
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,877
FOR THE ANOMALOUS
READINGS IN THE LOGS.

552
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,464
AHA! I KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT.

553
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,132
ANSWER THIS, MR. VULCAN:

554
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,759
WHY WOULD THOSE GAPS,
THOSE DELETIONS

555
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,262
OCCUR ONLY
IN THE SUB COM LOGS

556
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,013
AND ONLY IN THE LAST MONTH?

557
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,433
I CHECKED
EVERY LOG SYSTEM WE HAVE--

558
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,977
SENSOR LOGS,
POWER ALLOCATION LOGS,

559
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,438
WARP MAINTENANCE LOGS,
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL LOGS.

560
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:32,318
THEY'RE ALL PERFECTLY FINE.

561
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,944
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

562
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,614
I BELIEVE SOMEONE ON THE SHIP

563
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,865
HAS BEEN MAKING
COVERT TRANSMISSIONS

564
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,201
AND ERASING THE EVIDENCE.

565
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,578
TO WHAT END?

566
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,037
I DON'T KNOW,

567
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,373
BUT I SUSPECT WHOEVER IT WAS

568
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,542
HAS BEEN COMMUNICATING
WITH THE KAZON.

569
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,378
THAT'S
AN EXTREMELY SERIOUS CHARGE.

570
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,921
I KNOW.

571
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,507
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO YOU.

572
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:01,347
MR. NEELIX, I STRONGLY SUSPECT
THAT YOUR ENTHUSIASM

573
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,349
FOR YOUR NEW
JOURNALISTIC ENDEAVOR

574
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,975
IS LEADING YOU TO SEE VILLAINS

575
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,560
WHERE NONE EXIST.

576
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,188
HOWEVER, EVEN THE
POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE

577
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,232
ON BOARD MIGHT SECRETLY
BE COMMUNICATING WITH THE KAZON

578
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,443
DESERVES INVESTIGATION.

579
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,111
I WILL PURSUE
THE MATTER.

580
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,531
AND I WILL HELP YOU.
I THINK NOT.

581
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,866
THIS IS NOW A MATTER
OF SHIP SECURITY.

582
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,577
I MUST ASK YOU TO WITHDRAW
AND LET ME HANDLE IT

583
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,204
ACCORDING TO
STARFLEET PROTOCOLS.

584
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,915
AS A JOURNALIST, I HAVE
AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION

585
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,418
TO KEEP DIGGING
FOR THE FACTS IN THIS CASE.

586
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,170
AND I HAVE THE
HIGHER OBLIGATION

587
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,382
TO KEEP YOU FROM PUTTING
YOURSELF AND OTHERS AT RISK.

588
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,924
YOU WILL DROP THIS MATTER.

589
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,264
I SEE.

590
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,266
ALL RIGHT. I LEAVE IT
IN YOUR HANDS.

591
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,231
GOOD HUNTING.

592
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,775
"A HIGHER OBLIGATION"?

593
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,862
HA. I'LL SHOW HIM
HIGHER OBLIGATION.

594
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,490
HE'LL HAVE ESKARIAN EGG
ON HIS FACE

595
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,409
WHEN I GET TO THE HEART OF THIS.

596
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,495
IT'S THE JOB OF A JOURNALIST
TO BE INDEPENDENT.

597
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,999
LIEUTENANT, I WONDER
IF YOU COULD...

598
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,501
I'M A LITTLE BUSY
RIGHT NOW, NEELIX.

599
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,753
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
I WAS WONDERING

600
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,590
IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO
LOOK UNDERNEATH A LOG

601
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,341
THAT SEEMS
TO HAVE BEEN ERASED,

602
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,469
SEE IF THERE'S
ANYTHING LEFT OF IT.

603
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,514
MR. HOGAN, COULD YOU PLEASE
HELP NEELIX OUT FOR A MINUTE?

604
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,183
YOU WANT TO RECOVER
DELETED LOGS?

605
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,269
UH, THAT WOULD BE IDEAL.

606
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,354
WELL, LET ME
GIVE IT A TRY.

607
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,273
USUALLY IT'S POSSIBLE
TO RECOVER DATA

608
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,815
UNLESS EXTRAORDINARY
MEASURES

609
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,234
WERE TAKEN TO ERASE IT.

610
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,656
WELL, THIS IS STRANGE.

611
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:46,326
COMPUTER, RUN A SIGNAL
MODULATION ANALYSIS
OF THIS FILE.

612
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,828
Security authorization required.

613
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,457
ENGINEERING AUTHORIZATION
OMEGA FOUR-SEVEN.

614
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,751
Authorization accepted.

615
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,669
Running analysis.

616
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,589
WHAT?

617
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,840
I... CAN'T RECOVER THE LOGS,

618
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,468
BECAUSE THESE MESSAGES WERE SENT

619
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,554
WITHOUT USING
ANY OF THE ANTENNA ARRAYS.

620
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,139
HOW COULD SOMEONE DO THAT?

621
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,890
BY SENDING THE
TRANSMISSIONS

622
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,684
THROUGH THE SHIP'S POWER GRID.

623
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,185
THE MESSAGES WERE ENCODED

624
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,480
IN THE WASTE ENERGY
FROM THE PROPULSION SYSTEMS,

625
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,940
WHICH IS
ALMOST INDISTINGUISHABLE

626
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,817
FROM GALACTIC BACKGROUND NOISE.

627
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,987
INGENIOUS.

628
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,238
WOULD THERE BE A WAY

629
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,783
TO DETERMINE
WHO SENT THE MESSAGES?

630
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:29,244
I'M LOOKING
FOR SIGNAL CORRELATION TRACES.

631
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,997
THEY'D INDICATE A COM LINK
TO THE E.P.S. CONDUITS--

632
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,166
MAYBE GIVE US A LOCATION.

633
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,002
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN...

634
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,337
THERE.

635
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,674
THERE'S ONE.

636
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,175
THE SOURCE OF
THE COM LINK

637
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,638
IS ON DECK FOUR,
SECTION THREE-C.

638
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,973
SORRY, BUT I CAN'T GET
MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT.

639
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,058
MR. HOGAN, I NEED
YOUR HELP OVER HERE.

640
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,310
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

641
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,936
I'LL CHECK OUT DECK FOUR.

642
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,939
GO ROOM BY ROOM,
CONSOLE BY CONSOLE.

643
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,818
I'D LOOK FOR EVIDENCE
OF RECENT DELETIONS.

644
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,111
IF YOU SEE ANY,
RUN A RECOVERY PROGRAM.

645
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,488
SEE WHAT YOU GET.

646
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,552
COMPUTER, ACTIVATE MONITOR.

647
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,220
Unable to comply.

648
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,515
Monitor is cleared for
Lieutenant Thomas Paris only.

649
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,141
OVERRIDE EXISTING CLEARANCE.

650
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,645
ENGINEERING AUTHORIZATION
OMEGA FOUR-SEVEN.

651
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,147
Authorization accepted.

652
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,440
Files recovered.

653
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:57,040
UNBELIEVABLE.

654
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,252
MY FRIENDS,
I DERIVE NO SATISFACTION

655
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,421
FROM WHAT
I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

656
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,006
I KNOW I ORIGINALLY PROMISED YOU

657
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,426
THAT I
WOULD ONLY BRING YOU GOOD NEWS.

658
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:12,180
HOWEVER, I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU KNOW THE TRUTH.

659
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,476
I HAVE UNCOVERED EVIDENCE
THAT CASTS SERIOUS DOUBT

660
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,563
ON THE LOYALTIES
OF LIEUTENANT THOMAS PARIS.

661
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,649
I have discovered secret
communications to the Kazon

662
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,150
that were sent from his quarters

663
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,903
just prior
to his leaving the ship.

664
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,362
GET HIM UP HERE...<i> NOW.</i>

665
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,322
There was a series of messages
sent to the Kazon

666
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,950
for some weeks before his
departure...

667
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:39,082
HOW DID YOU TRACE THOSE
TRANSMISSIONS TO TOM'S QUARTERS?

668
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,209
IT WAS, UH...

669
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,922
I BELIEVE IT WAS CALLED
SIGNAL CORRELATION TRACES.

670
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,966
MR. HOGAN WAS HELPING ME
AND HE DETECTED THEM.

671
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,051
WHEN I LOOKED FOR
SIGNAL CORRELATION TRACES

672
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,428
THERE WERE NONE.

673
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,054
THAT MEANS SOMEONE PLACED
THEM IN THE SYSTEM

674
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,390
AFTER MY INITIAL
INVESTIGATION.

675
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,935
WHAT INITIAL INVESTIGATION?

676
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,311
CAPTAIN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

677
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,398
(<i> sighing</i> )

678
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,778
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY WILL COME
AS A SURPRISE TO YOU, COMMANDER.

679
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:11,531
THERE HAS BEEN A
SPY ABOARD<i> VOYAGER</i>

680
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,950
BUT IT ISN'T TOM PARIS.

681
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,493
IT ISN'T?

682
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,204
NO. LIEUTENANT PARIS IS,
IN FACT, PART OF OUR PLAN.

683
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,915
PLAN?

684
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,667
SOME WEEKS AGO, TUVOK
DISCOVERED EVIDENCE

685
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,126
OF COVERT TRANSMISSIONS

686
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,004
LEAVING<i> VOYAGER</i> THROUGH
THE E.P.S. SYSTEM.

687
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,756
WE REALIZED THERE WAS
SOMEONE ON THIS SHIP

688
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,342
COMMUNICATING WITH
THE KAZON-NISTRIM.

689
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,386
Tuvok:
HOWEVER, WE WERE UNABLE TO
ASCERTAIN WHO THAT PERSON WAS.

690
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,013
WE NEEDED A WAY
TO FLUSH OUT THE SPY

691
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,766
AND WE HAD EXHAUSTED
ALL CONVENTIONAL MEANS.

692
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,101
THAT'S WHEN
WE THOUGHT OF USING TOM

693
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,188
FINDING A WAY TO GET HIM
ON THE KAZON SHIP.

694
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,941
ARE YOU SAYING PARIS'
INSULTING BEHAVIOR

695
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,985
THE GAMBLING,
BEING LATE FOR DUTY

696
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:51,029
MOUTHING OFF AT ME,
WAS ALL A RUSE?

697
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,572
THAT IS CORRECT.

698
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,366
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT
HIS DECISION TO LEAVE THE SHIP

699
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:58,077
APPEAR PLAUSIBLE, SO HE BEGAN
BEHAVING LIKE A MALCONTENT.

700
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,956
AND THE REASON I WASN'T LET IN
ON THIS LITTLE PLAN?

701
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,958
I WAS THE ONE
WHO RECOMMENDED

702
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,418
TO CAPTAIN JANEWAY
THAT YOU NOT BE TOLD.

703
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,587
I SUSPECTED THAT THE SPY
WAS A MAQUIS

704
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,923
AND FELT IT WAS WRONG
TO PUT YOU IN A POSITION

705
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:13,218
OF SETTING A TRAP FOR SOMEONE
WHO HAD ONCE SERVED UNDER YOU.

706
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,636
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME.

707
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,973
COMMANDER, THE
SIMPLE FACT IS

708
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,017
WE NEEDED A
GOOD PERFORMANCE.

709
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:23,729
I'M AFRAID WE USED YOU
TO HELP TOM PROVIDE IT

710
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,023
AND YOU DID A
DAMN GOOD JOB.

711
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,069
NOW, IT SEEMS MR. NEELIX'S
INVESTIGATION

712
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,821
HAS MADE SOMEONE NERVOUS--

713
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,406
NERVOUS ENOUGH
TO PUT A TRAIL

714
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,116
IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM
FOR HIM TO FOLLOW.

715
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,493
COULD IT BE HOGAN?

716
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,704
I DON'T THINK SO.

717
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,081
HE WAS JUST THE PERSON
WALKING BY

718
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,001
WHO LIEUTENANT TORRES
ASKED TO HELP ME.

719
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,003
THE SPY MAY BE
A LITTLE COZY NOW

720
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,547
SINCE YOU TOOK THE BAIT
AND POINTED THE FINGER AT TOM,

721
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,174
BUT WE DON'T
WANT HIM COZY.

722
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,927
I'D RATHER HE
FEEL SOME PRESSURE.

723
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,386
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE

724
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,722
OF MR. NEELIX'S
UNINTENTIONAL BLUNDER.

725
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:02,059
EXACTLY. I WANT YOU
TO KEEP INVESTIGATING, NEELIX.

726
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,561
DO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING--
POKE AROUND, ASK QUESTIONS--

727
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,104
BUT LET PEOPLE THINK

728
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,441
YOU'RE NOT SO SURE
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT TOM PARIS.

729
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,903
THAT WOULD PUT NEELIX IN A
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.

730
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,822
WE WOULD KEEP AN OPEN
COM LINK TO YOU, AT ALL HOURS.

731
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,282
MY SECURITY TEAM
COULD ACT IMMEDIATELY

732
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,993
IF ANYTHING
WERE TO HAPPEN.

733
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,494
IT'S UP TO YOU, NEELIX.

734
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,496
THIS IS PURELY VOLUNTARY.

735
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,298
ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP, CAPTAIN

736
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:38,177
AND GET TOM HOME SAFELY,
I WANT TO DO.

737
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,893
(<i> static</i> )

738
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:58,239
(<i> static</i> )

739
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,407
What did you expect?

740
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,200
Do you think
this has all been

741
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,369
about exchanging
holiday greetings?

742
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,288
No, of course
not, but...

743
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,332
Here's how it is going to work.

744
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,334
We'll be waiting for you
on a planet

745
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,795
called Hemikek Four.

746
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,922
(<i> static</i> )

747
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,341
WELL, TOM, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD

748
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,969
TO HAVE ONE'S
INSTINCTS VERIFIED.

749
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,428
CLEVER PLAN, SESKA.

750
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,221
LEADING<i> VOYAGER</i>
INTO AN AMBUSH

751
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,266
BUT EVEN SO, THIS SHIP WILL BE
OUTMANNED AND OUTGUNNED.

752
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,811
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
GROUND TROOPS ON HEMIKEK

753
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,105
AND MORE SHIPS
ON THE WAY.

754
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,231
NOW, DON'T YOU WISH
YOU'D TAKEN MY OFFER?

755
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,028
(<i> mechanical whine</i> )

756
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,003
THANKS FOR THE HOSPITALITY.

757
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,422
GO GET HIM.

758
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,278
LIEUTENANT TORRES IS WAITING FOR
THESE INTERLINK SEQUENCERS.

759
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,613
GET THEM TO HER
RIGHT AWAY.

760
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,948
EXCUSE ME.

761
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,365
OH, HELLO, NEELIX.

762
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,243
I WAS WONDERING IF ONE OF YOU
COULD HELP ME?

763
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,828
WE'RE A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED?

764
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,371
THE SIGNAL
CORRELATION TRACES

765
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,207
THAT IMPLICATED
TOM PARIS--

766
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,793
THEY WERE ADDED
TO THE FILE AFTER THE FACT.

767
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,669
YOU'RE KIDDING?
SO, I WAS TRYING

768
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,964
TO FIGURE HOW
THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED

769
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,257
AND WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE IT.

770
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,175
THIS COULDN'T BE
A WORSE TIME, NEELIX.

771
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,928
WE'RE GETTING EVERYTHING READY
FOR REBUILDING THE WARP COILS.

772
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,846
DO YOU MIND IF I USE

773
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,141
THE DIAGNOSTIC TERMINAL
OVER THERE?

774
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,558
GO AHEAD.
JUST DON'T TAP INTO

775
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,768
ANY ENGINEERING SYSTEMS.

776
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,061
I'LL BE CAREFUL.

777
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,353
Torres to Engineering.

778
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,855
JONAS HERE, LIEUTENANT.

779
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,150
I need the electrodynamic
load specs.

780
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,152
They weren't with
the other things you sent.

781
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,112
SORRY, LIEUTENANT. I'LL GET THEM
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

782
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,446
TAKE THESE
TO LIEUTENANT TORRES.

783
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,781
RIGHT.

784
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,289
WHAT'S GOING ON?

785
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:53,915
Janeway:
Bridge to Engineering.

786
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,374
JONAS HERE, CAPTAIN.

787
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,169
I need you to increase
transporter range.

788
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,377
Shunt all available power

789
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,255
TO TRANSPORTER ROOM TWO.
Right away.

790
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,714
LET ME KNOW AS SOON
AS YOU'VE DONE IT.

791
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,049
WE HAVE AN INCOMING SHUTTLE,

792
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,884
AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED
HUMAN LIFE SIGNS.

793
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,804
It may be Tom Paris.

794
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,347
YES, MA'AM.

795
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,395
PARIS TO<i> VOYAGER!</i>

796
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,191
PARIS TO<i> VOYAGER!</i> 
DO YOU READ ME YET?

797
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,777
PARIS TO<i> VOYAGER!</i>

798
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,613
Paris to<i> Voyager!</i> Come in!

800
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,993
CAPTAIN, CHANGE YOUR COURSE
IMMEDIATELY.

WAITING FOR YOU

802
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,539

and more ships on the way.

803
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,999
WE'LL GET YOU OUT OF THERE AS
SOON AS WE CAN TOM.

804
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,917
YOU'RE STILL OUT
OF TRANSPORTER RANGE,

805
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,919
BUT WE WON'T CHANGE COURSE UNTIL
WE'VE LOCKED ON TO YOU.

806
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,671
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF!

807
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,341
Just get<i> Voyager</i> to safety!

808
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,218
As soon as you're on board.

809
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,261
TOM, WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

810
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,305
Lieutenant Paris, report.

811
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,474
MR. JONAS,
WE NEED THAT TRANSPORTER NOW.

812
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,060
I'm working on it, Captain.

813
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,270
I'M HAVING TROUBLE RESETTING
THE E.P.S. MANIFOLD.

814
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,646
Janeway:
Stay on it.

815
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,567
MR. JONAS, I'M NO EXPERT,

816
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,943
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE WORKING

817
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,778
ON THE TRANSPORTER
SUBSYSTEMS.

818
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,281
NEELIX,
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

819
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,246
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

820
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,705
WHAT DID YOU DO?

821
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,210
WHAT IS THIS FORCE FIELD FOR?

822
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,836
IT'S JUST A PRECAUTION.

823
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,338
PLEASE, NEELIX!

824
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,881
STAY OUT OF THIS!

825
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,345
Janeway:
Tom, can you hear me? Report.

826
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,971
I'M HERE, CAPTAIN.

827
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,598
We'll be
in normal transporter range

828
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,475
in another minute.

00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,437
CAPTAIN... THE SPY.

00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,772
IT'S MICHAEL JONAS.

831
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:44,776
He's the one
that sabotaged the ship.

832
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,736
NOTED. JANEWAY TO TUVOK.

833
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,529

IMMEDIATELY.

STARTING TO BREACH.

837
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,621
MIGHT NOT MAKE IT, CAPTAIN.

838
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,666
I RECOGNIZE THAT SUBROUTINE.

839
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,127
YOU'RE INTO
THE WEAPONS SYSTEM.

840
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,461

00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,075
We're energizing now.

DO YOU HAVE HIM?

850
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,625
We have him, Captain.
He's all right.

851
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,338
IT'S THE KAZON SHIP, CAPTAIN.

852
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:50,175
RETURN FIRE. JANEWAY TO TUVOK,
ARE YOU IN ENGINEERING YET?

853
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,592
The doors are sealed.

BRIDGE TO TRANSPORTER
ROOM TWO.

856
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,014
LOCK ON TO MR. JONAS
IN ENGINEERING

857
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,182
AND BEAM HIM OUT OF THERE.

858
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,891
Man:
Aye, Captain.

859
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,235
All I got
was his combadge, Captain.

860
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,571
CAPTAIN,
WE'VE LOST WEAPONS.

861
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,573
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PHASER
ARRAYS HAVE BEEN DISABLED

862
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,825
FROM ENGINEERING.

863
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,160
EVASIVE MANEUVERS, ENSIGN.

864
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,329
MR. KIM, GET THOSE WEAPONS
BACK ON-LINE.

865
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,755
(<i> grunts</i> )

866
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,470
(<i> groaning</i> )

867
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,934
(<i> yelling</i> )

868
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,210
(<i> bellowing</i> )

869
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,308
WEAPONS ARE BACK
ON-LINE, CAPTAIN.

870
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,893
FIRE AT WILL.

871
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,270
YES, MA'AM.

872
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,618
ARE YOU INJURED?

873
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,994
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
MR. VULCAN.

874
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,080
I'M PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.

875
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,707
UNFORTUNATELY, MR. JONAS
WASN'T SO LUCKY.

876
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,959
Janeway:
Bridge to Tuvok.

877
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,878
I'm standing down Red Alert.

878
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,839
WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE
PLENTY OF MATERIAL

879
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,427
FOR TOMORROW'S
<i>BRIEFING WITH NEELIX.</i>

880
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,387
...AND FORTUNATELY,
I WAS ABLE TO STEAL

881
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,722
ONE OF THE KAZON SHUTTLES
AND ESCAPE.

882
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,516
AN AMAZING STORY.

883
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,184
AMAZING.

884
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,562
NOW, I'D LIKE TO SAY
SOMETHING MORE, IF I MIGHT.

885
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,021
OF COURSE.

886
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,900
UM, I KNOW THAT I'VE
BEEN ACTING LIKE A JERK

887
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,111
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

888
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,155
UNFORTUNATELY,
I HAD TO BEHAVE THAT WAY

889
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,531
IF THE SPY
WAS GOING TO BELIEVE

890
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,033
THAT I REALLY WANTED
TO LEAVE THE SHIP.

891
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,578
SO I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
TO ANYONE

892
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,497
THAT I MIGHT HAVE OFFENDED...

893
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,957
UH, ESPECIALLY
COMMANDER CHAKOTAY.

894
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,875
I GAVE HIM A PRETTY HARD TIME.

895
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,880
NOT THAT IT WASN'T A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF FUN, MIND YOU.

896
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,841
(<i> hearty laugh</i> )

897
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,093
THERE YOU HAVE IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

898
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,846
THE TRUE HERO
OF THIS WHOLE ENDEAVOR:

899
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,056
LIEUTENANT
THOMAS EUGENE PARIS.

900
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,975
WELL, I'M AFRAID THAT'S
ALL THE TIME WE HAVE.

901
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,935
OH, I'D LIKE TO
APOLOGIZE TO THE DOCTOR

902
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,105
FOR NOT GETTING AROUND
TO HIM ONCE AGAIN TODAY.

903
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,732
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
HE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW

904
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,692
WITH LOTS OF FASCINATING
INFORMATION

905
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,487
ABOUT THE BOLIAN
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.

906
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,905
GOOD DAY,<i> VOYAGER.</i>
