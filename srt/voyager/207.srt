00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,670
Paris:
INERTIAL DAMPERS HAVE FAILED.

00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,672
Kes:
I CAN'T GET ANY RESPONSE
FROM THE FIELD COILS.

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,005
Paris:
DID YOU VERIFY
THE CONTROL INPUTS?

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,383
STAND BY.
THE INPUTS ARE BLOCKED.

5
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,178
WE'VE GOT TO FLUSH
THE PLASMA INJECTORS.

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:15,850
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST A PHASE
SYNCHRONIZATION ADJUSTMENT.

7
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:18,352
PLASMA INJECTORS.

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,895
PLASMA INJECTORS.

00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,689
RIGHT.

(<i> chuckling</i> )

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,532
THAT WAS NOT FAIR.

14
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,950
AS YOUR FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR,
IT'S MY DUTY

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,494
TO PREPARE YOU
FOR ANYTHING, FAIR OR NOT.

16
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,455
CLOGGING SOMEONE'S PLASMA
INJECTORS IS A DIRTY TRICK.

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,500
YES, WELL, I'M FAMOUS FOR
MY DIRTY TRICKS, YOU KNOW?

18

(<i> panting</i> )

19
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,798
WHAT WAS THAT?

20
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,009
I NEVER SAID THE SIMULATION
WAS FINISHED.

21
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,893

(<i> Paris and Kes laughing</i> )

23
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,442
I'LL BE READY
FOR ANYTHING NEXT TIME.

24
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,653
OH, SOUNDS LIKE
A CHALLENGE TO ME!

25
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,321
(<i> both laughing</i> )

28
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,416
I HOPE YOU HAVE
GOOD NEWS, COMMANDER.

29
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,083
BASED ON THIS INVENTORY,

30
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,504
OUR FOOD RESERVES LOOK TO BE
DOWN TO 30 PERCENT OF CAPACITY.

31
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,839
GOOD NEWS AND BAD.

32
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,925
WE HAVE LOCATED
AN "M" CLASS PLANET.

33
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,468
AND IT SHOWS HIGH AMINO ACID
AND PROTEIN READINGS.

34
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,845
THAT SHOULD INDICATE
A HEALTHY PLANT LIFE.

35
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,137
WHAT'S BAD ABOUT IT?

36
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,932
IT'S A FULL DAY OUT OF OUR WAY.

37
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,767
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY
CHOICE. IT'S THE FIRST CHANCE

38
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,268
WE'VE HAD TO REPLENISH
OUR SUPPLIES IN WEEKS.

39
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,853
AND OUR LONG-RANGE SENSORS

40
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,022
CAN'T CONFIRM ANY PLANT LIFE
ON THE SURFACE.

41
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,024
WHY NOT?

42
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,610
IT'S ONE STRANGE PLANET,
CAPTAIN.

43
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,073
IT'S SHROUDED.

44
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,824
VAPORS COVER IT
LIKE A CURTAIN.

45
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,243
E.M. DISTURBANCES
ALL OVER THE ATMOSPHERE.

46
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,703
SOME OF THESE READINGS SUGGEST A
PLANET

47
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,371
EARLY IN ITS EVOLUTION--

48
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,957
ALMOST LIKE
A PRIMEVAL EARTH.

49
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,374
THE PEOPLE
IN STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY

50
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,418
HAVE ALREADY NICKNAMED IT
"PLANET HELL."

51
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,211
SO IT MIGHT BE
A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

52
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,964
CAPTAIN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'LL FIND

53
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,383
WHEN WE GET TO THE SURFACE--
FLORA OR FAUNA, FRIEND OR FOE.

54
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,885
IF WE KNEW WE'D FIND

55
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:20,099
ANOTHER "M" CLASS
PLANET SOON, I'D...

56
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,102
SET A COURSE
FOR PLANET HELL, COMMANDER.

57
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,884
(<i> plays Mozart concerto</i>

58
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,350
(<i> door beeping</i> )

59
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,316
THAT WAS YOU?

60
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,860
THAT WAS ME.

61
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,529
I'M IMPRESSED.

62
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,364
I KEEP HEARING
MY MOTHER SAY

63
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,700
"PRACTICE, HARRY,
PRACTICE."

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,411
SO I ATE NEELIX'S
FOOD FOR A WEEK

65
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,455
AND USED MY
REPLICATOR RATIONS.

66
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,749
PLAY SOMETHING FOR ME.

67
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,793
WELL, I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR A FEW
DAYS, AND I DON'T THINK...

68
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,045
OH, COME ON!
PLAY SOMETHING.

69
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,338

I'M NOT HERE.

70

(<i> continues Mozart concerto</i> )

71
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,349
PLAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

72
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,435
DIFFERENT?

73
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,855
SOMETHING...
NOT SO CHEERFUL.

74
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,065
WHY?

75
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,692
WHAT? YOU DON'T
TAKE REQUESTS?

76
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,194
SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU,
PARIS?

77
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,074
(<i> sighing</i> ):
OH, HARRY.

78
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,617
I'M IN TROUBLE.

79
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,868
WHAT'S NEW?

80
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,120
I THINK I'M IN LOVE.

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,370
WHAT'S NEW?

82
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,747
WITH KES.
KES?

83
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,332
I KNOW, I KNOW!

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,792
I NEVER EVEN SAW IT COMING.

85
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,878
I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST GOOD BUDDIES.

86
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,546
BUT THERE SHE WAS,
IN MY ARMS.

87
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,339
IN YOUR ARMS? PARIS...

88
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,591
YOU DIDN'T.

89
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,970
WHAT? OH! NO!

90
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,888
I DIDN'T.

91
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,723
I WOULDN'T!

92
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,351
SHE STUMBLED DURING
A FLIGHT SIMULATION.

93
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,938
I CAUGHT HER.

94
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,149
I HELD HER FOR AN INSTANT.

95
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,653
ARE YOU GOING
TO PLAY OR NOT?

96
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,906
A WHOLE CREW
FULL OF WOMEN

97
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,909
AND I HAVE TO FALL
FOR THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE.

98
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,453
WHY DO I DO THIS
TO MYSELF?

99
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,041
IF YOU ASK ME,
I SAY YOU ENJOY IT.

100
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,500
ENJOY IT?

101
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,127
ONLY THING
THAT MAKES SENSE.

102
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,296
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
THE SAME THING TO YOURSELF

103
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,922
YOUR WHOLE LIFE--

104
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,051
SETTING YOURSELF UP
FOR REJECTION.

105
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,263
YOU MUST ENJOY
PLAYING THE PART.

106
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,725
HEY, DON'T KNOCK IT
IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED IT.

107
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,102
I JUST HAVE TO BE
MORE CAREFUL.

108
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,604
I CAN'T LET MYSELF
BE ALONE WITH HER.

109
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,025
THERE'S AN OLD
CHINESE EXPRESSION--

110
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,110
"STAY OUT OF HARM'S WAY."

111
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,656
THAT'S NOT
A CHINESE EXPRESSION.

112
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,826
IF IT WORKS, USE IT.

113
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,703
OF COURSE,
IT WOULD HELP A LITTLE

114
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,830
IF KES AND I WEREN'T GOING
TO BE STUCK ON THE SAME SHIP

115
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,082
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

116
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,875
THAT'S A PESSIMISTIC VIEW.

117
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,543
I'M IN A PESSIMISTIC MOOD.

118
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,503
PLAY SOMETHING
PESSIMISTIC.

119
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,506
PRACTICE, HARRY,
PRACTICE.

120

(<i> playing up-tempo,</i>
<i>bouncy melody</i> )

121
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,566
AND THEN SUDDENLY WE FELL
INTO A SUBSPACE ANOMALY.

122
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,068
NONE OF THE READINGS
MADE ANY SENSE.

123
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,444
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

124
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,197
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
TERRIBLE FOR YOU.

125
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,615
UH, PEPPER, SWEETING?

126
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:33,536
OH. ANYWAY, IT WAS QUITE
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

127
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:37,374
I'M SURE LIEUTENANT PARIS
IS A FINE TEACHER.

128
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,630
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT,
THE PALLIANTYNE PEAS.

129
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,220
UH...

130
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,597
HMM! EVER SO LIGHTLY SPICED.

131
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,163

HIGH LEVELS
OF TRIGEMIC VAPORS

133
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,959
BUT IT SHOULD STILL
SUPPORT HUMANOID LIFE.

00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,752
Dr. Zimmerman:

135
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,505
Please turn to your emergency
medical holographic channel.

136
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,509
I hope you don't mind
that I've been eavesdropping.

137
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
But I have something important
to contribute.

138
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,929
WHAT IS IT, DOCTOR?

139
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,597
Of course, it wouldn't be
necessary for me

140
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,017
to eavesdrop if I were included
in these discussions

141
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,685
as a matter of operating
protocol.

142
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,187
DOCTOR...
You should be aware

143
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,896
that trigemic vapors
at the recorded levels

144
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,858
can cause severe humanoid
skin irritations.

145
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,110
COULD YOU PROVIDE SOME SORT OF
SKIN PROTECTION THAT MIGHT HELP?

146
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,362
I am whipping up a batch

147
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,572
of dermal osmotic sealant
as we speak.

148
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,907
Nevertheless, skin exposure

149
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,909
to the atmosphere
should be limited.

150
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,537
NOTED, DOCTOR. THANK YOU.

151
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,459
TELL ME, JUST HOW OFTEN
DO YOU... EAVESDROP?

152
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,588
I am simply
trying to monitor issues

153
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,009
involving the health
of the crew, Captain.

154
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,719
When activated,
the emergency medical program

155
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,137
establishes comlinks

156
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,349
with all key areas
of the ship, and I have...

157
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,683
on occasion...

158
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,605
I am a doctor, not a voyeur.

159
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,149
I am programmed to be discreet.

160
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,942
I AM SURE.

161
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,945
COMMANDER CHAKOTAY WILL DISCUSS
OPERATING PROTOCOLS WITH YOU

162
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,906
AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY.

163
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,825
IN THE MEANTIME,
NO MORE EAVESDROPPING, DOCTOR.

164
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,661
But, Captain, I...
THAT'S AN ORDER.

165
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,582
THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM,
CAPTAIN.

166
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,251
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO TRANSPORT TO THE SURFACE

167
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,920
BECAUSE OF THE
E.M. DISTURBANCES
IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

168
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,548
THEY'LL INTERFERE
WITH OUR COMLINKS TOO.

169
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:53,176
I'LL HAVE MR. KIM
TAKE A LOOK.

170
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,471
LISTEN, WHY DON'T WE TAKE IN
A HOLODECK PROGRAM LATER?

171
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,516
A MOLIERE COMEDY--
THAT WILL CHEER YOU UP.

172
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,020
I THINK I'LL
JUST EAT LATER.

173

(<i> chuckling nervously</i> )

174
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,818
DAMN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

175
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,530
VERY SIMPLE. WE JUST
WON'T SIT WITH HER.

176
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,656
BUT THAT'S RUDE.
NO, THAT'S SMART.

177
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,908
WE'LL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

178
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,119
WE HAVE BRIDGE OPERATIONS
TO DISCUSS.

179
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,162
GENTLEMEN,
MAY I RECOMMEND

180
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,665
THE ALFARIAN
HAIR PASTA TODAY?

181
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,084
HAIR PASTA?

182
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,502
THAT<i> IS</i> JUST AN
EXPRESSION, ISN'T IT?

183
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,212
(<i> laughs</i> )

184
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,715
NOT AT ALL. IT'S ACTUALLY MADE
FROM THE FOLLICLES

185
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,301
OF THE MATURE ALFARIAN.

186
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,387
WE HARVEST THE HAIR
DURING SHEDDING SEASON

187
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,764
IN EARLY FALL.

188
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,682
IT'S VERY HIGH
IN PROTEIN.

189
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,934
WHATEVER.

190
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,852
WE JUST HAVE A LOT

191
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,022
OF BRIDGE OPERATIONS
BUSINESS TO DISCUSS.

192
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,364
Chakotay:
Mr. Kim, please report
to the bridge.

193
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,659
HAVE A NICE LUNCH.

194
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,066
YOU SUBCLASS GENUS.

195
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,401
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

196
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,445
SITTING WITH YOUR BACKS
TO EACH OTHER

197
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,032
LIKE TWO STRANGERS
WAITING FOR A TRANSPORT.

198
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,783
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO FOOL ME?

199
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,328
OH. A GUY JUST CAN'T WIN.

200
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,164
LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING
TO FOOL YOU ABOUT.

201
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,541
REALLY. I SWEAR.

202
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,708
LIAR.

203
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,297
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

204
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,719
I'LL KILL YOU!

205
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,014
Paris:
IT'S TOO LATE!

206
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:07,018
I'M BETTING YOUR HAIR PASTA
ALREADY DID THE TRICK!

207
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,313
Janeway to Lieutenant Paris
and Mr. Neelix.

208
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,814
GO AHEAD.
YES, CAPTAIN?

209
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,608
Please report to my ready room
right away.

210
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,570
I have something important
to discuss with you.

211
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,322
UH, CAPTAIN, DID YOU SAY
"RIGHT AWAY"?

212
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,074
IF WE COULD HAVE...
That's what I said, Mr. Paris.

213
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,201
Janeway out.

214
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,676
WOULD ANYONE
CARE TO EXPLAIN?

215
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:47,642
IT MIGHT BE TOO LONG
TO GO INTO RIGHT NOW, CAPTAIN.

216
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:52,813
VERY WELL. I HAVE A MISSION
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

217
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,190
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

218
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,609
THAT THERE ARE FOOD SOURCES
ON THIS PLANET,

219
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,902
BUT WE CAN'T TRANSPORT
TO THE SURFACE.

220
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,613
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
A SHUTTLE DOWN

221
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,780
AND DO A LITTLE SCOUTING.

222
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,491
ME... AND HIM?

223
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,161
HE'S OUR BEST PILOT,
AND YOU'RE OUR EXPERT

224
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,623
ON EDIBLE PLANT SPECIES
IN THIS QUADRANT.

225
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,165
UH, CAPTAIN,

226
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,500
I'M NOT ONE
TO PASS UP A MISSION,

227
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,377
BUT IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE,

228
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,964
MAYBE ENSIGN BAYTART,
WHO IS A FINE PILOT--

229
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,049
THERE ARE ELECTROMAGNETIC
ANOMALIES IN THE ATMOSPHERE,

230
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,009
AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE YOU
AT THE HELM.

231
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,680
AM I... DISCERNING

232
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,558
A PERSONAL PROBLEM HERE,
GENTLEMEN?

233
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,647
FRANKLY, YES, CAPTAIN.

234
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,403
SOLVE IT.
YOU LEAVE AT 1400 HOURS.

235
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,753
WE'RE MODIFYING
THE TRANSPORTER

236
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,380
TO TRY AND PENETRATE
THE ATMOSPHERE.

237
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,090
SO FAR NO LUCK.

238
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,300
HOWEVER, WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING

239
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,926
COMPUTER SIMULATIONS
TO DETERMINE

240
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,845
IF THE E.M. DISTURBANCES
FOLLOW ANY SPECIFIC PATTERN.

241
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,306
OUR DATA ANALYSIS
SUGGESTS THAT

242
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,600
THERE MAY BE OCCASIONAL
ATMOSPHERIC WINDOWS

243
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,268
THAT WOULD ALLOW
US TO GET THROUGH.

244
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,437
HOW OCCASIONAL
AND HOW LONG WILL THEY LAST?

245
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,773
WE SHOULD SEE ONE
EVERY 30 HOURS OR SO,

246
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,692
BUT THEY MAY ONLY LAST
FOR A MATTER OF MINUTES.

247
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,360
I CAN'T BE SURE YET.

248
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,737
AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH FOR US
TO BEAM UP FOOD SUPPLIES.

249
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,447
MR. PARIS, YOU
AND MR. NEELIX WILL COLLECT

250
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,449
AS MANY VEGETABLES
AND FRUITS AS YOU CAN

251
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,786
WHILE WE WAIT FOR THIS
ATMOSPHERIC WINDOW TO OPEN.

252
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,455
MR. KIM, BE SURE YOUR COMPUTER
SIMULATIONS INCLUDE...

253
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,845
WHAT HAPPENED?
I HEARD THAT...

254
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,888
NOTHING HAPPENED.

255
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,640
THEY SAID THAT YOU
AND TOM PARIS...

256
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,728
KES, WE'LL TALK
WHEN I GET BACK.

257
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,062
I WANT TO KNOW.

258
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,106
NEELIX, IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU WERE FIGHTING?

259
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,401
WHEN I GET BACK.

260
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,777
SHUTTLEBAY.

261
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,283
GOOD AFTERNOON.

262
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,911
WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE,
COULD YOU RUN AN ANALYSIS

263
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,996
OF THE CYTOKINETIC
RESULTS FOR...

264
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,665
I DID IT DURING LUNCH.

265
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,046
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

266
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,423
I'M FINE.

267
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,007
ARE YOU SURE?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE...

268
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,009
I'M FINE.

269
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,136
YOU KNOW, IF YOU SKIPPED
LUNCH, THE RESULT

270
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,972
MIGHT BE A LOWER
BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL
WHICH COULD...

271
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,892
I'M SORRY. IT'S
IN MY PROGRAM.

272
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,811
I SEE SOMETHING WRONG, I
MUST ATTEMPT TO DIAGNOSE IT.

273
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,606
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
YOU CAN'T CURE.

274
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,694
NEELIX AND TOM PARIS HAD

275
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:49,156
A PHYSICAL... FIGHT.

276
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,825
OVER ME.

277
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,118
HOW DELIGHTFUL.

278
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,121
DELIGHTFUL?

279
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,957
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT
A HIGH COMPLIMENT.

280
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,210
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, MEN HAVE
FOUGHT OVER THE LOVE OF A WOMAN.

281
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,087
WHY, I CAN QUOTE YOU
AUTOPSY REPORTS

282
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,298
FROM DUELS AS FAR BACK AS 1538.

283
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,549
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

284
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,342
IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE.

285
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,762
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED
IN AUTOPSIES.

286
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,972
ARE ALL TALAXIANS SO JEALOUS?

287
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,600
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I'VE ONLY MET ONE.

288
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,893
I LOVE NEELIX.

289
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,312
WHY CAN'T HE
JUST ACCEPT THAT?

290
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,815
HIS SUSPICIONS ABOUT TOM
ARE COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIED.

291
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,399
ARE THEY?

292
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,402
LIEUTENANT PARIS' AFFECTION
FOR YOU IS OBVIOUS.

293
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,695
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

294
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,157
I MEAN HE... DESIRES YOU.

295
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,450
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

296
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,952
TOM AND I ENJOY
EACH OTHER'S COMPANY.

297
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,328
WE'RE FRIENDS.

298
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,164
WHENEVER YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM,

299
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,041
HIS RESPIRATION INCREASES,
HIS PUPILS DILATE

300
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,962
AND THE COLORATION OF HIS EARS
TURNS DECIDEDLY ORANGE.

301
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,379
UNTIL I NOTICED THE PATTERN,

302
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,006
I THOUGHT HE WAS SUFFERING
FROM TANZIAN FLU.

303
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,467
IT'S THERE FOR ANYONE
TO SEE, MAYBE NOT

304
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,761
IN THE SAME DIAGNOSTIC DETAIL
AS I SEE IT, YET...

305
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,931
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT?

306
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,772
YOU'RE ONLY TWO YEARS OLD.

307
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,441
THERE MAY BE A FEW THINGS...

308
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,068
YOU DON'T KNOW
TO LOOK FOR IN A MAN.

309
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,613
IN TIME,
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

310
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,907
ON MY HOME WORLD,
IT'S SO MUCH SIMPLER.

311
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,408
YOU CHOOSE A MATE FOR LIFE.

312
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,410
THERE IS NO DISTRUST,
NO JEALOUSLY,

313
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,245
NO ENVY, NO BETRAYAL.

314
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:24,002
HMM, YOUR WORLD MUST HAVE
VERY DRY LITERATURE.

315
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,297
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

316
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,676
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

317
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,969
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING

318
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,096
TO PRECIPITATE
THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS.

319
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,642
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO
MUCH TO RESOLVE IT, EITHER.

320
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,437
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
<i>YOU</i> CAN'T CURE.

321
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,787
ENTRY SEQUENCE
AT TWO MINUTES. MARK.

322
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,831
ALL SYSTEMS NORMAL.

323
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,293
TRIGEMIC DENSITY
AT .041 AND RISING.

324
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,715
WE LOST COMMUNICATION
WITH<i> VOYAGER</i> 3O SECONDS AGO.

325
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,928
YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMPRESS
ME WITH YOUR TECHNOBABBLE.

326
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,513
I'M NOT TRYING
TO IMPRESS ANYONE.

327
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,308
I'M ENTERING IT
INTO THE FLIGHT RECORD.

328
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,436
LOOK, CAN I MAKE
A SUGGESTION?

329
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,063
YOU'RE THE COMMANDER
OF THIS MISSION.

330
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,814
YOU CAN MAKE ANY
SUGGESTION YOU WANT.

331
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,317
AND IF YOU MAKE IT AN ORDER,
I'LL EVEN HAVE TO OBEY IT.

332
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,571
MY SUGGESTION IS THAT WE PUT
OUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS ASIDE

333
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,074
UNTIL THIS MISSION
IS OVER, OKAY?

334
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,158
I LEFT MY PERSONAL PROBLEMS
BACK ON THE SHIP.

335
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,702
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR YOU.
FINE!

336
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,954
LET'S GET THE JOB DONE.

337
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,288
YOU GET US DOWN IN ONE PIECE

338
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,041
AND I'LL TAKE
IT FROM THERE.

339
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,757
ENTRY SEQUENCE
AT THREE MINUTES. MARK.

340
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:57,511
ALL SYSTEMS... STAND BY.

341
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,639
HAVE YOU BEEN BRIEFED
ON SHUTTLE OPERATIONS?

342
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,391
ENSIGN BAYTART TOOK ME
THROUGH THE BASICS.

343
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,810
OF COURSE, I..
I DIDN'T HAVE

344
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,270
THE BENEFIT OF YOUR
PERSONAL TUTELAGE.

345
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,563
CHECK YOUR CONSOLE.

346
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,482
I'M READING
A POWER-OUTPUT DECLINE

347
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,192
OF... 15 PERCENT.

348
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,861
CONFIRMED.

349
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,488
Computer:
Warning.

350
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,450
Vectored exhaust controls
malfunctioning.

351
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,827
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

352
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,453
WE'RE GETTING
SOME KIND OF REACTION

353
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,122
IN OUR DRIVER COIL ASSEMBLY
FROM THE E.M. ANOMALIES

354
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,456
IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

355
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,961
I'M GOING TO ABORT
THE MISSION. HOLD ON.

356
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,718
WE'VE LOST OUR IMPULSE DRIVE!

357
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,345
SHUT OFF
THE DEUTERIUM FLOW.

358
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,221
I'M DUMPING EXCESS FUEL.

359
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,016
DEUTERIUM FLOW SEALED.

360
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,476
SETTING D.C.A. PULSE ORDER
TO NEUTRAL.

361
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,227
ENGAGING THRUSTERS.

362
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,647
CAN YOU REGAIN CONTROL?

363
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,982
I'M TRYING, NEELIX.

364
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,151
PREPARE FOR
AN EMERGENCY LANDING.

365
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,777
SEND OUT AN E.M.S. PULSE.

366
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,072
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE
<i>VOYAGER</i> WILL PICK IT UP.

367
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,159
(<i> grunting</i> )

368
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,119
CAPTAIN, WE'RE PICKING UP A
LOCATOR SIGNAL FROM THE SHUTTLE.

369
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,704
CAN YOU TRACK IT?

370
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,582
THEIR LAST VELOCITY VECTOR
INDICATES A STEEP DESCENT.

371
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,876
WE'VE LOST CONTACT.

372
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,045
BRIDGE TO TORRES.
Torres: Torres here.

373
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,963
B'ELANNA,
OUR SHUTTLE'S IN TROUBLE.

374
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,506
ANY PROGRESS ON MODIFYING
THE TRANSPORTER?

375
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,384
NEGATIVE.

376
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,678
IT'S AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX
INTERFERENCE PATTERN

377
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,888
AND IT KEEPS CHANGING.

378
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,639
BRING IN AS MUCH
HELP AS YOU NEED.

379
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,516
THIS IS NOW A SEARCH AND
RESCUE OPERATION.

380
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,934
Acknowledged.
Torres out.

381
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,144
KEEP ME INFORMED.

382
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,688
I'LL BE IN
MY READY ROOM.

383
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,365
I SAID...

384
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,034
IN ONE PIECE.

385
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,827
SORRY.

386
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,080
I DID THE BEST I COULD.

387
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,248
ANY BROKEN BONES?

388
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,043
EVERYTHING SEEMS
TO BE WORKING.

389
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,377
(<i> groaning</i> )

390
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,628
I'M ITCHING.

391
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,091
YEAH, I FEEL IT TOO.

392
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,301
WE'VE GOT ATMOSPHERIC
LEAKAGE IN THE HULL.

393
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,055
THE TRIGEMIC VAPORS
REALLY STING.

394
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,973
HERE.

395
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,767
DOC SAID
THIS WOULD HELP A LITTLE.

396
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,438
IF WE HAVE ATMOSPHERIC LEAKAGE,
HOW CAN WE FLY OUT OF HERE?

397
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,815
WE CAN'T. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT
FOR<i> VOYAGER</i> TO FIND US.

398
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,525
WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR US YET.

399
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,736
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE E.M.S.
PULSE GOT THROUGH.

400
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,404
B'ELANNA'S WORKING ON
THE TRANSPORTER,

401
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,241
AND ONE OF THOSE ATMOSPHERIC
WINDOWS MIGHT OPEN UP.

402
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,825
IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE GOING

403
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,326
TO HAVE TO LOOK FOR
SOME KIND OF COVER.

404
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,412
I SAY WE STAY RIGHT HERE.

405
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,164
THE TRIGEMIC VAPORS
ARE GOING TO--

406
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,583
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTS TO
GO OUT INTO THOSE VAPORS!

407
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,168
STAYING HERE IS OUR BEST CHANCE
OF BEING FOUND.

408
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,920
YOU HEARD WHAT THEY SAID.

409
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,256
THOSE WINDOWS ARE MAY ONLY BE
OPEN FOR A MATTER OF MINUTES.

410
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,757
AND WE MAY BE
WAITING HERE FOR DAYS.

411
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,759
EXPOSURE TO THESE VAPORS
IS TOO DANGEROUS.

412
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,302
WE'RE LEAVING.
GRAB YOUR GEAR.

413
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,471
IS THAT AN ORDER
OR A SUGGESTION?

414
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,098
AN<i> ORDER!</i>

415
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,766
YES, SIR.

416
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,229
I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED.

417
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,522
WE WERE A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE
INSIDE THE SHUTTLE.

418
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,650
I HAVE RED WELTS
ALL OVER MY HANDS.

419
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,152
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE
MORE CONSTRUCTIVE

420
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,279
IF YOU COULD FIND US
SOMETHING SAFE TO EAT.

421
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,905
Neelix:
I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW

422
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,532
WHY THE SHIP'S SENSORS
INDICATED THIS PLANET

423
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,534
MIGHT BE RICH
IN FOOD SUPPLIES.

424
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,203
IT SURE DOESN'T LOOK IT.

425
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,206
OUR EMERGENCY RATIONS
WON'T LAST FOREVER.

426
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,834
I'LL FIND SOMETHING FOR US.

427
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,127
OF COURSE,
IT MIGHT NOT MEET

428
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,420
YOUR PERSONAL
CULINARY STANDARDS.

429
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,630
OH, DON'T WORRY.

430
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,215
I'VE LEARNED TO
LOWER MY STANDARDS

431
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,884
SINCE YOU BECAME COOK.

432
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,136
I'M PICKING UP
SOME CAVES

433
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,763
ABOUT A KILOMETER
WEST OF HERE.

434
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,347
WHAT GOOD FORTUNE.

435
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,810
(<i> door chimes</i> )

436
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,062
COME IN.

437
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,563
HARRY.

438
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,898
ANY WORD YET?

439
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,320
WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.

440
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,239
THE TRANSPORTER JUST
DOESN'T WANT TO WORK
IN THAT ATMOSPHERE.

441
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,532
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

442
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,701
OH, I'M ALL RIGHT.

443
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,040
IT'S JUST, UH...

444
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,544
I WAS VERY ANGRY AT THEM
A FEW HOURS AGO.

445
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,587
YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT TO BE.

446
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,673
AND NOW THEY
MIGHT BOTH BE DEAD.

447
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:07,970
AND I'M SITTING HERE...

448
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,640
AND I'M FEELING GUILTY
FOR SOME REASON.

449
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,892
GUILTY? WHY?

450
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,227
I DON'T KNOW.

451
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,608
I DON'T LIKE IT.

452
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,236
AND IT'S THEIR FAULT

453
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,612
AND I CAN'T EVEN TELL THEM
HOW ANGRY I AM AT THEM

454
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,699
AND I MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL
THEM HOW ANGRY I AM AT THEM!

455
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,492
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER, DOES IT?

456
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,036
LOOK, YOU KNOW
IF THERE WAS ANY WAY

457
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,621
TO LAND THAT SHUTTLE,
TOM PARIS GOT IT DOWN.

458
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,377
AND NO ONE HAS STRONGER
SURVIVAL SKILLS THAN NEELIX.

459
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,419
I'M SURE THEY'LL
BOTH BE FINE.

460
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,755
UNLESS THEY KILL EACH OTHER.

461
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,883
(<i> laughs</i> )

462
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,385
THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS.

463
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,929
THEY BETTER BE ALL RIGHT,
BECAUSE WHEN I SEE THEM,

464
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,764
I'M PERSONALLY
GOING TO TELL THEM

465
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,683
THAT I NEVER INTEND TO SPEAK
TO EITHER ONE OF THEM AGAIN.

466
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,855
Chakotay to crew,
battle stations.

467
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,409
THIS IS GOOD.

468
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,826
WE CAN LAST A WHILE IN HERE.

469
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,133
THAT SHOULD
DO IT.

470
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,636
GARNESITE.

471
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,971
YEAH.

472
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,973
THIS WILL GIVE US
A LITTLE HEAT AT LEAST.

473
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,984
WE BETTER CONSERVE
OUR BEACON CELLS.

474
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,842
SO...

475
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,470
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

476
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,557
WHAT IS STAR FLEET PROTOCOL
FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THIS?

477
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,934
OH, THERE'S
A WHOLE COURSE

478
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,644
AT THE ACADEMY
FULL OF ALL SORTS

479
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,355
OF SURVIVAL STRATEGIES.

480
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,648
I HOPE YOU HAD A PASSING GRADE.

481
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,566
B-MINUS.

482
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,777
THAT'S NOT VERY ENCOURAGING.

483
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,113
MY FATHER WAS TEACHING
THE CLASS THAT YEAR.

484
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,659
AND HE GAVE YOU A B-MINUS?

485
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,453
I GUESS HE DIDN'T
PLAY FAVORITES, HUH?

486
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,912
(<i> laughs</i> )

487
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,542
WHAT ABOUT TALAXIAN PROTOCOLS?

488
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,006
I WROTE MY OWN BOOK.

489
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,383
MY LIFE BEFORE<i> VOYAGER</i>

490
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,510
WAS NO BED
OF FELARAN ROSE PETALS.

491
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,886
(<i> laughs</i> )

492
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,222
NO, MORE LIKE A BED OF...

493
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,597
WHAT?

494
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,558
NOTHING.

495
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,978
YOU WERE GOING
TO SAY "JUNK" PERHAPS?

496
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,481
GO AHEAD. SAY IT--
JUNK.

497
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,607
I WAS A DEALER IN JUNK.

498
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,527
PERHAPS NOT WORTHY
OF A WOMAN LIKE KES,

499
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,903
IN YOUR OPINION.

500
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,530
NEELIX, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I NEVER EVEN--

501
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,281
(<i> creaking</i> )

502
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,912
TELL ME SOMETHING.

503
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,956
IN THAT STAR FLEET
SURVIVAL COURSE,

504
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,210
DID YOUR FATHER TEACH YOU
TO CHECK FOR LIFE SIGNS

505
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,504
<i>BEFORE</i> YOU SEAL YOURSELF
INSIDE A CAVE?

506
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:33,342
I CHECKED FOR LIFE SIGNS.
THERE WEREN'T ANY.

507
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,676
THERE ARE NOW.

508
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,846
HAIL THEM.

509
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,681
THEY DO NOT RESPOND,
CAPTAIN.

510
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,151
THEY'RE POWERING DOWN
THEIR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.

511
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,279
THE VESSEL HAS TAKEN UP
A POSITION DIRECTLY BENEATH US.

512
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,155
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT,
LIEUTENANT?

513
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,450
THEY WOULD SEEM TO HAVE ADOPTED
A DEFENSIVE POSTURE, CAPTAIN.

514
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,869
I AGREE, BUT DEFENDING WHAT?
THE PLANET?

515
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,204
OR SOMETHING ON IT.

516
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,213
WHATEVER THIS LIFE-FORM IS...

517
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,466
ITS VITAL SIGNS
ARE AWFULLY FAINT.

518
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,718
IN THIS ATMOSPHERE,

519
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,096
IT COULD BE
DYING OF EXPOSURE.

520
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,265
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

521
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:25,478
THEY'RE FAINT...
BUT STEADY.

522
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,122
I'D SAY IT'S BECOMING
MORE AND MORE EVIDENT

523
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,915
THAT WE CHOSE
THE WRONG CAVE.

524
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,816
THIS IS WHERE THE LIFE
SIGNS ARE COMING FROM.

525
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,487
THEY'RE EMBRYONIC
LIFE-FORMS.

526
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:22,868
THESE TWO ARE HALF FORMED,
BUT THIS ONE

527
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,286
ALMOST SEEMS TO BE...

528
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,857
THE E.M. DISTURBANCE PATTERNS
MATCH THE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS.

529
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,734
I'D SAY WE'LL GET A SHOT
AT AN ATMOSPHERIC WINDOW

530
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,361
IN ABOUT 53 MINUTES.

531
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,488
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US
WITH THE TRANSPORTER?

532
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,947
OUR RANGE WILL STILL BE LIMITED,

533
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,241
BUT THE TRANSPORTER
SHOULD WORK

534
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,617
AS LONG AS WE STAY
IN AN AREA

535
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,494
WITH REDUCED
ELECTROMAGNETIC ACTIVITY.

536
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,705
THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE OUR SHUTTLE WENT DOWN.

537
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,164
SO THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW
HOW CLOSE THEY'LL BE

538
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,583
TO THE WINDOW WHEN
IT OPENS.

539
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,084
RECOMMENDATIONS?

540
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,336
TAKE THE SHIP THROUGH THE WINDOW
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

541
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,004
THE CLOSER YOU CAN GET US
TO THE SURFACE,

542
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,382
THE BETTER OUR CHANCES
FOR A SUCCESSFUL BEAM-OUT.

543
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,592
GET ON IT.

544
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,134
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE
TO WARN US

545
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,428
BEFORE THE WINDOW
CLOSES AGAIN?

546
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,803
I THINK SO.
MR. KIM,

547
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,305
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER
I CAN LIVE WITH.

548
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,140
I'LL TRY TO GET YOU
A BETTER ONE, CAPTAIN.

549
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,394
MR. TUVOK, WE NEED YOU TO FIND
A WAY TO GET US BY THAT SHIP.

550
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,479
I HAVE ANTICIPATED
YOUR REQUEST, CAPTAIN.

551
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,314
AM I CORRECT IN THE ASSUMPTION
THAT YOU WILL WANT TO USE

552
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,775
MINIMAL FORCE?
ASSUMPTION CONFIRMED.

553
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,485
I CANNOT
GUARANTEE SUCCESS.

554
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,195
MY EVALUATION
OF THEIR WEAPONS SYSTEMS

555
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,031
SUGGESTS A CAPACITY
EQUAL TO OUR OWN. HOWEVER...

556
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,452
YOU'VE COME UP WITH AN INGENIOUS
PLAN TO NEUTRALIZE THEM.

557
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,827
I HAVE.

558
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,705
IN MY ANALYSIS
OF OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER,

559
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,373
I HAVE DETECTED
WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE

560
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,917
A VULNERABILITY
IN THEIR SHIELD CONFIGURATION.

561
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,002
THERE APPEARS TO BE A SLIGHT
PHASE RETRACTION

562
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,463
WHEN AUXILIARY POWER
IS TRANSFERRED

563
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,214
TO THEIR AFT
WEAPONS SYSTEMS.

564
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,717
A CO-VARIANT PHASER PULSE
INTO THEIR AFT CONTROL SYSTEMS

565
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,762
MIGHT DISABLE THEIR ENTIRE
WEAPONS ARRAY.

566
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:07,765
THAT WAS
MY "INGENIOUS" PLAN, COMMANDER.

567
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,057
YOU ARE CORRECT.

568
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,768
VERY WELL. RED ALERT.

569
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,144
MR. KIM, SET COORDINATES.

570
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,646
TORRES, SPEED AT 2,000 K.P.H.

571
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,938
AYE, CAPTAIN.

572
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,189
CHAKOTAY, TAKE THE HELM.

573
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,899
Kim:
COORDINATES ENTERED.

574
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,068
ENGAGE.

575
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,363
THIS CREATURE'S GOING
TO HAVE THE ABILITY

576
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,864
TO STAND UPRIGHT.

577
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,493
IT HAS THE SKELETAL SYSTEM
OF A HUMANOID.

578
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,954
IT'S COLD-BLOODED,
HAS REPTILIAN EPIDERMIS.

579
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,539
ITS BRAIN
IS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER

580
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,916
THAN MOST
REPTILIAN SPECIES.

581
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,126
I'D SAY WE'RE DEALING WITH

582
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,919
A SENTIENT LIFE-FORM
HERE, NEELIX.

583
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,464
IF THIS SPECIES IS SENTIENT

584
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,757
WOULDN'T THAT SUGGEST THAT

585
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,884
ITS PARENTS MIGHT RETURN
TO CARE FOR IT?

586
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,303
IT'S HARD
TO SAY.

587
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,430
MOST COMMON REPTILES
LAY THEIR EGGS

588
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,349
AND NEVER RETURN
TO PROTECT THEM.

589
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,767
I THINK WE'VE ESTABLISHED

590
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,226
WE'RE NOT DEALING
WITH A COMMON REPTILE.

591
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,478
TRUE.

592
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,396
AND IF THIS THING DOES HAVE A
MOTHER,

593
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,106
I'D SAY WE DON'T WANT
TO BE AROUND WHEN SHE GETS BACK.

594
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,316
COME ON.

595
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,859
WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE IT HERE.

596
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,277
<i>WE'RE</i> NOT
LEAVING IT HERE.

597
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,487
ITS MOTHER LEFT IT HERE.

598
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,489
WE JUST HAPPENED TO WANDER IN.

599
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,990
BUT WE BLOCKED OFF
THE CAVE.

600
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,660
THE MOTHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN
TRAPPED OUTSIDE.

601
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,538
WE'LL LEAVE THE DOOR
OPEN FOR HER WHEN WE GO, OKAY?

602
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,414
LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

603
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,668
WHAT IF SHE CAN SENSE
WE WERE HERE?

604
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:22,005
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SMELL THAT
FAUX LIME AFTERSHAVE OF YOURS.

605
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,257
I'M SURE YOU REALIZE

606
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,676
MANY SPECIES WON'T RETURN
TO A NEST

607
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,887
AFTER IT'S BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

608
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,640
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO
ABOUT THAT NOW, IS THERE?

609
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,892
WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE ALL THIS
THE WAY WE FOUND IT.

610
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,811
NO.
NEELIX!

611
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,188
THIS CREATURE
IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

612
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,481
OURS?
THE MOMENT WE CAME IN HERE

613
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,233
IT BECAME
OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

614
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,694
AND YOU EXPECT TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS THING UNTIL WHAT?

615
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:46,071
IT GRADUATES FROM HIGH SCHOOL,
COLLEGE?

616
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,865
AND WHAT IF MOM
DOESN'T COME BACK?

617
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,242
ARE YOU PLANNING TO BRING THIS
WITH US BACK ON THE SHIP?

618
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,203
LOOK, IF SHE DOES RETURN
AND ACCEPTS THE HATCHLING,

619
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,080
IT'LL SOLVE EVERYTHING.

620
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,165
WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT
AND SEE WHAT SHE DOES.

621
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,917
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS
IN YOUR QUADRANT,

622
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:03,630
BUT IN MINE WE DON'T ABANDON
A NEWBORN... THING.

623
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,762
(<i> sighs</i> )
FINE.

624
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:13,473
FINE, YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT.

625
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,518
I OFFICIALLY DESIGNATE YOU
ITS GODFATHER.

626
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,439
IT STOPPED CRYING.

627
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,232
IT'S SHIVERING.

628
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,693
THAT'S NORMAL... ISN'T IT?

629
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,779
I MEAN, NEWBORN LIFE-FORMS

630
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,530
DO SHIVER,
DON'T THEY?

631
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,742
TO BE HONEST, I HAVEN'T BEEN
AROUND MANY NEWBORNS.

632
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,787
ME NEITHER.

633
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:48,717
Neelix:
AWW... LOOK AT THIS, PARIS.

634
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,302
IT STOPPED SHIVERING.

635
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,646
IT'S ASLEEP.

636
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,401
FORGET WHAT I SAID,
NEELIX.

637
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,736
YOU'RE NOT
ITS GODFATHER.

638
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,404
YOU'RE ITS GODMOTHER.

639
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,914
THE ATMOSPHERIC WINDOW
IS FORMING, CAPTAIN.

640
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,499
30 DEGREES OFF
THE PREDICTED COORDINATES.

641
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,542
HOW SOON WILL WE HAVE
MAXIMUM APERTURE, MR. KIM?

642
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,419
NINE MINUTES.
ALL RIGHT, COMMANDER.

643
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,338
LET'S TRY TO DRAW SOME FIRE
FROM THEIR AFT WEAPON SYSTEMS.

644
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,840
BRING US WITHIN TEN KILOMETERS.

645
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,347
SHIELDS AT 80 PERCENT.

646
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,516
MINOR DAMAGE
TO OUR PORT NACELLE.

647
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,434
RE-ROUTING POWER
TO LATERAL THRUSTERS.

648
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,019
TUVOK?

649
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,688
SO FAR, I'M NOT DETECTING
THE SAME VULNERABILITY

650
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,230
IN THEIR SHIELDS THIS TIME,
CAPTAIN.

651
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,066
WE MAY HAVE TO RESORT
TO ADDITIONAL FORCE.

652
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,902
ARM PHOTONS.
Kim: READY.

653
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,821
PREPARE TO...
STAND BY, CAPTAIN.

654
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,280
I'M DETECTING
AN OPENING.

655
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,373
DIRECT HIT TO THEIR
AFT CONTROL SYSTEMS.

656
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,625
THEIR WEAPONS
ARE DISABLED.

657
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,878
COMMANDER, PROCEED
TO MR. KIM'S COORDINATES.

658
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,337
ONE-HALF IMPULSE.

659
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:13,385
Paris:
OH, COME ON. COME ON.

660
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,847
DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE
FOR STARFLEET RATIONS.

661
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,390
IF I WERE IN MY KITCHEN,

662
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,644
I COULD COOK YOU UP SOME
DELIGHTFUL LEOLA ROOT BROTH.

663
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,979
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

664
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,899
UGH, I HOPE I NEVER
SEE ANOTHER LEOLA ROOT

665
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,316
AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY
NOT FEEDING

666
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,528
ANY OF THAT HIDEOUS
BROTH TO MY NIECE...

667
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,739
OR NEPHEW...

668
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,032
WHATEVER IT IS.

669
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:41,705
ITS HEARTBEAT
IS GETTING WEAKER.

670
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,707
I DON'T LIKE IT.

671
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:44,958
COME ON, KID.

672
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,419
YOU'VE GOT TO EAT SOMETHING.

673
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,048
IT SEEMS FAR MORE INTERESTED
IN MY JACKET THAN YOUR FOOD.

674
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,386
Paris:
NEELIX

675
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,555
IT'S NOT YOUR JACKET.

676
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,432
IT'S THE RESIDUE
OF THE TRIGEMIC VAPORS

677
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,850
WE WALKED THROUGH.

678
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,143
THINK ABOUT IT. <i> VOYAGER'S</i>
SENSORS

679
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,897
PICKED UP HIGH LEVELS
OF PROTEINS AND AMINO ACIDS

680
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,481
WHICH WE ASSUMED MEANT
THIS WAS A PLANET

681
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,943
FILLED WITH VAST SUPPLIES
OF EDIBLE PLANT LIFE.

682
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,861
WE WERE CERTAINLY WRONG
ABOUT THAT.

683
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,906
THE RESIDUE IS A CONCENTRATION
OF PROTEINS AND AMINO ACIDS.

684
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,574
A PERFECT SOURCE
OF NUTRITION

685
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,076
FOR THE HATCHLING.

686
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:22,412
THE SOURCE WE CUT OFF
WHEN WE BLOCKED THE CAVE.

687
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,164
COME ON, WE'VE GOT
SOME ROCKS TO MOVE.

688
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,628
THE ATMOSPHERIC WINDOW IS AT
FULL APERTURE, CAPTAIN.

689
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,921
WE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST
17 MINUTES

690
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,255
BEFORE IT STARTS TO CLOSE.

691
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,215
CAPTAIN, THE ALIEN VESSEL
IS IN PURSUIT.

692
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,968
ARE THEIR WEAPONS SYSTEMS
BACK ON LINE ALREADY?

693
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,594
NEGATIVE.
THEY ARE STILL DISABLED.

694
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,763
THEY COULDN'T BE PREPARING
TO RAM US, COULD THEY?

695
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,556
HOLD YOUR COURSE. WE NEED TO GET
THROUGH THAT WINDOW,

696
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,475
BUT PREPARE TO TAKE
EVASIVE ACTION IF NECESSARY.

697
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,893
UNDERSTOOD.

698
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,771
ALIEN VESSEL CLOSING
TO 1,000 KILOMETERS.

699
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,314
500.

700
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,399
300.

701
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,027
IT HAS PASSED US AND IS
PROCEEDING TOWARD THE SURFACE.

702
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,695
TAKE US DOWN, COMMANDER.

703
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,042
IT'S NOT BREATHING!

704
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,710
I DON'T THINK IT'S BREATHING!

705
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,921
COME ON, SUCK IN

706
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,049
SOME OF THOSE
HEARTY VAPORS.

707
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,592
IT'S JUST TOO WEAK.

708
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,556
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HERE
WE CAN USE TO RESUSCITATE IT.

709
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,809
NEELIX, WE DID
THE BEST WE COULD.

710
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,894
NO!
IT'S OUR FAULT, OUR FAULT.

711
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,730
IF WE HADN'T COME...

712
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,858
HERE. CORDRAZINE.

713
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,400
THIS IS A STIMULANT.

714
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,777
YOU CAN'T PUMP IT FULL OF DRUGS

715
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,737
WITHOUT KNOWING
ITS BODY CHEMISTRY.

716
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,906
SO WE SHOULD JUST LET IT DIE?

717
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,163
GIVE ME THAT.

718
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,544
WHEN I WAS A KID,
A BABY BIRD FELL OUT OF A NEST

719
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,296
AND LANDED ON THE WINDOW SILL
NEXT TO MY BED.

720
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,923
WE HAD TO FEED IT WATER
WITH AN EYEDROPPER

721
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,051
TO KEEP IT ALIVE.

722
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,969
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

723
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,429
FILLING THE EYEDROPPER.

724
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,264
CAN YOU HOLD ITS MOUTH OPEN?

725
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,690
DO IT AGAIN. AGAIN.

726
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,278
IT'S WORKING.

727
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,655
IT'S WORKING!

728
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,992
LIFE SIGNS ARE
GETTING STRONGER.

729
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,451
YOU DID IT!

730
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,328
<i>WE</i> DID IT.

731
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,999
YOU KNOW, I NEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT HYPOSPRAY IF...

732
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,834
THE VAPORS...

733
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,169
WHO CARES?

734
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,894
SENSORS ARE OPERATING
AS WELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED

735
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,604
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

736
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,522
EITHER WE'RE JUST NOT CLOSE
ENOUGH TO WHERE THEY LANDED

737
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,193
TO PICK UP THEIR COM SIGNALS,
OR THEY NEVER LANDED.

738
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,986
THEIR SHUTTLE MIGHT HAVE
BURNED UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

739
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,738
I'M NOT WILLING
TO CONCEDE THAT YET.

740
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:02,948
ANY SIGN OF THE ALIEN SHIP?

741
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,365
NO. CAPTAIN. WE'VE
LOST THEM.

742
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,784
MR. KIM, HOW MUCH LONGER
BEFORE THAT WINDOW

743
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,493
STARTS TO CLOSE?
NINE MINUTES, 20 SECONDS.

744
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,995
CHAKOTAY, EXTEND OUR
SURVEILLANCE PATTERN.

745
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,247
IF WE DON'T FIND THEM
IN FIVE MINUTES

746
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,706
WE'LL HEAD BACK
TO THE WINDOW.

747
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,458
AYE, CAPTAIN.

748
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,975
I'M SORRY.

749
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,309
HMM?

750
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,523
I FEEL I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

751
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,780
NO, YOU DON'T.

752
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,784
I HAD NO RIGHT TO PUSH
THAT PASTA IN YOUR LAP.

753
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,996
WELL... THINK
OF IT THIS WAY:

754
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,081
IT SAVED ME FROM
HAVING TO EAT IT.

755
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,415
NOTHING PERSONAL,

756
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,667
BUT I JUST DON'T
HAVE AN AFFINITY

757
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,128
FOR HAIR IN MY FOOD.

758
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,712
I HAVEN'T BEEN FAIR TO YOU.

759
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,803
YOU KNOW, I HEAR PEOPLE TALKING
ABOUT YOU IN THE MESS HALL.

760
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,807
NO KIDDING.

761
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,100
WHAT DO THEY SAY?

762
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,394
OH, THAT YOU USED
TO BE A COWARD

763
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,107
AND COULDN'T BE TRUSTED.

764
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,984
IT'S TYPICAL OF KES
THAT SHE WOULD BEFRIEND

765
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,862
SOMEONE LIKE YOU--

766
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,906
SOMEONE WHO REALLY
NEEDS A FRIEND.

767
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,952
AND I GUESS I... JUST
GOT A LITTLE JEALOUS.

768
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,787
I GOT MORE THAN
A LITTLE JEALOUS.

769
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,083
I REALIZE NOW I WAS WRONG.

770
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,680
NEELIX, I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH

771
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,393
WHEN I SAID THAT NOTHING
HAPPENED BETWEEN ME AND KES.

772
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,811
I KNOW.

773
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,315
AND I PROMISE YOU,
NOTHING EVER WILL

774
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,649
BUT...

775
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,529
YOU WEREN'T WRONG ABOUT ME.

776
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,864
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

777
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,742
I...

778
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,415
WELL, I GUESS THE ONLY WAY
TO SAY IT IS TO SAY IT.

779
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,044
I<i> AM</i> ATTRACTED TO KES.

780
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,337
OH?

781
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,588
TO BE HONEST, IF YOU
WEREN'T AROUND,

782
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,132
I'D BE KNOCKING
AT HER DOOR.

783
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,677
BUT I RESPECT
YOU, NEELIX.

784
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,054
AND THAT'S THAT.

785
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,851
EVERYTHING YOU HEARD
THOSE GUYS SAYING ABOUT ME

786
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,896
WELL, IT WAS TRUE.

787
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,274
BUT IT'S NOT
WHO I AM ANYMORE.

788
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:45,235
AT LEAST NOT
WHO I WANT TO BE.

789
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,695
THIS UPSIDE-DOWN MISSION

790
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,198
TO THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE GALAXY

791
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,784
HAS GIVEN ME
A SECOND CHANCE,

792
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,660
AND I DON'T INTEND
TO BLOW IT.

793
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,332
I SEE.

794
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,043
WELL, IN A WAY,
I CAN'T SAY I BLAME YOU.

795
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,546
SHE<i> IS</i> VERY ATTRACTIVE.

796
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,091
(<i> chuckles</i> )

797
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,594
SHE'S DEVOTED TO YOU,

798
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,179
YOU KNOW?

799
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:17,434
WELL, I DID SAVE HER LIFE.
I'M SURE SHE'S GRATEFUL.

800
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,561
OH,, SHE'S A LOT MORE
THAN GRATEFUL.

801
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,690
SHE LOVES YOU, NEELIX.
I WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

802
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,026
NOBODY WOULD.

803
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,987
THERE ARE OTHERS?

804
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:33,032
IF YOU EVER DOUBT YOURSELF,
JUST LOOK INTO HER EYES

805
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,827
SEE THE WAY
SHE LOOKS AT YOU.

806
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,622
YOU'LL NEVER
DOUBT YOURSELF AGAIN.

807
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,292
AND AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

808
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:48,131
I'LL JUST BE HER FRIEND--
I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

809
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:51,384
I DON'T PICK
KES' FRIENDS FOR HER.

810
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,096
JUST MY OWN.

811
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,809
(<i> static</i> )

812
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,479
<i>VOYAGER,</i> THIS IS LIEUTENANT
TOM PARIS AND MR. NEELIX.

813
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,063
DO YOU READ?
Janeway: We do, Mr. Paris.

814
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,359
Are you all right?
ASIDE FROM A NASTY RASH, YES.

815
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,609
HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED LIFE-FORMS?

816
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,903
Actually, yes.
ARE THEY HOSTILE?

817
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,447
NO.

818
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,740
JUST... YOUNG.

819
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,992
YOUNG?

820
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,452
Yes, we found a nest,

821
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,704
and one of the creatures
hatched.

822
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,165
BE AWARE WE ENCOUNTERED A
HOSTILE SHIP OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN,

823
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,749
AND WE'RE SHOWING THAT SHIP
ON THE SURFACE

824
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,044
APPROXIMATELY ONE KILOMETER
FROM YOUR POSITION.

825
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,838
We're attempting to lock on
to you for transport. Stand by.

826
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,882
WE CAN'T LEAVE YET.
WHAT? WHY?

827
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,259
WHAT IF THE MOTHER REJECTS IT?

828
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,719
NEELIX, ONE
THING'S FOR SURE--

829
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,054
WHETHER THE MOTHER
REJECTS IT OR NOT,

830
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,014
SHE<i> WILL</i> REJECT
YOU AND ME.

831
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:42,519
WE PROMISED EACH OTHER
WE WOULDN'T ABANDON IT UNTIL...

832
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,145
Janeway:
Away Team, we're showing
a life-form moving

833
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,023
toward your position.
Prepare to transport.

834
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,400
CAPTAIN, THIS IS NEELIX.

835
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,235
ARE YOU IN A PARTICULAR
RUSH TO LEAVE?

836
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,028
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID,
MR. NEELIX?

837
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,446
YES, BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE

838
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,073
finished here yet.

839
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,866
FINISHED WITH WHAT? WE HAVE AN
ATMOSPHERIC WINDOW

840
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,451
CLOSING IN
LESS THAN SIX MINUTES.

841
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,495
AND ANOTHER ONE
WILL BE COMING IN HOW LONG?

842
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,247
DAYS. IS THERE A PROBLEM?

843
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,831
The problem is, Captain,

844
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,333
IF WE LEAVE OUR LITTLE
HATCHLING HERE

845
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,792
AND THE MOTHER
REJECTS IT,

846
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,128
it might die of exposure
before we get back.

847
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,963
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN
FOR ITS WELFARE...

848
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,673
HOW LONG CAN YOU
GIVE US, CAPTAIN?

849
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,052
ONE MINUTE, TEN SECONDS, MAX.

850
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,054
WE'LL TAKE IT!
LOCK ON TO US,<i> VOYAGER.</i>

851
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,098
IF YOU HEAR
MUFFLED SCREAMS,

852
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,641
CONSIDER THAT A REQUEST
FOR A BEAM-OUT.

853
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,697
(<i> roaring</i> )

854
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:53,381
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
A FAMILY REUNION.

855
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,840
(<i> roaring</i> )

856
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,468
<i>VOYAGER,</i> TWO TO BEAM OUT!

857
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,138
AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY.

858
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,604
Neelix:
KES!

859
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:09,814
WE DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU
WERE DEAD OR ALIVE.

860
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,316
WHAT HAPPENED?

861
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,194
I BECAME AN UNCLE.

862
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,529
AND I'M A GODMOTHER!

863
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:23,453
I'D SAY THIS IS THE SPECIAL
OCCASION I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

864
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:26,456
TO OPEN UP THAT BOTTLE
OF POTAK COLD FOWL

865
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:27,624
I'VE BEEN SAVING.

866
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,208
COLD FOWL
IN A BOTTLE?

867
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,543
THAT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION,
ISN'T IT?

868
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,961
NO! IT'S ACTUALLY MADE

869
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,630
FROM THE GLANDULAR
SECRETIONS

870
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:38,134
OF AN ADULT DUNGHILL BIRD
FOUND ONLY ON POTAK THREE.

871
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:41,971
IT'S VERY RARE,
VERY EXQUISITE.

872
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,306
THERE ARE, I BELIEVE,

873
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:46,100
ONLY 27 BOTTLES
IN EXISTENCE AT THIS TIME.

874
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,102
IT HAS A RATHER
SMOKY FLAVOR.

875
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,105
UH... GOING WELL WITH
STRONG, MEATY DISHES,

876
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,984
BUT I PREFER IT FOR SIPPING...
