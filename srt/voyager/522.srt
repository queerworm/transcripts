1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,506
...so Harry throws it
in gear, floors the gas

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,800
and backs us right through
a burrito stand.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,845
So when are you going
to teach me how to drive?

4
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,387
You sure
you're ready?

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,973
I've piloted starships.

6
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,808
I think I can
handle a car.

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,309
Ah, you'd be surprised.

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,104
The clutch on a '69 Mustang
can be pretty tricky.

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,439
Take a look.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,150
She's watching
us again.

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,862
She's working. Relax.

12
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,864
Dessert?

13
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,406
What is it?

14
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,908
Some cheese I prepared

15
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,284
for our Kadi guest.

16
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,703
Tell me what you think.

17
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,960
It's a little bland.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,962
Just a little?
Oh, that's bad.

19
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,006
The Kadi don't approve
of spices...

20
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,048
anything that might
inflame the senses.

21
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,426
You're talking this mission
very seriously.

22
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,387
The Kadi are easily offended.

23
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,389
The Captain's leaving
their representative

24
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,474
entirely in my hands
while she's at the colony.

25
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,852
I'm sure you're up
to it, Ambassador.

26
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,896
I hope so.

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,607
She's watching
us again.

28
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,568
You're imagining things.

29
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,319
I don't think so.

30
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,196
B'Elanna.

31
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,867
Enjoying the view?

32
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,201
Explain.

33
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,495
You've been staring
at us all night.

34
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,956
In fact,
you were following us yesterday

35
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,583
when we were walking
to Engineering,

36
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,083
and the day before,

37
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,294
when I was waiting for Tom
outside the Shuttle Bay.

38
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,796
You are correct.

39
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,258
I have been observing you
as part of my research

40
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,468
on human
mating behavior.

41
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,348
"Stardate 52647,
1400 hours.

42
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,100

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,644

49
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,202
How the hell do you know when
we're having intimate relations?

50
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,038
There is no one on
Deck 9, Section 12

51
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,540
who doesn't know when you're
having intimate relations.

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,833
Is there a problem?

53
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,501
I want all the data
you've collected.

54
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,629
I haven't completed the study.

55
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,339
Then study this.
Borg provokes Klingon.

56
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,258
Klingon breaks Borg nose.

57
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,385
B'Elanna...
Call Sick Bay.

58
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,763
Tell them there's about
to be a medical emergency.

59
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,514
B'Elanna, let's go
have a nightcap.

60
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,600
This time, you've
crossed the line.

61
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,882
I've read B'Elanna's report.

62
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,800
Needless to say,
I was surprised.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,761
I was careful not
to violate protocols.

64
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,137
That's not the point.

65
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,640
This is a starship,
not a nature preserve.

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,517
Oh, I'm missing a pip.

67
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,645
You asked me to broaden
my knowledge of human behavior.

68
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,732
I'm not questioning your goals,
Seven... Oh. It's your methods.

69
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,692
You shouldn't be taking
field notes on the crew.

70
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,195
Help me with this,
will you, please?

71
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,408
Have you ever considered
trying it yourself?

72
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,911
Romance, I mean.

73
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,164
I do not require
a romantic relationship.

74
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,541
So why did you collect
30,000 gigaquads

75
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,460
of data on the subject?

76
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,963
I'm late.

77
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,300
I missed this on my first pass
through their database.

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,427
Kadi monks only wash
with purified water,

79
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,720
so sonic showers
are out.

80
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,472
I've already
equipped his quarters

81
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,598
with an ablutionary fountain

82
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,058
built to their
specifications.

83
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,768
They observe eight
daily services.

84
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,061
Noted.

85
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,896
Show the ambassador
our best side, Neelix.

86
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,773
I don't want him going
back to his superiors

87
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,985
with tales of how
immoral we are.

88
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,820
TUVOK:
Energize.

89
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,789
The ritual greeting.

90
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,668
Travelers who have left
the sanctity

91
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,171
of their home and family,

92
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,006
we welcome you into our home...

93
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,049
our family.

94
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,635
Accept these symbols
of our purity

95
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,221
and the Goddess
Mother's blessing.

96
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,230
Commander Tuvok,
the senior officer

97
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,773
who will accompany me,

98
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,151
and Mr. Neelix, who will
familiarize your ambassador

99
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,654
with<i> Voyager.</i> 
Tomin is an excellent

100
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,281
judge of character.

101
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,616
He'll help us determine
whether your crew is worthy

102
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,576
of receiving our minerals.

103
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,329
He's in very good hands.

104
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,790
It is time
to welcome you to our home.

105
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,766
This way, Ambassador.

106
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,439
<i>Voyager's</i> an Intrepid-class
starship

107
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,275
with a crew of 146,

108
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,736
designed for long-term
exploration.

109
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,364
I thought we'd start with
a tour of our primary systems.

110
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,532
First stop, Engineering.

111
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,618
I was hoping I might sample
a food item I noted earlier

112
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,204
in your data files.

113
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,621
<i>"Hasperat"?</i>

114
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,541
It's a Bajoran dish.
Very spicy.

115
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,961
I believe that your dietary
protocols prohibit

116
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,338
flavorful foods.

117
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,591
I want to broaden
my palate while I'm here

118
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,052
in the interests
of better understanding.

119
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,680
In that case,
first stop, Mess Hall.

120
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,309
Your cortical implants
are operating

121
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,894
at peak efficiency.

122
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,479
Nanoprobe levels
stable. Complaints?

123
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,689
None.

124
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,483
I heard about
the Mess Hall incident.

125
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,278
This crew can be
very efficient

126
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,238
at disseminating
information

127
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,906
when they choose to be.

128
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,492
They say gossip travels
faster than warp speed.

129
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,703
So why were you studying
Tom and B'Elanna?

130
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,206
Scientific curiosity.

131
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,167
Are you sure?
Perhaps there's a reason

132
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,003
that hasn't
occurred to you.

133
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,755
You're a woman, Seven.

134
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,174
Is that an observation
or a diagnosis?

135
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,801
A simple
biological fact...

136
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,054
with repercussions
that are hard to deny.

137
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,181
What is your
proposed treatment?

138
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,558
Perhaps you
should consider

139
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,519
expanding your research
to the realm of dating.

140
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,813
"Dating."

141
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,564
You mean procreation.

142
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,276
One step at a time.
Dating is a human ritual

143
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,861
wherein two people share
a social activity,

144
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,196
get to know each other.

145
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,865
In time, it can lead
to a romantic involvement

146
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,743
and eventually,
if all goes well, even marriage.

147
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,578
One step at a time.

148
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,207
This could be an important stage
in your social development.

149
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,792
It's worth exploring.

150
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,921
The Captain would
seem to agree.

151
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,465
How shall I proceed?

152
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,633
You mean, we.
I'll prepare a lesson plan.

153
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,136
Meet me on Holodeck 2
in one hour.

154
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,388
Most women start dating
a little younger than you,

155
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,807
but better late than never.

156
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,232
I've prepared
an introduction.

157
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,028
I call it
"Love Amid the Stars."

158
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,490
The Milky Way.

159
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,034
Home to thousands
of humanoid species

160
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,786
and countless
courtship rituals.

161
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,579
Klingon males

162
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:03,377
initiate courtship
by biting the female.

163
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,671
Here we see two Bolians
getting to know one another.

164
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,756
The courtship rituals
of some species

165
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,842
remain shrouded in mystery.

166
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,512
For example, Species 8472

167
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,722
appears to have as many

168
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,265
as five sexes.

169
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,684
Bystanders better
keep their distance.

170
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,436
( chuckles )

171
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,397
Of course, the species

172
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,524
you're most likely
to interact with is human,

173
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:29,236
so without further ado,
Lesson One, "First Contact."

174
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,529
There are any
number of ways

175
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,531
humans can meet
prospective mates.

176
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:36,368
Here we see
the "chance encounter."

177
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:40,580
Equally common is
the "formal introduction."

178
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,665
When first contact
is successful,

179
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,418
romance quickly ensues

180
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,586
and, in the happiest
of circumstances,

181
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,088
procreation.

182
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,091
Here we see how
fortress ovum

183
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,386
is besieged by countless
little warriors.

184
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,179
Doctor,
I am familiar

185
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,932
with the physiological processes
of sexuality.

186
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,809
Well...

187
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,937
then let's skip ahead

188
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,980
to the first
of the practical exercises.

189
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,317
Lesson Two.
"Encounter in a Public Place."

190
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,403
Computer,
initiate holo-program

191
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,696
Paris 3.

192
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,198
Our location?

193
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,783
Chez Sandrine.

194
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,536
It's on Earth in a city
called Marseilles.

195
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,289
Ensign Paris whiled
away a good portion

196
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,082
of his Academy
years here.

197
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,419
No doubt to the detriment
of his scholastic performance.

198
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,629
Now, pull up a bar stool

199
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,632
and pretend you've
come here to meet

200
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,051
the man of your dreams.

201
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,556
"Hi, there."

202
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,890
"Hello."

203
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,642
"Come here often?"

204
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,519
"This is my first time."

205
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,271
"You must be new in town.

206
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,565
How do you like
the south of France?"

207
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,275
"It is very quaint,

208
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,527
exactly as I've
always pictured it."

209
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,237
"May I buy you a drink?"

210
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,990
I don't require a liquid
supplement at this time.

211
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,741
You're not giving this
a fair chance.

212
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,743
This exercise
is pointless.

213
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,953
It may seem pointless,

214
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,746
but small talk is
a vital dating skill.

215
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,833
It helps to establish
a rapport with your companion.

216
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,918
Perhaps there's
something to be said

217
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,753
for assimilation
after all.

218
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,715
All right. Why don't you
try your own approach on...

219
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,343
that gentleman over there.

220
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,263
Go ahead.

221
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,265
Very well.

222
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,357
Hello.

223
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,108
Hello.

224
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,485
May I buy
you a drink?

225
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,695
Uh... sure.

226
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,365
Steven Price.

227
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,037
And... and you are?

228
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,332
Seven of Nine,
Tertiary Adjunct of...

229
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,875
You may call me Seven.

230
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,587
Seven... that's-that's
an unusual name.

231
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,089
Uh, please, have a seat.

232
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,310
Looks like Sandrine's
is under new management.

233
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,229
Who deleted
my pool table?

234
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,314
Shh. School is in session.

235
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,899
More social lessons?

236
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,319
Watch. You might
learn something.

237
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,947
Curious jewelry.

238
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,242
It's a Borg implant. I was a
drone.

239
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,035
Oh, so then it's
a family heirloom.

240
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,579
( laughing )

241
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,456
Borg do not have families. They
have unimatrices.

242
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,791
Well, in that case,
why don't you tell me

243
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,378
about your... unimatrix.

244
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,005
They're hitting it off,
don't you think?

245
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,049
He's a hologram.

246
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,509
Your point?

247
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,969
Well, you programmed him
to interact with Seven.

248
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,013
Real people don't
respond the same way.

249
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,266
Under my guidance,
she'll be dating real people

250
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,184
in no time.

251
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,520
You're teaching
Seven how to date?

252
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,812
( laughing )

253
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,275
Talk about the blind
leading the blind.

254
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,860
I've had my share
of romantic encounters.

255
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,613
Hmm.

256
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,323
Are you implying
that Seven couldn't get a date?

257
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,908
What, are you kidding?

258
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,993
Half the men on this ship
would jump at the chance.

259
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,995
But getting a date
is one thing.

260
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,624
Keeping it from turning
into a disaster is another.

261
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,376
I have every confidence
in her social skills.

262
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,796
Well, fine. Let's say you get
her a date.

263
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,257
This is the holodeck.

264
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,092
The cards are stacked
in her favor.

265
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,511
But if you want to really
put her to the test,

266
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,012
you have to do it
in the real world,

267
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,474
where anything
can happen.

268
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,477
Mr. Neelix is hosting
a reception

269
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,811
for the Kadi Ambassador
on Thursday night.

270
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,565
Not only will Seven arrive
with a date,

271
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,652
she will have him eating
out of the palm of her hand.

272
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,237
Put your latinum
where your mouth is.

273
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,615
If Seven brings a date
to the reception

274
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,075
and leaves with the same date
on good terms

275
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,536
without causing
a diplomatic incident,

276
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,539
I will work double shifts
in Sick Bay for the next month.

277
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,124
And if she fails?

278
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,501
I get a month off.

279
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,253
It's a bet.

280
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,008
Where are you going?

281
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,843
Our small talk is terminated.

282
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,014
I have mastered
this exercise.

283
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,474
We can proceed
to the next.

284
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,351
If I were you,

285
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,312
I'd start looking for somebody
to fill in for me.

286
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,327
One Katarian pudding.

287
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,538
Mm-hmm.

288
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,874
Ah.

289
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,045
Mmm!

290
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,549
Ah, the texture
is so frothy.

291
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,218
It seems to be evaporating
in my mouth.

292
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,136
The recipe includes
a catalytic agent

293
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,680
designed to do
just that.

294
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,557
Mmm.

295
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,808
If we don't hurry,

296
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,226
we'll miss Lieutenant Torres.

297
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,144
She's been waiting
half an hour.

298
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,646
You're right.

299
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,898
Engineering.
Your warp core.

300
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,401
I must see that.

301
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,364
In our society,

302
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,948
males and females
work separately.

303
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,327
But I can see the wisdom
of your approach.

304
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,206
Promotes a more stimulating
environment.

305
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,418
( beeping )
It's time for third prayer.

306
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,961
Yes, it is.

307
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,172
But I think I can forego
this service

308
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,092
and perform
the appropriate penance later.

309
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,761
It's more important

310
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:32,265
that I continue exploring
your culture.

311
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,725
Perhaps another dessert.

312
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,145
Good morning.

313
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,440
It's time
for Lesson Three.

314
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,776
"Getting to Know You."
Elaborate.

315
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,027
The key to finding
a compatible partner

316
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,740
is learning how to share
your interests and goals.

317
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,533
We'll start with hobbies.

318
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,660
What do you do
with your spare time?

319
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,955
Regenerate.
Uh-huh.

320
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,917
Tell me about your tastes,
your likes and dislikes.

321
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,628
I dislike irrelevant
conversations.

322
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,631
Okay. Which brings
us to "goals."

323
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,800
What do you want
out of life?

324
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,092
Perfection.

325
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,470
Perfection is a laudable
goal for oneself,

326
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,472
but you can't expect
it from others.

327
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,014
I learned that
lesson myself

328
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,725
when I was
first activated.

329
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,812
One of the ways
I adapted was to pursue

330
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:23,065
interests people
could identify with.

331
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,944
Holo-photography,
for example. Opera.

332
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,613
Music does have intriguing
mathematical properties.

333
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,156
Excellent.

334
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,784
Perhaps we can mold this
curiosity into an interest.

335
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,953
Something you can
share with others.

336
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,080
Let's see how much you know.

337
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,585
Here we see--
A basic musical phrase

338
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,086
in the major mode.

339
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,381
I've done a preliminary study
of the topic.

340
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,676
Sing it for me.

341
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,094
( tone sounds )

342
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:57,517
♪ La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. ♪

343
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,186
Seven, has anyone
ever told you

344
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,314
you have a beautiful voice? It's
a true gift.

345
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,065
The gift is
from the collective.

346
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,234
A vocal subprocessor
designed to facilitate

347
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,403
the sonic interface
with Borg transponders.

348
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,991
Let's try something
a little more challenging.

349
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,994
"You Are My Sunshine."

350
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,162
It's a simple melody
from Earth's 20th century.

351
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,039
A good piece
for beginners.

352
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,624
Sing.

353
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,292
( tone sounds )

354
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:28,840
♪ The other night, dear,
As I lay sleeping ♪

355
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,386
♪ I dreamed I held you
In my arms ♪

356
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,722
That was... flawless,

357
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,683
but try putting a little
more emotion into it.

358
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,851
Like this.

359
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,519
( tone sounds )

I was mistaken ♪

♪ And I hung my head

362
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,995
See? Computer,
add instrumental accompaniment.

00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,039
( piano playing )

364
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,582
On to the chorus.

365
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,458
Together now.

366
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:09,505
♪ You are my sunshine

00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:14,761

♪ Please don't take

375
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,096
Seven, I need the data

376
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,931
from those last two
astrometric scans.

377
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,682
In a moment.

378
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,184
That looks like
the crew manifest.

379
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,645
The Doctor asked
me to pick

380
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,106
a suitable candidate.
For what?

381
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,400
Lesson Ten. "The First Date."

382
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,527
Your first date?

383
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,529
I've narrowed the list
to two crewmen

384
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,116
based on work performance
and compatible interests.

385
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,618
I didn't know you had
any interests.

386
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,369
Neither did I,

387
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,539
but, apparently, they include
astronomy, quantum mechanics

388
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,833
and music.

389
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,835
I play the clarinet,
you know.

390
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,254
You are not one of
the candidates, Ensign.

391
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,841
Oh.

392
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:39,178
Well, maybe I can help
you pick Mr. Right.

393
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,556
Ensign Bronowsky,
assigned to the Airponics Bay.

394
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,892
His work record is flawless
and he plays the accordion.

395
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,352
Badly, very badly.

396
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,772
He's got no sense of humor.

397
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,026
Lieutenant Chapman,
Structural Engineering.

398
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,486
Chapman's a nice guy.

399
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,947
We worked together
on an away mission.

400
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,240
He seemed efficient.

401
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,537
( door opens )
Robertson, if that's you,

402
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,206
I need an isolinear spanner.
SEVEN: It is not.

403
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,042
Ooh.

404
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,711
I apologize, Lieutenant.

405
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,962
I didn't mean to startle you.

406
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,464
No, my fault.

407
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,757
You need something?

408
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,384
Your presence is required...

409
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,554
...er, rather, it is
requested tonight.

410
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,305
1900 hours, Holodeck 2.

411
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,265
Another Engineering simulation?

412
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,809
Dinner.

413
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,561
"Dinner"?

414
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,938
The consumption
of nutritional biomatter.

415
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,400
No, I know what dinner is.
I just...

416
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,238
Are you asking me to join you?

417
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,781
Yes.

418
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,368
State your response.

419
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,080
Okay.

420
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,706
Yes.

421
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,499
Please be punctual.

422
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,543
I will. Thanks.

423
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,213
A dropped tool can be
a workplace hazard.

424
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,131
Be more careful
next time.

425
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,427
Seven, please state
the nature

426
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,803
of the medical
emergency.

427
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,722
I have a date.

428
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,147
(<i> humming</i>
<i>"You Are My Sunshine"</i> )

429
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,030
Sorry I'm late.
It's quite all right.

430
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,741
In fact, why don't you
take the day off...

431
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,534
relax?
Those double shifts

432
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,327
are going to take
a lot out of you.

433
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,495
Oh?

434
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,414
Seven of Nine has
a date tonight.

435
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,041
If all goes well,
as I'm sure it will,

436
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,962
he'll accompany her
to the reception tomorrow.

437
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,504
Who'd she pick?

438
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,132
Lieutenant William Chapman.

439
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,884
Ha! Chapman! Good luck.

440
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,427
What's that
supposed to mean?

441
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,846
He's renowned
for being nervous around women.

442
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,307
So?
Are you kidding?

443
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,017
Seven's dominant personality

444
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,228
will have him running
for the airlock before dessert.

445
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,063
Seven may seem
intimidating,

446
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,649
but that's only a reaction
to the way people treat her.

447
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,358
In fact, she's...

448
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,695
an efficient and
charming young woman.

449
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,781
Efficient,
I'll give you that.

450
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,658
But charming?

451
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,409
Most people don't
take the time to look

452
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,036
beyond her exterior.

453
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,371
Did you know she has
a lovely singing voice?

454
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,667
Uh, no, I didn't,
but then again,

455
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,294
I've never asked her
to sing for me.

456
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,795
What are you implying?

457
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,505
Well, it sounds like
you're getting

458
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,966
a little infatuated
with your star pupil.

459
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,301
( scoffing laugh )

460
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,427
"Infatuated"? That's absurd.

461
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,429
Whatever you say, maestro.

462
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,058
It was part of the lesson plan!

463
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,778
You're meeting with him
in ten minutes, Seven.

464
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,613
Why aren't you ready?
I am.

465
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,490
Aren't we forgetting
something?

466
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,409
Lesson Eight.
"Dress for Success."

467
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,288
My appearance is sufficient.
Sufficient, yes,

468
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,791
but you could use a
little more... panache.

469
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,878
Let's start by doing something
different with your hair.

470
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,339
I don't have much
first-hand experience

471
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,590
with this, but, uh...

472
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,345
Try...

473
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,387
shaking your head
a little bit.

474
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,642
Is this more appropriate?

475
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,187
Yes.

476
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,315
When I first designed your
dermaplastic garment,

477
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:23,236
I also tried my hand
at some casual attire.

478
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,905
You might want
to replicate one of these.

479
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,489
How shall I choose?

480
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,783
I think you'd look
very nice in...

481
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,161
this one.

482
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,497
I am uncertain how to
wear such a garment.

483
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,083
Assist me.

484
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,126
Oh, I-I-I'm sure
you'll manage.

485
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,502
I'll go prepare
the holodeck.

486
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,005
Remember, the idea is
to have fun tonight.

487
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,549
I'll expect a full report
in the morning.

488
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,138
( romantic piano music playing )

489
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,621
You-you look beautiful.

490
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,332
Thank you. You look...

491
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:22,253
beautiful as well.
Thank you.

492
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,545
( chuckles )

493
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,965
Uh, would you like to sit down?

494
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,925
Where is our
designated location?

495
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,760
Best table in the house.

496
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,435
I wasn't sure
you'd actually show up.

497
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,853
I requested your presence.
Well, to be honest,

498
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,606
I thought one of my friends
put you up to it.

499
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,280
( clears throat )

500
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,907
( sighs )

501
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,617
Um... champagne?

502
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,453
Synthehol impairs
my cortical function.

503
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,703
Water will suffice.

504
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,496
Mind if I...

505
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,582
Proceed.

506
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,585
I must admit I'm a little
nervous.

507
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,296
Elaborate.

508
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,381
Oh, um...

509
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,009
let's just say it's
been a long time

510
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,094
since I've been
out on a date.

511
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,430
I've never been
on a date.

512
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,683
As a result, I am experiencing
anxiety as well.

513
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,353
Well, I guess that means
we've got something in common.

514
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,645
( chuckling )

515
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,356
( sighs )

516
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,443
Uh...

517
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,321
Garçon?

518
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,530
( chuckles )

519
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,158
Server, report
to this station.

520
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,618
We require
your assistance.

521
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,669
( resumes playing )

522
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,732
Problem?

523
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,735
This creature has
an exoskeleton.

524
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,904
It's a lobster.

525
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,656
They're a delicacy
on Earth.

526
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,326
Try it.

527
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,581
( music resumes )

528
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,464
I will replicate you
a new garment.

529
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,091
I'm fine, fine.

530
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,052
It's just a little bit of...
exoskeleton.

531
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,345
( chuckling )

532
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,846
Maybe we should
order dessert.

533
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,640
You wish to accelerate
our social encounter?

534
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,561
No, no. I didn't say that. I'm
just, uh...

535
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:48,065
I'm having a very...
interesting evening.

536
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,942
( sighs )

537
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,528
W-would you like to dance?

538
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,530
That activity is
covered in Lesson 35.

539
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,781
I haven't
reached it yet.

540
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,241
( sighs )

541
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,452
Well, I'm not much of
a dancer myself...

542
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,744
but it might be fun.

543
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,914
As you wish.

544
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,958
( sighs )

545
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,715
Oh...

546
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,717
Relax.

547
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,936
Try to relax.
You seem a little tense.

548
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,772
Relaxation would disrupt
my chronographic sequencer.

549
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,191
It allows me to maintain
synchronous movement

550
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,027
with the music.
That's handy...

551
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,863
but maybe you could ignore
your chronographic sequencer

552
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,241
and, uh, let me lead.

553
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,040
That's better.

554
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,936
( snap )
Oh!

555
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,229
( music stops )

556
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,649
You are damaged.
(<i> strained</i> ): No...

557
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,109
I'll be all right.

558
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,698
You've torn a ligament.

559
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,035
I'm afraid you'll have
to report to Sick Bay.

560
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,744
Mr. Paris will treat you.

561
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,664
No need to mention
how this happened.

562
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,457
( groans )

563
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,545
I had a great time, Seven.

564
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,547
Let's do this again...

565
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,382
s-someday.

566
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,261
I have failed.

567
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,888
Nonsense.

568
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,308
Even Romeo and Juliet
hit a few snags at first.

569
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,353
Besides, Lieutenant Chapman's
not the only lobster in the sea.

570
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,522
I wish to terminate our social
lessons.

571
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,607
Just because you didn't
achieve perfection

572
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:57,152
your first time out doesn't mean
you should give up.

573
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,448
Dating is a poor means
of interaction.

574
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,824
There is
far more efficiency

575
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,577
in the way
you and I communicate.

576
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,912
We say what we mean
simply and directly.

577
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,831
You and I do
have a rapport,

578
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,584
but we're colleagues.

579
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,086
We're not
pursuing romance.

580
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,505
No.
I'm certain you'll be able

581
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,132
to master these basic
skills in short order.

582
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,969
My first date was
certainly short.

583
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,722
Was that a joke?

584
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,890
Lesson Six.
"Beguiling Banter."

585
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,393
Now you're getting
the hang of it.

586
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,978
Perhaps this evening doesn't
have to end so abruptly.

587
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,272
This may be a good time

588
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,190
to cover Lesson 35.
"Shall We Dance?"

589
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,693
Computer,
play "Someone To Watch Over Me"

590
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,570
instrumental only.

591
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,073
( piano intro playing )

592
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,158
We'll begin with
some simple steps.

593
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,827
Place your left hand
on my shoulder

594
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,789
and your right
hand in my left.

595
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,500
Now... follow me...

596
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,544
one step at a time.

597
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:05,512
Don't worry. I don't have
any ligaments to tear.

598
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,457
( laughing )

599
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,335
Another drink!

600
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,757
Ambassador!
Neelix!

601
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,926
( drunkenly ):
My friend,
my... host...

602
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,054
my... savior.

603
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:52,476
Neelix, I want you
to meet, uh...

604
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:53,811
Alandra...

605
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,187
( laughs heartily )

606
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,523
and Tria.

607
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,982
What are you doing?

608
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,401
I'm sampling yet another entrée

609
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:05,322
on the menu of pleasure
that you have opened up for me.

610
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,657
I checked today's menu,

611
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,367
and they're not on it.
Coffee, black.

612
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,036
Neelix, I decided
to go exploring

613
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,163
and I found your holodecks...

614
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,374
and I discovered
this little gem

615
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,877
still simmering
in the memory buffer.

616
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,213
We can explore it later.
Right now, we've got to get you

617
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,173
to your reception.

618
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,966
Mmm... pungent taste.
What is it?

619
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,510
Coffee

620
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,387
and there's plenty more
where we're going.

621
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,971
No coffee on
our colony.

622
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,682
Nothing to tempt
the appetite

623
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,393
of even the most
weak-willed novitiate.

624
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,521
Neelix, a confession.

625
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:41,107
I am thinking of
leaving the colony,

626
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,609
joining<i> Voyager.</i>

627
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,153
I want to throw
off my vows

628
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,157
and immerse myself in
your wonderful culture.

629
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,117
That's just
the synthehol talking.

630
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:56,707
No, I've never been more
clear-headed about anything.

631
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,293
And I have you to thank.

632
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,462
That's right...
there we go...

633
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,006
It's all you...

634
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,344
Hard at work?

635
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,388
Our lessons
have disrupted my duties.

636
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,848
Then I suppose
you're too busy

637
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,933
to attend the
Ambassador's reception.

638
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,393
My presence
is not required.

639
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,645
True, but it might be
an opportunity for you

640
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,231
to apply your newfound
social skills.

641
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,275
Lesson 11.
"Life of the Party."

642
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,068
Exactly. Join me?

643
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,363
Are you asking me
on a date?

644
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,199
I suppose I am.

645
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,201
Then I accept.

646
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,661
Is my appearance sufficient?

647
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,038
You look perfect.

648
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,503
( Tomin laughing )

649
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,047
PARIS:
How do you bend
a hologram's ear?

650
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,925
Use a prism.

651
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,220
What did the counselor
say to the hologram?

652
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,306
"You're projecting."

653
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,935
This humor...
it's a revelation.

654
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,937
Ambassador?
Very good.

655
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,438
Uh... are-are you sure

656
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,565
you wouldn't prefer
some more coffee, Ambassador?

657
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,818
Coffee. Mmm, yes.
I'll have that too.

658
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,569
Go.

659
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,408
Neelix...
is it my imagination

660
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,910
or is our guest
of honor drunk?

661
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,870
Commander, I tried.

662
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,288
I had an itinerary.

663
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,666
I even set up a prayer dais
in his quarters,

664
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,042
but I just
couldn't control him.

665
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,253
The Captain is due
back in the morning

666
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,046
with the Kadi Minister.
What do I do?

667
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,674
Pray.

668
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,517
Well, well, well. What do we
have here?

669
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,227
Mr. Paris, I believe you know
Seven of Nine,

670
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,521
my date for the evening.

671
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,147
Oh, you don't say?

672
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,650
Well, your last date
ended up in Sick Bay.

673
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,902
I hope this one
goes a little smoother.

674
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,737
There's no need
to be insulting.

675
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,071
It's all right, Doctor.

676
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,282
I believe he is merely
engaging in small talk.

677
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,242
May I get either
of you gentlemen a drink?

678
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,912
Ah, yes, gin and
tonic with a twist.

679
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,874
You know I don't drink.
I don't have the stomach for it.

680
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:05,126
A well-crafted joke,
Doctor.

681
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,133
Impressive. You've actually
taught her to be polite.

682
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,093
But don't think
you've won our bet.

683
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,388
She was supposed to
bring a real date.

684
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,598
Photons and force fields,
flesh and blood...

685
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,225
why quibble over details?

686
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,685
I'm just as real
as any of you.

687
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,687
TOMIN ( hollering ):
Where is that funny man?

688
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,024
Mr. Tomin, please,
why don't we sit down?

689
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,609
Ah, there he is--
There he is.

690
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,570
Ensign Paris, tell us

691
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,239
another one of those
hologram jokes.

692
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,033
You've been stealing
my material?

693
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:39,118
That guy's so lubricated
he'll laugh at anything.

694
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,537
There he is.

695
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:44,332
The Ambassador of Humor.

696
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,209
I could use a little help here.

697
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,712
Seven, perhaps now
would be a good time

698
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:52,925
to review Lesson 23.
"Toast of the Town."

699
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,801
Very well.

700
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,931
( tapping on glass )

701
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:02,141
Ladies and gentlemen,
I require your attention.

702
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,352
May cultural differences
encourage us

703
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,939
to build bridges
of understanding.

704
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,148
To all that makes us unique.

705
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,909
Who is that
extraordinary female?

706
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,244
Seven of Nine.
I want to meet her.

707
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,080
Take a number.

708
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,873
That was lovely.
Thank you.

709
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,292
I've got to admit it.
You've done wonders.

710
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,835
All right, you win.

711
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,046
"Win"?
I know when I'm licked.

712
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,590
You tell me when you want me
to start those double shifts.

713
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,635
You made a wager
regarding me? Clarify.

714
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,136
It's not what you think.

715
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,681
Um, don't blame him.
It was my idea.

716
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,016
I believed your interest

717
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,477
in my social
development was sincere,

718
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,186
not motivated by
personal gain.

719
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,438
It was sincere.

720
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,482
Clearly, I am
not the only one

721
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,233
who requires social lessons.

722
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,988
Thank you for a
lovely evening.

723
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,076
Hey...

724
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,079
Why don't we
go back to my quarters?

725
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,581
I've studied human
mating rituals.

726
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:11,128
Remove your hand
or I will remove your arm.

727
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:17,884
Did you hear
what she said to me?!

728
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,803
I am the guest of honor!

729
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,847
Ambassador,
it's been a long day.

730
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,222
Maybe you should
get some rest.

731
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,851
No! I'm not leaving!

732
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:29,228
I want another drink!

733
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,365
I thought synthehol
wasn't supposed

734
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,867
to have this effect
on people.

735
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,619
Most people. The enzymes
that break down synthehol

736
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,621
aren't present
in his bloodstream.

737
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,331
Can you counteract
the effects?

738
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,959
I can synthesize the enzymes,
but that'll take days.

739
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,336
Days? The Captain will
be back in the morning.

740
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,254
Maybe he needs a cold shower.

741
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,507
If his superiors
find him like this,

742
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,051
he'll be banished
from the colony

743
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,469
and our trade agreement
will go right out the airlock.

744
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,221
Oh, Seven of mine.

745
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,224
It may be possible to encode
some of my nanoprobes

746
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,101
to assimilate
the synthehol molecules.

747
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,602
Assimilate me.

748
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,437
There may be some
adverse effects.

749
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,732
Please...
But it's worth a try.

750
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,692
The Kadi have
rules against

751
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,861
medical procedures
that haven't been sanctified.

752
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,779
I'd say he's already
violated a few rules.

753
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,198
What's one more?

754
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,200
Either we treat him or
he remains intoxicated.

755
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,410
You're his caretaker.
Decide.

756
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,705
Nanoprobes.

757
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,297
I owe you an apology.

758
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,884
Nanoprobe extraction is an
insignificant procedure.

759
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,177
My systems will adapt.

760
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,888
No...
I'm referring to the...

761
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,557
wager I made with Ensign Paris.

762
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,018
I can see how you
might have felt manipulated,

763
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:54,064
but I assure you
that was never my intention.

764
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:57,776
I accept your apology.

765
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,485
I want to make this
perfectly clear,

766
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,947
so there's no room
for misunderstanding.

767
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,199
I asked you to go with me
to the reception

768
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,245
because I enjoy your company.

769
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:11,164
In fact,
over the last few days,

770
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,375
I feel as though we've...

771
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,377
grown closer.

772
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,171
Closer?

773
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,506
We've become
more than colleagues.

774
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,385
We're...

775
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,720
friends.

776
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,472
Friends? Agreed.

777
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,724
I should begin.

778
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,602
Of course.

779
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,778
I'll take over from here.

780
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,780
Mr. Paris...

781
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,490
hypothetically...

782
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,493
if one develops romantic
feelings for another person,

783
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,870
how does one usually
go about expressing them?

784
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,747
It's for one of Seven's
social lessons.

785
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,751
Ah... well, I recommend
the direct approach.

786
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,544
Tell the person how you feel.

787
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,006
What if the feelings
aren't mutual?

788
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,467
Well, that's the risk
you always take.

789
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,178
Oh... thank you.

790
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,767
Why don't you tell her?

791
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,560
Come on, Doc.

792
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,104
It's obvious the Ambassador

793
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,315
is not the only one
in this room who's intoxicated.

794
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,816
Impossible.

795
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,319
She's my student.

796
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,279
A hologram and a Borg?

797
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,905
Stranger things have happened.

798
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,283
Just look at me
and B'Elanna.

799
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,792
Uh, could... could we
walk a little slower?

800
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,711
They're due back
any minute.

801
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,421
But my throat feels like an
ancient parchment.

802
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,007
Can't we go
back to Sandrine's

803
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,134
for a refreshing glass of...
Oh, no, no, no, no.

804
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,636
No. No, no, no, no.

805
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,223
Those doors... they're so loud.

806
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,850
You've got a hangover.

807
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,686
Neelix, I don't remember
much of last night,

808
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,064
but... I imagine I might
have said some things...

809
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,358
You spoke eloquently... charmed
the entire crew...

810
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:04,236
your reception was a
success. Understand?

811
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,486
Yes.

812
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,572
Neelix, you've been
most patient.

813
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,241
Well, that's my job.

814
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,284
And it isn't over yet.

815
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,831
Welcome back!
JANEWAY: Good to be home.

816
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,041
How's it going?

817
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,959
All systems
functioning normally.

818
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,212
Ensign Kim detected
a minor fluctuation

819
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,297
in the sensor array,
but he took care of it.

820
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,258
I was referring
to Ambassador Tomin.

821
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:29,302
Did he enjoy his visit?
Oh, well...

822
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,012
well, I would say
that he, uh...

823
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,764
he enjoyed himself
immensely.

824
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,226
There are many distractions
aboard this vessel.

825
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:39,271
You didn't indulge
in any of their more...

826
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,064
colorful traditions?

827
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,941
Of course not!

828
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,193
We followed the itinerary
that you approved

829
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,444
to the last detail.

830
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,614
Oh... shame.
Your Holiness?

831
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:53,868
It isn't a violation
to explore new experiences...

832
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,621
as long as you don't make
a habit of it.

833
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,831
I see your point.

834
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,500
Shall we conclude
our negotiations, Captain?

835
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,794
By all means.

836
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,379
I'll show you to
the briefing room.

837
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,006
Good work... Ambassador.

838
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,271
DOCTOR:
Do you like them?

839
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,856
Species Rosa rubifolia.

840
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:29,779
State your intention.

841
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,572
I wanted to
congratulate you

842
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,659
on the latest phase of
your social development.

843
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,412
Why don't you
read the card?

844
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,835
"You are my sunshine."

845
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,756
These past few days
have been...

846
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,593
unforgettable.

847
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,472
You've brought light
into my life, Seven.

848
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,600
You have developed
romantic feelings for me.

849
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,769
It's as if you've become
a part of my program.

850
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:06,774
When we're apart, I feel like
I'm missing a subroutine.

851
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:11,363
I don't expect you
to reciprocate...

852
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:15,158
but I wanted you
to know how I feel.

853
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,410
( door chimes )

854
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,913
Computer, end program.

855
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,290
Enter.

856
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,752
Seven...

857
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,129
I wish to
speak with you.

858
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,506
What a coincidence.

859
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:33,301
I... was hoping to speak
with you as well.

860
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,844
Regarding?

861
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,681
You first.

862
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,605
What's this?
It's a medical tricorder.

863
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,901
I enhanced its scanning
resolution by 33 percent.

864
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,695
You once stated you desired
a more efficient instrument.

865
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,865
I suppose I did.

866
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,367
It is a gift.

867
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,245
Lesson 22.
"Thanks for the Memories."

868
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,957
Is it insufficient?

869
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,667
No... no.

870
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,337
It's very thoughtful.

871
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,172
I chose to convey my gratitude
at this time

872
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,132
because I no longer require
your assistance.

873
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,633
It's obvious
there are

874
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,677
no potential mates for me
aboard this vessel.

875
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,679
However, if I encounter
a compatible individual

876
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,848
in the future, I will again
seek your guidance.

877
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,686
Guidance.

878
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,230
Of course.

879
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,066
You said you had something
to tell me.

880
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,531
I just wanted to say...

881
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,492
the past few days...

882
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,497
have been unforgettable.

883
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,957
Thank you.

884
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,626
You're welcome.

885
00:43:55,883 --> 00:44:00,805
Computer, activate
holo-program Paris 3.

886
