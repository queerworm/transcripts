1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,837
Show mercy.

2
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:04,505
Your people have a saying:

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,507
"Fool me once, shame on you.

4
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,383
Fool me twice, shame on me."

5
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,469
In other words,
your credit's no good here.

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,929
I'll pay you back double

7
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,430
with next month's
replicator rations.

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,140
That's what you said
when I let you replicate

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,475
all those pork rinds

10
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,977
for your monster
movie marathon.

11
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,687
Let me put it another way.

12
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,856
( loudly ): This is
a life-and-death
situation!

13
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,106
Hyperbole won't help.

14
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,441
I'm not exaggerating.

15
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,109
This is the anniversary
of my first date

16
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,862
with B'Elanna.

17
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,238
And you forgot
all about it?

18
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,699
Yes, and if
I don't come through

19
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,617
with some kind of
romantic dinner...

20
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,828
All right,
you've made your case.

21
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,538
Neelix, you're a saint.

22
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,623
Okay, that'll be one bottle
of Mouton Rothschild--

23
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,710
a 2342 if it's
in the database--

24
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,295
Uh, Terellian pheasant,
steamed asparagus

25
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,254
and a single rose.

26
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,923
Where do you want it?

27
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,174
You can send
the food requisition

28
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,592
to B'Elanna's replicator.

29
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,553
The wine and the flower
I'll take with me.

30
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,722
Well, I can't
show up empty-handed.

31
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,515
Neelix, how about
a pot of coffee

32
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,599
while you're at it?

33
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,767
Coming right up.

34
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,812
Flowers and wine?

35
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,980
Ah, anniversary.

36
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,065
Oh.
Coffee?

37
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,149
Bridge duty.

38
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,818
I've got eight hours
ahead of me.

39
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,277
Sitting in the big chair again?

40
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,571
Fourth night in a row.

41
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,739
( Paris scoffs )

42
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,032
You're not fooling anyone.

43
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,033
Excuse me?

44
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,659
You<i> love</i> these night shifts.

45
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,285
Your chance to play Captain?

46
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,954
I'm not playing.

47
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,956
<i>This</i> is an opportunity
to get command experience.

48
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,499
You might put in
for some yourself.

49
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,459
Oh, what's the point
of trying to compete

50
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,545
with an ambitious
upstart like you?

51
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,590
Just promise me one thing:
When you reach the top,

52
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,425
you'll remember
all the little people

53
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,760
you climbed over to get there,

54
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,470
and you won't make them
work night shifts.

55
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,062
( door opens )

56
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,648
Helm, status?

57
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,276
Same as it was
20 minutes ago.

58
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,152
Refresh my memory.

59
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:55,574
Current speed-- warp 6.3,
heading 021 mark 2.

60
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,743
( sighing )

61
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,787
Permission to speak freely, sir?

62
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,204
Granted.

63
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,123
We're on the night shift.

64
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,875
Relax.

65
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,251
One of these days,

66
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,920
you'll get the call
to take the Bridge,

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,296
and maybe then

68
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,172
you'll understand
the burden of command.

69
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,759
( console beeping )
Report.

70
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,260
It's an automated distress call.

71
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,595
Origin?

72
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,973
A Class-M planet.
Range-- .73 light-years,

73
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,683
bearing 261 mark 15.

74
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,645
That would be
a significant course change.

75
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,606
Burden of command<i> is</i>
on your shoulders, sir.

76
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:31,068
Of course, we<i> could</i> always
wake Commander Chakotay.

77
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,569
No.

78
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,029
Alter course.

79
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,324
<i>( light dramatic</i>
<i>theme playing )</i>

80
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,961
Open a channel.

81
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,212
This is Ensign Kim
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

82
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,507
Can we be of assistance?

83
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,592
I'm not picking up
on any life signs.

84
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,386
I guess they
didn't make it.

85
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,139
There could be
any number of reasons

86
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,807
why we're not detecting
life signs.

87
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,059
We'll have to go down there
and take a look.

88
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,811
I'll inform the Commander.

89
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,815
Oh, Jenkins,
the Bridge is yours.

90
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,192
( light nervous sigh )

91
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,736
I hope I made
the right decision.

92
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,571
About changing course
or waking me up?

93
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,115
Sorry, sir,
but I thought...

94
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,407
Relax, Harry, you
did the right thing

95
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,868
on both counts.
Thanks.

96
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,744
Hey, why don't you
lead the away team?

97
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,705
I'll monitor your
progress from the Bridge.

98
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,707
Yes, sir.

99
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,835
The distress call
was automated?

100
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,294
That's right.

101
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,130
I'm hoping whoever
sent it is still alive.

102
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,007
Who's leading the mission?
You're looking at him.

103
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,800
Really?
Problem?

104
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,553
No. I just thought,
given the circumstances--

105
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,889
a new planet,
unknown hazards--

106
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,183
that Commander Chakotay
or Tuvok would be in charge.

107
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,560
I<i> am</i> a senior
officer, Doc.

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,062
I've been on this
ship for five years.

109
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,688
I think I can handle
an away mission.

110
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,398
I certainly didn't mean
any offense.

111
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,733
None taken.

112
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,943
Of course, having
<i>me</i> on the team

113
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,695
will more
than compensate

114
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,823
for any lack
of experience
on your part.

115
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,282
Energize.

116
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,960
Are you sure
these are

117
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,503
the right
coordinates?

118
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,880
Positive.

119
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,049
Apparently,
whoever sent

120
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,675
the distress call
was rescued.

121
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,635
Maybe, but as long
as we're here,

122
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,470
we should make
a thorough search.

123
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,722
Spread out.

124
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,981
Ensign?

125
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,240
This is the source
of the distress call.

126
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,741
What is it?

127
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,034
I don't know.

128
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,206
Paratrinic shielding,
a dense energy matrix...

129
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,958
bio-neural circuitry?

130
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,000
Bio-neural?

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,376
( high-pitched beeping )

132
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,377
Whoa, back off.

133
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,712
This could be dangerous.

134
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,922
No, wait.

135
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,967
( high-pitched beeping )

136
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,843
It's speaking to us.

137
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,762
Speaking?

138
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,388
In duotronic algorithms.

139
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,933
Hold on. My translation matrix
is interpreting.

140
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,726
( beeping continues )

141
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,186
It says it's injured.

142
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,729
It needs our help.

143
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,942
It's asking why it can't see...

144
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,778
or feel its arms and legs.

145
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,029
It's terrified.

146
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:31,372
<i>( dramatic musical</i>
<i>score playing )</i>

147
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,017
Can you identify yourself?

148
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,269
( beeping )

149
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,229
It's saying that
its memory's

150
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,898
been damaged. It doesn't
remember its name.

151

( beeping )

152
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,943
Don't worry.

153
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,611
We're going to help you.

154
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,779

156
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,741
Crewman Lang
will remain with you.

157
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,993
What do you think?
An artificial intelligence?

158
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,079
One that doesn't seem to
realize it's artificial.

159
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,372
Maybe we should
tell it the truth,

160
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,790
try to jog its memory.

161
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,584
No. I don't want to risk
psychological trauma.

162
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,710
Psychological trauma?

163
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,170
Doc, this is a machine.

164
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,672
One which is confused
and asking for our help.

165
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,133
We should beam it aboard.

166
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,302
Not until we know
what we're dealing with.

167
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,429
Away mission protocols
dictate that we...

168
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,972
Morality dictates
that we help.

169
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,307
It may not be
flesh and blood,

170
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,309
but it's clearly
in distress.

171
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,395
Make way for
the day shift.

172
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,438
How's he doing?

173
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,064
Well, let's see.

174
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,691
I haven't heard from him
in almost five minutes,

175
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,526
so he should be checking
in right about...

KIM:
<i>Away team to</i> Voyager.

I'd watch out for your job.

Go ahead, Ensign.

180
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,202
<i>We found the source</i>
<i>of the distress call.</i>

181
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,830
It's some kind of artificial
intelligence-- badly damaged.

182
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,790
The Doctor thinks
we should beam it aboard.

183
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,750
You're in charge
of the away mission, Ensign.

184
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,085
What do<i> you</i> think?

185
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,589
Well, I think
we should help it if we can,

186
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,591
but as a precaution,
I recommend

187
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,968
sealing off
an Engineering Bay

188
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,761
with a level-10 force field
and beaming it

189
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,804
<i>directly there.</i>

190
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,222
Agreed. Give us a few minutes.

191
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,892
We're going to transport you
back to our ship.

192
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,520
( beeping )

193
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,357
I'm<i> Voyager's</i>
Emergency Medical Hologram.

194
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,774
( beeping )

195
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,900
A projection

196
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,194
of light and force fields,

197
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,030
guided by an optronic
computer program.

198
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,866
( beeping )

199
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,409
( slight chuckle )

200
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,328
No... technically speaking,

201
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,997
I suppose
I'm<i> not</i> a real person.

202
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,795
JANEWAY:
How's our patient?

203
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,464
TORRES:
Complicated.

204
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,508
It uses bio-neural circuitry

205
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,010
to mimic humanoid
synaptic functions.

206
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,636
KIM:
But its memory core is damaged.

207
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,723
It's suffering from
a technological form of amnesia.

208
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,850
Any theories as to
what it might be?

209
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,394
TORRES:
It could be a probe

210
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,853
or a communications
device.

211
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,522
Whoever our friend is,
he wasn't alone.

212
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,233
He claims to have been
traveling with a companion.

213
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,901
If there's
another one down there,

214
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,486
it might give us
a few answers.

215
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,612
I'll be in Astrometrics
scanning the surface.

216
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,448
Give our guest
my regards.

217
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,782
Of course, Captain.

218
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,910
Lower the containment field.

219
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,621
How are you?

220
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,166
( beeping )

221
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,126
( hesitant sighing )

222
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,129
Well, that's
an interesting question.

223
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,799
Ensign Kim and Lieutenant Torres
are attempting to repair your...

224
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,385
damaged circuitry.

225
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,345
( beeping )

226
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,806
That's... what I wanted to talk
to you about.

227
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,518
You're not an organic being.

228
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,144
You're technological.

229
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,563
( beeping )

230
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,731
You're an artificial
intelligence

231
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,401
embedded in a machine
of some kind.

232
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,985
( beeping )

233
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,154
No, there's no mistake.

234
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,615
We believe the damage
you suffered in the crash

235
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,825
is causing your confusion.

236
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,287
( beeping )

237
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,247
Look at it this way--

238
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,998
you and I
have something in common.

239
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,875
Just because
we're not organic beings

240
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,128
doesn't mean
we're in any way inferior.

241
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,046
( beeping )

242
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,842
Well... you're metallic,
over a meter in length...

243
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,219
cylindrical.

244
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,720
( beeping )

245
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,806
Oh, you're quite sleek,
actually.

246
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,433
( beeping )

247
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,809
You're welcome.

248
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,686
I'm detecting
no further technology

249
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,230
on the planet's surface.

250
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,358
Maybe the second device
was destroyed when it crashed.

251
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,985
Scan for metallic
particulates

252
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,279
consistent with our friend
in Engineering.

253
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,614
There are minute traces

254
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,907
scattered across
the northern continent.

255
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,992
Isolate.

256
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,541
An impact crater.

257
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,962
It spans a radius
of 200 kilometers.

258
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,671
And look at this.

259
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,758
Heavy concentrations
of radiogenic decay

260
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,760
in the crater walls.

261
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,556
And the fracture gradients
are consistent...

262
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,142
with a highly focused
explosion.

263
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,562
Evidently we've
discovered its function.

264
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,901
A weapon
of mass destruction.

265
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,744
I understand
your concerns,

266
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,997
but the device hasn't
shown itself to be hostile.

267
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,333
Not yet, but it's only
a matter of time

268
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,959
before it puts
the pieces together.

269
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,545
All the more reason
we should talk to it;

270
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,046
explain our concerns.

271
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,298
Ask for help in defusing
its explosive components.

272
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,675
If it's programmed
to detonate,

273
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,468
there's no telling
how it'll react.

274
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,387
Agreed. We have to neutralize
the threat, now. Suggestions?

275
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,180
Transport the device
off the ship

276
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,140
and destroy it
before it harms anyone.

277
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,310
Seven, this is a sentient
being we're talking about.

278
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,854
Very well. Return it
to the surface

279
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,273
and deploy a warning buoy
to alert other vessels.

280
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,732
I refuse to believe

281
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,902
our only options are to
kill it or abandon it.

282
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,571
What if we
could separate

283
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,031
the bio-neural circuitry
from the explosive?

284
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,576
Take the weapon off-line,
but salvage the intelligence.

285
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,951
They're fully integrated.

286
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,453
Where would we store
the intelligence

287
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,663
once we shut the device down?

288
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,122
The answer's obvious.

289
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,666
Download its
synaptic patterns

290
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,501
into a holographic
matrix like mine.

291
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,127
Then what?

292
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,546
Try to find out
where it came from

293
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,838
and return it
to its people.

294
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,840
The device is
extremely complex.

295
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,093
One error and we'd
risk detonation.

296
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,220
Saving a life often
entails risk.

297
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,266
Harry, B'Elanna,
assist the Doctor.

298
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,766
Thank you, Captain.

299
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,310
At the first sign of danger,

300
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,396
we transport it off the ship,
understood?

301
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,689
Understood.

302
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,235
( device beeping )

303
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,737
DOCTOR:
I quite understand.

304
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,530
I wouldn't like being
carried around, either.

305
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,657
( beeping )
Of course you are.

306
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,824
Who wouldn't be?

307
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,201
( beeping )

308
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,745
We're taking you
to Sick Bay.

309
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,329
( beeping )

310
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,707
Because we're better equipped
to help you there.

311
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,959
Deck 5.

312
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,211
We're going to transfer
your intelligence

313
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,296
to a holo-matrix.

314
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,796
( beeping )

315
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,132
You should be pleased.

316
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,134
In a little while,
you're going to be

317
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,636
walking around
just like me.

318
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,555
( beeping )

319
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,390
I'm not certain.

320
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,016
Ensign Kim's configuring

321
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,893
your physical parameters
as we speak.

322
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,771
( beeping )

323
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,023
I'm sure you'll be
quite handsome.

324
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,984
Are we ready
to proceed?

325
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,694
Whenever you are.

326
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,868
( device beeping )

327
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,245
Don't be alarmed.

328
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,997
We have to access
some of your systems

329
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,166
to enable the transfer.

330
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,209
( beeping )

331
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,297
He says he wants to know
exactly what you're doing

332
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,048
as you do it.

333
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,634
This is a delicate
procedure.

334
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,302
I won't be able
to concentrate

335
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,096
if I have to give
a blow-by-blow
description.

336
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,515
( beeping )

337
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,809
You'll have to forgive
Lieutenant Torres.

338
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,560
She's an excellent
engineer.

339
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,147
Unfortunately, she doesn't
share my bedside manner.

340
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,149
Harry, would you mind?

341
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,109
KIM:
Uh, yeah, sure.

342
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,404
Well, first we're
going to be setting up

343
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,781
an active interlink

344
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,408
between you and
the holo-systems.

345
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,328
Uh, now, to do that,

346
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,164
we're going to take
your program off-line

347
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,417
while we resequence
your bio-neural circuitry.

348
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,294
( beeping )

349
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,339
He says he can't allow you
to shut him down.

350
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,591
I'm sorry, but
there's no other way.

351
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,343
( alarm blaring )

352
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,680
It's arming itself.

353
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,097
The detonation sequence
has begun.

354
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,224
Sick Bay to Bridge.

355
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,266
The device is going to detonate.

356
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,685
<i>Beam it off the ship.</i>

357
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,228
We've lost the transporter lock.

358
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,771
Talk to it, Doctor.

359
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,482
Please, you're going
to destroy yourself, and us.

360
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,192
Detonation in 20 seconds.

361
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,778
B'Elanna, send an EM pulse
through its power matrix.

362
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,238
Maybe you can short it out.

363
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,322
I'm on it.

364
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,949
KIM:
15 seconds.

365
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,326
Please disarm yourself.

366
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,161
We're just trying to help you.

367
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,371
Ten seconds.

368
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,330
Nine...

369
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,832
Initiating the pulse.

370
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,252
Six... five...

371
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,504
Now!

372
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,423
( powers down )

373
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,091
( sighs )

374
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,300
It worked.

375
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,386
<i>We've shut it down, Captain.</i>

376
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,265
You shouldn't
have done that.

377
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,059
I know you've gotten a little
attached to this thing, but...

378
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,811
You lied.

379
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,563
What are you talking about?

380
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,732
You said you were trying
to transfer my neural patterns,

381
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,901
but you were really trying
to shut me down.

382
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,948
You're the artificial
intelligence.

383
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,325
It used the interlink

384
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,952
to commandeer the
Doctor's program.

385
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,204
B'ELANNA:
Sick Bay to Bridge.

386
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,374
Captain, respond.

387
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,793
He's tapped
into the ship's systems--

388
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,127
deactivated
the com.

389
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,295
He's locked us in, too.

390
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,046
You tried to destroy me.

391
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,215
We were only trying
to disarm you.

392
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,594
I'm a weapon.
Yes.

393
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,345
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,680
It was a precaution.

395
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,808
We were afraid you
might be dangerous.

396
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,183
Obviously, we were right.

397
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,060
I couldn't let you
destroy me.

398
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,146
I have to complete
my mission.

399
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,440
You remember it now?
Yes.

400
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,318
I'm a long-range
tactical armor unit.

401
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,903
I've been deployed
by my people.

402
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,905
They're facing
a terrible threat--

403
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,073
a hostile species.

404
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,992
My companion unit
was destroyed,

405
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,953
but I will reach
my target.

406
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,747
Your ship will
take me there.

407
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,250
Look, we'll try
and contact your people.

408
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,211
If you could tell
us who they are...

409
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,213
I must resume my mission!

410
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,717
The weapon's been rearmed.

411
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,594
Security?
( computer beeping )

412
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,054
They still can't gain access
to Sick Bay

413
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,223
or any part of Deck 5,
for that matter.

414
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,976
Get a transporter lock
on our people.

415
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,227
We'll jettison the whole
damn section if we have to.

416
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,938
DOCTOR:<i> I wouldn't</i>
<i>recommend that, Captain.</i>

417
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,608
<i>If you try to stop me again,</i>
<i>I'll detonate.</i>

418
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,779
<i>Your ship and everyone on it</i>
<i>will be destroyed.</i>

419
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,620
<i>I'm transferring a new heading</i>
<i>to the helm.</i>

420
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,374
<i>You'll proceed</i>
<i>to the coordinates</i>
<i>at maximum velocity.</i>

421
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,542
Doctor?

422
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,377
<i>He's gone.</i>

423
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:29,423
He's directing us to a system
2.3 light-years from here.

424
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,258
Is that your home?

425
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,927
<i>It's my target.</i>

426
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,221
<i>The course I've plotted</i>
<i>bypasses enemy minefields.</i>

427
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,265
<i>Don't deviate from it.</i>
<i>Your ship won't be harmed.</i>

428
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,934
<i>Once we've reached the system,</i>

429
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,853
<i>you'll transport me</i>
<i>to my target.</i>

430
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,063
We won't help you wage war.

431
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,400
This crew has a Prime Directive
that forbids us to interfere

432
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,360
in the affairs of other species.

433
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,153
<i>You've already interfered.</i>

434
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,446
We were trying to help you.

435
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,281
<i>Until you discovered</i>
<i>my true nature.</i>

436
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,116
<i>Then you tried</i>
<i>to deactivate me.</i>

437
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,828
Just your explosive
components, not you.

438
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,497
<i>There's no distinction.</i>
<i>I am what I am.</i>

439
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,917
<i>Now alter course</i>
<i>or I'll detonate.</i>

440
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:08,295
If you do that, you'll never
reach your target, will you?

441
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,966
<i>I am programmed to take</i>
<i>whatever measures are necessary</i>

442
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,052
<i>to obtain my objective.</i>
<i>Failing that,</i>

443
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,889
<i>I'm to consider anyone</i>
<i>who tries to stop me an enemy.</i>

444
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,850
<i>Now alter course, and transfer</i>
<i>your sensors to me,</i>

445
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,019
<i>so I can monitor</i>
<i>your compliance.</i>

446
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,438
Release my crewmen
from Sick Bay first.

447
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,941
<i>I'm not programmed</i>
<i>to negotiate.</i>

448
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,026
<i>They'll remain where they are.</i>

449
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,362
Lay in the course,
Mr. Paris.

450
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,906
Transfer sensors to Sick Bay.

451
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:38,076
<i>A sound tactical decision,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

452
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,996
Assemble the staff.

453
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,374
We're going to find a way
to outsmart a smart bomb.

454
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,382
If we can shut down the force
fields around Sick Bay,

455
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,134
I could get a
transporter lock on it.

456
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,719
Even if you
were successful,

457
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,262
we can't beam it
far enough

458
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,806
from the ship
to escape the blast.

459
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,016
She's right.
Our best option
is to disarm it.

460
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,517
Good luck.

461
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,311
It's got an internal
sensor array.

462
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,606
If we try so much
as to loosen a screw-- Boom!

463
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,859
Commander, I think
you should take a look at this.

464
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,736
It's a power node
I used to enhance

465
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,362
the replicator system.

466
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,490
I acquired it last week
on a trading mission.

467
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,993
It has transkinetic
energy regulators

468
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,911
and bio-neural
control circuitry.

469
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,871
Remind you
of anything?

470
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,205
Our friend in Sick Bay.

471
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,000
I didn't make the
connection at first,

472
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,793
but when I overheard
a few of the engineers

473
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,294
talking about the weapon,

474
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,213
I went back and I checked
the schematics on this.

475
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,799
It's the same technology.

476
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,175
Who did you acquire it from?

477
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,260
A merchant
named Onquanii.

478
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,762
Did he say where
he got it?

479
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,515
No, but he seemed
eager to trade.

480
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,309
Maybe he'd tell us if
we make it worth his while.

481
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,603
Scan for his vessel.

482
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,314
If you find him,
send an encoded message.

483
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,565
Tell him about our problem.

484
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,943
Aye, sir.

485
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,778
If we could tap
into the holo-projectors

486
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,113
without his knowing it,

487
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,739
we might be able
to shut him down.

488
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,282
He changed all
the access codes.

489
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,868
The second we try
to decrypt them,

490
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,953
he'll restart
the detonation
sequence.

491
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,454
Do you have
a better idea?

492
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,165
Yeah, let the
Captain handle it.

493
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,583
The last thing anyone
needs is my opinion.

494
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,919
This is no time to be
feeling sorry for yourself.

495
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,880
Chakotay lets me make
a command decision--

496
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,299
What do I do?
I beam a talking
bomb on board.

497
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,638
The first time I commanded
an away mission,

498
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,265
I led my people
into a cave that I thought

499
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,393
was a Cardassian
military installation.

500
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,188
Turned out I'd mistaken
unstable mineral deposits

501
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,772
for weapon signatures.

502
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,315
There was a rock slide

503
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,026
and we were stuck there
for three days.

504
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,819
What did you do?

505
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,073
We dug ourselves out
with our bare hands.

506
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,451
Where are you going?

507
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,619
To dig us out.

508
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,667
You don't have
to do this, you know.

509
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,419
It's what I was
programmed for.

510
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,004
You're a sentient being.

511
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,381
You don't have to be
a slave to your programming.

512
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,092
Look at the Doctor.

513
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,551
He's a tool--

514
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,136
a holographic puppet.

515
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,763
That puppet saved your life.

516
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,347
If it weren't
for him,

517
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,433
you'd still be damaged
and alone on that planet.

518
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,477
He's the one that convinced me
to beam you aboard.

519
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,272
And when we discovered
what you were,

520
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,776
and some people wanted
to destroy you,

521
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,569
the Doctor defended
your right to exist.

522
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,529
What's your point?

523
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,449
Even though he was only
programmed to be a Doctor,

524
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,618
he's become more than that.

525
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,829
He's made friends,
he's piloted a starship,

526
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,081
he even sings.

527
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,916
Despite all of
his achievements,

528
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,960
did he ever stop
being a Doctor?

529
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,419
No, but...

530
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,130
And I can't stop
being a weapon.

531
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,342
Look at yourself.

532
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,137
You're already
much more than that.

533
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,847
You've got a body now,
eyes to see with.

534
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,849
The second you detonate,
that'll all be over.

535
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,060
That's the nature
of what I am.

536
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,352
It doesn't have to be.

537
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,438
We can give you
your own holo-matrix.

538
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,523
You can exist for
as long as you want,

539
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,818
accomplish anything

540
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,402
you set your mind to.

541
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,988
The only thing
I want to accomplish

542
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,447
is the destruction of my target.

543
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,491
What is your target?

544
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,994
A military installation
on Salina Prime,

545
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,997
Grid 11, Vector 9341.

546
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,706
Tell me about it.

547
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,250
Who's the enemy?

548
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,668
A ruthless, violent race

549
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,377
that's threatening
to destroy my people.

550
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,089
What else
do you know about them?

551
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,175
What's their planet like?

552
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,550
Are there forests?

553
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,385
Wildlife?

554
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,306
Schools for the children
of this violent race?

555
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,017
I'm not programmed
with superfluous data.

556
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,059
Well, lucky for you.

557
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,853
You're aboard<i> Voyager</i> now

558
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,230
and you have access
to our scanners.

559
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,150
Why don't we take a closer look
at your target.

560
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,284
A military installation,
as I told you.

561
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,327
But it's manned.

562
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,786
By soldiers.

563
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,370
Who are going to suffer
because of you.

564
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,747
Remember when you
were suffering?

565
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,415
Blind and paralyzed?

566
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,710
Do you really want to make
others go through that?

567
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,295
I have a duty
to protect my people.

568
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,462
I will not betray them.

569
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,839
Now get out

570
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,799
before I'm forced
to harm you!

571
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,721
Nice try.

572
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,184
I'm reading a subspace surge
off our port bow.

573
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,228
It looks like
a cloaked ship.

574
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,436
That could be him.

575
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,813
Onquanii travels
in a cloaked vessel.

576
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,233
We're being hailed,
audio only.

577
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,567
Open a channel.

578
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,153
ONQUANII: Voyager,
<i>good to see you again.</i>

579
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,696
And you, sir.

580
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,323
<i>I received your message.</i>

581
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,825
<i>Have you an intelligent weapon</i>
<i>in your possession?</i>

582
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,827
Actually,
we're in its possession.

583
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,162
We're being held hostage.

584
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,081
Do you know anything
about this weapon?

585
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,999
<i>If I'm correct,</i>

586
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,544
<i>it was created by a species</i>
<i>named the Druoda.</i>

587
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,130
<i>I've studied their technology.</i>

588
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,090
<i>Bring me aboard.</i>

589
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,175
<i>I can assist you.</i>

590
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,014
You've deactivated
your com system?

591
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,017
And reinforced
the shielding
in this section.

592
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,643
We won't be overheard.

593
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,188
I'd have more faith
in your security precautions,

594
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,233
if you weren't already at
the mercy of this weapon.

595
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,692
We didn't know
what it was

596
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,278
when we brought
it aboard.

597
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:11,742
This particular series has
a class-11 intelligence factor.

598
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:17,290
It's warp-capable,
fully armored, self-guiding.

599
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,835
It has a maximum range
of 80 light-years.

600
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,422
It can fly through an ion storm

601
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,757
or an armada of hostile ships

602
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,675
and still find its target.

603
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,676
Charming.

604
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,262
How do I get it off my ship?

605
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,888
You can't,

606
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,472
but I can.

607
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:38,685
My transporter system
employs a dampening field,

608
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,147
which disables
the detonator

609
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,941
until my engineers
can disarm it.

610
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,567
That's a generous offer.

611
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,612
Mind if I ask what
you expect in return?

612
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,073
The device itself.

613
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,784
I'm not about to hand over
a weapon of mass destruction

614
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,161
to someone I just met.

615
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:59,332
Oh, my business
is salvage, not war.

616
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:02,251
I've no intention
of deploying it.

617
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,920
But you might sell it
to someone who does.

618
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,797
I imagine you'd stand
to make quite a profit.

619
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:11,177
I can make more profit
by selling off its components.

620
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:15,973
The energy matrix alone
can power a fleet of starships,

621
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,143
and its intelligence core,
properly reprogrammed,

622
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,187
can assist
in a variety of things,

623
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,438
from terraforming

624
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,232
to planetary weather control.

625
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,109
All right.
You can have the weapon

626
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,820
as long as we keep
the energy matrix.

627
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,239
That way we can be sure
no one ever deploys it.

628
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,784
I'm afraid that's
unacceptable.

629
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,203
The energy matrix

630
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,122
is one of the most
valuable components.

631
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,916
I'm sorry. It's not open
for negotiation.

632
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,918
We could offer you
a few dilithium crystals

633
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,420
in compensation.

634
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:51,258
That matrix is worth
a thousand dilithium crystals.

635
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,220
What if we threw in
a plasma manifold?

636
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,973
I want the entire weapon
or it remains here.

637
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,599
Captain?

638
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,767
You seem awfully intent

639
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,853
for someone only
interested in salvage.

640
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,065
I'm sorry to
waste your time.

641
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,691
We'll have to find
another way

642
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,236
to solve
our problem.

643
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,699
I wish you luck.

644
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,079
NEELIX:
Sorry, Captain,

645
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,788
I thought
it would help.

646
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,207
Bridge, report.

647
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,334
PARIS:
<i>The alien vessel</i>
<i>has opened fire.</i>

648
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,169
<i>We've lost weapons and shields.</i>

649
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,088
Sick Bay to Captain.
What's happening?

650
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,548
JANEWAY:
<i>We're under attack.</i>

651
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:31,924
How many ships?

652
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,426
<i>One... off the port bow.</i>

653
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,718
Return fire.

654
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,803
<i>We can't.</i>
<i>Check your sensors.</i>

655
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,638
<i>Our weapons are off-line.</i>

656
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,059
Force fields around
Sick Bay are destabilizing.

657
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,186
He's trying to get
a transporter lock
on the weapon.

658
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,771
Remodulate the shields.

659
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,442
No effect.

660
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,195
What are you doing?

661
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,991
The weapon's sending
an antimatter surge

662
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,701
back through
the transporter beam.

663
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,169
They've been destroyed.

664
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,004
That wasn't necessary.

665
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,965
DOCTOR:
<i>They were an enemy.</i>

666
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,467
Maintain course.

667
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,557
I've studied
the weapon's schematics.

668
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,100
My nanoprobes can be adapted

669
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,893
to disable its
bio-neural circuitry.

670
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,686
However, I would need
direct access

671
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,938
to its primary control port.

672
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:29,356
That means
getting you

673
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,150
into Sick Bay without
arousing suspicion.

674
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,194
We could access the holo-matrix
controls above Sick Bay,

675
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,947
disrupt the Doctor's program
long enough for Seven

676
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,740
to inject
the nanoprobes.

677
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,826
How much time
would you need?

678
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,702
Approximately
20 seconds.

679
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,955
Run a long-range scan
on that subspace minefield

680
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,624
it warned us about.

681
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,542
Calculate
their explosive yield...

682
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,419
what kind of damage
they might to do the ship.

683
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,962
TUVOK:
Aye, Captain.

684
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,380
What have you
got in mind?

685
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,923
I have a feeling
we're about to run

686
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,009
into some
unexpected trouble.

687
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,165
We've analyzed
the alien minefield

688
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,334
and calculated the effect
it would have on<i> Voyager.</i>

689
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,503
I think I can simulate
the explosions

690
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:36,048
with a well-timed disruption
to the inertial dampers.

691
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,425
Of course, asking me
to give you a bumpy ride

692
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,136
is like asking a virtuoso
to sing off-key.

693
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,555
I'm sure
you'll manage.

694
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,848
The weapon has access
to our sensors.

695
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,350
How do we make sure
it won't catch on?

696
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,851
We've reconfigured
the sensor array

697
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,353
to send it false telemetry.

698
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,104
It will believe
we're navigating a minefield.

699
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,773
At least long enough for us
to get Seven to Sick Bay.

700
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,025
How?

701
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,610
Medical emergency.

702
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,737
I intend to suffer
third-degree plasma burns

703
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,698
during our encounter
with the mines.

704
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,157
That's where I come in.

705
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,577
Chief Cosmetics Officer,
at your service.

706
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,953
Another hidden talent, Neelix?

707
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,665
Well, I know my way around
a dermal regenerator.

708
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,501
I should be able to simulate
a convincing wound.

709
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,628
Okay. We get her inside.

710
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,962
Then what?

711
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,297
Commander Tuvok
will be in position

712
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,049
to disrupt the Doctor's program.

713
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,593
Once that happens, I will inject

714
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,261
the nanoprobes
and disable the weapon.

715
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,929
I'll inform the Captain.

716
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,764
Get started.

717
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,935
Do well on this mission, Neelix,
and maybe the Captain

718
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,312
will promote you
to Senior Beautician.

719
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:41,739
Assist me.

720
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,073
With what?

721
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,366
I'm trying
to identify

722
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,951
the malfunction
that caused me to crash,

723
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,787
but several of my memory files
are still damaged.

724
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,871
Restore them.

725
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,209
We tried helping
it before.

726
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,502
Look where
that got us.

727
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,713
"When taken captive
by a hostile force

728
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,924
seek out any opportunity
to engage the assailant."

729
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,051
Didn't you ever read
the Officers' Manual?

730
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,261
Section 126.

731
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,221
I don't think
Starfleet diplomacy

732
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,181
is going to work this time.

733
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:12,728
If we cooperate, we'll be
giving it the advantage.

734
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,354
If there's even a chance

735
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,731
that we can convince it
to change its mind...

736
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,816
It's a bomb, Harry.

737
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,942
A sentient bomb.

738
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,111
DOCTOR:
I said assist me!

739
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,200
Where do we start?

740
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,869
There are several disruptions
in my memory index,

741
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,331
including a three
minute, 37 second gap

742
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,291
just prior
to the crash.

743
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,793
A recursive
search algorithm

744
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,586
might retrieve
the missing data.

745
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,798
There.

746
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,342
You received
a subspace transmission--

747
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,760
a command to alter course

748
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,178
and head
toward the planet's surface.

749
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,262
Looks like your landing

750
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,972
wasn't an accident.

751
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,229
It was an attempt by the enemy
to divert me from my target.

752
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,357
No, your access codes
are encrypted.

753
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,401
They must've developed
an infiltration code.

754
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,986
What if it wasn't the enemy?

755
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,030
Who else would try
to divert me?

756
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,406
Correct me if I'm wrong,

757
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,826
but these are
the same duotronic algorithms

758
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,619
that you use
to communicate with.

759
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,289
My own people wouldn't try
to stop me.

760
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,957
Maybe they changed their mind.

761
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,459
The enemy is ruthless.

762
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,127
My target is a threat.

763
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,672
Why would my people call off
the assault?

764
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:24,257
If we clear up
some more of these memory files,

765
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,844
maybe we'll find out.

766
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,804
Your assistance is
no longer required.

767
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,888
What's wrong?

768
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,473
You afraid
you might find out

769
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,058
you're not supposed to
destroy that installation?

770
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,143
Let us finish the job.
Then you can decide

771
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,187
what you want to do
with the information.

772
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,440
Proceed.

773
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,947
Does the name
"Strategic Command Matrix"

774
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,074
mean anything to you?

775
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,450
That's my control center.

776
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,951
They ordered my launch.

777
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,080
Well, it looks like your
orders were rescinded.

778
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,540
See for yourself.

779
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,710
"All long-range
tactical armor units...

780
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,088
terminate mission immediately."

781
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,631
Keep reading.

782
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,343
It says... the war is over.

783
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,429
It ended nearly
three years ago.

784
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,180
My launch was

785
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,182
a mistake.

786
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,477
There was a malfunction
in one of the command sensors.

787
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,979
It activated a series
of launch sequencers.

788
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,815
My people managed
to shut most of them down,

789
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,777
but 34 weapons were fired...

790
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,319
including me.

791
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,487
KIM:
I guess this means

792
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,615
you can disarm
yourself now.

793
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:33,786
<i>No.</i> There's no
confirmation code here.

794
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,413
We avoided
the enemy's minefield,
so they're trying to deceive us!

795
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,750
The confirmation
could be in one of
your damaged memory files.

796
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,419
Or maybe it was<i> you</i> 
deceiving me to implement

797
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,797
your pacifist philosophy.
That's not true.

798
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,632
You lied to me before.
Why should I trust you now?

799
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:50,009
You don't have to trust us,
just access those files.
No!

800
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,011
I am programmed
to destroy my target!

801
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,889
I will complete my mission!

802
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,767
If the war is over, you could
end up starting another one.

803
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,268
How many of your people
will die then?

804
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,896
( explosion )

805
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,188
DOCTOR:
Sick Bay to Bridge.

806
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,523
<i>Report.</i>

807
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,858
We've run into
a subspace mine.

808
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,359
We had to drop
out of warp.

809
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,069
<i>There shouldn't be mines</i>
<i>along this course.</i>

810
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,655
CHAKOTAY:
We're detecting
thousands of them

811
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,114
scattered throughout the region.

812
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,658
We're plotting a new
course to avoid them.

813
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,160
Transmit it to me.

814
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,996
This trajectory will delay us
for two days.

815
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,332
That'll give you time
to confirm that the war is over.

816
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,960
No! Proceed as planned.

817
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,170
I'm programming
a shield enhancement

818
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,880
<i>that will protect</i> Voyager.

819
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,841
I'm still going
to have to reduce speed.

820
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,426
Agreed,

821
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,095
but only until
we've cleared the minefield.

822
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,474
Maintain course, Mr. Paris.
One-quarter impulse.

823
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,476
Think he bought it?

824
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,353
He seemed to.

825
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,856
Let's give him another
good shake just to be sure.

826
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,649
Yes, ma'am.

827
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,027
That was another mine.

828
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,988
The shields will hold.

829
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,079
Tuvok to Bridge.

830
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,665
I've accessed the holo-matrix.

831
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,124
JANEWAY:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

832
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,003
Janeway to Neelix.
Casualty report.

833
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,172
I'm putting the finishing
touches on Seven's plasma burn

834
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,341
and it looks
pretty authentic,

835
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,801
if I do say so myself.

836
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,053
JANEWAY:
<i>Good work. Stand by.</i>

837
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,513
Time to hit another mine, Tom--

838
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,181
a big one.

839
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,560
Commander, blow out
the plasma relays on Deck 6.

840
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,438
<i>Janeway to Sick Bay.</i>
<i>We have heavy casualties.</i>

841
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,316
Maintain heading and speed.
That's going to be difficult.

842
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,443
Our Astrometrics Officer
has been injured.

843
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,989
She's the one who's been guiding
us through the minefield.
Replace her.

844
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,991
Seven of Nine's abilities
are unique.

845
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,367
We're not going to get past

846
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,452
<i>these mines without her.</i>

847
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,163
Then treat her injuries
and send her back to her post.

848
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,082
She has third-degree
plasma burns.

849
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,459
She needs to go to Sick Bay
to be treated.

850
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,045
If you want to reach
your target,

851
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,629
you're going to have to wait.

852
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:54,259
All right, Captain,
but I'm warning you...

853
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,887
No deceptions.

854
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,848
Janeway to Neelix.

855
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,850
Go.

856
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,268
( door chimes )

857
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,190
( groaning )

858
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,443
Treat her as quickly
as possible.

859
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,862
( beeping )

860
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,363
They're in.

861
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,573
Now, Tuvok.

862
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,329
Bridge, my holo-matrix
is destabilizing.

863
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,873
Why?

864
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,333
We took damage
to our secondary systems.

865
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,877
Repair them.

866
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,338
<i>Now!</i> Or I'll activate
the detonation sequence.

867
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,424
Stand by.

868
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,885
What's going on?

869
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,429
She's trying
to defuse the weapon.

870
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,606
Seven!

871
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,947
She's going into
neural shock.

872
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,364
Help me.

873
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,167
Sick Bay to Bridge.

874
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,878
Your attempt to disable me
did not succeed.

875
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,505
I am designed to repel

876
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,133
<i>any assault</i>
<i>on my bio-neural circuitry.</i>

877
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:19,136
We've tried to reason with you.
You left me no choice.

878
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,179
And you leave me no choice.

879
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,849
You and your crew will abandon
<i>Voyager</i> immediately.

880
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,477
No deal.

881
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,021
This is not a negotiation!

882
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,897
Comply or I will detonate!

883
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,483
Go ahead. Do it.

884
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,402
Everyone on board
will be killed!

885
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,113
But no one else will.

886
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,910
Captain, 32 vessels
just dropped out of warp

887
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,203
off our port bow.

888
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,830
On screen.

889
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,478
One of them is transmitting
a message...

890
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,688
to the "Doctor."

891
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,231
Bridge to Sick Bay.

892
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,691
We've got company--

893
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,860
<i>32 self-guided weapons.</i>

894
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,654
They detected my presence
aboard your vessel.

895
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,323
They say my target
is essential.

896
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,450
They altered course
to ensure that I reach it.

897
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,745
They are ordering me
to transport off your vessel.

898
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,621
<i>They will tractor me</i>
<i>to my target.</i>

899
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,083
Mr. Kim, reintegrate
its neural matrix,

900
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,959
<i>and prepare to beam it off--</i> 
We can't do
that, Captain.

901
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,670
<i>Explain.</i> 
These weapons were
fired by accident.

902
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,005
We can't let them
reach their targets.

903
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,383
Enough! Captain,
order him to proceed!

904
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,718
Harry, what are you
talking about?

905
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,553
Captain, I need
a minute.

906
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,097
You're making a mistake.

907
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,182
Your own people
tried to disarm you.

908
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,559
I cannot be certain of that.
Yes, you can.

909
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,061
You can check
your memory files.

910
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,645
Look for the
confirmation code.

911
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,855
No more delays.

912
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:54,940
Check the files.

913
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,566
Reintegrate my matrix.
No!

914
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,610
Do what Harry says
or you're not leaving this ship.

915
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,987
DOCTOR:
<i>You're in no position</i>
<i>to give me orders.</i>

916
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,572
If you detonate now,

917
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,449
you'll destroy yourself
and your companions.

918
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,825
Is that what you want?

919
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,163
The confirmation code.

920
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,589
Coding intersequence
443, vector 39121.

921
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,216
Cessation of hostilities...

922
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,135
confirmed.

923
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,887
Unauthorized launch...
confirmed.

924
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,889
Order to terminate mission...

925
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,474
confirmed.

926
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,017
You must disarm yourself

927
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,978
and tell the others
to stand down.

928
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,520
It's a deception.

929
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,898
This code of yours uses
a modulating algorithm.

930
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,192
It would be almost
impossible to duplicate.

931
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,027
The enemy is ruthless;
they are violent.

932
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,361
Have you ever
met the enemy?

933
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,947
You're just spouting
propaganda,

934
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,698
what you've been
programmed to believe.

935
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,658
I have a directive.

936
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,784
It's been
countermanded!

937
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,452
I am a Series 5,
long-range

938
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,621
tactical armor unit
designed to traverse enemy space

939
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,581
and circumvent
all attempts to deter me.

940
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,750
You're a sentient being.

941
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,669
I have a duty
to protect my people,

942
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,045
to destroy my target!

943
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,755
You've been programmed
with intelligence,

944
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,257
so you could make decisions
on your own.

945
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,800
Well, it's time to make one.

946
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,927
Countless lives are at stake!

947
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,521
Ever since you took
the Doctor's form,

948
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,107
you've been learning what
it's like to be one of us.

949
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,483
Now, try to imagine

950
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,319
what it's like to be
one of your victims--

951
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,945
your first victim.

952
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,488
You've seen
her suffering.

953
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,740
Increase that by a
factor of one million--

954
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,201
<i>ten</i> million--

955
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,785
and that's how much
suffering you'll cause

956
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,829
if you don't end this.

957
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,248
( high-pitched beeping )

958
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,211
They're asking why
I haven't left your ship.

959
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,545
Tell them.

960
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,383
I'm transmitting our orders
to terminate the mission.

961
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,801
( relieved sigh )

962
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,971
( high-pitched beeping )

963
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,597
They also received
those orders,

964
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,266
but they had
already crossed

965
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,018
the targeting
threshold.

966
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,436
Once we're within two
light-years of our target,

967
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,938
we cannot be diverted.

968
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,982
( sighs )

969
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,525
Tell them the war's over.

970
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,568
I did.

971
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,070
Tell them you got the message

972
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,571
before you crossed
the threshold,

973
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,365
when you were on
the planet's surface.

974
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,993
( high-pitched beeping )

975
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,452
They don't believe me.

976
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,496
It's up to you
to make them understand.

977
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,540
They only understand
their directive.

978
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,417
They won't listen.

979
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,631
Reintegrate my
neural matrix

980
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,841
and return me
to the others.

981
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,343
We won't do that.

982
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,720
I have no intention
of proceeding to my target.

983
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,513
I will stop them.

984
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,848
How?

985
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,601
I am a weapon
of mass destruction.

986
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,356
You want me to see
past my programming...

987
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:45,026
then you must try to
see past your doubts.

988
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,405
B'Elanna...

989
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,656
give me a hand.

990
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,079
Bridge, lock on to the weapon.
Prepare to beam it into space.

991
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,705
JANEWAY:
<i>Harry, what's going on?</i>

992
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,416
Captain, no time to explain.

993
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,708
Just trust me on this one.

994
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,585
I hear you
loud and clear, Ensign.

995
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,212
Do it.

996
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,757
I've reconfigured
the bio-neural matrix.

997
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,094
Ready?

998
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,806
I'm sorry.

999
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,642
I am simply completing
my mission.

1000
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,852
Only the target has changed.

1001
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,240
Transfer complete.

1002
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,616
Please state the nature
of the...

1003
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,660
What happened?
How long was I off-line?

1004
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,163
We'll explain later.
Seven needs your help.

1005
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,748
Bridge, energize.

1006
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,729
They've gone
into warp.

1007
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,731
Maintain long-range sensors.

1008
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,496
I'm detecting a series
of antimatter explosions.

1009
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,289
In proximity
to what?

1010
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,209
No ships,
no planets...

1011
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,584
nothing.

1012
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,462
Bridge to Ensign Kim.

1013
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,214
The weapons have been destroyed.

1014
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,132
( sighs )

1015
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,600
Anyone home?

1016
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,853
Ensign.

1017
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,146
Feeling well, I hope?

1018
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,939
Perfect.
On my way to the Bridge

1019
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,692
for another night shift.
Came by to check on Seven.

1020
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,361
You just missed her.

1021
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,778
What's her prognosis?

1022
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,613
She'll need another
week of regeneration,

1023
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,408
but I expect she'll
make a full recovery.

1024
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,950
Good news.

1025
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,036
Oh, considering I was
responsible for her injuries,

1026
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,579
you can imagine<i> my</i> relief.

1027
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,331
Well, you weren't exactly
yourself at the time.

1028
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,126
That's not what I mean.
I was the one who asked you

1029
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,337
to bring that device aboard
in the first place.

1030
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,256
I even argued with the Captain
to keep it aboard

1031
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,258
after we learned what it was.

1032
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,885
"It" was an artificial
intelligence, like you,

1033
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,803
but I have to admit,

1034
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,390
his personality made you
seem like Mr. Congeniality.

1035
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,268
Look, Doc, the truth is,

1036
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,644
I never would've gotten
through to him without you.

1037
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:29,941
From what I heard,
I wasn't much help.

1038
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,067
You were.

1039
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,444
I held you up as an example

1040
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,112
of how
an artificial intelligence

1041
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,114
could exceed its programming.

1042
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:40,201
I didn't realize how true
that was... until today.

1043
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,330
It seems your strategy worked.

1044
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,124
Thank you.

1045
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,501
I better get to the Bridge.

1046
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,128
You never know when Ensign Kim

1047
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,921
will be called upon
to take command again.

1048
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,717
<i>Voyager</i> could do worse.

1049
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:09,063
Helm, status.

1050
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,025
Current speed-- warp 5.
Heading-- 021 mark 3.

1051
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,860
Anything on
long-range sensors?

1052
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,279
Nothing to report.

1053
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,614
As you were.

1054
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,951
Permission to speak
freely, sir.

1055
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,828
Why would tonight
be any different?

1056
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,955
People have been
talking about you.

1057
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,373
Oh?

1058
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,707
Rumor has it
you were the one

1059
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,585
who outsmarted
the smart bomb.

1060
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,545
Well... not exactly.

1061
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,173
I made first contact
with a sentient being.

1062
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,925
All I did was help it
understand a few things.

1063
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,260
The rest was up to him.

1064
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,220
Understood.

1065
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,640
Actually, I've been authorized
by the junior staff

1066
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,392
to thank you for keeping us
in one piece.

1067
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,394
You're welcome.

1068
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,771
Any time.

1069
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,231
Do me a favor.

1070
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,941
Of course, sir.

1071
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,443
No more distress calls.

1072
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,111
At least not tonight.
