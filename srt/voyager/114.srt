1
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:11,010
MALE:
Regeneration phase completed.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,388
Deactivate the genotron.

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,474
( genotron powers down )

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,687
Shut down
the bio-matrix.

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,481
( bio-matrix powers down )

6
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,900
B'Elanna...

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,736
B'Elanna Torres.

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,155
Wake up.

9
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,706
( theme music playing )

10
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,852
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48784.2.</i>

11
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,605
<i>We have completed our survey</i>
<i>of the Avery system</i>

12
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,982
<i>and are returning to retrieve</i>

13
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,358
<i>Lieutenants Paris,</i>
<i>Torres and Durst.</i>

14
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,694
<i>By now, they should have</i>
<i>concluded their inspection</i>

15
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,156
<i>of the magnesite formations</i>
<i>on the third planet.</i>

16
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,119
Here we are, Mr. Tuvok.

17
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:44,748
One bowl of authentic
Vulcan<i> plomeek</i> soup.

18
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,792
As I have told you,
Mr. Neelix,

19
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,669
this is
an unnecessary indulgence.

20
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,004
I am quite content to eat

21
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,630
whatever the rest of the crew
is eating.

22
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,798
Nonsense!

23
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,049
Everyone aboard
this ship

24
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,383
deserves a little
taste of home

25
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,719
every now and then.

26
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,178
Very well, then.

27
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,764
Thank you.

28
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,474
Oh, don't thank me.

29
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,809
I'm having a
marvelous time

30
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,393
experimenting with
the native dishes

31
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,645
of the entire crew.

32
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,896
So far, I've
learned to make

33
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,231
corn salad for
Mr. Chakotay

34
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,651
and peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

35
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,902
for Mr. Paris.

36
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,237
He calls it
"comfort food."

37
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,949
Isn't that charming?

38
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,993
What are you waiting for?
It's no good cold.

39
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,667
Well?

40
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,293
( coughs )

41
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,379
It is rather... piquant.

42
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,255
It is zesty, isn't it?

43
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,676
I tried following the recipe
in the computer's data bank,

44
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,136
but it seemed so bland.

45
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,847
So I took the liberty
of spicing it up a bit.

46
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,017
Call it<i> plomeek</i>
soup Ã  la Neelix.

47
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,268
I must point out
that if you take the liberty

48
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,646
of changing
a time-honored recipe,

49
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,440
you are hardly presenting
a taste of home.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,944
CHAKOTAY ( over P.A. ):
<i>Senior officers, please</i>
<i>report to the Bridge.</i>

51
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:56,945
But your soup.

52
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,572
Please...

53
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,115
enjoy it.

54
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,837
Oh!

55
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,672
Ooh, there's no place like home.

56
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,965
( burps )

57
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,633
The away team
hasn't arrived

58
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,260
at the prearranged
coordinates, Captain,

59
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,596
and they've failed to
respond to our hails.

60
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,806
Have you tried locking on
to their com signals?

61
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,516
We scanned the entire surface.
No sign of them.

62
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,809
They must still be underground.

63
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,895
But I can't locate them
there, either.

64
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,106
Then, as we suspected,
the dense magnesite formations

65
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,108
in the planet's crust
are blocking

66
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,275
our sensors.

67
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,818
Take a look at this.

68
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,737
This is the cave system
nearest the beam-in coordinates

69
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,906
as it appeared in our
initial geological scan

70
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,657
and this is
the same system now.

71
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,034
This tunnel here

72
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,161
has shifted to the west
by almost 75 degrees.

73
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,789
Are you saying walls
of solid rock have changed shape

74
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,083
in the two days since
the away team was deployed?

75
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,127
Apparently so, Captain,
but our initial scans

76
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,962
didn't indicate
tectonic activity

77
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,630
of anywhere near
that magnitude.

78
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,966
In any case, it's possible
that Torres and the others

79
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,635
haven't returned to the beam-out
site because they were trapped

80
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,762
by these
geological shifts.

81
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,223
I'd like to lead a team
down to investigate, Captain.

82
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,934
And what is to prevent us from
losing you as well, Commander?

83
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,185
KIM:
Bread crumbs.

84
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,270
Ensign?

85
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,896
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.

86
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,108
What I mean to say is
I think I can modify

87
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,359
some subspace transponders
which could be deployed

88
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,820
along the Commander's path,
kind of like...

89
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,655
Bread crumbs.
Got it.

90
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,364
If they're placed
at regular intervals,

91
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,159
I believe they'll maintain
a signal link with the ship

92
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,452
and they could serve
as a transporter relay

93
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,579
in case we need to stage
an emergency beam-out.

94
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,000
Very well, Commander.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,043
Take a team with you,
but I want a transporter lock

96
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,419
on you at all times.

97
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,504
Aye, Captain.

98
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,547
Tuvok, Kim, you're with me.

99
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,886
( gasping quietly )

100
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,812
I apologize
for the restraints,

101
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,690
but your presence here
is very important to us.

102
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,817
Do you understand?

103
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,029
Who... are... you?

104
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:07,909
I am Sulan, Chief Surgeon
of the Vidiian Sodality.

105
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:14,415
I demand... to know...

106
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,585
what is happening here.

107
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,762
You've surgically altered
my face!

108
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,807
I look like a Klingon!

109
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,311
I've performed no surgery,
as you understand the term.

110
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,772
There are several questions
I need to ask you

111
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,274
before we proceed.

112
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,776
You can't possibly believe

113
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,738
I'm going to cooperate
with you.

114
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,405
Perhaps I was in error

115
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,701
to leave your consciousness
and memory intact.

116
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,829
Durst...

117
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,873
Paris...

118
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,085
What have you done with them?!

119
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,670
What is your exact age,
Klingon?

120
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,842
If you want me
to answer your question,

121
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,846
you will have to answer
one of mine first.

122
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,348
Very well.

123
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:17,938
What... exactly...
have you done to me?

124
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,565
I have reconstituted
your genome.

125
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,734
You are now
purely Klingon.

126
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,903
That's not possible!

127
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,488
I assure you it is.

128
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,908
I have developed
a procedure

129
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,701
to stimulate
cell division.

130
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,414
A kind of...
enhanced mitosis.

131
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,416
Your Klingon
genetic material

132
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,917
was extracted.

133
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,296
It was then converted
from matter to energy

134
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,671
by our genotron.

135
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,340
Finally...

136
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,508
you were
rematerialized

137
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,429
as the purified
Klingon specimen

138
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,972
that you are now.

139
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,766
Why? Why...

140
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,184
have you done this?!

141
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,812
For generations,
my people have been searching

142
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,982
the Quadrant for
a species immune

143
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,568
to our disease, in the hope
that it would lead us to a cure.

144
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:11,616
And you think Klingons
are immune to this phage?

145
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,034
I believe your genetic structure

146
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,121
has phage-resistant
nucleotide sequences, yes.

147
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:21,418
But I needed a pure specimen
to be certain.

148
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,171
My people do not know it yet,

149
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,923
but you are their greatest hope.

150
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,884
I... will... never

151
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,386
help you!

152
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,638
You are very strong.

153
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:38,518
I can only hope that you will be
truly resistant to the phage.

154
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,772
And how will you know that?

155
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,984
I have infected you.

156
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,862
( snarls )

157
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,432
They're the ones
with the guns, remember?

158
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,449
We've got to find a way
out of this place.

159
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,160
Agreed, but I don't want
to do anything

160
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,995
until we find out what
they've done with B'Elanna.

161
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,122
( footsteps approaching )

162
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,462
In the meantime, we have to keep
track of the guards' movements--

163
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,755
how long are their shifts

164
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,132
when do they eat,
when do they sleep.

165
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,222
There don't seem
to be many of them.

166
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,307
I guess they figure
we're all so exhausted,

167
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,184
we don't have any fight left.

168
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,977
We'll find an opening, Pete,

169
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,064
and when the time is right,
we'll make our move.

170
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,815
( laughing )

171
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,151
Something funny, friend?

172
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,528
You.

173
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,779
Really?

174
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,988
How's that?

175
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,074
Nobody ever escapes
from this place.

176
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,742
Those Vidiian leeches

177
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,828
can yank the beating heart
out of you-- in a heartbeat.

178
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,039
Heart out of you
in a heartbeat.

179
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,916
Now, that's funny.

180
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,251
Hilarious.

181
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,835
Seems like you know this place
pretty well.

182
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,297
I should.
I've been here six years.

183
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,091
Then tell me something...

184
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,468
I thought those Vidiians

185
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,677
were in the business
of harvesting organs.

186
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,305
How come we're all
still in one piece?

187
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,265
The disease makes them weak.

188
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,267
They need somebody
to dig their tunnels.

189
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,018
That's us.

190
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,020
Best way to keep alive
around here

191
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,856
is to stay strong.

192
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,150
Thanks for the advice.

193
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,651
But don't worry.

194
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,736
They're always in need of
replacement body parts.

195
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,822
They'll get around
to gutting you eventually.

196
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,117
There were 23 of us
from my ship.

197
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,536
I'm the only one left.

198
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,830
Listen, when they grabbed us,

199
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,083
there was a woman with us--
B'Elanna Torres.

200
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,751
Any idea what might've
happened to her?

201
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,044
If she's not here,

202
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,297
she's been taken
to organ processing.

203
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,907
( beeping quietly )

204
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,790
I've deployed
the transponders, Commander.

205
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,460
The relay signal
is coming through clearly.

206
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,794
CHAKOTAY:
Good work.

207
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,094
Any sign of them?

208
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,681
According to my
tricorder readings,

209
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,599
they definitely
came this way.

210
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,810
The question is: Where
did they go from here?

211
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,899
( animal screeches )

212
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,734
Delightful spot
to get lost.

213
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,863
TUVOK:
Commander, Ensign,
over here.

214
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,161
CHAKOTAY:
What is it?

215
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,706
I detect traces of at least
five humanoid life-forms.

216
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,332
KIM:
Five?

217
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,792
There were only three
on the away team.

218
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,588
Evidently, they did not enter
this cavern alone.

219
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,515
( forceful, ragged breathing )

220
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,063
( door opens and closes )

221
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,532
Are you in pain?

222
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,785
It's... nothing.

223
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,624
Remarkable.

224
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,125
One of the symptoms 

225
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,628
of the early stages
of the phage

226
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,714
is excruciating
joint pain.

227
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,718
I find it extraordinary
that you can endure it.

228
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,720
Some who are infected

229
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,557
have been known to die
from the agony itself.

230
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:33,812
It's going to take more
than an infection to kill me.

231
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,404
It appears you are correct.

232
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,908
Your body is successfully
fighting off the phage.

233
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,952
I am overjoyed.

234
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,705
How delightful for you.

235
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,750
Soon we will begin
a series of procedures

236
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,462
replicating your genetic code
and attempting various methods

237
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,047
of integrating your DNA
with our own.

238
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,092
In time, we'll be successful

239
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,971
and eliminate the phage forever.

240
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,683
When that time comes,

241
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:13,019
you will be honored
as a hero by my people.

242
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,357
I know I'm the first Klingon
you've ever seen,

243
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,900
so I'll tell you

244
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,658
that Klingons find honor
as warriors on the battlefield,

245
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:31,245
not as guinea pigs
in a laboratory.

246
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,208
Earlier, you accused me
of mutilating you.

247
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,878
Now you sound positively proud
to be Klingon.

248
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,758
You have me to thank
for that, B'Elanna.

249
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,760
You'll get no gratitude from me.

250
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,470
Perhaps you'll feel

251
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,723
different in time.

252
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,184
But I don't blame you
for your obstinance.

253
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,935
I would be proud, too,

254
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,938
with a form as handsome
as yours.

255
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,317
I believe Klingons

256
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:06,030
are the most impressive species
I have ever seen.

257
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,369
( door opens )

258
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,006
( groans )

259
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,646
Tom...

260
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:40,815
Tom, wake up.

261
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,817
( grunts )

262
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,740
B'Elanna?

263
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,910
Yeah. It's me.

264
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,873
B'Elanna, what have they
done to you?

265
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,304
I remember them grabbing
us outside the caves

266
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,222
and then I...

267
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,683
I guess I just blacked out.

268
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,603
Yeah.
They stunned all of us.

269
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,313
The next thing I knew,

270
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,651
they were waking me up in
some kind of laboratory.

271
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,488
I was so groggy I couldn't see.

272
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,741
I asked them
what they had done to me

273
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,328
and then one of them said

274
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:40,708
that they had completely
extracted my Klingon DNA.

275
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,460
( sighs )

276
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,713
That doesn't seem possible...

277
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,257
but you look human.

278
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,929
I feel so weak
and sick to my stomach.

279
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,514
Well, considering
what they've done to you,

280
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,765
I'm not surprised.

281
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,809
( gasps )

282
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,355
( panting )

283
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,691
So strange.

284
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,192
What?

285
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,779
When I was a child,

286
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,200
I did everything I could
to hide my forehead--

287
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,453
hats, scarves--
you name it.

288
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,581
When I was a kid,

289
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,000
I wore a cap
to cover the haircuts

290
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,793
my father
used to make me get,

291
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,212
first day
of every summer.

292
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,846
I grew up in a colony
on Kessik IV.

293
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,306
My mother and I were
the only Klingons there,

294
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,183
and that was a time

295
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,436
when relations
between the Homeworld

296
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,857
and the Federation
weren't too cordial.

297
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:50,820
Nobody ever said anything,
but...

298
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,614
we were different...

299
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,616
and I didn't like that feeling.

300
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,120
Then...

301
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,750
my father left...

302
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,710
when I was five years old.

303
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,170
( clanking,
indistinct voices )

304
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,298
One day he was there,
and the next, he wasn't.

305
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:15,177
I cried myself to sleep
every night

306
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,263
for months...

307
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,433
but of course,
I never told anybody.

308
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,688
And then I finally decided

309
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,943
that he left because
I looked like a Klingon...

310
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,572
and so I tried to look human.

311
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,996
Looks like you finally got
what you wanted.

312
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,143
Strange.

313
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,394
What is?

314
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,563
According to our last
geological scan,

315
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,982
this cave should continue
straight ahead

316
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,357
for another eight kilometers.

317
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,902
This is solid granite,
more than 50 meters.

318
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,821
If these caves were
changing configuration

319
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,906
while we were here,
we certainly would've felt it.

320
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,199
True, Commander,
but I do not believe

321
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,994
there has been
any tectonic activity.

322
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,663
I believe this wall is
merely an illusion--

323
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,707
a disguised force field.

324
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,917
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>

325
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,543
JANEWAY:
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

326
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,796
We've run into some type
of force field, Captain.

327
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,547
<i>One minute, we were</i>
<i>reading an empty tunnel,</i>

328
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,715
<i>and the next, we walked</i>

329
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,592
right into
a solid wall of rock.

330
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,552
Captain, the energy
configuration

331
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,888
of the force field matrix
is virtually identical

332
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,640
to those used by the Vidiians.

333
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,309
Mr. Ayala...

334
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,895
scan for any alien
vessels in the sector.

335
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,563
Commander, we know
from past experience

336
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,691
that our phasers
can disrupt that force field.

337
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,942
I want to find out
what's in there.

338
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,610
Aye, Captain.

339
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,863
<i>But I don't want you</i>
<i>taking any unnecessary risks.</i>

340
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,032
We'll be standing by to
implement an emergency beam-out.

341
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,574
Acknowledged.

342
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,415
CHAKOTAY:
It's not working, Captain.

343
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,709
Try reconfiguring your phaser

344
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,919
to match the bandwidth
modulation.

345
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,962
Commander!

346
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,798
Three to beam up!

347
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,279
B'Elanna.

348
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,872
How are you feeling today?

349
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,917
I feel strong.

350
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,837
It's very frustrating
to be restrained like this.

351
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,463
I sympathize.

352
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:00,968
I don't like being
chained up like an animal.

353
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,887
I'm sorry.
I wish there was...

354
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,681
I've been thinking about
what you've said.

355
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:11,729
It's because of you
that I am Klingon.

356
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,773
And I do...

357
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,858
like...

358
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,526
this feeling.

359
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,113
In a strange way,

360
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,865
I suppose...

361
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,700
I am grateful.

362
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,619
Did you know

363
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,664
that Klingon females are
renowned in the Alpha Quadrant

364
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,710
not only
for their physical prowess,

365
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,670
but for their...

366
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,258
voracious... sexual

367
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,635
appetites as well?

368
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,889
Why not let your creation
out of her harness?

369
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:51,269
<i>Study</i> her in action.

370
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,979
( gasps quietly )

371
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,110
I wish it were possible,
B'Elanna...

372
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,198
but I'm afraid I can't risk

373
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,993
releasing you just yet.

374
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,832
( quiet panting )

375
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,296
Forgive me.

376
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,755
For what?

377
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,632
Please...

378
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,302
don't condescend.

379
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,346
I may have
a grotesque appearance,

380
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:33,519
but I assure you
my instincts are finely honed,

381
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,272
and I do have feelings.

382
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,114
Hard as it may be
for you to imagine, B'Elanna,

383
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:51,369
my people were once handsome
and vigorous like yours.

384
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,622
And with your help,

385
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,416
we will be again.

386
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,793
Perhaps, when
that time comes...

387
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:04,633
I will not disgust you
quite so much as I do now.

388
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,396
They're coming to take us
to the work detail.

389
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,815
You can't let them see
how sick you are.

390
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,150
Maybe if they
think I'm too weak,

391
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,693
they'll leave me behind.

392
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,778
I could try to get my hands
on that console over there.

393
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,446
Or maybe they'll skip
the preliminaries

394
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,657
and take you straight
to organ processing.

395
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,874
You.

396
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,042
Come with me.

397
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,293
What for?

398
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,254
You asked to contact
your ship.

399
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,797
The Prefect wishes
to discuss your request.

400
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,717
I'm the senior officer here.

401
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:50,388
If your superiors want to talk
with one of us, it should be me.

402
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,306
He's not going
anywhere without me!

403
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,349
Tom, don't.

404
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,600
They'll kill you.

405
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,517
Stop!

406
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,602
( gasps )

407
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,437
It's okay, Tom.

408
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,774
They're the ones
with the guns, remember?

409
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,783
( door opens and closes )

410
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,868
( sniffling )

411
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,874
What is it?

412
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,549
Now that the Vidiians
know we're here,

413
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,176
we have to be prepared
for the possibility

414
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,304
that they'll call in
reinforcements.

415
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:32,805
So far,
long-range sensors

416
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,765
haven't located
any alien vessels near here.

417
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,101
However, it is possible
that the same technology

418
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,519
that disguises
their force fields,
cloaks their ships.

419
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,272
CHAKOTAY:
The other thing
we have to consider

420
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,108
is that the prisoners
may be at greater risk now.

421
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,777
KIM:
Captain, take a look at this.

422
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,070
Using our tricorder data,

423
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,447
I've been able
to scan the entire planet

424
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,906
for the force field signature,

425
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,366
and it looks like
the field surrounds an area

426
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,160
more than 600 kilometers
in circumference.

427
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,245
Is there any way
to scan inside it?

428
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,248
Every reconfiguration
I've tried has failed.

429
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,916
If it's the same kind
of force field

430
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,169
the Vidiians used
the last time we ran into them,

431
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,338
why didn't our
phasers breach it?

432
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:08,590
Apparently, it has been adapted
to repulse phaser fire.

433
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,635
If the Vidiians can move in
and out of there, so can we.

434
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,095
Start setting up
simulations.

435
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,431
Find a way to get through
that force field.

436
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,106
SULAN:
B'Elanna?

437
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,862
I have something
I want to show you.

438
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,746
Durst...

439
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,207
I thought perhaps this new face

440
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,709
would make you
more comfortable with me.

441
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,961
You've killed him.

442
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,380
Yes, B'Elanna,

443
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,008
but his organs will save
more than a dozen lives.

444
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,720
( grunting, snarling )

445
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,809
( choking )

446
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,731
( door opening )

447
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,817
( footsteps approaching )

448
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,115
Deep-level scans
have revealed

449
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,450
a network of microfissures,

450
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,910
minuscule openings
which develop briefly

451
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,204
each time the field
matrix remodulates.

452
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,456
Just how small are
these microfissures?

453
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,750
Less than one micron.

454
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,919
And they close up
within a few seconds.

455
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,837
Would it be possible
to use our phasers

456
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,173
to expand one of these
openings as it's forming?

457
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,925
That was our first thought.

458
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,593
But we realized such an attempt
would have to be at close range

459
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,887
and would carry the risk

460
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,847
of alerting the Vidiians
to our presence.

461
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,433
So then it occurred to us--

462
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,017
if we could narrow
the transporter's energy beam

463
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,936
tightly enough,
it might be possible

464
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,064
to transport one of us
through the microfissures.

465
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,857
Of course,
timing the transport

466
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,777
to the precise moment
of an opening would be critical.

467
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,862
But if we could
get someone inside,

468
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,448
we might be able
to find our people

469
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,824
and also deactivate
the force field.

470
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,201
And then, presumably,

471
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,120
we could beam everyone
back to the ship.

472
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,662
Precisely.

473
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,790
But you should be aware
that because we are incapable

474
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,417
of scanning beyond
the force field,

475
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,043
we will have no way
of communicating

476
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,003
with whoever
transports inside it,

477
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,547
nor will we be able
to verify

478
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,673
that the transport
has been successfully completed.

479
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,927
Moreover, what's to prevent
whoever goes in

480
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,305
from being captured
by the Vidiians?

481
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,807
I have an idea
about that, Captain.

482
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,185
DOCTOR:
Dermal stimulator, please.

483
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,649
Remarkable work, Doctor.

484
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,859
( scoffs )

485
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,194
If you think this
is remarkable,

486
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,029
you should see me
remove a bunion.

487
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,496
I have done my best
to replicate Vidiian attire.

488
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,165
I trust it will prove
sufficiently convincing.

489
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,336
It's a fine piece
of work, Mr. Tuvok.

490
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,795
Next time
I need a tailor,

491
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,589
I'll know just
where to look.

492
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,008
GUARD:
Quickly now!

493
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,222
GUARD:
In there!

494
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,242
Here, B'Elanna.

495
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,494
Sit down.

496
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,877
Here. It's water.

497
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,630
Thanks.

498
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,050
Rest while you can.

499
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,968
The guard won't be back
right away.

500
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,639
Keep it.

501
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,899
Tom...

502
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,192
I've been thinking.

503
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,739
When they did this thing to me,

504
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,617
I think it changed more
than just the way I look.

505
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,369
What do you mean?

506
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:12,918
Back there,
when they took Durst away...

507
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,878
I was...

508
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,672
terrified.

509
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,466
No one could blame you for that.

510
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,843
You don't understand.

511
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,803
I've been in worse situations,

512
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,890
but I've never felt
like that before.

513
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,350
Never.

514
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,893
I mean...

515
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:34,273
my heart was pounding
and my hands were shaking.

516
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,900
I didn't even try to help you.

517
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,485
B'Elanna, I'm no doctor,

518
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,738
but I have to believe
that whatever they did to you

519
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,781
has seriously depleted
your strength.

520
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,408
There's nothing
you could've done.

521
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,119
No, that's not it.

522
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,246
I think that...

523
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,708
when they extracted
my Klingon DNA...

524
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,252
they turned me
into some kind of...

525
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,756
...a coward.

526
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,469
Sometimes fear
can be a good thing.

527
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:07,013
It keeps you from taking
unnecessary chances.

528
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,601
Courage doesn't mean
that you don't have fear.

529
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,228
It means that you've
learned to overcome it.

530
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,356
And I know you can find
the courage to hold on

531
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,151
until we can find a way
out of this place.

532
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,570
GUARD:
What's going on here?

533
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,656
She's ill.
She needed a rest.

534
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,324
If she's too weak, I'll take
her back to the barracks.

535
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,408
TORRES:
That's okay, Tom.

536
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,951
Maybe from there,

537
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,828
I can try to make contact
with the ship.

538
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,380
KIM:
The emitter array has been
initialized, Captain.

539
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,340
Good.

540
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,008
Are you ready,
Mr. Chakotay?

541
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,552
( console beeping )

542
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,970
TUVOK:
Captain, there's an opening

543
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,221
forming in
the force field.

544
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,598
Initiating auto sequence.

545
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,350
Targeting scanners
to match coordinates.

546
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,976
Scanners locked.

547
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,687
On my mark, Mr. Kim.

548
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:57,939
Energize.

549
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,155
Well...

550
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,740
now we wait.

551
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,996
( panting )

552
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,420
Make a sound and
I'll break your neck.

553
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,088
Understand?

554
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,676
I'm looking for my friend,
Tom Paris-- a human male.

555
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:26,760
Have you seen him?

556
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,927
He was here,

557
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,471
but they sent him
to another tunnel.

558
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,723
Which one?

559
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,474
Back that way.

560
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,851
There was another
human with him,

561
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,729
but they took her
back to the barracks.

562
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,522
A human female?

563
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,939
Yeah...

564
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,867
( door opening )

565
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,871
VIDIIAN:
I need your help here.

566
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,882
( door closes )

567
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,067
( console beeps and whirs )

568
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,960
GUARD:
What are you doing?!

569
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,003
Come with us.

570
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,046
Where are you taking me?

571
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,590
For a shower
and a hot meal.

572
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,883
No, please!

573
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,848
( remote beeps )

574
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,422
Wake up,<i> pahtk!</i>

575
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,925
Eat!

576
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,094
What... What is it?

577
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,222
Some rodent I killed.

578
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,768
No. Thanks.

579
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,146
I'm sorry I can't
replicate you a soufflÃ©,

580
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,940
but you need nourishment.

581
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,860
I can't carry you
all the way out of here.

582
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,956
How are we supposed
to escape this place?

583
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,666
There are guards everywhere.

584
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,209
We fight our way out.

585
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,627
Maybe you haven't noticed,

586
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,505
but I'm not exactly
in fighting form.

587
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,091
That's why you need food.
Eat!

588
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,182
So...

589
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,601
you're what's left over

590
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,437
when all the Klingon DNA
is taken out.

591
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,984
Apparently.

592
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,945
If I hadn't come along,

593
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,781
were you just going to waste
away in that prison camp

594
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,533
until they killed you
for your body parts?

595
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,536
Were you too frightened to act?

596
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,205
I was looking
for a way to escape.

597
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,415
Looking!

598
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,667
I'll show you
the way to escape.

599
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,795
This and this.

600
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,631
That's the way you respond
to every situation, isn't it?

601
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,091
If it doesn't work, hit it.

602
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,468
If it's in your way,
knock it down.

603
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,886
( huffs )

604
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,013
No wonder
I got kicked out of the Academy.

605
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,725
For which you should be
eternally grateful.

606
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,518
Well, I'm not.

607
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,729
Your temper has gotten me into
trouble more times than I can...

608
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,440
( sighs )

609
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,483
Listen to me.

610
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,909
Listen to us.

611
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,661
This is ridiculous.

612
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,998
Do you realize that we're each
fighting with our self?

613
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,959
I'm not the one
who's fighting,<i> pahtk.</i>

614
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,752
If I remember correctly,

615
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,922
I'm the one who rescued you
from that prison

616
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,966
and carried you here.

617
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,926
Don't you think

618
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,387
you could at least
acknowledge that?

619
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,723
Can't you even admit

620
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,310
that you won't be able
to get out of here without me?

621
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,313
I don't know that I can
get out of here<i> with</i> you.

622
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,857
Brute force
isn't going to do it.

623
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:35,986
Maybe not!
Maybe we'll die in the attempt,

624
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,737
but that's better
than sitting here

625
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,948
like frightened<i> Tikacats</i>
doing nothing!

626
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,868
There you go again--
out of control.

627
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,828
Just leaping into action

628
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,621
before you think
things through.

629
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,081
Fine! You stay here.
I'm getting out.

630
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,124
No, wait a minute.

631
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,083
That's not what I meant.

632
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,168
I'm sorry.

633
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,962
Please...

634
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,969
Just before...

635
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,470
you rescued me...

636
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,600
I logged onto the
Vidiians' computer system.

637
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,186
I only had a few seconds,

638
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:12,480
but I think I found a way
to access the force field

639
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,608
that's cloaking this place.

640
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,361
With a few minutes more,
I could've deactivated it.

641
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,989
Then<i> Voyager</i>
could get a lock on us.

642
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,323
Beam us back.

643
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,992
Paris, too.

644
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,953
It may not be as exciting

645
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,414
as fighting our way out,

646
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,500
but it stands a much
better chance of working

647
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,546
if... I have your help.

648
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,010
So... you need me.

649
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,391
I can't get back
to that computer without you

650
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,852
and you'll have to cover
for me while I work.

651
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,523
We can't go
to the prison barracks.

652
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,901
There are
too many guards there.

653
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,903
In the lab,
where they were holding me,

654
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,447
there was
a security console.

655
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,573
That's the last place

656
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,117
they would
expect us to be.

657
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,676
They must have taken her
to organ processing.

658
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,678
Tell me how to get there.

659
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,681
Keep your hands
off me!

660
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,225
Whatever you say, Paris,

661
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,602
but I thought you might like
to get out of this place.

662
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,898
Chakotay?

663
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,858
Where are Torres and Durst?

664
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,113
I think
they've been taken

665
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,823
to what the Vidiians
call "organ processing."

666
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,199
GUARD:
You!

667
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,659
Why are you talking
to that prisoner?

668
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,828
I was ordered to take him
to organ processing.

669
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,663
Why wasn't I notified?

670
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,872
I was told you had been.

671
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,168
I've never seen you before.

672
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:59,796
My face was just grafted.

673
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,884
Very well.

674
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,053
Take him, but from now on,

675
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,721
I expect to be
notified in advance

676
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,182
of all transfers.

677
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,516
Yes, sir.

678
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,527
There.

679
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,905
I have to bypass
the security code,

680
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,366
so I can access
the force field grid.

681
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:33,454
Then I'll have a better idea
of what we're dealing with.

682
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,708
That should do it.

683
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,001
( console beeping )

684
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,211
There.

685
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,879
That's what we're up against,

686
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,130
and I think we're...

687
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,756
here.

688
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,841
Can you shut it down?

689
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,343
I'm working on it.

690
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,719
( alarm blaring )

691
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,012
What now?

692
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,097
If they didn't know

693
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,849
we were here before,
they do now.

694
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,478
Take it easy.

695
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,897
I'll be done in a minute.

696
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,151
You're not frightened
anymore,

697
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,944
are you?

698
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,113
Maybe I just don't have time
to think about it.

699
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,743
( grunting )

700
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,952
Are you hurt?

701
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,120
Keep working!

702
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,330
B'Elanna!

703
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,664
Stop.

704
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,458
You're not going to hurt me.

705
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,919
You need me.

706
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:25,840
You're right,
but if you do not surrender,

707
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,842
I will kill her.

708
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,844
Drop it!

709
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,851
Who are you?

710
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,894
That's what I want to know!

711
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,396
It's Chakotay.

712
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,359
I think I've just
about accessed

713
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,443
the force field.

714
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,986
Hurry!

715
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,740
Got it!

716
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,200
There.

717
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,247
Captain, the force field
has been disrupted.

718
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,749
Mr. Kim, can you get a lock
on Commander Chakotay?

719
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,167
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>
Do you read?

720
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,253
Loud and clear, Commander.

721
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,670
I found them, Captain.

722
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,966
No!

723
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,969
No!

724
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:15,140
Three humans and one Klingon
to beam up.

725
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:27,152
PARIS:
She's badly
wounded, Captain.

726
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,194
Beam her to Sick Bay!

727
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,072
Don't. No time.

728
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,456
You showed true courage.

729
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:45,753
It makes my death...
an honorable one.

730
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,943
Using tissue
from your counterpart,

731
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,279
I can replicate
the Klingon DNA.

732
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,780
Then, over the course
of several days,

733
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,657
I'll reintegrate
that genetic material

734
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,075
into your
cellular structure.

735
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,702
Wait a minute--
you're not saying

736
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,371
that you're going
to change me back.

737
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,830
That's precisely
what I'm saying.

738
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,916
Your cells' ability
to synthesize proteins

739
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,669
has been
severely compromised.

740
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,671
You need the Klingon
genes to survive.

741
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,637
So, she's saving my life again.

742
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,097
I'll get started
on the DNA.

743
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,149
How are you doing?

744
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,194
( sighs ):
I'm not sure.

745
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,446
It's been a pretty
strange experience.

746
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,781
I do know

747
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,659
that right now...

748
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,078
the way I am...

749
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:06,418
I'm more at peace with myself
than I've ever been before...

750
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,756
...and that's a good feeling.

751
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,259
But...?

752
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:17,053
I'm incomplete.

753
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,518
It doesn't feel like me.

754
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,940
I guess I've had someone else

755
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,567
living inside of me
for too long

756
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,527
to feel right without her.

757
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,654
I'd have to say that you two
made quite a team down there.

758
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,744
I know.

759
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:46,458
I came to admire
a lot of things about her--

760
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,335
her strength,

761
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,421
her bravery...

762
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:03,099
I guess... I just have
to accept the fact

763
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,977
that I'll spend the rest
of my life fighting with her.

764
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,066
( gentle theme playing )

765
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:04,243
( dramatic theme playing )
