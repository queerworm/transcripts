(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,131
Anything?

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,716
Not really.

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,803
The polyferranide deposits
are contaminated with astiline.

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,805
TUVOK:
Commander, there's
something over here

6
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,349
I think you should see.
Pack it up.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,476
We'll find better quality
somewhere down the line.

8
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:18,769
That line is going
to be cut short

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,562
when our nacelles
burn themselves up

10
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,856
if we don't find it soon.

11
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,273
What have you got,
Lieutenant?

12
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,192
There have been
other visitors

13
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,401
to this moon recently.

14
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,529
What do you
think this is?

15
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,947
Some kind of message?

16
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,753
I don't want you
to go wandering off.

17
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,380
I'm not.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,923
I'm just looking
at something.

19
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,091
Antonio.

A<i> kep-pon-nee.</i>

I was just looking at
a lizard when I saw it.

28
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,445
Well, it was your eyes
that saw it.

29
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,697
No one else's did.

30
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,741
That's the important thing.

31
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,992
Come.

32
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,160
I want you
to understand this.

33
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,957
It's a blessing to the land.

34
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:25,377
An ancient healing symbol.

00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,046
A<i> CHAH-mooz-ee.</i>

36
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,630
They probably cut this down

37
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,424
for firewood.

38
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,217
The Rubber Tree people?

39
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,054
Well, the closest thing to
the Ancient Rubber Tree people

40
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,513
that we'll ever see.

41
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,600
The people in this tribe
are their descendants.

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,810
Just like we are.
(<i> insect buzzing</i> )

43
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,979
But they never left this jungle.

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,941
And they rarely intermarry
with other tribes.

45
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,484
And they still use firewood
instead of magnesite fuel

46
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,778
like everyone else.

47
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:54,031
Chakotay, they've chosen

48
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,490
to live like this
for centuries.

49
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,951
That's why we are
traveling on foot

50
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,827
and not using a transporter.

51
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,662
We honor the Sky Spirits

52
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,499
who led our ancestors
to this sacred land.

53
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,126
Sacred land?

54
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,336
Yes.
Huh.

55
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,173
The Sky Spirits must have taken
a wrong turn somewhere.

56
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,730
Maybe it's
a blessing to the land.

57
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,774
For damaging it
with the campfire.

58
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,191
TUVOK:
What is your basis

59
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,193
for that conclusion,
Commander?

60
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,740
Oh, just...

61
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,659
something somebody told me once.

62
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,233
Describe the nature
of your pain.

63
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,776
In the lower back.

64
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,527
It's tight.

65
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,947
Choose the word that would
best describe your pain.

66
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,865
Burning, throbbing, piercing,

67
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,784
pinching, biting,
stinging, shooting...

68
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,035
Shooting.

69
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,954
It even goes down my legs.

70
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,080
Hmm.

71
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,456
Is the baby
all right?

72
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,749
Hmm? Oh, certainly.

73
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,918
Fine, nothing
to worry about.

74
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,753
Well, that
makes me feel better.

75
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,213
The position of the baby

76
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,257
is simply putting pressure
on your sciatic nerve.

77
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,967
You may return to your post.

78
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:04,805
The pain makes it difficult
to sit for any period of time.

79
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,431
It's really quite
uncomfortable.

80
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,058
Elevating your legs when you sit

81
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,935
should provide
all the relief you need.

82
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,479
Perhaps a day of rest, off-duty.

83
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,814
Mm-mm.

84
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,276
Ensign Wildman, according
to your medical history,

85
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,819
this is your first
pregnancy, correct?

86
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,570
Yes.
Well, Ensign,

87
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,115
unfortunately, pregnancy causes
its fair share of discomforts,

88
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,783
and you'll have
to learn to live with them.

89
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,243
That's just
the way it is.

90
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,287
We'll schedule her
for follow-up in two days.

91
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,330
If the pain has not subsided
on its own by then,

92
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,665
we'll attempt to decrease

93
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,458
the sensitivity
of the nerve in that region.

94
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,793
Thank you, Doctor.

95
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,341
Call me day or night
if this gets any worse.

96
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,932
Don't you have any compassion
for the way she feels?

97
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,226
Every member of this crew
is an adult.

98
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,978
I will not coddle them.

99
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,772
Compassion can be
your department.

100
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,691
Fortunately, you have
enough for both of us.

101
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,568
You've never been
sick or in pain.

102
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,862
I just wish,
once in your life,

103
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,197
you could know
what it's like,

104
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,531
how it makes you
feel vulnerable

105
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,740
and a little afraid.

106
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,366
Then you'd understand.

107
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,206
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

108
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,457
I don't have a life.

109
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,877
I have a program.

110
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,968
I hated every minute of it.

111
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,637
My father had dragged me
all the way from our colony

112
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,389
near the Cardassian border
on this quest of his.

113
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,602
Away from my friends, my home,
and here we were, in the middle

114
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,604
of a brutal Central
American jungle

115
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,982
looking for the descendants
of the Ancient Rubber people.

116
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,109
It must have been
very important to him.

117
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,986
Believe me, it was.
And he was very disappointed

118
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,697
that I didn't
share his enthusiasm.

119
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,825
He'd been tracking down the
origins of our tribe for years.

120
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,915
The one on the right
is the one I found today.

121
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:59,711
And now, something you saw
on that trip years ago,

122
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,922
shows up again
on a moon surface

123
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,799
almost 70,000 light-years away.

124
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,554
I don't suppose
you have any theories

125
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,391
that might explain this.
(<i> sighs</i> )

126
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,975
I can give you

127
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,103
an official Rubber Tree
people theory if you like.

128
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,731
Sky Spirits.

129
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,900
Sky Spirits?

130
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,526
It's an ancient myth.

131
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,696
Sky Spirits from above
created the first Rubber people

132
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,532
in their own image,
and led the way to a sacred land

133
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,618
where the Rubber people
would live for eternity.

134
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,745
You obviously don't
put a great deal of faith

135
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,080
in this explanation.

136
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,539
(<i> sighing</i> )

137
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,833
How much faith do you
put in Adam and Eve?

138
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,168
Hasn't science proved

139
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,670
that all humans developed
from a single

140
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,964
evolutionary
process?

141
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,632
That's what I was always taught.

142
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,801
On the other hand,
none of my teachers

143
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,553
ever spent much time
in the Delta Quadrant.

144
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,140
B'Elanna tells me
we picked up

145
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,434
a warp signature
heading away from the moon.

146
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,851
Think we should follow it?

147
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,770
I don't know that it's fair
for me

148
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,023
to put my own personal curiosity
ahead of the ship's priorities.

149
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,900
We still haven't found
the polyferranide

150
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,526
we need to seal the warp coils.

151
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,488
If these people have warp
technology, they might be able

152
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,781
to help us.

153
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,453
Besides...

154
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:18,581
we are in the business
of exploring, aren't we?

155
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,084
My father would put on
his expedition hat

156
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,752
and shout, "Let's go!"

157
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,879
I guess that's
good enough for me.

158
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,637
(<i> sighing</i> )

159
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,643
Showing no life signs.

160
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,854
Mr. Paris, are you certain
the warp signature ended here?

161
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,772
Positive, Captain.

162
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,192
Harry, check your sensors.

163
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,445
That look like some kind
of power source to you?

164
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,613
That is an unusually
high EM reading

165
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,282
for a natural occurrence.

166
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,159
Could be some kind
of cloaking technology.

167
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,497
Mr. Kim, transmit a continuous
message on all frequencies

168
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,248
identifying who we are,
where we're from

169
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,000
and make it clear
our intentions are peaceful.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,751
<i>Torres to Bridge.</i>
Go ahead.

171
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,170
<i>We're in luck, Captain.</i>

172
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,297
My readings are showing
high concentrations

173
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,883
of polyferranide about ten
kilometers below the surface.

174
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,011
Acknowledged. We'll send an away
team to continue the survey.

175
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,221
Report to Transporter Room 3.

176
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,555
<i>On my way.</i>

177
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,224
Commander,
if we meet any resistance,

178
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,641
abort the mission.

179
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,477
I have no intention
of disturbing an alien race

180
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,811
that would rather
be left alone.

181
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,855
Understood.
On the other hand,

182
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,648
if we can make contact,
our goal

183
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,026
is to get permission to begin
excavation as soon as possible.

184
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,652
Tuvok, you're with me.

185
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,947
Mr. Neelix, please report
to Transporter Room 3

186
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,408
for an away mission.

187
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>I'll meet you there, Commander.</i>

188
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,915
We may be out of luck.

189
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,291
Problem?

190
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,792
I'm not sure
we can transport down.

191
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,003
Every time we try
to lock on to a transport sight,

192
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,672
a storm begins.
Storm?

193
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,175
We've tried seven different
sites and as soon as we lock on,

194
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,344
an electrical storm forms
right above the location.

195
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,887
When we change sites,

196
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,638
a new storm forms
and the old one dissipates.

197
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,599
Might the transporter
beam itself

198
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,269
be causing an electrostatic
charge in the atmosphere?

199
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,062
That's as good a guess as any.

200
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,980
I can't explain it.

201
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,607
We just can't transport.

202
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,234
Fine, we'll take a shuttle.

203
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,036
Once again, the storm
seems to have formed

204
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,329
as a direct result

205
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,914
of our interaction
with the atmosphere.

206
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,083
The meteorological
conditions changed radically

207
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,294
when we began
our entry sequence.

208
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,212
Shields are holding.

209
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,632
(<i> thunder crashes</i> )

210
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,842
It takes more than
a little thunderstorm

211
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,720
to bother one of your mighty
Starfleet ships, huh?

212
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,680
Nothing we can't handle.

213
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,057
Relax, Neelix.

214
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,644
(<i> repeated peals of thunder</i> )

215
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,863
That's why they call it
a rain forest.

216
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,533
(<i> thunder rumbles</i> )

217
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,036
Why do your Sky Spirits
choose a place where it rains

218
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,497
all the time?

219
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,665
And it's hot...

220
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,417
and there are so many bugs?

221
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,880
It's said the Sky Spirits
honored the land above all else.

222
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,551
Maybe it's because this land

223
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,262
yields so many
different kinds of life.

224
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,974
Maybe they wanted us
to become friends

225
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,725
with everything in nature.

226
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,353
Including the bugs.

227
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,686
Sorry, Sky Spirits.

228
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,356
I will never make friends
with bugs.

229
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,607
(<i> insect buzzing</i> )

230
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,150
(<i> slaps leg</i> )

231
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,985
Maybe that's why
they keep biting you.

232
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,781
You're miserable.

233
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,286
It was a mistake to bring you.
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:47,874
I'm sorry I can't be
what you want me to be.

235
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,379
From the day you came
out of your mother...

236
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,381
upside down...

237
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,092
I knew the spirits had
chosen you to be a contrary.

238
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,969
No one chooses for me.

239
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,305
I choose my own way.

240
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,849
And if that makes me a contrary,

241
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,518
I'll have to live with it.

242
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,978
If you have no spirits
to guide you,

243
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,314
I fear you will lose your way.

244
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,946
Altitude: 5,000 meters.

245
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,866
Decreasing speed
to 720 kph.

246
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,661
Entering terminal
approach phase.

247
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,204
TORRES:
Visibility still zero.

248
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,415
Switching
to enhanced terrain scanning.

249
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,375
Touchdown sight scanned.

250
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,710
Continuing descent.

251
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,772
Computer, activate the emergency
medical holographic program.

252
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,818
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

253
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,404
I thought we changed
your program

254
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,615
so you wouldn't have
to say that anymore.

255
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,157
We did.

256
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,326
But I became so uncomfortable
trying to find new ways

257
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,205
to "break the ice," as it were,
that I restored it.

258
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,749
Let's just say it works for me.

259
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,083
(<i> sneezes</i> )

260
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,251
Doctor?

261
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,586
(<i> sniffs</i> )

262
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,296
Ah, you noticed.

263
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,798
Are holograms
supposed to... sneeze?

264
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,217
Generally, no.

265
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,428
But I have accepted
your challenge.

266
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,639
I programmed myself
with the symptoms

267
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,140
of the 29-hour Levodian flu.

268
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,183
Thus I will gain
the experience

269
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,769
that you suggest
would be beneficial

270
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,395
to the performance
of my duties.

271
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,855
(<i> sneezes and sniffs</i> )

272
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,025
Holographic tissue paper
for the holographic runny nose.

273
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,818
Don't offer them to patients.

274
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,907
Mmm, interesting sensation,
blowing one's nose.

275
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,701
It's my first time.

276
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,954
I think this is
very brave of you.

277
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,372
Nothing of the sort.

278
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,916
I intend it to be
an educational experience.

279
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,710
I'm sure you'll learn a lot.

280
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,629
I meant for the crew.

281
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,675
I'm tired of the whiny,
cranky attitudes

282
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:02,883
we see around here.

283
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,218
I intend to serve
as an example

284
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,762
of how one's
life and duties

285
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,888
do not have to be disrupted
by simple illness.

286
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,307
Doc?

287
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,975
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I,

288
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,977
and you don't hear
me complaining.

289
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,697
We are not making any
progress locating the source

290
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,407
of that unusual power
reading, Commander.

291
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,868
Then I guess we'll have
to search for these people

292
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,662
the old-fashioned way--
With our eyes and ears.

293
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,039
Is something bothering you,
Commander?

294
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,792
No, it just reminds me

295
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,877
of another jungle
that I visited once.

296
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,547
The Central American rain forest
on Earth.

297
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,215
It's the only other place
in the universe

298
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,800
that I've ever seen this flower.

299
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,803
It appears to be a rare variety
of<i> Cypriprdium</i>

300
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,430
of the Asiatic genus
<i>Paphiopedilum.</i>

301
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,098
I never knew you had

302
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,853
such horticultural
expertise, Mr. Vulcan.

303
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,814
In fact, I am-- Or, more
accurately, I was--

304
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,858
A breeder of prize
Vulcan orchids.

305
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:04,070
Then we have something
in common-- I breed orchids too!

306
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,197
(<i> laughs</i> )

307
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,700
Don't they make
the most exquisite salad?

308
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,745
A touch of Baldoxic vinegar--
Pure heaven.

309
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,663
I hereby designate
the two of you

310
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,707
the team's
botanical surveyors.

311
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,291
Collect a sample
of that flower.

312
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,335
B'Elanna?

313
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,129
It's just what we've
been looking for.

314
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,798
Almost pure
polyferranide.

315
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,884
But there's a problem
with crust reactivity.

316
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,552
If we can't solve it
before excavation,

317
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,804
we might contaminate
the entire yield.

318
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,348
Have Ensign Kim run an
analysis from the ship.

319
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,893
We should be able to...
(<i> bird cries</i> )

320
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,352
I'll be damned.

321
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,771
What?

322
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,858
It almost looks like
a hawk, doesn't it?

323
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,321
KOLOPAK:
Listen to him, Chakotay.

324
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,782
What does he say to you?

325
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,785
(<i> chuckles</i> )

326
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,829
He says, "You are home."
Huh?

327
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,833
I'm leaving the tribe, Father.

328
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,209
What?

329
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,797
I got to know a lot of
the Starfleet officers

330
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,006
patrolling
the Cardassian border.

331
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,383
I asked Captain Sulu

332
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,886
if he would sponsor me
at Starfleet Academy.

333
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,178
And he would
do such a thing

334
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,847
without even
discussing it with me?

335
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,934
I told him I had your approval.
Ah!

336
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:19,813
I kept him as far away
from you as I could.

337
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,899
I take it you've been
accepted by the Academy.

338
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,573
Well, you've never
fully embraced

339
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,117
the traditions of
our tribe, I know that.

340
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,703
And you've always been curious
about other societies.

341
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,873
And that is why I allowed you
to read about them.

342
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,877
Because I believe that ignorance
is our greatest enemy.

343
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,838
But to leave the tribe...

344
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,923
Our tribe lives in the past.

345
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,508
A past of fantasy and myth.

346
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,468
That past is a part of you,

347
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,095
no matter how hard
you try to reject it.

348
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,474
Other tribes have learned
to accept the 24th century.

349
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,809
Why can't ours?

350
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,730
It is not the place
of a 15-year-old boy

351
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,607
to question the choices
of his tribe.

352
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,900
I know.

353
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,318
That's why
I have to leave.

354
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,362
You will never belong
to that other life.

355
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,281
And if you leave, you will
never belong to this one.

356
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,534
You'll be caught
between worlds.

357
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,077
I ask for your blessing,
Father.

358
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,038
MAN:
<i>Oon-day. Oon-day, Kolopak.</i>

359
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,675
(<i> bird calls</i> )

360
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,764
NEELIX:
<i>Botanical surveyor number one</i>
<i>to Commander Chakotay.</i>

361
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,516
Go ahead, Neelix.

362
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,727
<i>You won't believe what I found.</i>
<i>I think it's...</i>

363
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:45,105
(<i> Neelix shouting, groaning</i> )

364
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,691
(<i> groaning continues</i> )

365
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,984
Neelix, what the...?

366
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,777
The bird, the bird!

367
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,197
(<i> bird calls</i> )

368
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,283
(<i> bird cries</i> )

369
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,583
My eye!

370
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,001
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>

371
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,544
PARIS:
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

372
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,921
Emergency beam-out.

373
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,714
Get Neelix to Sick Bay.

374
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,090
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

375
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,264
Commander.

376
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,514
DOCTOR (<i> hoarsely</i> ):
You're very lucky this bird

377
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,349
didn't snatch your eye
right out of the socket.

378
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,643
(<i> sniffs</i> )

379
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,603
We have no spare Talaxian
eyeballs.

380
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,438
Is something
the matter with him?

381
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,024
The doctor gave himself
the Levodian flu

382
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,358
to see what it's like.

383
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,027
Is he contagious?

384
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,571
It's a holographic simulation,
not an actual virus.

385
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,823
There's no need for concern.

386
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,198
(<i> sniffs</i> )

387
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,492
You may sit up.

388
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,912
Touchy, isn't he? 
He isn't feeling well.

389
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,707
I don't require any compassion,
thank you very much.

390
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:31,504
I have been experiencing these
symptoms for nearly 20 hours,

391
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,674
and I am in complete command
of my faculties.

392
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,717
(<i> sneezes</i> )

393
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,053
You may both leave now.

394
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,572
Mr. Kim believes if
we bombard the crust

395
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,074
with antithoron radiation,

396
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,368
we can decontaminate it
before excavation begins.

397
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,704
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Then all we need to do</i>
<i>is locate these people</i>

398
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,080
<i>and get their permission.</i>

399
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,498
Any progress?

400
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,000
Everything we've found here

401
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,044
suggests the people
who live in this village

402
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,545
left recently and in a hurry.

403
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,881
<i>Do you believe our arrival</i>
<i>frightened them?</i>

404
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,298
We can't discount that.

405
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,051
You'd think with
warp technology,

406
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,804
they would have encountered
other alien life before now.

407
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,222
You'd think
with warp technology,

408
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,724
they wouldn't be living
like this.

409
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,642
<i>Captain, have you had any</i>
<i>unusual readings</i>

410
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,102
<i>that might explain the images</i>

411
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,687
<i>of a strange face</i>
<i>I've been seeing?</i>

412
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,313
Images?

413
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,732
<i>Very odd.</i>

414
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,358
<i>Like the flash of a memory.</i>

415
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,527
<i>But it's someone</i>
<i>I've never met.</i>

416
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,822
Nothing unusual has shown up
on the ship's sensors.

417
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,117
Tuvok hasn't detected
any telepathic activity, either.

418
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,203
If you want to call it a day,
Commander...

419
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,705
No. I think we'll press on
for a while.

420
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,041
If there are any other problems,
I'll let you know.

421
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,375
Chakotay out.

422
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,794
The dwellings
are constructed

423
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,254
with an alloy
polymer matrix

424
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,048
we've never encountered
before, Commander.

425
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,299
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

426
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,760
They're out there.

427
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,303
Our tricorders
may not tell us so,

428
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,931
but they're
out there.

429
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,147
Lay down
your weapons.

430
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,398
Commander?

431
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,192
Disarm-- I want them to see

432
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,319
that we don't pose
any threat to them.

433
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,240
May I remind the Commander
that Starfleet protocol demands

434
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,783
that away teams remain armed

435
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,244
and ready to defend themselves
until contact is...

436
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,495
I know all about
Starfleet protocol, Lieutenant.

437
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,290
As we have not yet established
the inhabitants' intentions,

438
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,167
it would not be
a logical course of action.

439
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,295
The logical course
isn't always the right course.

440
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,297
Lay down your weapons
in plain sight.

441
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,507
Those are my orders.
Would you at least permit me

442
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,009
to advise the Captain
to move the ship

443
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,803
into a stronger
tactical position?

444
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,096
Negative.

445
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:48,182
We'll show no force of any kind.

446
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:52,228
For the record, I must take
exception to these orders.

447
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,896
Noted.

448
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,447
They have reason to be scared.

449
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,241
Who can blame them?

450
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:10,121
Their history, our history,
is filled with conquerors

451
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,539
who brought slavery
and disease and death.

452
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,333
Maybe we should
just leave them alone.

I honor the sacred land

464
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,446
I have come very far
to find you, my cousins.

465
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:15,996
How do you know our language?

466
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:23,170
It is the language
of my ancestors...

467
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,636
We are of the same hand.

00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,026
I have no explanation,
Commander!

471
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,487
There is no storm activity
indicated.

472
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,156
All right, let's get back
to the shuttle.

473
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,090
Hey! Wait!

We will never make it!

477
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,976
Where's Chakotay?

00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,895
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>

00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,230
Emergency beam-out.

480
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,375
He was right behind us.

481
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,168
I don't understand
what could have happened.

482
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,504
Was he wearing the combadge
the last time you saw him?

483
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,964
Just before the storm, he was
using it to speak with you.

484
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,175
Mr. Paris, what are the current
surface conditions

485
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,927
near the shuttle?
Surface conditions

486
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,303
are back to normal, Captain.

487
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,722
Winds two knots, but...

488
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,474
I can't find any sign
of their shuttle.

489
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,184
It's not where
they landed it.

490
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,685
And it isn't airborne?

491
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,854
No, ma'am.
I'll lead the away team back.

492
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,440
Mr. Tuvok, Lieutenant,
you're with me.

493
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,606
Mr. Paris, you have...

494
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,067
(<i> hoarsely</i> ):
<i>Captain Janeway,</i>

00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,318

What is it, Doctor?

499
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,868
<i>Something terrible</i>
<i>has happened.</i>

502
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,164
Doctor, I think you're carrying

503
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,833
this experiment of yours
a little too far.

504
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,669
<i>One hour too far,</i>
<i>to be precise.</i>

505
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:13,466
<i>I very specifically programmed</i>
<i>a 29-hour Levodian flu.</i>

506
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,469
<i>And it has now been 30 hours.</i>

507
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,471
Doctor, I'm sorry, but we have
more pressing matters...

508
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,680
<i>You can't leave me like this.</i>
<i>I need help.</i>

509
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,933
Now. Get me somebody
who can tweak the computer

510
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,726
and make me feel
better, immediately.

511
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,480
(<i> coughing</i> )

512
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,440
Very well.

513
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,275
Mr. Kim is on his way.

514
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,526
Try to relax, Doctor.

515
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,487
I'll see to
that, Captain.

516
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,196
I'm going to need you
with me, Kes.

517
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,574
Prepare a medkit and bring it
with you to Transporter Room 3.

518
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,034
Commander Chakotay is still on
the surface and may be injured.

Oh, I don't understand it.

522
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,378
I... I ran
a computer diagnostic

523
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:55,257
and it said
that my program was fine.

524
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,384
Just rest, Doctor.

525
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,180
Here's a cool,

526
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,556

527
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,724
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

528
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,478
Please don't go yet.

529
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,895
I have to.
The Captain...

00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,648
I feel like
I'm fading,

531
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,816
just... fading away.

532
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,943
You don't know what
that means to a hologram.

533
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,445
What seems to be
the problem?

534
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,821
(<i> groaning</i> )

535
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,365
My simulated virus

536
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:23,118
is leading me
to a simulated death.

537
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,662
It's nothing
to worry about.

538
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,206
I just added a couple of hours
to his computer program.

539
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,292
He'll be fine
in about 45 minutes.

540
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,337
Knowing when it would end

541
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,922
didn't exactly make it
a fair test, did it, Doctor?

542
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,097
(<i> groaning</i> )

543
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:49,102
Oh, she is far more devious
than I ever suspected.

544
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,398
(<i> coughing</i> )

545
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,457
(<i> sighs</i> )

546
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,028
No shuttle.

547
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,406
Well, at least
they got out okay.

548
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,095
You have nothing
to fear from me.

549
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,474
Talk to me.

550
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,933
Let me see you.

551
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,610
Make our cousins one with us!

552
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,905
(<i> laughing</i> )

553
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,658
<i>Is-to ko-hee-nis.</i>

554
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,242
No!

555
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,577
Thank you.

556
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,431
He is one of us!

557
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,808
(<i> chuckling</i> )

558
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,201
You have nothing
to fear from me.

559
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,413
Talk to me.

560
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,707
Let me see you.

561
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,938
I don't understand it.

562
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,273
It's the same thing
that happened

563
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,941
the first time
we tried to go down.

564
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,026
A storm develops wherever
we try to lock on.

565
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,528
Why would we have
the ability

566
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,782
to beam people up,
but not to beam them down?

567
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,117
I believe we have seen enough
to discern a pattern, Captain.

568
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,536
The logical conclusion
is that someone is controlling

569
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,038
the elements of nature
to ward us off.

570
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,499
The transporter anomaly is
evidence of this conclusion.

571
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,167
We are allowed
to leave the planet,

572
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,586
but not to approach.

573
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,337
If that's true,
I'd be happy

574
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,840
to respect their wishes,
but, unfortunately,

575
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,842
I have a missing crewman
to get back first.

576
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,968
Janeway to Paris.

577
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,678
Yes, Captain.
<i>Mr. Paris,</i>

578
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,472
<i>we're going to land</i>
Voyager<i> on the surface.</i>

579
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,056
<i>Take us into the atmosphere.</i>

580
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,975
Acknowledged.

581
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,518
Beginning entry sequence.

582
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,574
I'm reading electrical storms
forming all around us.

583
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,409
Adjusting flight path.

584
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,245
The barometric pressure
is continuing to fall.

585
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,290
We're looking
at monsoon conditions out there.

586
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,124
Mr. Paris, the shuttle crew
didn't report

587
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,126
turbulence this severe
during their landing.

588
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,628
I'm doing the best
I can, Captain.

589
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,214
I'm showing gale force
winds out there.

590
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,632
It is conceivable
that the aliens

591
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,467
have been able
to intensify their response

592
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,761
now that they are familiar
with our capabilities.

593
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,055
Red Alert!

594
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,974
Inertial dampers
are off-line.

595
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,019
We seem to be caught
in some kind of vortex.

596
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,187
I can't maintain altitude.

597
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,480
Captain, it's a cyclone.

598
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,787
Altitude 20,000 meters
and falling.

599
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,664
I can't get us out
of this thing, Captain.

600
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,750
Bridge to Torres. We need more
power from the engines.

601
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,626
I've got them running
20 percent

602
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,961
over rated maximum, Captain.

603
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,588
It's not enough.

604
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,548
Could we go to low warp
under these conditions?

605
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,717
The ship might make it
without inertial dampers,

606
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,386
but we'd all just be stains
on the back wall.

607
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,889
I can try to augment the engines

608
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,058
with power from the auxiliary
fusion reactors,

609
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,226
but it's going to take
at least 20 minutes.

610
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,144
How much time do we have,
Mr. Paris?

611
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,272
Altitude at 18,000 meters
and falling.

612
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,983
At this rate, we're looking
at about ten minutes.

613
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,511
If you can hear me, speak to me.

614
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,351
ALIEN:
<i>Dosh-du-pah kee-ne?</i>

615
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:49,106
<i>Swasge-muh kee-say-yo-pah?</i>

616
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,732
<i>Swas-ti-ma-hay.</i>

617
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,358
<i>Kee-say-yo-pah.</i>

618
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:56,780
ALIEN:
<i>Pah-kee-ne?</i>
<i>Sas-ga no-yo-du no-kay-dah?</i>

619
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,740
I'm sorry.

620
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,910
I don't know the ancient
language of my people.

621
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,412
I can't understand.

622
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,791
<i>Po-kud-zee yo-atah.</i>

623
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,835

COMPUTER:
Warning. Approach vector
is too steep.

631
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,094
Discontinue landing sequence.

632
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,013
Would somebody
turn that off, please?

633
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,389
Engineering, report.

634
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,225
<i>We need that extra power,</i>
<i>B'Elanna.</i>

635
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,019
Ten minutes.

636
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,395
I just need

637
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,064
<i>ten minutes!</i>

638
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,992
Do you understand
my words now?

639
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,411
Yes.

640
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,580
Explain the face marking.

641
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,290
I wear it to honor my father.

642
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,585
He wore it
to honor his ancestors.

643
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,670
Ancestors...

644
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,173
You are human?
Yes.

645
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,800
Are there others on your
world with this mark?

646
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,094
Yes.

647
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,553
Not many, but some.

648
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,889
We were taught all of them
had been annihilated.

649
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:49,101
We were taught your
world had been ravaged

650
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:52,687
by those with no respect
for life or land.

651
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,107
There was a time
when that was true.

652
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:58,193
But no longer.

653
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,904
He claims to be a descendent
of the Inheritors.

654
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,489
(<i> muttering</i> )
Inheritors?

655
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,330
The ones...
our ancestors chose to honor.

656
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,833
I'm surprised you have no memory

657
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,877
of the Inheritors.

658
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,755
One of our gifts
was the memory.

659
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,383
If you are a descendent,
you should remember.

660
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,846
I'm not sure I understand.

661
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,183
Perhaps it has
been lost over time.

662
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,647
45,000 years ago,

663
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,483
<i>on our first visit</i>
<i>to your world,</i>

664
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,527
<i>we met a small group</i>
<i>of nomadic hunters.</i>

665
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,613
<i>They had no spoken language,</i>

666
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,492
<i>no culture, except the use</i>
<i>of fire and stone weapons,</i>

667
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,912
<i>but they did have</i>
<i>a respect for the land</i>

668
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:55,625
<i>and for other living creatures</i>
<i>that impressed us deeply.</i>

669
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,253
<i>We decided</i>
<i>to give them an inheritance--</i>

670
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,005
<i>A genetic bonding--</i>

671
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,508
<i>So they might thrive</i>
<i>and protect your world.</i>

672
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:07,095
<i>On subsequent visits,</i>
<i>we found that our genetic gift</i>

673
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,348
<i>brought about a spirit</i>
<i>of curiosity and adventure.</i>

674
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,392
<i>It impelled them to migrate</i>
<i>away from the cold climate</i>

675
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,645
<i>to a new, unpeopled land.</i>

676
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,814
<i>It took them almost</i>
<i>a thousand generations</i>

677
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,732
<i>to cross your planet.</i>

678
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,819
<i>Hundreds of thousands of them</i>
<i>flourished in their new land.</i>

679
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,113
<i>Their civilization</i>
<i>had a profound influence</i>

680
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,115
<i>on others of your species.</i>

681
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,243
<i>But then new people came</i>
<i>with weapons</i>

682
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,162
and disease.

683
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,791
The Inheritors who
survived scattered.

684
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,336
Many sought refuge
in other societies.

685
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,754
12 generations ago
when we returned,

686
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,507
we found no sign
of their existence.

687
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,761
My people called you
the Sky Spirits.

688
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,517
Why have you been hiding from us
since we landed here?

689
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,519
When we heard your message,

690
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,273
who you were, observed
you probing our land,

691
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,359
we believed you were a threat.

692
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,361
We thought you
would annihilate us

693
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,154
as you had
the Inheritors.

694
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,032
Our message was supposed to
communicate peaceful intentions.

695
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,201
We were taught that is the way

696
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,912
human conquerors
often introduce themselves.

697
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,455
As I said...

698
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,416
we've tried to change our ways

699
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,377
since the last time
you stopped by.

700
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,882
Altitude: 2,000 meters.

701
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,175
Stand by, Bridge.

702
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,594
We're initiating
the transfer now.

703
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,471
I'm showing an eight percent
boost in the engines.

704
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,224
That's all?

705
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,934
The fusion reactors
are nearly drained.

706
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,519
Fighting the storm is taking
every reserve we have.

707
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,313
Altitude: 1,000 meters.

708
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,190
Impact in 20 seconds.

709
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,524
B'Elanna.

710
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,028
KIM:
<i>Impact in 15 seconds.</i>

711
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,323
I'm sorry, Captain,
that's all we've got.

712
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,120
Impact in ten seconds.

713
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,211
Report.

714
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,130
We're free.

715
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,589
Gaining altitude.

716
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,967
2,000 meters.

00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,970
2,500.
Dampers back on line.

718
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,223
The storms have
completely dissipated.

719
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,435
There's not a cloud in the sky.

720
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,023
Stand down Red Alert.

721
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,275
Anybody have

722
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,068
an explanation?

723
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,070
TUVOK:
It appears the inhabitants
of this planet

724
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,613
have decided
to make contact, Captain.

725
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,698
The cloaking device
has been turned off,

726
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,576
and we are showing
an alien population.

727
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,787
I have located the shuttle.

728
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,789
It may be possible
to locate Commander Chakotay

729
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,124
without landing.

730
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,210
Establish a search pattern,
Mr. Paris.

731
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,544
Yes, Captain.

732
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,464
Begin scanning
for human life signs.

733
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:51,009
As soon as you find Chakotay,
we'll send down an away team.

734
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,263
(<i> sighing</i> )

735
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,474
My ship will be coming
for me soon.

736
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,892
I'm sorry we cannot permit you

737
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,645
to extract all the materials
you need.

738
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,274
You were generous
to offer as much as you did.

739
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,568
You have a long journey ahead.

740
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,197
It took us
more than two generations

741
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,449
to reach your world.

742
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,041
I wish I could see
my father's face right now.

743
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,917
Does he still live?

744
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,171
No.

745
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,424
He died fighting enemies

746
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,551
who would have
taken our home colony.

747
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,429
Our tribe moved there
a few hundred years ago.

748
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:41,393
So he honored the land
just as... his ancestors did.

749
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,063
Yes.

750
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,647
Yes, he did.

751
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,738
We weren't on very good terms
when he died.

752
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,823
Once he was gone, I didn't know

753
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,159
how to reconcile
our differences,

754
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,578
how to heal our old wounds.

755
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,288
I returned to my colony,

756
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,457
and continued the fight
in his name.

757
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:08,461
I took the mark that he wore
to honor his ancestors.

758
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,672
I spoke to him
in my vision quests,

759
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,009
but he never answered.

760
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,886
Until now.

761
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,700
<i>CHAH-mooz-ee.</i>

762
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,582
Commander.

763
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,589
Put those away.

764
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,443
(<i> bird calls</i> )

765
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,488
KOLOPAK:
<i>Listen to him, Chakotay.</i>

766
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:19,198
<i>Do you hear</i>
<i>what he says to you?</i>

767
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,618
Yes, Father.

768
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:23,119
I hear him.

769
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,582
I finally hear him.

770
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,767
