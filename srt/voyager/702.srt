00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:07,424
[Janeway]
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 54129.4.</i>

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,302
<i>It's a bittersweet day</i>
<i>for the crew of</i> Voyager.

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:14,306
<i>We've finally found a home</i>
<i>for some of our most precious cargo.</i>

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,560
Thank you again for taking care of them,
Captain. We're very grateful.

5
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,606
We're just glad Rebi and Azan will have
a chance to grow up with their own people

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,317
and that you've been kind enough
to let Mezoti join them.

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:32,115
-You can still come with us.
-And you can still stay on <i>Voyager.</i>

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,993
Adapting to your absence
will be difficult.

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,704
I'll miss you, too.

10
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,667
It's time.

11
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,004
I've been studying all available data
relevant to this species,

12
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,464
as you recommended.

13
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,509
Familiarizing yourself with their culture
will help you adapt.

14
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,054
On Wysanti, it's customary
not to say good-bye, but...

15
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,723
I think I prefer the human way.

16
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,083
Energize.

17
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,264
We should deactivate
the children's alcoves.

18
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,682
Right now?

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,100
They're a drain
on <i>Voyager's </i>power reserves.

20
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,771
Is there a problem?

21
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:49,860
It just seems like... an insufficient
amount of time has passed.

22
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,864
You're having an emotional response
to the children's departure.

23
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,950
They'll be fine.
We should be happy for them.

24
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:57,868
Seven?

25
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,620
Yes?

26
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,205
You're crying.

27
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,962
My ocular implant must be malfunctioning.

28
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,491
Crying is nothing
to be ashamed of, Seven.

29
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,160
You should have seen me
the first time I heard

30
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,579
Puccini's <i>Tosca</i> in the holodeck.

31
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:10,083
-I sobbed through the entire third act.
-You're a hologram. You can't cry.

32
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,503
Ordinarily, but Lieutenant Torres
enhanced my emotional subroutines,

33
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,423
so I could truly appreciate
the performance.

34
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,801
Then your reaction was the result
of a technological enhancement,

35
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,096
just as mine was the result
of a technological malfunction.

36
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,849
Saying good-bye to the children
was a traumatic experience.

37
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,809
Crying was a normal response.

38
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,896
Except that I was in complete control
of my emotions.

39
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,106
[beeping]

40
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,488
Hmm. It seems I owe you an apology.

41
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,865
According to this,
your tears were the result of a glitch

42
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,034
in your primary cortical node.

43
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,578
Have you experienced
any other malfunctions lately?

44
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,622
Headache? Dizziness?
Diminished motor function?

45
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,290
No.

46
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,459
Really?

47
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,504
Then you won't mind if I check
the bio-monitors in your alcove,

48
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,297
just to be sure?

49
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,635
-I've experienced an occasional headache.
-Why didn't you come to see me?

50
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,054
The malfunctions have
not affected my work.

51
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,517
Seven, if you're having problems,
you need to let me know.

52
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,395
If it'll make you feel better,
I'll be more forthcoming in the future.

53
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,939
You're all heart.

54
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,444
I'll schedule some follow-up tests
and make my report to the captain.

55
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,321
I'd prefer to keep this between us.

56
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,657
I don't want to worry the captain.

57
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,034
We've always kept her informed
of your medical needs.

58
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,162
It was my understanding
that all members of this crew

59
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,915
have the right
to doctor-patient confidentiality.

60
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:38,171
If you want to keep this between us,
that's where it'll stay.

61
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,261
[door opens, closes]

62
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,399
[door opens]

63
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,529
Have you finished charting
the nebula in Sector 949?

64
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,323
Several hours ago.

65
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,540
I've been thinking.

66
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,252
While I'm grateful for the opportunity
to assist you in Astrometrics,

67
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,130
I'd like to take on
more challenging assignments.

68
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,967
-I can assign you additional diagnostics.
-That's not what I meant.

69
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,387
-I want to work on the Bridge.
-You don't have the proper training.

70
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,892
That's why I'd like to take
the entrance exam for Starfleet Academy.

71
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,479
I could forward it to Earth
in the next datastream transmission.

72
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,066
If I pass, I could take the basic classes
from Commander Tuvok.

73
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,069
He was an instructor at the Academy.

74
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,489
-Your plan is ambitious.
-Then you think it's a good idea?

75
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:52,120
You could take the classes with me.
Earn your own commission.

76
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,040
I believe I've already assimilated
enough Starfleet training.

77
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,334
I'll need a letter of recommendation
from the captain.

78
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,835
I'll speak to her.

79
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,596
I have work to complete in the cargo bay.
Can you finish here?

80
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,348
Of course.

81
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,517
[door opens]

82
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,863
Computer, initiate regeneration cycle.

83
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,200
-[beeping]
-[computer]<i> Unable to comply.</i>

84
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,120
-Why?
<i>-The interface is incompatible.</i>

85
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,333
-Run a diagnostic of Alcove 01.
-[beeping]

86
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:43,672
<i>Diagnostic complete. Alcove 01</i>
<i>is operating within normal parameters.</i>

87
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,009
-Initiate regeneration cycle.
-[beeping]

88
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,554
<i>-Unable to comply.</i>
-Clarify.

89
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,974
<i>Your cortical node is malfunctioning.</i>

90
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,984
[door opens]

91
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,946
Seven! I didn't see you.

92
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,533
-I was just leaving.
-Before breakfast?

93
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,160
-What time is it?
-0500.

94
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,123
Don't tell me you've been here all night.

95
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,001
I was unable to regenerate.

96
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,086
Anything on your mind?

97
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,297
My alcove is malfunctioning.

98
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,842
Well, you should ask B'Elanna
to take a look at it.

99
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,468
I didn't want to wake her.

100
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,848
-What's all this?
-Nutritional supplements.

101
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,933
-[sniffs]
-I thought they would compensate.

102
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,102
Your own recipe?

103
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,188
It's a mixture of metabolic enzymes
and protein extract.

104
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,524
Let me make you
one of my Talaxian omelets.

105
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,027
It may not have as many enzymes,
but it'll taste better.

106
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,320
That won't be necessary.

107
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,198
I think I'll take your advice
and wake Lieu...

108
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,658
Lieutenant...

109
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,162
Seven!

110
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,295
Neelix to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

111
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,061
You lost consciousness in the Mess Hall.

112
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,858
Your body's begun to reject your implants.

113
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm afraid it's a result of that glitch
we found in your cortical node.

114
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,906
Apparently, it's more serious
than we thought.

115
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,119
The node is destabilizing.

116
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,164
It's no longer able
to regulate your implants.

117
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,500
They're shutting down one by one.

118
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,797
When you've disconnected implants
in the past, I've always adapted.

119
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,424
Minor implants.

120
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,552
An assimilation tubule here,
a few nanoprobes there...

121
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,472
Nothing crucial to your human physiology,

122
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,100
but these implants control
your vital functions.

123
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:04,604
And without my cortical node
to regulate them, I'll die. Correct?

124
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,781
Borg technology is highly adaptive.

125
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,784
My cortical node
will repair itself in time.

126
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:22,288
I don't think so, Seven. If anything,
the deterioration is accelerating.

127
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,334
-You'll have to stay here for observation.
-I think I've been sufficiently observed.

128
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,044
Would you excuse us, please?

129
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,218
I'm sorry for what's happening.
You have every right to be angry,

130
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,054
but that isn't going to help us
solve this problem.

131
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,973
The node will correct itself.

132
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,101
Suppose it doesn't,
for the sake of argument.

133
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,397
-Is it possible to replicate a new one?
-The technology is too complex.

134
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,612
What if this had happened
when you were part of the collective?

135
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,698
How would the Borg have
repaired the damage?

136
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,160
They wouldn't have.

137
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,496
Trying to repair a node
would be a futile exercise.

138
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,165
The Borg would simply replace it.

139
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,672
Harry, we passed a Borg debris field
six or seven days ago,

140
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,592
just outside the Yontasa Expanse.

141
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,468
See if you can find it
on long-range sensors.

142
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,553
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,849
It's not every day we go looking
for the Borg. What's up?

144
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,268
Seven needs a new cortical node.

145
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,561
Captain, need I remind you?

146
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,522
The Borg often return
to salvage damaged cubes.

147
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,357
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

148
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,318
I want to help Seven as much as anyone,

149
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,196
but if we're not careful,
we'll all end up with cortical nodes.

150
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,406
That's why I'm taking the <i>Flyer</i> alone.

151
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,408
I've located the debris field.

152
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,162
Transmit the coordinates to the <i>Flyer.</i>
You have the Bridge, Commander.

153
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,164
With all due respect...

154
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,167
the last time you took the <i>Delta Flyer</i>
to confront the Borg,

155
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,127
it ended up in a couple thousand pieces.

156
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,712
I intend to bring it back
in one piece this time.

157
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,090
A good pilot might be able
to help you do that.

158
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,844
Particularly if he's accompanied
by an experienced tactical officer.

159
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,930
You shouldn't do this
by yourself, Captain.

160
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,810
[sighs] Well, then, gentlemen,
I guess you're with me.

161
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,736
Captain.

162
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,572
I'll meet you in the Shuttle Bay.

163
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,409
-Have you talked to Seven?
-Just a few minutes ago.

164
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,788
-Then you don't approve.
-Of what?

165
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,249
-My request.
-Request?

166
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,795
I'm sure Seven will discuss it with you
when she has the chance.

167
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,754
I'm sorry I bothered you.

168
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,841
Obviously, no one's told you.

169
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,803
-Told me what?
-Seven isn't well.

170
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,514
What's wrong with her?

171
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,641
Her cortical node is failing.

172
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,018
Her cortical node?

173
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,520
She's going to die.

174
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,230
Not if we find a new node.

175
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,773
We're on our way to search
a Borg debris field.

176
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,194
I have experience in Borg technology.
Let me come with you.

177
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,280
I appreciate the offer,
but it's too dangerous.

178
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,408
-I'm willing to take the risk.
-I'm not willing to let you.

179
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,494
I'll let you know how we did
as soon as we're back.

180
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,996
Don't worry.

181
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,801
Seven?

182
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,017
Why are you here?

183
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,228
-The captain told me you were ill.
-I'm fine.

184
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,439
Then why are you in Sick Bay?

185
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,734
That's not your concern. You have work
to complete. Report to Astrometrics.

186
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,528
-I've finished my work.
-Then I'll assign you more.

187
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,489
-Is there a problem?
-I wish to be alone.

188
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,242
Come with me, please.

189
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,499
[sighs]

190
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,919
-Why is she so angry with me?
-She's not angry with you.

191
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,921
She's just angry.

192
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,506
I don't understand.

193
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,009
It's a common response
to serious illness.

194
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,763
She's frustrated to be confined,
embarrassed to appear vulnerable.

195
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,058
She shouldn't be embarrassed
in front of me. I'm her friend.

196
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,726
And her pupil.

197
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,146
She doesn't want you or anyone else
to see her when she's not at her best.

198
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,982
-It's not her fault that she's sick.
-Of course not,

199
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,152
but we have to allow her
to deal with this in her own way,

200
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,112
with as much dignity as possible.

201
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,323
Give her time.

202
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,117
She may decide she wants company,
and if she does,

203
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,952
you're the first person I'll call.

204
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,640
I have isolated a section that contains
the bodies of approximately 37 drones.

205
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,393
Thirty-seven doesn't sound
approximate to me.

206
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:57,772
These drones were killed in an explosion.
There are only a few left intact.

207
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,650
Looks like there's still
a breathable atmosphere inside.

208
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,319
Any sign of active Borg ships
in the vicinity?

209
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,988
-Nothing on sensors.
-Huh. That could change in a hurry.

210
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,574
-Run continuous scans.
-Yes, ma'am.

211
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,354
[tricorder beeping insistently]

212
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,441
Tuvok, here.

213
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,152
Help me get this off him.

214
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,207
[tricorder beeping]

215
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,835
No apparent damage
to the cortical node.

216
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,841
[Paris on communicator]
<i>Captain, you've got company.</i>

217
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,843
<i>There's a ship...</i>
[drowned out by static]

218
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,638
Two to beam out.

219
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,807
<i>Delta Flyer,</i> respond.

220
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,644
[tricorder beeping]

221
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,313
Three humanoids have just
transported aboard this vessel.

222
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,858
-Drones?
-The only drones here are dead.

223
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,027
They belong to us.

224
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,324
Who are you?

225
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,327
Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Starship <i>Voyager.</i>

226
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,080
This is my debris field, Captain.

227
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,290
We weren't aware of that.

228
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,752
-What have you taken?
-A cortical node.

229
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:29,465
-We need it to save one of my crew.
-Everything here belongs to us.

230
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,387
Put down your weapons and I'll consider
not activating this laser scalpel.

231
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,681
[both grunt]

232
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,516
[groans]

233
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,184
[screams]

234
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,623
Sorry about the delay.
They knocked our transporters off-line.

235
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,139
I need you at tactical!

236
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,641
When I bring us around,
target their engine core.

237
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,101
Aye, sir.

238
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,239
-Nice shot.
-[beeping]

239
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,116
They're breaking pursuit.

240
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,622
[beeping]

241
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,636
May I ask what you're doing?

242
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,847
Your filing system is inefficient.
I'm implementing a new one.

243
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,807
You should be in bed.

244
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,101
Delivery for Seven of Nine.

245
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:08,356
Tarcanian wildflowers.
Cheery, don't you think?

246
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:13,235
Ah. Well, if you prefer gladiolas,
I could go back to the Airponics Bay.

247
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,820
That won't be necessary, Mr. Neelix.

248
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,157
The flowers are lovely,
aren't they, Seven?

249
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,244
Thank you. I'll admire them later.

250
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,122
Actually, I thought I'd stay
and keep you company.

251
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,543
Seven prefers not to have
visitors right now.

252
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,588
Not even a visitor
with a Kadis-Kot board?

253
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,840
-Correct.
-But it's your favorite game.

254
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,637
Personally, I can't blame her.

255
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,682
-You're being extremely insensitive.
-I am?

256
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,559
You know perfectly very well
Seven is in a weakened state.

257
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,812
She wouldn't stand a chance against you.

258
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,483
You're right.
I don't know what I was thinking.

259
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,444
We'll play later
when you're feeling up to it.

260
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,322
-Green.
-I beg your pardon?

261
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,867
I prefer the green pieces.
You'll use red.

262
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,038
-Doctor, do you think she's up to it?
-As long as you go easy on her.

263
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,582
-[intercom beeps]
<i>-Janeway to the Doctor.</i>

264
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,210
-Yes, Captain.
<i>-We're back and we have the node.</i>

265
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,319
I'm ready to disengage
the damaged node.

266
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,239
Transfer Seven's cortical functions
to the computer.

267
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,741
Understood.

268
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,787
Done.

269
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,831
Initiating the extraction.

270
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,097
-[beeping]
-Vital functions are stable.

271
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,557
-[Doctor] Time?
-Twenty seconds.

272
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,854
Not yet. I have to realign
her primary neurodes first.

273
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,315
[alarm beeping]

274
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,650
The computer can't maintain
her cortical functions much longer.

275
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,570
Ready.

276
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,582
Her neural relays are going
to destabilize in ten seconds.

277
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,833
-Nine...
-Almost finished.

278
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:37,671
...eight, seven, six, five...

279
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,341
Transfer Seven's cortical functions
to the new node.

280
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,136
[alarm beeping]

281
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,348
-Something's wrong.
-She's going into anaphylactic shock.

282
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,975
Her implants aren't adapting.
They're rejecting the new node.

283
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,020
-[alarm beeping]
-She's losing synaptic cohesion.

284
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,482
Apply a 20 millijoule
neurostatic pulse on my mark.

285
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,401
Now!

286
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,112
[steady, continuous tone]

287
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,781
-No effect.
-Again!

288
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,076
[steady, continuous tone]

289
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,162
Increase the pulse. 30 millijoules.

290
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,756
Computer, end simulation.

291
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,134
-[sighs]
-Why did you stop?

292
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,470
-It wasn't working.
-Run it again.

293
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,931
Captain, this was our 12th simulation.

294
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,975
Something tells me 13
won't be our lucky number.

295
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,561
The salvaged node has
been inactive too long.

296
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,939
Then we'll find one that hasn't.

297
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,277
No matter how many
debris fields we sift through,

298
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,529
a node from a dead drone
isn't going to work.

299
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,363
Who said anything about a dead drone?

300
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,992
-What's that supposed to mean?
-We've infiltrated Borg vessels before.

301
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,160
If that's what it's going to take
to save Seven, we'll do it again.

302
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,246
Are you suggesting ending
one life to save another?

303
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,207
-I'm not giving up on her.
-Neither am I!

304
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,419
I'll do everything
in my power to help her,

305
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,673
but we both have to face the possibility
that it may not be enough.

306
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,309
Red. Grid 13-3.

307
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,855
They should have finished
the simulation by now.

308
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,650
I'm sure they'll let you know
as soon as they do. Your move.

309
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,153
Don't you have more important
duties to attend to?

310
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,905
Nothing that can't wait.

311
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,575
Despite what the Doctor told you,
I feel perfectly fine.

312
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,828
Really? Because it looks to me
like you're about to lose.

313
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,168
Kadis-Kot.

314
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,837
I should have seen that coming.

315
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,797
Oh, well, that makes what...

316
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,799
sixteen to three, your lead?

317
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,010
Sixteen to two.

318
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,638
-Oh, my mistake.
-[door opens]

319
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:57,686
Oh, uh... well, I should really see
how things are going in the Mess Hall,

320
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,856
but I'll be back later for a rematch.

321
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,274
Are you ready to proceed?

322
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,198
According to the simulations,
the salvaged node isn't going to work.

323
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,448
I'm sorry.

324
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,701
[Doctor] I'm still researching
alternative treatments,

325
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,412
and Harry and B'Elanna are going
to try to repair the faulty node

326
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,123
using components from your alcove.

327
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,625
They'll fail.

328
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,298
We're not giving up hope.
Neither should you.

329
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,721
With your permission,
I'd like to return to my duties.

330
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,099
That's not possible.
I need to monitor your condition.

331
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,602
-Captain?
-I'm afraid I have to defer to the Doctor.

332
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,691
If you'd like, I can ask Icheb
to bring some of your work here.

333
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,675
Doctor?

334
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,262
Computer, locate the Doctor.

335
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,598
-[computer] <i>The EMH is off-line.</i>
-Activate the EMH.

336
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,434
...forced to sedate you!

337
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,185
Doctor?

338
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,563
I'm sorry, Icheb.
I wasn't talking to you.

339
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,690
-Where's Seven?
-I wish I knew.

340
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,402
When I refused to release her,
she overrode my autonomy protocols,

341
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,738
in the middle of a sentence, no less.

342
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,198
Computer, locate Seven of Nine.

343
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,533
[computer]
<i>Seven of Nine is in Sick Bay.</i>

344
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,249
[sighs]

345
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,130
He's looking for you...

346
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,049
the Doctor.

347
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,550
I ran into him in the corridor.

348
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,598
He's about 30 seconds away
from calling a shipwide alert.

349
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,557
Are you going to tell him where I am?

350
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,310
Nope.

351
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,146
I know what it's like
to be stuck in Sick Bay.

352
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,982
I've escaped the Doctor myself
once or twice.

353
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,902
Thank you.

354
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,236
Anytime.

355
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,199
Lieutenant...

356
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,163
When you die...

357
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,416
do you believe your spirit
will go to <i>Sto-Vo-Kor</i>?

358
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,002
You shouldn't be thinking about dying.

359
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,837
According to the Doctor's simulations,

360
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,091
any attempt to adapt
the salvaged node will fail.

361
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,435
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor,</i> Lieutenant...

362
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,562
do you believe you'll go there?

363
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:52,820
I guess it all depends
on how... honorable my death is.

364
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,281
But you do believe
there's something after death?

365
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,867
I hope so.

366
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,875
What about you?

367
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,880
The Borg have no concept
of an afterlife.

368
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:16,093
However, when a drone is deactivated,

369
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:20,597
its memories continue to reside
in the collective's consciousness.

370
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,226
As long as the hive exists,

371
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,854
so will a part of that drone.

372
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,440
You don't seem to take
much comfort in that.

373
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:36,155
My link to the collective has been severed
for nearly four years.

374
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,616
If I die,

375
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,577
everything that
I've accomplished in that time,

376
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,580
everything I achieved
as an individual,

377
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,914
will be lost.

378
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,667
My memories, my experiences...

379
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,380
It will be as if they...

380
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,635
as if I never existed.

381
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:10,022
I think... you're a little more memorable
than you're giving yourself credit for.

382
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,193
You don't need the collective
to validate your existence.

383
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,779
You've made an impact
on every member of this crew.

384
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,240
That's your legacy.

385
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,576
[door opens]

386
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,120
[Doctor]
There you are.

387
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,540
I should have known
she'd be the one to harbor a fugitive.

388
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,627
We difficult patients
need to stick together.

389
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,796
I want you to return
to Sick Bay immediately.

390
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,882
Have you devised a new treatment?

391
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,926
Not yet.

392
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,595
Then it's best that I don't
distract you from finding one.

393
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,056
Seven, if you continue to exert yourself,

394
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,017
your condition will
only deteriorate more rapidly.

395
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,894
Is that what you want?

396
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,271
What I want is to be useful.

397
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,734
I really could use her help.

398
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,153
I promise not to let her overdo it.

399
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,741
You can stay,

400
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,743
provided you wear this cortical monitor.

401
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,463
-Thank you.
-[door opens, closes]

402
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,985
Are you feeling better?

403
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,445
My condition is unchanged.

404
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:49,037
I've spoken to the captain about your
desire to apply to Starfleet Academy.

405
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,873
She's agreed to administer
the entrance exam

406
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,042
before we send
the next datastream to Earth.

407
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,298
It's a list of crewmen
who can help you study.

408
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,136
Lieutenant Torres is extremely
well-versed in warp mechanics.

409
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,556
Ensign Kim claims to have aced
the quantum theory section.

410
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,516
What about astrometrics?

411
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,813
You know more about astrometrics
than most Starfleet officers.

412
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,066
Still, I'll need someone
to review the material with me.

413
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,277
I'll ask Lieutenant Paris
to set aside some time.

414
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,653
I'd rather study with you.

415
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,412
You've become too dependent on me.
You must learn to rely on others.

416
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,206
-And if I don't want to?
-What you want is irrelevant.

417
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,459
Why are you acting like this?

418
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,378
-Is it because you think you're dying?
-I am dying.

419
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,511
-I'm sorry.
-You may have given up...

420
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,096
but I haven't.

421
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,928
[Icheb]
I know how to save her.

422
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,013
I'm certainly open to suggestions.

423
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,974
I've been analyzing
the simulations you performed.

424
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,853
They failed because you tried to implement
a cortical node from a dead drone.

425
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,940
-That's correct.
-What you require is a live drone.

426
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,025
I've already been through that
with Captain Janeway.

427
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,111
My cortical node is operational.

428
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,114
I want you to remove it
and give it to Seven.

429
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,074
Absolutely not!

430
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,035
-Well, at least review my research.
-It may as well be a suicide note.

431
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,829
-I don't agree.
-Well, that's comforting.

432
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,581
You took these scans of me
when I left the collective.

433
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,500
By your own estimation,

434
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,337
I emerged from my maturation chamber
before I was fully assimilated.

435
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,424
As a result, my physiology
is less dependent on my implants.

436
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,926
They still regulate
many of your vital functions.

437
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,010
What about my age?

438
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,681
I'm younger, so it should be easier
for my body to adapt to the loss.

439
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,016
You're obviously too young
to understand the risks involved.

440
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,144
I understand the risks perfectly.

441
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,646
If we continue to do nothing,
Seven will die.

442
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,731
And if we proceed with your idea,
you could both die!

443
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,943
According to my research,
there's an 86.9% chance

444
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,487
that Seven's implants
will adapt to my node.

445
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,573
-Eighty-six--?
-Point nine.

446
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,202
And what about you?

447
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,830
Without a cortical node,
how will you regulate your implants?

448
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,417
You should be able to compensate
with genetic resequencing.

449
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,838
This isn't suicide, Doctor.
I believe it can work.

450
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,507
All I ask is that you consider it.

451
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,725
[door opens]

452
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:01,438
Earth's biggest ditch.
That's what my father used to call it.

453
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,232
We hiked the north rim
when I was nine.

454
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,318
It's an impressive geological formation.

455
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,779
Too dusty. I've always preferred
farm country myself.

456
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:16,411
Bloomington, Indiana,
your hometown.

457
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,664
You've mentioned it
on several occasions.

458
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,583
So, what do you think?

459
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,336
It appears to be
a pleasant environment.

460
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,214
When we get to Earth,
I'll take you there.

461
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,467
It's more likely this crew
will reach Earth without me.

462
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,843
You don't know that.

463
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,140
You refuse to acknowledge
the severity of my condition,

464
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,767
just as I did at first.

465
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,770
Are you giving up?

466
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,439
I'm merely accepting reality.

467
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,194
If I'd accepted reality six years ago,

468
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,197
I'd have settled on the first
M-Class planet we came across.

469
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,951
Instead, I'm 30,000 light-years closer
to Bloomington, Indiana.

470
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,245
Minus several members of your crew.

471
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,166
Ensign Marie Kaplan,

472
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,294
Ensign Lyndsay Ballard,
Crewman Timothy Lang...

473
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,629
Is there a point to this?

474
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,424
Every person on this list
died under your command.

475
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:15,095
You accepted their deaths...

476
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,389
but I don't believe you'll accept mine.

477
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,643
-That's presumptuous.
-I'm not being egotistical.

478
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,062
On the contrary,
I'm trying to make a point.

479
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,355
Which is?

480
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:33,905
All of these crew members came to <i>Voyager</i>
with unique personalities...

481
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,075
but I have required
your constant assistance

482
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,910
to develop my individuality.

483
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,705
-And you've come a long way.
-But not far enough.

484
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:47,085
I've disappointed you.
You feel your task is incomplete.

485
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,880
That's why my death will be
difficult for you to accept.

486
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,092
Is that what you think?

487
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,971
That you haven't lived up
to my expectations?

488
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,765
Clearly, I haven't...

489
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,269
but I want you to know...

490
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,188
that the failure has been mine,
not yours.

491
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,734
You haven't failed, Seven.

492
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,447
You've exceeded my expectations.

493
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,701
You've become an individual,
an extraordinary individual.

494
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,038
If I'm having trouble
accepting your condition,

495
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,373
it's only because
I don't want to lose a friend.

496
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,503
-[intercom beeps]
<i>-Doctor to the captain.</i>

497
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,089
<i>I need to see you and Seven right away.</i>

498
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,802
[Janeway]
It would be a complicated procedure.

499
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,305
-No doubt.
-But you believe it'll work.

500
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,225
There are significant risks involved,
to Seven and Icheb,

501
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,978
but if you're asking me if it's possible,
I'd have to say yes.

502
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,188
What sort of precautions--?

503
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,441
No matter how many precautions you take,
it's not worth the risk to Icheb.

504
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,567
Seven, this could work.

505
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,028
I'm not willing to extend my life
at the cost of yours.

506
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,613
But you haven't reviewed all of the data.

507
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:01,242
As long as there is any chance
you won't survive, the data is irrelevant.

508
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,996
-I'd like to return to Sick Bay now.
-As you wish.

509
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,877
-[door opens]
-You're the captain.

510
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,422
-You could order her to do it.
-I have to respect her wishes.

511
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,299
Even if it kills her?

512
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:19,260
I want to help her
just as much as you do.

513
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,013
If that were true,
you wouldn't let her die.

514
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,435
[door opens, closes]

515
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,151
Is there anything I can bring
from the Cargo Bay

516
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,904
to make you feel more at home?

517
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,614
No, thank you.

518
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:43,368
Something from the Mess Hall?
A piece of fruit?

519
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,787
Are you offering me my last meal?

520
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,165
I... of course not.
Is that what you thought?

521
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,419
I was attempting to lighten the mood.

522
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,088
Ah, yes. [chuckles]
Well done.

523
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,923
-[intercom beeps]
<i>-Icheb to the Doctor.</i>

524
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,634
<i>Report to Cargo Bay 2 immediately.</i>

525
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,845
-He's persistent.
-Not to worry.

526
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,724
I'll make it clear to him
that persistence is futile.

527
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,731
[door opens, closes]

528
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,067
You were summoned, too?

529
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,988
Icheb doesn't seem to have grasped
the chain of command yet.

530
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,740
Remind you of anyone we know?

531
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,242
Icheb!

532
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,375
-He's disengaged his cortical node!
-How?

533
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,127
My alcove...

534
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,297
I programmed it
to disconnect my neural relays.

535
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,924
-Can you reconnect them?
-He's locked me out of the controls.

536
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,301
How could you do this?

537
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,220
It was the only way I could
prove to you that it would work.

538
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,902
What's wrong with him?

539
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,905
Icheb decided to perform
a little operation on himself.

540
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,741
You have to reconnect
his node immediately.

541
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,618
-I intend to.
-No.

542
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,787
If Seven can refuse treatment, so can I.

543
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,580
We don't have time for this.

544
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,750
Check your scans.
You'll see I'm already adapting.

545
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,627
Some of your implants
have adapted, but not all.

546
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,004
Then apply the resequencing
technique I researched.

547
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,923
This debate is pointless.
I won't accept the node.

548
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,092
-And I won't keep it.
-Someone had better use the damn thing.

549
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,638
If it stays disconnected much longer,
it won't do either of you any good.

550
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,682
-You're acting like a child.
-I'm trying to save your life.

551
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,726
Only because you've grown
too dependent on me.

552
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,937
So, you think I need to learn
to rely on other people?

553
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,688
-Yes.
-What about you?

554
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,525
You've refused to rely
on a single member of this crew.

555
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,485
You hid your condition
from the rest of us.

556
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,364
You deactivated the Doctor,
and now you're rejecting my help.

557
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,866
You're the one who needs
to rely on others.

558
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,245
Isn't that what people on this ship do?
They help each other?

559
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,247
Whenever we can.

560
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,499
If the captain were dying,

561
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,876
you'd risk your life to save her,
wouldn't you?

562
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,419
And when you respond
to a distress call,

563
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,839
you're risking the life
of everyone on this ship

564
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,174
to respond to the aid of strangers.

565
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,679
-He's right.
-Captain, he's just a child.

566
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,390
I don't think he is.

567
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,725
Not anymore.

568
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,726
Doctor.

569
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,479
Don't look at me.

570
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,650
Please. Just let us help you.

571
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,585
Let's begin.

572
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,470
Good morning.

573
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,849
-How long have I been regenerating?
-Six days.

574
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,812
We needed to make sure your implants
had completely adapted to the new node.

575
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,981
The good news is, they have.

576
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,110
Icheb.

577
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,950
His road to recovery has been
a little bumpier than yours.

578
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,703
Has he suffered
any permanent damage?

579
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,454
I don't think so.

580
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,083
He's been experiencing some pain,
but I believe it's temporary.

581
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,585
Pain I caused him.

582
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,921
Pain he was willing to endure.

583
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,772
You've recovered.

584
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,358
I expect the same from you.

585
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,988
The Doctor wants
to keep me here another week,

586
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:16,743
but I'm sure I'll be back on my feet
in half that time.

587
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,956
I suggest you get as much rest as you can.
You're going to need it.

588
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:23,958
Why?

589
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,085
I've decided to help you prepare

590
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,172
for the astrometrics portion
of the Academy exam.

591
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,468
You can expect a rigorous
and grueling schedule.

592
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,100
-Seven...
-Yes.

593
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:45,313
Your ocular implant...
it's malfunctioning again.

594
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,072
Actually, it's functioning perfectly.
