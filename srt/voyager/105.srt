1
00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:06,131
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG, STARDATE</i>
<i>48532.4.</i>

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>WE'RE ON OUR WAY</i>
<i>TO A ROGUE PLANETOID</i>

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,844
<i>WHICH MR. NEELIX TELLS US</i>

4
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,304
<i>IS AN EXTREMELY RICH SOURCE</i>
<i>OF RAW DILITHIUM.</i>

5
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,682
<i>IF HE'S RIGHT,</i>
<i>THIS COULD GO A LONG WAY</i>

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,351
<i>TOWARD EASING</i>
<i>OUR POWER SHORTAGE.</i>

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,103
ASSUMING WE DO FIND DILITHIUM
ON THIS PLANETOID

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,772
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
A REFINING FACILITY

9
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,482
ON THE SHIP
TO PROCESS IT.

10
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,150
LIEUTENANT TORRES
HAS ALREADY ASKED PERMISSION

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,401
TO START MODIFICATIONS

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,154
TO THE AUXILIARY
IMPULSE REACTOR.

13
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:33,283
IT COULD BE CONVERTED INTO
A CRUDE DILITHIUM REFINERY.

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,327
THE IMPULSE REACTOR?

15
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,037
SOMETIMES I THINK B'ELANNA
GOES OUT OF HER WAY

16
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,289
TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT IGNORE
STARFLEET PROCEDURES.

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,041
HER ARGUMENTS ARE
QUITE CONVINCING.

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,918
SHE THINKS
IT CAN BE DONE SAFELY.

19
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,378
I'M SURE IT CAN.

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,421
TELL HER I WANT
REGULAR REPORTS
ON HER PROGRESS

21
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,883
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

22
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,343
ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T
JOIN ME FOR BREAKFAST?

23
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,095
I WAS THINKING
OF HAVING EGGS BENEDICT

24
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,892
WITH ASPARAGUS,
STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM...

25
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,021
I SAID I WAS
THINKING ABOUT IT.

26
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,523
I'M ACTUALLY HAVING
RATION PACK NUMBER FIVE--

27
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,901
STEWED TOMATOES
WITH DEHYDRATED EGGS.

28
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,402
MMM, SOUNDS DELICIOUS

29
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,195
BUT I'VE ALREADY HAD
MY VACUUM-PACKED OATMEAL

30
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,364
THIS MORNING.
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE BRIDGE.

31
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,964
HERE YOU ARE.
HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.

32
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,549
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

33
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,091
CAPTAIN, YOU CAUGHT ME
BY SURPRISE.

34
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,385
I COULD SAY THE SAME THING.

35
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,929
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,556
I KNOW HOW YOU AND THE
OTHER... SENIOR OFFICERS

37
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,933
HAVE BEEN, EXCUSE ME,

38
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,809
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RATIONS
LATELY

39
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,562
SO I THOUGHT I'D USE
A FEW OF THE VEGETABLES

40
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,691
FROM THE HYDROPONICS BAY
AND WHIP UP A LITTLE BREAKFAST.

41
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,359
YOU HAVE TURNED THIS
INTO A GALLEY?

42
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,028
IT WASN'T EASY.

43
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,989
I HAD TO COMPLETELY RE-ROUTE
THE MESS HALL POWER CONDUITS

44
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,117
AND SCROUNGE A LOT OF SUPPLIES
FROM ALL OVER THE SHIP

45
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,121
BUT THAT'S MY SPECIALTY--
MAKING SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING.

46
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,206
I KNOW IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
MUCH NOW, BUT IN A FEW DAYS

47
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,459
YOU'LL SWEAR THERE'D BEEN
A GALLEY HERE FOR YEARS.

48
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,335
CAREFUL, THAT ONE IS
A LITTLE SPICY.

49
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,755
NEELIX...
WHO APPROVED THIS?

50
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,382
UH, WELL... NO ONE.

51
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,097
WELL, YOU MIGHT HAVE
ASKED ME FIRST.

52
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,641
THIS USED TO BE
MY PRIVATE DINING ROOM.

53
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,392
YOUR DINING ROOM?

54
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,228
IF YOU HAD CHECKED THE SHIP'S
DIRECTORY, YOU'D HAVE NOTICED

55
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,522
THAT CABIN 125-ALPHA, DECK TWO

56
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,524
IS DESIGNATED AS THE CAPTAIN'S
PRIVATE DINING ROOM.

57
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:34,989
OH... THEN I GUESS THAT
YOU'LL BE WANTING ME

58
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,740
TO MOVE ALL OF THIS STUFF
OUT OF YOUR WAY?

59
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,241
Chakotay:
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

60
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,618
GO AHEAD.
We're approaching

61
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,911
the rogue planetoid, Captain.

62
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,203
ON MY WAY.

63
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,455
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME.

64
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,001
WE WILL DEAL
WITH THIS LATER.

65
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,586
ENSIGN PARSONS, WOULD YOU MIND
KEEPING AN EYE ON THINGS

66
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,464
UNTIL I GET BACK...
AND ROTATE THE DARVOT FRITTERS

67
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,674
EVERY TEN MINUTES

68
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,634
UNTIL THEY TURN
A DEEP CHARTREUSE.

69
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,137
AND REMEMBER--
ONE TO A CUSTOMER.

70
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,557
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?

71
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,560
WE'RE PICKING UP DEFINITE
DILITHIUM SIGNATURES, CAPTAIN.

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,813
THE STRONGEST READINGS
ARE ORIGINATING FROM TEN

73
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,857
TO 20 KILOMETERS
INSIDE THE PLANETOID.

74
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,152
IT ALSO LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A
SERIES OF SUBTERRANEAN CAVES

75
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,611
WITH AN OXYGEN-NITROGEN
ATMOSPHERE.

76
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,822
CLASS M. IT WILL MAKE MINING
A LOT EASIER

77
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,657
IF WE CAN GO IN
WITHOUT ENVIRONMENTAL SUITS.

78
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,242
HOW MUCH DILITHIUM
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

79
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,787
IT'S HARD
TO GET A PRECISE READING.

80
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,582
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM 500
TO 1,000 METRIC TONS.

81
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,250
JUST AS I SAID.

82
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,837
I BET THERE'S A FEW
YALLITIAN ENGINEERS

83
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,755
WHO'D GIVE ALL THREE
OF THEIR SPINAL COLUMNS

84
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,050
TO KNOW WHERE THIS PLANET IS.

85
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,635
COMMANDER, TAKE AN AWAY TEAM
DOWN INTO THOSE CAVES AND DO

86
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,721
A PRELIMINARY GEOLOGICAL
ANALYSIS.

87
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,099
LIEUTENANT, YOU'D BETTER GET
YOUR DILITHIUM REFINERY ON-LINE.

88
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,934
IT'LL BE READY TO GO
IN THREE DAYS.

89
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,644
ENSIGN KIM.

90
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,025
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

91
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,275
WITH YOU.

92
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,527
I'VE BEEN STUDYING

93
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,362
MY TRICORDER
OPERATIONS MANUAL.

94
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,073
LIEUTENANT TORRES HAS
BROUGHT ME UP-TO-DATE

95
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:02,492
ON DILITHIUM GEOPHYSICS.

96
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,912
I'VE BEEN PREPARING
FOR THIS MISSION ALL WEEK.

97
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,209
VERY WELL, MR. NEELIX.

98
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,336
I THINK YOU'LL FIND ME
EXTREMELY HELPFUL, COMMANDER.

99
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,630
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
THAT I FLEW PAST THIS PLANET.

100
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,882
IT WAS ABOUT
THREE YEARS AGO...

101
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,967
Kim:
DECK FOUR.

102
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,971
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE SEVERAL
LARGE DEPOSITS

103
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,932
IN THIS GENERAL VICINITY.

104
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,018
LET'S SPLIT UP AND BEGIN TAKING
GEOLOGICAL SCANS.

105
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,771
KEEP YOUR COM CHANNELS
OPEN AT ALL TIMES

106
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,106
AND DON'T WANDER TOO FAR.

107
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,607
STAY WITHIN
A 50-METER RADIUS

108
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,234
OF THIS POSITION.

109
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,990
CHAKOTAY TO KIM.
Go ahead.

110
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,910
I'M STILL PICKING UP
DILITHIUM SIGNATURES,

111
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,872
BUT THERE ARE NO
DILITHIUM FORMATIONS HERE.

112
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,124
HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING YET?

113
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,751
I'M RUNNING A GEO-STRATAL
ANALYSIS OF THE ROCK

114
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,294
IN THIS VICINITY.

115
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,296
BUT SO FAR, THERE'S NO
INDICATION OF ANY DILITHIUM.

116
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,506
Keep looking.

117
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,633
NEELIX TO COMMANDER CHAKOTAY.

118
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,510
Go ahead.

119
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,807
I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING.

120
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:19,647
A LARGE CAVERN APPROXIMATELY
20 METERS FROM MY POSITION.

121
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,483
I'M READING A HUGE
DILITHIUM FORMATION THERE.

122
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,860
Don't go any further, Neelix.

123
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,571
STAY WITHIN THE SEARCH RADIUS.

124
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,198
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.

125
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,158
BUT IT'S RIGHT HERE!

126
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:36,539
I'M IN THE CAVERN NOW,
COMMANDER, BUT...

127
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,795
Let me guess. Nothing there?

129
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,090
NOT SO MUCH AS A SLIVER
OF DILITHIUM.

130
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,341
AND YET
ACCORDING TO MY READINGS

131
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,677
I SHOULD BE SURROUNDED BY IT.

132
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,138
ALL RIGHT, I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF THIS.

133
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,889
KIM, NEELIX, WE'RE HEADING
BACK TO THE SHIP.

134
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,142
Rendezvous with the...
WAIT A MINUTE.

135
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,894
I'M GETTING UNUSUAL READINGS

136
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,521
FROM THIS ROCK FACE.

137
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,941
TRACES OF ORGANIC ENERGY.

138
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,362
LOOKS LIKE
A BIO-ELECTRICAL SIGNATURE.

139
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,115
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ALIVE

140
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,951
DOWN HERE.

141
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:18,290
IT'S ABOUT TWO METERS
INTO THIS ROCK FACE.

142
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,375
Chakotay:
Neelix, I said get back here.

143
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,632
Neelix, did you hear
what I said?

144
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,926
JUST ONE MINUTE, COMMANDER.

145
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,856
HELLO?

146
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,359
IS THERE SOMEONE THERE?

147
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,693
HELLO?

148
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,947
I KNOW THERE'S SOMEBODY...

149
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,742
(<i> screaming</i> )

150
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,455
NEELIX, WHAT'S WRONG?

151
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,707
NEELIX!

152
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,958
KIM!

153
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,626
I'M ON MY WAY, SIR.

154
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,548
I CAN'T BE SURE, BUT I THINK
HE'S GOING INTO SHOCK.

155
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,343
CHAKOTAY TO<i> VOYAGER--</i>
<i>MEDICAL EMERGENCY.</i>

156
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,969
BEAM US DIRECTLY
TO SICK BAY.

157
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,649
GET THE BLOOD-GAS INFUSER.
THE WHAT?

158
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:31,238
EQUIPMENT STORAGE UNIT TWO--
SECOND SHELF ON THE LEFT, NOW.

159
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,531
HOLD HIM STILL.

160
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,576
WHAT'S HAPPENING, DOCTOR?

161
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,994
HE'S GOING INTO A COMA.

162
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,332
THE INFUSER WILL KEEP
HIS OXYGEN LEVEL STABLE

163
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,419
FOR THE NEXT HOUR OR SO,
BUT AFTER THAT HE'LL DIE.

164
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,295
HIS LUNGS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

165
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,594
BY THE TIME WE GOT TO HIM,
HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS.

166
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,431
HOW COULD ANYONE REMOVE
HIS ORGANS SO QUICKLY?

167
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,681
THE DOCTOR SAYS
WHOEVER DID THIS

168
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,308
USED SOME KIND OF TRANSPORTER

169
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,769
TO BEAM THE LUNGS
DIRECTLY OUT OF HIS BODY.

170
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,687
WHAT HAPPENED?

171
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,940
IT APPEARS THAT NEELIX
WAS ATTACKED.

172
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,150
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENED

173
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,905
BUT SOMEONE HAS SURGICALLY
REMOVED HIS LUNGS.

174
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,865
DID YOU FIND ANY EVIDENCE
OF THE LIFE SIGN

175
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,784
THAT NEELIX REPORTED?
NO.

176
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,370
CAPTAIN, I'VE ANALYZED THE
SENSOR LOGS FROM NEELIX'S
TRICORDER.

177
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,873
THE BIO-SCANNER PICKED UP
A SINGLE CLASS-THREE
HUMANOID ORGANISM.

178
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:28,669
THE BLOOD-GAS INFUSER
WILL KEEP HIM ALIVE
FOR ANOTHER 47 MINUTES.

179
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,547
THE ONLY CHANCE FOR HIS SURVIVAL
I SEE AT THE MOMENT

180
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,424
IS TO GET HIS OWN LUNGS BACK.

181
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,384
CAN'T WE FIT HIM WITH A PAIR OF
ARTIFICIAL LUNGS?

182
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,553
HIS RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
IS DIRECTLY LINKED

183
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,763
TO MULTIPLE POINTS
ALONG HIS SPINAL COLUMN.

184
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,432
IT'S TOO COMPLEX
TO REPLICATE.

185
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,225
I MAY BE ABLE TO SURGICALLY
REATTACH THE ORGANS

186
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,935
IF WE GET THEM BACK.

187
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,854
IN THE MEANTIME, I'LL HAVE
TO SEARCH FOR OTHER OPTIONS.

188
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,691
COMMANDER, I'M TAKING
AN AWAY TEAM BACK TO THE PLANET.

189
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,360
YOU'RE IN CHARGE
UNTIL WE RETURN.

190
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,778
INFORM MR. TUVOK
I WANT THREE

191
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,030
ARMED SECURITY
DETACHMENTS TO ACCOMPANY US.

192
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,408
ISSUE TYPE-THREE PHASERS.
MR. PARIS,

193
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,910
DID THEY TEACH YOU HOW TO RUN
A RESPIRATORY SERIES

194
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,955
IN YOUR BIOCHEMISTRY CLASSES
AT THE ACADEMY?

195
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,416
NO, I'M AFRAID THEY DIDN'T.

196
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,876
FINE. I'LL RUN IT MYSELF.

197
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,296
GET ME A PULMONARY SCANNER.

198
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,880
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK
YOU TO LEAVE.

199
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,132
I'M NOT LEAVING.

200
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,635
ALL RIGHT. JUST KEEP
OUT OF THE WAY.

201
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,680
HERE IT IS. THIS IS WHERE
NEELIX WAS STANDING

202
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,974
WHEN HE WAS ATTACKED.

203
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,434
ACCORDING TO
HIS TRICORDER LOG

204
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,893
HE WAS SCANNING
THIS ROCK FACE

205
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,562
WHEN HE DETECTED
THE LIFE SIGN.

206
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,105
NEELIX SAID THERE
WAS A LIFE SIGN

207
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,359
TWO METERS BEHIND THIS WALL.

208
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,986
BUT MY TRICORDER SAYS
THERE'S NOTHING BUT SOLID ROCK

209
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,405
FOR ANOTHER 15 METERS.

210
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,282
IT SOUNDS LIKE OUR TRICORDERS
AREN'T GIVING THE REAL PICTURE

211
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,201
BEHIND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

212
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,994
WAIT A MINUTE.

213
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,579
THE ROCK IS WARMER HERE.

214
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,206
YOU'RE RIGHT, CAPTAIN.

215
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,041
A TWO-DEGREE DIFFERENTIAL
IN THIS SECTION OF THE WALL.

216
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,210
THERE ARE NO NATURAL
GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA

217
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,463
THAT COULD BE CREATING
THIS HEAT SOURCE.

218
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,382
LET'S MAKE A LITTLE HEAT
OF OUR OWN.

219
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,766
Tuvok:
THERE WAS A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED
FORCE FIELD IN PLACE.

220
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,102
THERE'S A CHAMBER DOWN
THIS CORRIDOR.

221
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:22,116
DOC, I THINK HIS CELLULAR
TOXICITY LEVEL IS RISING.

222
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,993
IT'S UP TO 32 PERCENT.

223
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,453
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
STABILIZE THOSE LEVELS.

224
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,081
GET ME A CYTOPLASMIC
STIMULATOR.

225
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,084
WE DON'T HAVE ONE.

226
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,419
THEN REPLICATE ONE.

227
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,212
YEAH.

228
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,511
THE DESIGN SCHEMATICS ARE IN
THE SHIP'S MEDICAL DATABASE.

229
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,761
RIGHT.

230
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,182
THE MAN DRIVES
A 700,000-TON STARSHIP

231
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,268
SO SOMEBODY THINKS
HE'D MAKE A GOOD MEDIC.

232
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,103
I CAN SURVIVE WITH ONE
LUNG, CAN'T I?

233
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,105
WHAT IF I DONATED
A LUNG TO NEELIX?

234
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,107
A TRANSPLANT
IS NOT AN OPTION.

235
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,193
NO ONE ABOARD IS A COMPATIBLE
MATCH FOR A TALAXIAN.

236
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,028
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
A COMPLETELY NEW WAY

237
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,905
TO OXYGENATE
HIS BLOOD SUPPLY

238
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,824
AND RELAY NEURO-ELECTRICAL
IMPULSES.

239
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,040
OUR REPLICATORS
CAN'T REPRODUCE

240
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,833
COMPATIBLE ARTIFICIAL
ORGANS FOR HIM

241
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,921
BUT MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
TO MIMIC THEIR FUNCTIONS

242
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,133
AND GIVE US DIRECT CONTROL
OF HIS RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.

243
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,052
COMPUTER, IS THERE AN
IDENTIFICATION MATRIX

244
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,971
ON MR. NEELIX FROM THE LAST TIME
HE USED THE TRANSPORTER?

245
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,432
Affirmative.
TRANSFER IT TO CONSOLE FOUR.

246
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,146
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IM USING THE TRANSPORTER MATRIX

247
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,814
TO GET EXACT SPECIFICATIONS
FOR NEELIX'S LUNGS.

248
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,025
I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID
WE CAN'T REPLICATE HIS LUNGS.

249
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:43,573
WE CAN'T, BUT IF I CAN
RECONFIGURE MY EMITTER ARRAY

250
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,824
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO CREATE
A PAIR OF HOLOGRAPHIC LUNGS

251
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,868
FOR MR. NEELIX.

252
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,537
HOLOGRAPHIC LUNGS?

253
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,205
IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL,
WE CAN PRECISELY CONTROL

254
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,083
HIS PULMONARY FUNCTIONS
TO ALLOW NORMAL BREATHING.

255
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,673
BUT A HOLOGRAM IS JUST
A PROJECTION OF LIGHT

256
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,923
HELD IN A MAGNETIC
CONTAINMENT FIELD.

257
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,841
THERE'S NO REAL MATTER
INVOLVED.

258
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,679
NOW...

259
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,766
YOU HIT ME.

260
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,437
THE MAGNETIC
CONTAINMENT FIELD

261
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,356
THAT CREATES THE ILLUSION
OF MY BODY

262
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,025
CAN BE MODULATED TO ALLOW
MATTER TO PASS THROUGH IT

263
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,945
OR... BE STOPPED.

264
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,823
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO MODULATE
THE HOLOGRAPHIC LUNGS

265
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:25,990
IN THE SAME WAY,

266
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,701
ALLOWING OXYGEN
AND CARBON DIOXIDE

267
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,286
TO PASS FROM THE LUNGS
THE BLOODSTREAM.

268
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,871
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS.

269
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,414
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO TO HIM?

270
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,915
THERE'S NO TIME TO EXPLAIN
THE EXACT PROCEDURE

271
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,126
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.
OH, WELL, MAKE THE TIME

272
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,545
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING
TO LET YOU

273
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,506
PERFORM ANY EXPERIMENTAL
SURGERY ON NEELIX

274
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,591
UNTIL I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

275
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,552
AND WHAT THE RISKS ARE.

276
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,597
THE RISK IS
THAT IT WON'T WORK.

277
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,392
AND IF IT DOESN'T,
HE'LL DIE.

278
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,811
BUT IT IS HIS ONLY
IMMEDIATE CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL.

279
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,021
IF HE DOES SURVIVE
HE'LL HAVE TO BE HELD MOTIONLESS

280
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,565
IN AN ISOTROPIC RESTRAINT.

281
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,441
THE LUNGS NEED TO BE
PERFECTLY ALIGNED

282
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,818
TO HIS INTERNAL PHYSIOLOGY.

283
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,277
THE COMPUTER WON'T BE ABLE
TO COMPENSATE

284
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,364
FOR ANY BODY MOVEMENT
WHATSOEVER.

285
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,241
HOW LONG WILL HE
HAVE TO STAY LIKE THAT?

286
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,950
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE

287
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,413
UNLESS THE HOLO-LUNGS CAN BE
REPLACED BY HIS ORIGINAL ORGANS.

288
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,831
AND HE WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO LEAVE

289
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,208
THE HOLOGRAPHIC ENVIRONMENT
OF THIS ROOM.

290
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,253
THE HOLO-LUNGS WOULD DISAPPEAR
THE MOMENT HE WENT OUT THE DOOR.

291
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:32,807
KES, I KNOW IT SOUNDS
PRETTY GRIM

292
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,308
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN
LOSING HIM COMPLETELY.

293
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:38,104
THIS WAY, HE'LL STILL
BE ALIVE.

294
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,898
AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND
A BETTER SOLUTION

295
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,399
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD.

296
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,490
WHAT DO YOU THINK
NEELIX WOULD WANT?

297
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:55,955
I'M NOT SURE, BUT I DO KNOW
THAT I WANT HIM TO LIVE.

298
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,533
THIS ROOM IS THE SOURCE
OF THE DILITHIUM SIGNATURE

299
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,827
WE DETECTED EARLIER.

300
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,244
THE POWER SYSTEMS HERE

301
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,622
ARE RUNNING ON AN UNUSUAL
DILITHIUM MATRIX.

302
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,457
SO THERE ARE ACTUALLY
NO DILITHIUM DEPOSITS

303
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,750
ON THIS PLANET?

304
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,502
IT WOULD APPEAR NOT.

305
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,842
ARE THESE... ORGANS?

306
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,345
THIS LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND
OF STORAGE FACILITY.

307
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,930
I WOULD SAY YOU ARE CORRECT,
CAPTAIN.

308
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,057
THIS APPEARS TO BE
A BIOLOGICAL REPOSITORY.

309
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,643
ANY SIGN OF NEELIX'S LUNGS?

310
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,936
NEGATIVE.

311
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,438
THERE IS, HOWEVER,
A KAZON LIVER.

312
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,358
AND ALTHOUGH I CANNOT IDENTIFY
THE OTHER ORGANS ON DISPLAY HERE

313
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,943
I WOULD SAY THEY BEAR
A STRIKING SIMILARITY

314
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,236
TO PULMONARY ORGANS,
EPIDERMAL TISSUE

315
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,530
OCULAR NERVE FIBER...

316
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,114
SAVE THE CATALOGING
FOR LATER, TUVOK.

317
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,616
ACCORDING TO MY TRICORDER,
THERE WAS A LIFE FORM

318
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,284
IN THIS ROOM
LESS THAN TEN MINUTES AGO.

319
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,536
CAPTAIN.

320
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,705
OPEN IT.

321
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,960
ONE LIFE SIGN
20 METERS AHEAD.

322
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,712
LET'S GO.

323
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,317
(<i> gagging</i> )

324
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,953
THEY'VE ERECTED A FORCE FIELD

325
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,830
WITH A ROTATING PHASE
MODULATION.

326
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,331
WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
DISRUPT IT.

327
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,833
Chakotay:
<i>Voyager</i> to Captain Janeway.

328
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,125
GO AHEAD.
We've just picked up

329
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,503
AN ALIEN SHIP
LEAVING THE PLANET.

330
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,047
TRACTOR THEM, COMMANDER.
Sorry, Captain.

331
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,673
They went into warp too quickly.

332
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,466
BEAM US BACK.

333
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,218
AS SOON AS WE'RE ABOARD,
LAY IN A COURSE

334
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,595
for pursuit, maximum warp.

335
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,971
AYE, CAPTAIN.

336
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,112
OKAY...

337
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,409
THE ISOTROPIC RESTRAINT
IS ACTIVATED

338
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,662
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO MOVE
MORE THAN TWO MICRONS
IN ANY DIRECTION.

339
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,414
ONE MICRON
WOULD BE PREFERABLE

340
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,083
BUT I SUPPOSE
IT'LL HAVE TO DO.

341
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,168
INITIATING THE
HOLOGRAPHIC EMITTER ARRAY

342
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,172
HIS CELLULAR TOXICITY IS RISING.

343
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,424
82 PERCENT.

344
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,217
86 PERCENT.

345
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,595
COMPUTER, ACTIVATE PROGRAM
<i>NEELIX ONE.</i>

346
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,221
DEACTIVATE THE INFUSER.

347
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,142
IT'S OFFLINE.

348
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,852
HERE WE GO.

349
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,897
90 PERCENT.

350
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,231
95 PERCENT.

351
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,403
(<i> raspy breathing</i> )

352
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,908
TOXICITY RETURNING
TO NORMAL.

353
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,665
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG SUPPLEMENTAL:</i>

354
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,208
<i>WE ARE PURSUING THE ALIEN SHIP</i>
<i>FROM THE MOON.</i>

355
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,210
<i>THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING</i>
<i>TO HAILS.</i>

356
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,755
<i>AND IT APPEARS THAT OUR TWO</i>
<i>SHIPS ARE EVENLY MATCHED</i>

357
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,048
<i>FOR SPEED.</i>

358
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,259
HOLOGRAPHIC LUNGS?
YES.

359
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,513
AND THEY'RE WORKING PERFECTLY,
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

360
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,306
(<i> gasping</i> )

361
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,725
TRY TO BREATHE NORMALLY.

362
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,937
HOW LONG CAN I LIVE LIKE THIS?

363
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,271
I DON'T KNOW.

364
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,316
THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED
MEDICAL PROCEDURE.

365
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,569
WE WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORING
YOUR CONDITION.

366
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,947
WHEN DO I GET OUT
OF THIS RESTRAINT?

367
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,699
UNLESS CAPTAIN JANEWAY

368
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,785
IS SUCCESSFUL IN RETRIEVING
YOUR ORIGINAL LUNGS

369
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,453
YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY
IN THE ISOTROPIC RESTRAINT

370
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,788
INDEFINITELY.

371
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,376
INDEFINITELY?

372
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,419
YOU MEAN I...

373
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,881
I COULD BE IN HERE
THE REST OF MY LIFE?

374
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,842
YES.

375
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,468
BUT WE'RE TRYING
TO FIND THE ALIENS

376
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,303
THAT DID THIS TO YOU.

377
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,764
THE CAPTAIN IS DOING
EVERYTHING SHE CAN.

378
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,393
WELL...

379
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,022
IF I'M GOING TO BE
IN HERE A WHILE

380
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:35,568
NOW'S AS GOOD A TIME
AS ANY TO TELL YOU

381
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,654
YOUR CEILING IS HIDEOUS.

382
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,079
I DIDN'T DESIGN THE ROOM.

383
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,705
I JUST WORK HERE.

384
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,290
SOMETHING WITH A BIT OF COLOR
WOULD HELP.

385
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:56,714
MAYBE A NICE TAPESTRY
OR A PAINTING.

386
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,799
UH, COULD YOU DIM THE LIGHTS
A LITTLE?

387
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,468
I'M A DOCTOR, MR. NEELIX,
NOT A DECORATOR.

388
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,678
PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE WILLING

389
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,515
TO ACCOMMODATE
HIS AESTHETIC NEEDS.

390
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,976
AND SOME MUSIC
WOULD BE NICE.

391
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,145
OR BETTER YET,
ARE YOU PROGRAMMED

392
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,438
TO SING?

393
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,110
Janeway to Paris.
Please report to the bridge.

394
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,820
I'M ON MY WAY, CAPTAIN.

395
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,488
YOU KNOW WHERE I AM
IF YOU NEED ME.

396
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,366
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

397
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,368
OH, FINE.

398
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,996
I HAVE A LITTLE ACCIDENT

399
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:33,417
I LOSE A PAIR OF LUNGS,
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW

400
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,755
PARIS IS SWOOPING IN
LIKE A RECTILIAN VULTURE.

401
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,340
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

402
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,761
DIDN'T YOU HEAR THE WAY
THAT HE SAID THAT?

403
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:47,347
"I'LL BE ON THE BRIDGE
IF YOU NEED ME."

404
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,601
"IF YOU NEED ME."

405
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,519
NEELIX.
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST

406
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,272
PULL THE PLUG
ON THE HOLOGRAPHIC EMITTER

407
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,149
AND GET IT OVER WITH.
GET ME OUT OF THE WAY

408
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,483
SO HE CAN HAVE YOU ALL
TO HIMSELF?

409
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,860
NEELIX, YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

410
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,487
TOM'S BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE.

411
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:05,116
AH, SO IT'S "TOM" NOW, IS IT?

412
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,451
YOU REALLY HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

413
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,869
WE'RE FRIENDS, THAT'S ALL.

414
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,747
IT'S NOT YOU I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

415
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,457
IT'S HIM.

416
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,168
HE'S JUST...

417
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:20,589
ONE BIG HORMONE
WALKING AROUND THE SHIP.

418
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,425
DON'T YOU SEE THE WAY
THAT HE LOOKS AT YOU?

419
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,470
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

420
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,849
I AM NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH YOU

421
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,644
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT EXISTS
ONLY IN YOUR IMAGINATION.

422
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,899
I KNOW YOU, NEELIX.

423
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,986
AND I KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID.

424
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,157
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

425
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,575
I'LL BE HERE WITH YOU.

426
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,205
KE... KES...

427
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:56,709
I COULD BE IN HERE
A VERY LONG TIME.

428
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,461
YOU NEED TO GO ON
WITH YOUR LIFE.

429
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,339
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

430
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,840
NEELIX...

431
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,009
YOU SHOULD JUST LET ME DIE.

432
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,468
STOP THAT.

433
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,305
WE'RE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

434
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,224
VISITING HOURS
ARE OVER.

435
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,559
HE NEEDS REST.

436
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,477
WHEN CAN I COME BACK?

437
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,523
1700 HOURS,
NOT A MINUTE BEFORE.

438
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,150
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

439
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,076
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GOING TO KISS YOU.

440
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,078
I'M ONLY ADJUSTING
THE RESTRAINT.

441
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,705
I'LL TRY TO CONTAIN
MY DISAPPOINTMENT.

442
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:42,088
Torres:
CAPTAIN, WE'VE COMPLETED OUR
DIAGNOSTIC ON THE ALIEN DEVICE.

443
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,048
IT APPEARS TO BE
MORE THAN A WEAPON.

444
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,259
IT'S ALSO A VERY
SOPHISTICATED
MEDICAL SCANNER

445
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,135
AND SURGICAL
INSTRUMENT.

446
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,595
FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL,

447
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,429
IT USES A NEURAL RESONATOR
TO STUN THE VICTIM

448
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,015
WHILE A QUANTUM IMAGING SCANNER

449
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,768
BEGINS A MICROCELLULAR ANALYSIS
OF THE ENTIRE BODY.

450
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,519
THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION
THIS THING CAN GATHER

451
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,356
PUTS A TRICORDER TO SHAME. YOU
FIRE THIS AT SOMEONE,

452
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,400
YOU LEARN EVERYTHING
ABOUT THEIR ANATOMY,

453
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,027
RIGHT DOWN TO THEIR
DNA SEQUENCING.

454
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,695
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE
WE'RE DEALING WITH ALIENS

455
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,073
WHO HAVE DEVELOPED A TECHNOLOGY
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

456
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:13,077
TO LOCATE AND EXTRACT ORGANS
FROM OTHER BEINGS. WHY?

457
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,661
Chakotay:
CAPTAIN.

458
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,292
THE ALIEN SHIP
HAS DROPPED OUT OF WARP.

459
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,459
IT'S APPROACHING
A LARGE ASTEROID.

460
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,087
ON SCREEN.

461
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,298
IT'S ENTERED THE ASTEROID,
CAPTAIN.

462
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,632
HOLD POSITION HERE.

463
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,801
MR. KIM?

464
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,219
I CAN'T SCAN
THE INTERIOR.

465
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,096
THE SURFACE STRATUM
IS MADE OF SOME SORT

466
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,722
OF NEUTRONIUM ALLOY.

467
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,808
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A NATURAL FORMATION.

468
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,893
ARE YOU SAYING SOMEONE
BUILT THIS ASTEROID?

469
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,145
IT'S POSSIBLE.

470
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,478
ANY SIGN OF WEAPONS OR
DEFENSE SYSTEMS?

471
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,356
NEGATIVE.

472
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,067
I THINK I'VE LOCATED
WHERE THE ALIEN SHIP ENTERED.

473
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,445
THERE'S AN OPEN CRATER
ON THE ASTEROID.

474
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,779
LET'S SEE IT.

475
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,202
Paris:
THE ION TRAIL
FROM THE ALIEN SHIP

476
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,663
LEADS DIRECTLY INSIDE.

477
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,249
HOW LARGE IS THAT CRATER?

478
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,500
200 METERS
IN DIAMETER.

479
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,670
CAPTAIN,
MAY I SUGGEST

480
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,214
YOU CONSIDER CAREFULLY
WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO.

481
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,216
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO?

482
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,636
I COULD DESCRIBE TO YOU IN
DETAIL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
OBSERVATIONS

483
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,306
I'VE MADE ABOUT YOU
OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS

484
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,016
WHICH LEAD ME TO CONCLUDE
YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE

485
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:21,061
THIS SHIP INSIDE THE ASTEROID,
BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY

486
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,105
I KNOW YOU QUITE WELL.

487
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:26,524
ONE OF THESE DAYS, I'M GOING
TO SURPRISE YOU, TUVOK.

488
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,194
BUT NOT TODAY.

489
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,863
I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED
OTHER OPTIONS.

490
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,698
IF NEELIX HAS ANY CHANCE
OF SURVIVING

491
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,242
WE HAVE TO ACT FAST.

492
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,785
RED ALERT.

493
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,787
MR. PARIS, LAY IN A COURSE.

494
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,997
AYE, CAPTAIN.

495
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,041
MR. TUVOK,
MAXIMUM SHIELDS.

496
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,709
PHASERS AT THE READY.

497
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,356
CAPTAIN, I'M REDUCING POWER
TO THE AFT THRUSTERS ONLY.

498
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,607
THIS PASSAGEWAY IS GETTING
A LITTLE TOO NARROW

499
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,984
FOR MY TASTE.

500
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,653
USE YOUR DISCRETION,
MR. PARIS.

501
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,239
ANY SIGN OF THE VESSEL,
LIEUTENANT?

502
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,199
WE'RE STILL FOLLOWING
THE ION TRAIL

503
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,369
BUT ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE
IS LIMITING OUR SENSOR RANGE.

504
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,955
I AM ONLY ABLE TO SCAN
500 METERS AHEAD OF US.

505
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,499
Chakotay:
ARE THERE ANY INDICATIONS

506
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,042
WE'RE BEING SCANNED
OR PROBED, MR. KIM?

507
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,127
Kim:
NOT YET.

508
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,513
DOCTOR?

509
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,975
DOCTOR,
I REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE.

510
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,810
WHAT IS IT,
MR. NEELIX?

511
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,313
PLEASE, IT'S URGENT.

512
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,232
YES?

513
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,691
I HAVE AN ITCH.

514
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,987
AN ITCH?

515
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,240
JUST ABOVE MY LEFT EYEBROW.

516
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,867
(<i> sighs</i> )

517
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,246
A LITTLE HIGHER.

518
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,498
(<i> sighs</i> )

519
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,916
OH, THANK YOU.

520
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,667
YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME.

521
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,169
DOCTOR, WAIT. DON'T LEAVE.

522
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,712
I'M NOT LEAVING
MR. NEELIX

523
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,089
I'M SIMPLY GOING
BACK TO WORK.

524
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,300
I CAN'T SEE YOU OVER THERE.

525
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,137
I FEEL LIKE I'M ALL ALONE.

526
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,805
YOU ARE ALL ALONE.

527
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,099
I'M A HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION--

528
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,143
A PROJECTION WITH A LOT
OF WORK TO DO, I MIGHT ADD.

529
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,437
(<i> chuckling</i> )

530
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:29,731
THAT'S VERY AMUSING, DOCTOR.

531
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,485
BUT... UM...

532
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:37,823
I'M REALLY STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE, UH... TRAPPED IN HERE.

533
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:41,535
A LITTLE CLAUSTROPHOBIC MAYBE.

534
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,162
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO.

535
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,831
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
EXCEPT LIE THERE AND BE QUIET.

536
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:50,919
I'M GOING TO LIE HERE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE

537
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,213
AREN'T I?

538
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:57,217
JUST STARING UP AT THE CEILING.

539
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:01,347
I'M NOT SURE I CAN TAKE THAT.

540
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:05,476
I REALLY NEED TO GET OUT
OF THIS RESTRAINT.

541
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,936
DOCTOR, I WANT YOU TO LET ME
OUT OF THIS THING

542
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,687
RIGHT NOW.

543
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,731
YOU KNOW THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE.

544
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,234
I'M THE PATIENT.
I KNOW WHAT MY RIGHTS ARE.

545
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:19,031
I WANT TO BE RELEASED
FROM THIS RESTRAINT IMMEDIATELY.

546
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,244
IMMEDIATELY!

547
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,956
MR. NEELIX, YOU ARE ALIVE,
YOU ARE BREATHING

548
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,707
AND FOR THE MOMENT,
YOUR CONDITION IS STABLE.

549
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,836
THAT IS MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE
CAN SAY IN YOUR SITUATION.

550
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,630
NOW IT IS CRITICAL TO
YOUR RECOVERY

551
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,091
THAT YOU NOT SUBJECT YOURSELF
TO ANY ADDITIONAL STRESS.

552
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,301
TRY TO CALM DOWN.

553
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,053
DON'T TELL ME
TO CALM DOWN!

554
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,931
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE TRAPPED
IN A RESTRAINING FIELD WITH...

555
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,726
(<i> gasping</i> ) HOLO-LUNGS.

556
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,020
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE WORKING.

557
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,567
I CAN'T... I CAN'T
GET ENOUGH OXYGEN.

558
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,694
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

559
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,028
YOU'RE HYPERVENTILATING.

560
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,905
TRY TO TAKE SLOW,
NATURAL BREATHS.

561
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,281
(<i> choking</i> )

562
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,408
I CAN'T.

563
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,909
(<i> gasping</i> )

564
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,827
I'M DYING.

565
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,162
LET ME OUT OF HERE.

566
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,417
WILL YOU HELP ME?
HELP ME.

567
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,252
HELP ME!

568
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,982
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE,
MR. PARIS. JUST FINE.

569
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,735
THANKS, CAPTAIN.

570
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,404
SENSORS DETECT
A LARGE CHAMBER AHEAD.

571
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,039
WHAT THE HELL?
WE APPEAR TO BE SEEING

572
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,916
<i>VOYAGER</i> AND
THE ALIEN SHIP

573
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,128
REFLECTING OFF THE WALLS
OF THE CHAMBER.

574
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,671
Janeway:
CAN YOU DETERMINE WHICH SHIP

575
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,048
IS THE REAL ONE?
NO, CAPTAIN.

576
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,510
THE WALLS ARE EMANATING SEVERE
ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE.

577
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,011
I CANNOT SCAN THEM DIRECTLY.

578
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,889
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO MOVE
THROUGH A HALL OF MIRRORS.

579
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,892
YOU NEVER NOW WHEN YOU'RE
GOING TO WALK INTO THE GLASS.

580
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,437
I'M STILL PICKING UP
THE ALIEN'S ION TRAIL.

581
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,188
MAYBE WE SHOULD FOLLOW THAT.

582
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,900
THEY MIGHT HAVE LEFT A FAKE
ION TRAIL TO LURE US IN HERE.

583
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,819
IT COULD LEAD US RIGHT
INTO ONE OF THOSE WALLS.

584
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,196
THAT'S A CHANCE WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE.

585
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,700
TUVOK, EXTEND THE DEFLECTORS
TO MAXIMUM RANGE.

586
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,034
IF WE DO RUN INTO SOMETHING,

587
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,495
IT'LL GIVE US
AN EXTRA MARGIN OF ERROR.

588
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,998
FOLLOW THE ION TRAIL,
MR. PARIS... SLOWLY.

589
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,000
MR. KIM, CONTINUOUS SCANS.

590
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,543
AYE, CAPTAIN.

591
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,137
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
TO REASSURE HIM, DOCTOR.

592
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,806
GOOD. IF YOU DON'T MIND,

593
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,140
I'D LIKE YOU
TO REMAIN IN SICK BAY

594
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,351
SO YOU'RE HERE
WHEN HE WAKES UP.

595
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,852
OF COURSE.

596
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,312
(<i> sighs</i> )

597
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,605
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

598
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:57,939
ME?

599
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,316
YOU SEEM AGITATED ABOUT
SOMETHING.

600
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,734
OF COURSE I'M AGITATED.

601
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,986
THIS ENTIRE SITUATION
IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

602
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,738
YOU MEAN NEELIX.

603
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,951
FIRST THEY TELL ME
THERE'S NO DOCTOR

604
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,663
SO I HAVE TO BE
ON CALL 24 HOURS A DAY.

605
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:13,997
THEN THEY TELL ME
THERE ARE NO NURSES

606
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,874
SO I HAVE NO ONE TO ASSIST ME.

607
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,378
I THOUGHT TOM PARIS
WAS ASSIGNED TO YOU.

608
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,004
LIKE I SAID...

609
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,006
NO ONE TO ASSIST ME.

610
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:27,010
AND NOW I HAVE A PATIENT WITH
SEVERE AND POSSIBLY LONG-TERM

611
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,223
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS AND THERE'S
NO COUNSELOR ON BOARD.

612
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,434
I AM AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL
SUPPLEMENT--

613
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,353
A SUPPLEMENT, THAT'S ALL.

614
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,397
I WASN'T PROGRAMMED
FOR ANY OF THIS.

615
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,233
IT'S JUST...

616
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,026
UNACCEPTABLE.

617
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,945
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
HOLOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING

618
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,032
BUT IF YOU WANT MY OPINION,
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ACCEPTABLE.

619
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,536
YOU'VE BEEN REMARKABLE.

620
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,414
I'VE ONLY DONE WHAT
THE PROGRAM ALLOWS ME TO.

621
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,083
GIVE YOURSELF SOME CREDIT.

622
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,919
YOU SAVED HIS LIFE.

623
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,841
YOU DID--
NOT SOME PROGRAM.

624
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,384
IT MAY SEEM THAT WAY TO YOU.

625
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,969
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT SEEMS.

626
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,517
YOU'RE VERY...KIND.

627
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,143
HOW DOES A REAL DOCTOR LEARN

628
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,438
TO DEAL WITH PATIENTS'
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS ANYWAY?

629
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,857
THEY LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE.

630
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,901
AREN'T YOU CAPABLE OF LEARNING?

631
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,570
I HAVE THE CAPACITY
TO ACCUMULATE

632
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,113
AND PROCESS DATA, YES.

633
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:32,242
THEN I GUESS
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO LEARN...

634
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,202
LIKE THE REST OF US.

635
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,583
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
A CAREER IN MEDICINE?

636
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,627
(<i> beeping</i> )

637
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,337
NEELIX IS STARTING
TO REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS.

638
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,174
LIEUTENANT, I'M PICKING UP

639
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,636
A MINOR POWER FLUCTUATION
IN THE WARP CORE.

640
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,513
COMPENSATE WITH
THE K.L.S. STABILIZER

641
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,014
NO EFFECT.

642
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,892
IN FACT, THE POWER LOSS
IS STARTING TO ACCELERATE.

643
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:00,395
Janeway to Torres.
What's going on down there?

644
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,355
SOME KIND OF POWER DRAIN.

645
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,192
I CAN'T LOCALIZE IT,
BUT...

646
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,486
WE'RE LOSING POWER

647
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,447
AT A RATE OF SEVEN PERCENT
PER MINUTE.

648
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:11,824
THE POWER DRAIN
IS COMING

649
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,700
FROM SOMEWHERE IN
THIS CHAMBER, CAPTAIN.

650
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,703
SOME KIND OF
DAMPENING FIELD.

651
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,080
IT'S BLEEDING ENERGY DIRECTLY
FROM THE WARP NACELLES.

652
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,999
B'ELANNA, SHUT DOWN
THE WARP CORE.

653
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,501
Go to emergency power.

654
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,837
NO EFFECT, CAPTAIN.

655
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,505
Keep me informed.
Bridge out. 

656
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,800
CAN YOU PINPOINT THE SOURCE
OF THE DAMPENING FIELD?

657
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,179
IT APPEARS TO BE COMING
FROM 217 MARK 015.

658
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,055
DISTANCE 547 METERS.

659
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,349
TUVOK,

660
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,142
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF
WE LOCKED PHASERS

661
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,602
AND FIRED AT THE SOURCE?

662
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,480
THE WALLS OF THIS CHAMBER
REFLECT DIRECTED ENERGY.

663
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,107
THE PHASER BEAM WOULD RICOCHET
ALONG AN UNPREDICTABLE PATH

664
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,735
POSSIBLY IMPACTING
OUR SHIP IN THE PROCESS.

665
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,029
ALL RIGHT.
WE WON'T TRY THAT.

666
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,781
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD.

667
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,867
TUVOK, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

668
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,786
IF WE REDUCED THE PHASER
POWER LEVEL TO A MINIMUM SETTING

669
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,496
AND SENT OUT
A CONTINUOUS BEAM?

670
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,791
THE PHASER WOULD CONTINUE
TO REFLECT OFF THE BULKHEADS

671
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,043
UNTIL IT ENCOUNTERED
A NONREFLECTIVE MATERIAL.

672
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,713
UNTIL IT ENCOUNTERED
A NONREFLECTIVE MATERIAL--

673
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,339
LIKE THE REAL ALIEN SHIP.

674
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,300
SO, WE COULD USE THE PHASERS
LIKE A SEARCHLIGHT...

675
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,511
SCAN THE INTERIOR OF THE STATION
UNTIL WE FIND THE SHIP.

676
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,013
EXACTLY.

677
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,430
DO IT.

678
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,025
ADJUSTING PHASER AZIMUTH
TO 15 DEGREES.

679
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:31,028
WAIT A MINUTE. I THINK
I'VE FOUND THE REAL SHIP.

680
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,487
ON SCREEN.

681
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,451
MR. PARIS, BRING US WITHIN
TRANSPORTER RANGE OF THAT SHIP.

682
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,703
AYE, CAPTAIN.

683
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,621
I'M PICKING UP TWO LIFE SIGNS.

684
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,206
THEY'RE POWERING ENGINES.

685
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,875
BRIDGE TO TRANSPORTER
ROOM THREE,

686
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,877
LOCK ON TO THOSE TWO LIFE SIGNS
AND BEAM THEM ABOARD.

687
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,754
SECURITY, MEET ME
IN TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE.

688
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,296
AYE, SIR.

689
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,530
YOU'RE ON
THE STARSHIP<i> VOYAGER.</i>

690
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,198
I'M CAPTAIN
KATHRYN JANEWAY

691
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,701
OF THE UNITED FEDERATION
OF PLANETS.

692
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,661
I AM DERETH...

693
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,331
OF THE VIIDIAN SODALITY.

694
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,375
YOU ATTACKED
ONE OF OUR CREW MEMBERS

695
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,837
AND YOU'VE LURED US
INTO THIS ASTEROID. WHY?

696
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,505
WE ARE GATHERING

697
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:36,969
REPLACEMENT ORGANS
AND SUITABLE BIOMATTER.

698
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,473
IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE
TO FIGHT THE PHAGE.

699
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,724
A VIRUS?

700
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,768
SOME KIND OF DISEASE?

701
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,269
YES.

702
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:50,023
IT ATTACKED OUR PEOPLE
OVER TWO MILLENNIA AGO.

703
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,484
IT CONSUMES OUR BODIES

704
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,696
DESTROYS OUR GENETIC CODES
AND CELLULAR STRUCTURES.

705
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,952
SO YOU HARVEST THE BODIES
OF OTHER BEINGS

706
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,287
TO REPLACE YOUR OWN TISSUES

707
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,582
AS THEY'RE CONSUMED
BY THIS... PHAGE?

708
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,294
OUR IMMUNOTECHNOLOGY
CANNOT KEEP UP.

709
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,421
THE PHAGE ADAPTS.

710
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,048
IT RESISTS ALL ATTEMPTS

711
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,382
TO DESTROY IT.

712
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,803
OUR SOCIETY
HAS BEEN RAVAGED.

713
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,222
THOUSANDS DIE EACH DAY.

714
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,685
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
FOR US TO SURVIVE.

715
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,398
I HAVE A GREAT...

716
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,527
SYMPATHY FOR WHAT
YOUR RACE HAS ENDURED.

717
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,363
BUT I CANNOT ALLOW YOU
TO KEEP THE ORGANS YOU REMOVED

718
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,990
FROM ONE OF OUR CREW MEMBERS.

719
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,075
WE NEED THEM BACK IMMEDIATELY.

720
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:50,208
I'M AFRAID THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE.

721
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,419
I HAVE ALREADY
BIOCHEMICALLY ALTERED

722
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:56,464
THE AIR-BREATHING ORGANS

723
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:01,053
AND GRAFTED THEM
INTO MOTURA'S BODY.

724
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:04,389
THEY ARE A PART
OF HIM NOW.

725
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,854
HE IS MY HONATTA.

726
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:16,526
HIS TASK IS TO FIND
THE ORGANS I NEED FOR SURVIVAL.

727
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,153
WE...

728
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:22,741
WE TRY TO EXTRACT THEM
FROM THE DEAD...

729
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:27,453
BUT SOMETIMES,
WHEN THE NEED IS IMMEDIATE

730
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:31,624
MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS
ARE REQUIRED.

731
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:36,546
SO NOW I AM LEFT WITH
THE SAME CHOICE YOU MADE:

732
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:40,550
WHETHER TO COMMIT MURDER
TO SAVE A LIFE

733
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,637
OR TO ALLOW MY OWN
CREWMAN TO DIE

734
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,473
WHILE YOU BREATHE AIR
THROUGH HIS LUNGS.

735
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,564
IT MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND

736
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,734
HOW ANY CIVILIZED PEOPLE

737
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,780
COULD COME TO... THIS.

738
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,575
BEFORE THE PHAGE BEGAN

739
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:09,913
WE WERE KNOWN AS EDUCATORS
AND EXPLORERS--

740
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:14,459
A PEOPLE WHOSE GREATEST
ACHIEVEMENTS WERE ARTISTIC.

741
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:19,672
I, MYSELF, AM A SCULPTOR
OF NOTE ON MY WORLD.

742
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:25,720
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WHEN YOUR
ENTIRE EXISTENCE IS AT STAKE...

743
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,639
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN

744
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,142
YOURSELF, MOTURA.

745
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:38,984
IF THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ACT
IS A DEATH SENTENCE,

746
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,735
SO BE IT.

747
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,447
AT LEAST IT WILL PUT
AN END TO MY SUFFERING.

748
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:51,871
I CAN'T BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOUR PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH.

749
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,457
THEY MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY
TO IGNORE THE MORAL IMPLICATIONS

750
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,295
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
BUT I HAVE NO SUCH LUXURY.

751
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:02,548
I DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM
TO KILL YOU TO SAVE ANOTHER.

752
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,717
MY CULTURE FINDS THAT
TO BE A REPREHENSIBLE

753
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,470
AND ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE ACT.

754
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,264
IF WE WERE CLOSER TO HOME

755
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:12,100
I WOULD LOCK YOU UP AND TURN YOU
OVER TO MY AUTHORITIES FOR TRIAL

756
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,227
BUT I DON'T EVEN HAVE
THAT ABILITY HERE

757
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:19,816
AND I AM NOT PREPARED TO CARRY
YOU FOREVER IN OUR BRIG.

758
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,401
SO I SEE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE...

759
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,783
BUT TO LET YOU GO.

760
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,535
TAKE A MESSAGE
TO YOUR PEOPLE.

761
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,872
IF I EVER ENCOUNTER
YOUR KIND AGAIN

762
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,750
I WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY
TO PROTECT MY PEOPLE

763
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,338
FROM THIS... HARVESTING
OF YOURS.

764
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:44,257
<i>ANY</i> AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS
AGAINST THIS SHIP

765
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:49,304
OR IT'S CREW WILL BE MET
BY THE DEADLIEST FORCE.

766
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,389
IS THAT CLEAR?

767
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,102
UH... QUITE.

768
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,481
WAIT.

769
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,942
I WANT TO SEE
THIS CREWMAN OF YOURS.

770
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,445
THAT CAN SERVE
NO USEFUL PURPOSE.

771
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,031
MAYBE IT CAN.

772
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,243
OUR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES
MAY BE SUPERIOR TO THEIRS.

773
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:14,704
I CAN TELL YOU
FROM WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED OF THEM

774
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,332
THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERABLY
SUPERIOR.

775
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,669
SHE SPARED
MY LIFE--

776
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,714
OUR LIVES.
WE OWE IT TO THEM

777
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,925
TO SEE IF THERE'S
ANYTHING WE CAN DO

778
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,467
TO HELP HIM.

779
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,597
I'LL TAKE YOU TO HIM.

780
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:49,864
HIS SIMULATED ORGANS
ARE PRIMITIVE.

781
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:54,452
IT'S AMAZING
HE IS STILL ALIVE.

782
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,954
(<i> sighs</i> )

783
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,168
THIS IS SET
TO SCAN ONLY.

784
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,795
PROCEED...

785
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,671
CAREFULLY.

786
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,695
STRANGE.

787
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:34,867
ACCORDING TO MY READINGS,
YOU ARE NOT HERE.

788
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,829
BELIEVE ME,
I WISH I WEREN'T.

789
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,378
THE REST OF YOU ARE HEALTHY.

790
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,465
YOU ARE COMPATIBLE
FOR ORGAN TRANSPLANT.

791
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:51,509
WAIT A MINUTE.
WE'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED THIS.

792
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,803
TALAXIAN PHYSIOLOGY
IS DIFFERENT

793
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,721
FROM THAT OF ANYONE ELSE
ON THIS SHIP.

794
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,557
HIS IMMUNE SYSTEM WOULD
REJECT THEIR LUNGS IMMEDIATELY.

795
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:02,561
YOUR SURGICAL KNOWLEDGE
IS INFERIOR.

796
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,441
WE WILL SIMPLY ADAPT
HIS IMMUNOGENICITY.

797
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,735
IT WON'T BE
A PROBLEM.

798
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:14,115
WHICH OF YOU
WILL DONATE A LUNG?

799
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,534
ME.
Neelix: NO!

800
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,703
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

801
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,163
LET SOMEONE ELSE
DO IT.

802
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,873
NO. I WANT TO DO IT,
NEELIX.

803
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,625
I'M WILLING TO TAKE
THE RISK.

804
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,711
BESIDES, YOU'VE DONE
SO MUCH FOR ME.

805
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:30,131
LET ME GIVE YOU
SOMETHING ONCE.

806
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,924
JUST FOR ONCE.

807
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,261
ALL RIGHT.

808
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,396
I LOOK FORWARD

809
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:48,607
TO SAMPLING YOUR COOKING,
MR. NEELIX.

810
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,361
YOU MEAN, I CAN KEEP
MY KITCHEN?

811
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:56,282
WELL, AT LEAST UNTIL WE GET
THE REPLICATORS BACK ON LINE.

812
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,868
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

813
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,870
AND, CAPTAIN...

814
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,122
I'LL SEE YOU AT BREAKFAST.

815
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,922
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG, SUPPLEMENTAL.</i>

816
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,091
<i>THE ALIENS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY</i>
<i>TRANSPLANTED</i>

817
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,093
<i>ONE OF KES'S LUNGS INTO NEELIX.</i>

818
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,345
<i>THE DAMPENING FIELD</i>
<i>HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED</i>

819
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,680
<i>AND I HAVE ALLOWED THEM</i>
<i>TO BEAM BACK TO THEIR VESSEL.</i>

820
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,974
<i>WE ARE RESUMING A COURSE HOME.</i>

821
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,904
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

822
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,449
THE OPERATION WAS A SUCCESS.

823
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:40,910
NEELIX IS ASLEEP AND
BREATHING ON HIS OWN NOW...

824
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,455
WITH YOUR LUNG.

825
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,498
I FEEL A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED.

826
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,041
THAT WILL PASS.

827
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,711
YOU'LL SOON ADAPT
TO DIMINISHED LUNG CAPACITY.

828
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,922
I SPOKE TO THE CAPTAIN
ABOUT YOU.

829
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,715
SHE'S GIVEN ME PERMISSION
TO BEGIN TRAINING YOU

830
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,175
AS A MEDICAL ASSISTANT.

831
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,553
YOU'LL BE A BACKUP
FOR MR. PARIS

832
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:03,141
OR, POSSIBLY, A REPLACEMENT.

833
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,643
THAT IS, ASSUMING
YOU'RE INTERESTED.

834
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,271
OF COURSE I'M INTERESTED.

835
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,106
WHEN DO WE START?

836
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:14,068
WE'LL BEGIN YOUR LESSONS AS SOON
AS YOU'VE FULLY RECOVERED.

837
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,281
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

838
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,951
THANK YOU.

839
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:26,122
YOU'VE GIVEN ME
A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.
