Input failure.
Input failure.

00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,530
Input failure.

5
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,623
Our link
to the collective
has been severed.

6
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,917
Initiate secondary protocols.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,503
(<i> explosion</i> )

8
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,045
The vessel's
transwarp chamber

9
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,673
is approaching
critical pressure.

10
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,257
We must evacuate this area.

11
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,551
ALL:
Agreed.

12
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,886
No directional...

13
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,221
ALL: coordinates are available.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,432
That way. Bearing 301.

15
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,893
ALL:
Agreed.

16
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,436
Bring that drone.

17
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,098
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53049.2.</i>

18
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,224
<i>We've docked</i>
<i>at the Markonian Outpost</i>

19
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,310
<i>and agreed to mutual visits,</i>

20
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,063
<i>so I'm allowing shore leave</i>
<i>to anyone who wants it.</i>

21
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>Commander Tuvok has objected</i>
<i>to taking on too many</i>
<i>visitors.</i>

22
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,736
<i>But, security issues aside,</i>
<i>I'm looking forward</i>
<i>to a cultural exchange</i>

23
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,738
<i>and making</i>
<i>some new friends.</i>

24
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,406
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

25
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,703
Pardon me.

26
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,787
Excuse me.

27
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,122
Careful, careful.

28
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,581
Excuse me.

29
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,127
Watch it!

30
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,753
Excuse me.

31
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,923
Captain?

32
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,717
I'll be right
with you.

33
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,764
The station manager didn't tell
me the vines were prehensile.

34
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,600
I went to put some water
in the pot and it grabbed me.

35
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,020
This is a gift
from the Kinbori Delegation.

36
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:51,272
I don't know its name,
only that it's used
in one of their sacred games

37
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,691
and it's very heavy.

38
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,693
Well, put it down anywhere.

39
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,117
Thank the Kinbori for me,

40
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,786
and give them
a token of our esteem.

41
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,622
I already gave them
a Voyager medallion.

42
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,916
They seemed appreciative.

43
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

44
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,835
Come in.

45
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,214
Doesn't it
look like

46
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,757
Christmas morning
in here, Commander?

47
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,383
You have to admit
the generosity

48
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,094
of our guests is
very impressive.

49
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,846
As is their proclivity
for criminal behavior.

50
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,806
This morning's
security report.

51
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,518
Broken ODN line...
some missing personal items...

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,813
a damaged scanner relay.
All in all, not that bad.

53
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,191
There is a second page
to the report.

54
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,111
Well, some of
these incidents

55
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,820
<i>are</i> a little
more serious.

56
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,906
But on balance,
I still think

57
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,157
we did the
right thing.

58
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,076
There is a third page.

59
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,578
Come on, Tuvok,

60
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,622
after all the xenophobic races
we've run into

61
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,540
don't you find it
just a little refreshing

62
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,834
to meet some people
who value openness
and freedom?

63
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,711
Well, as far as
I'm concerned,

64
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,880
opening the ship has been
a fascinating experience

65
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,466
and an unqualified success.
I'm very pleased.

66
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,968
Me, too.

67
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,053
I am pleased
that you are pleased.

68
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,639
If you'll excuse me.
Tuvok...

69
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,975
please accept this
token of our esteem.

70
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,020
Oh, no.

71
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,190
It's got me by the hair.

72
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,987
Now it's 12:45.

73
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,363
If you're hungry,
you may eat without me.

74
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,783
You said we'd have
lunch together.

75
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,245
I haven't completed
my analysis of the station's
power conversion matrix.

76
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,080
How long is it
gonna take?

77
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,331
Several hours.

78
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,667
Seven, you promised.

79
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,796
Very well.

80
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,142
I think it's even more crowded
than this morning.

81
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,559
Yes.

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,603
Excuse us. Excuse us.

83
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,064
Please, we're trying to get
through to the turbolift.

84
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,150
Excuse us.

85
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,068
SEVEN:
Stand aside!

86
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,695
(<i> voices fall silent</i> )

87
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,698
Thank you.

88
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,080
I'm sorry, but there's
no more Marsupial Surprise.

89
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,626
We only had two kilos
of pouches to begin with
and it's all gone!

90
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,254
Now, how about
some pizza, huh?

91
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,008
She's...
a Shivolian, right?

92
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,425
Correct.

93
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,511
Species 521?

94
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,057
Your mother
would not approve of you
memorizing Borg designations.

95
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,933
I don't approve either.

96
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,853
We've discussed the impropriety
of you emulating the Borg.

97
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,395
Sorry.

98
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,816
I'm finished.

99
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,318
We just sat down.

100
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,695
I do not enjoy crowds.

101
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,530
But you were
in the collective.

102
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,157
Wasn't that like
a big crowd?

103
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,701
Which is why
I do not enjoy them now.

104
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,163
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that.

105
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,207
Let's go.
Excuse me.

106
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,335
Are you Seven of Nine?

107
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,087
Yes.

108
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,817
You okay?

109
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,362
These are Borg synaptic relays

110
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,530
from my original unimatrix.

111
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,408
These are<i> yours?</i>

112
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,867
Where did you acquire them?

113
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,745
A trader from
Orendal V.

114
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,497
I was told you are
a former Borg drone

115
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,751
and might be interested
in acquiring these pieces.

116
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,338
I'll take them.
Captain Janeway will provide you

117
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,091
with whatever monetary
reimbursement you require.

118
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,302
Agreed.

119
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,180
I must examine these items
more closely.

120
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,807
Okay.

121
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,517
What's your name?

122
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,731
That was rude.

123
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,612
MALE 1:
<i>Stage two is complete.</i>

124
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,698
<i>She has the relays.</i>
<i>She's going to study them.</i>

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,119
FEMALE:
<i>Her regeneration alcove</i>
<i>is in Cargo Bay 2.</i>

126
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,745
MALE 2:
<i>That's where she'll go.</i>

127
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,747
<i>We should prepare</i>
<i>for stage three.</i>

128
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,124
<i>Agreed.</i>

129
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,667
<i>There's consensus.</i>

130
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,461
<i>Rendezvous at my coordinates</i>

131
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,464
<i>and stand by</i>
<i>to penetrate their security.</i>

132
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,106
Error.

133
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,692
Explain.

134
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,321
We shouldn't be desecrating
the body of this drone.

135
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,032
It is against the will
of Brothara.

136
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,741
Who is Brothara?

137
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,037
Brothara: a supernatural
deity worshipped

138
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,539
by Species 571.

139
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,626
I am a member of Species 571.

140
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,172
You're being confused
by irrelevant data.
Ignore it.

141
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,425
You said,<i> "I</i> am a
member of Species 571."

142
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,512
Do you consider yourself
an individual?

143
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,140
There are no individuals here.
We are Borg.

144
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,226
Agreed.
Agreed.

145
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,894
Agreed.

146
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,688
Resume constructing
the communications beacon.

147
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,000
It looks like
a standard Borg synaptic relay.

148
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,586
There must be
something more.

149
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,588
When I first came
into contact with it,

150
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,092
I was overwhelmed
with images, memories, sounds.

151
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,720
Sounds like a
perfectly natural
reaction to me.

152
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,723
That was part your
old unimatrix, right?

153
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,725
Well, isn't it
at least possible

154
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,770
that what you experienced
was simply nostalgia?

155
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,564
You know, sentimental
feelings about the past.

156
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,857
I know what nostalgia is,

157
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,277
but I have no feelings
about the past.

158
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:16,157
Okay. I think I've
done all I can here.

159
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,825
Lieutenant...

160
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,623
you were trying to help.

161
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,208
I appreciate that.

162
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,252
Anytime.

163
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:32,006
Oh, and, um, you may not be
<i>nostalgic</i> about the past,

164
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,219
but I'd say you definitely
have feelings about it.

165
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,887
Strong ones.

166
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,816
<i>Their security protocols</i>
<i>are formidable.</i>

167
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,692
<i>We may not have</i>
<i>enough time.</i>

168
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,861
<i>I'm worried about</i>
<i>Seven of Nine.</i>

169
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,406
<i>We should reexamine</i>
<i>the question of</i>
<i>simply asking...</i>

170
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,116
<i>You know what her</i>
<i>reactions will be.</i>

171
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,700
<i>She won't help us</i>
<i>because she...</i>

172
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,661
<i>We've been</i>
<i>through all that.</i>

173
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,997
<i>She could be</i>
<i>permanently injured.</i>

174
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,915
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to harm...</i>

175
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,250
Enough!

176
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,671
We need consensus.

177
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,594
We can't act without it.

178
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,974
I know.

179
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,185
So, then it's up to you.

180
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,937
Do we proceed or not?

181
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,107
Yes.

182
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:37,238
We... I apologize
for my indecision.

183
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,534
Apologies are irrelevant!

184
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,373
Computer, begin
multipolar analysis.

185
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,082
Analysis underway.

186
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,584
Time to completion?

187
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,878
Five hours, 17 minutes.

188
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,222
(<i> beeping</i> )

189
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,478
She's regenerating.

190
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,606
Begin rerouting
their internal sensors.

191
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,527
<i>Rerouting sensor input</i>
<i>to secondary processors.</i>

192
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,622
(<i> console beeping</i> )

193
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,013
Hold.

194
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,268
What have you got?

195
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,396
There's a power fluctuation
in the security grid.

196
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,416
All we know is that we've
got a security breach.

197
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,791
We don't know where.

198
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,468
Ready.

199
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,553
Insert the interlink module.

200
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,976
Ready.

201
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,358
He's still worried
about injuring her.

202
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,700
If we fail, we'll never
become individuals.

203
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,161
We have to
remember that.

204
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,668
There is consensus.

205
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,221
I've found her memory files.

206
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,847
She's aware
of our presence.

207
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,018
She's trying to
regain consciousness.

208
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,313
We must abort.
No! We're too close.

209
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,485
I will not comply.

210
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:59,106
I have performed
this action before.

211
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,901
I was with my father.

212
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,070
He was
a tall man.

213
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,448
I have a... similar memory.

214
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,659
But I was in a house

215
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,119
and the fire was in a hearth.

216
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,664
The biomatter
is ready.

217
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,969
It tastes similar
to a bird I once ate.

218
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,639
I used to prepare food...

219
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,641
for...

220
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,184
my parents.

221
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,479
They lived...
in a small building

222
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,314
by...

223
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,066
a river.

224
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,444
I used to be...

225
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,195
afraid of the dark.

226
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,073
Just before I was assimilated,
I was...

227
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:53,620
eating with a group of men.

228
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:58,666
We... worked in numbers.
Mathematics.

229
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,003
I... calculated equations
for another man.

230
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,172
I have a name.

231
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,842
It's...

232
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,594
Marika.

233
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:18,269
Marika Willkarah.

234
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,521
Willkarah.

235
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,190
Hello, Marika Willkarah.

236
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,694
Her designation
is Three of Nine.

237
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,696
MALE 2:
I have a name.

238
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,783
P'Chan.

239
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,911
Son of Dornar and Ansha.

240
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,747
My primary function
was to care for them.

241
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,290
FEMALE: I was married.

242
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,293
We were on a starship...

243
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,920
the<i> Excalibur.</i>

244
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,715
I worked
in Engineering.

245
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,426
This is not my hand.

246
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,053
MALE 2:
My parents... they're dead.

247
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,306
The Borg killed them.

248
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,395
I hate the Borg.

249
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,606
This is counterproductive.

250
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,651
We must delete
all irrelevant data.

251
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,402
I want my hand back.

252
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,198
I was on duty...
the night watch...

253
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,241
when the Borg came....

254
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,953
Oh, my God!

255
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,956
Look at what they've...
done to me!

256
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,709
These-these things
they put in my body!

257
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,169
What have they done?
Command override.

258
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,171
Cease this interaction!

259
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,758
Comply.

260
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,719
We will not access

261
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,888
these memory files again.

262
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,892
Initiate the prescribed
maintenance and survival
protocols only.

263
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,477
No further communication
is required,

264
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,271
until we are reassimilated
into the collective.

265
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,524
Agreed.

266
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,067
Agreed.

267
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,696
Agreed.

268
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,414
...but whoever removed their
implants was a poor surgeon.

269
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,958
Their internal organs were
damaged during the procedure

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,168
and their bodies are
covered with scars.

271
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,463
You said you recognized them.
Not at first.

272
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,632
But when they attempted
to access my memory files,

273
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,551
I was momentarily linked
with them.

274
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,094
Two of Nine.

275
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,431
Three of Nine.
Four of Nine.

276
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,183
We were all members
of the same unimatrix.

277
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,811
Do you know why they were trying
to access your memories?

278
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,772
No.

279
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,565
How long have they
been disconnected
from the collective?

280
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,233
Three or
four months.

281
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,945
However, they are still
connected to each other.

282
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,197
Somehow, the left parietal
lobes of their brains

283
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,825
have been transformed
into organic interlink nodes.

284
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,911
They've become
linked together

285
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,580
into a sort of
collective triad.

286
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,206
Revive them.

287
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,424
I'm Captain Janeway.

288
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,217
We know who you are,

289
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,053
and we know
what you were trying to do.

290
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,888
What we don't know is why.

291
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,640
She has
information
we need.

292
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,182
What kind of information?

293
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,601
We want to become...

294
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,269
Individuals.

295
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,688
You want to break
the neural link

296
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,356
between the three
of you?

297
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,275
Wouldn't you?
None of us is alone

298
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,319
with our own thoughts,
our own feelings.

299
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,029
Every day of my
life is spent

300
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,490
hearing their two
voices in my head.

301
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,618
When we're asleep, we experience
each other's dreams.

302
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,912
How's that different
from life in the collective?

303
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,872
In the collective, there
are billions of voices.

304
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,291
They become... white noise.

305
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,251
But with only
three...

306
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,629
Each voice comes through
clearly.

307
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,756
It has to stop.

308
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,925
We must break
the neural link.

309
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,260
Doctor, is there anything
you can do?

310
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,554
The modifications
are too extensive.

311
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,474
Their neuronal pathways
have been fundamentally
altered.

312
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,059
You hold the key.

313
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,811
Why?

314
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,395
You were there with us.

315
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,940
Planet 1865 Alpha.

316
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,483
You must remember.

317
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,321
Eight years ago,
our vessel crashed.

318
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,782
The four of us were
the only survivors.

319
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,492
When we were
reassimilated...

320
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,911
We found we'd been linked
together somehow.

321
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,039
We were a subset
within the collective.

322
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,875
It's like having
three voices whispering
in one ear...

323
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,127
And a crowd screaming
in the other.

324
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,963
We had to break free,
so we worked together,

325
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,673
and we finally
escaped.

326
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,800
We had our implants
removed on Inavar Prime.

327
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,969
But they couldn't break
the neural link.

328
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,554
We need to find out

329
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,472
what happened
eight years ago

330
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,891
<i>after</i> the crash...

331
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,726
The night we were
reassimilated

332
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,352
into the collective.

333
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,230
We need to know how
the link was created.

334
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,607
But our memories
are...

335
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,152
Fragmented, disorganized.

336
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:39,613
We hoped
that you would know.

337
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,782
I don't.

338
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,327
However, I am willing to attempt
to retrieve the data.

339
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,083
Come with me.

340
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,008
Are you ready?

341
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,136
Yes.

342
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,724
Data search complete.

343
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,268
Do you remember
anything further?

344
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,437
No.

345
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,815
My last memory is of us...

346
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:15,900
Is of us standing around...

347
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,735
Around a
campfire.

348
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,612
And yet the data files
in your cortical processor

349
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,363
appear to be intact.

350
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,074
I see no evidence
that would explain

351
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,575
your lapse in memory.

352
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,202
What about you?

353
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,704
Why don't you remember
what happened?

354
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,165
I don't know.
I've found no evidence

355
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,333
of damage to<i> my</i>
<i>memory files either.</i>

356
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,671
I remember the campfire
and then waking up
in the collective.

357
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,049
There is an obvious gap...

358
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,218
but no indication of why.

359
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,845
Why do they still
call you Seven?

360
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,388
You should have a name.

361
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,390
It<i> is</i> my name.
No.

362
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,351
It's a designation.

363
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,604
You're an individual now.

364
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:59,068
I decided that my former name
was no longer appropriate.

365
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,113
Prepare to reinitialize
the memory cascade.

366
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,116
I can't wait to use
my real name again.

367
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,827
There is nothing
preventing you
from doing so.

368
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,870
Except that
most of the time,

369
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,916
I don't know whether my name
is Marika, P'Chan or Lansor.

370
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,584
The names,
the memories...

371
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,253
The memories,
even the thoughts

372
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,046
flow from one
to the other.

373
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,840
I can't love
or hate or laugh...

374
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,591
Or cry without...
or cry without...

375
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,802
sharing it with them.
sharing it with them.

376
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,471
How can any of us take
a name for ourselves...

377
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,432
For ourselves?
We're not individuals.

378
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,476
We're not Borg.

379
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,394
We're nothing.

380
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,150
Begin the memory cascade.

381
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,746
JANEWAY:
"A friendly game"?

382
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,957
Well... that's how it started.

383
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,210
JANEWAY:
I see. And perhaps you
could explain to me

384
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,378
how this friendly game
turned into a street brawl?

385
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,673
(<i> clears throat</i> ):
Well, Harry and I

386
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,800
wanted to explore
the station.

387
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,719
Um... we wanted
to broaden

388
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,846
our understanding
of alien cultures and, uh...

389
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,764
Skip the recruiting
speech.

390
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,017
You were looking
for a bar. Then what?

391
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,854
Well, we found one
and we met a pair
of Kinbori who told us

392
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:20,941
about this game they play
with these big,
odd-looking rackets...

393
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,902
You mean one of those?

394
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,487
BOTH:
Yeah!

395
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,240
I-in any case,
they challenged us

396
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,449
to a game
and we accepted,

397
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,411
but I guess we weren't quite
aware of all the rules.

398
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,039
Because you'd been drinking.

399
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,957
Yes, ma'am.

400
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,835
Y-You see, we thought
it was a version
of tennis,

401
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,046
but as soon as we hit
the first volley,

402
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,090
this Kinbori jumps
over the net

403
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,133
and starts attacking
us with his racket.

404
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,177
So we figured we were
supposed to fight back...

405
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,763
Yeah.
And then, uh...

406
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,431
well, things got
a little out of hand.

407
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,560
"A little out of hand."

408
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:01,357
Seven<i> Voyager</i> crewmen,
including two Bridge officers,

409
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:05,361
along with 13 Kinbori
and one Morphinian cafe owner...

410
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,113
all arrested.

411
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,156
The charges range
from disorderly conduct

412
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,409
to assault
on a security officer.

413
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,411
Th-That one's not true.

414
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,705
Oh, thank you, Mr. Kim.
I'll note that exception
in my log.

415
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,292
You're both confined to quarters
until further notice--

416
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,294
after you report to Sick Bay.

417
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,836
That's all.

418
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,425
Well, did you win?

419
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,386
Oh, yes, ma'am.

420
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:33,180
We kicked their... rackets.

421
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,808
Good. Dismissed.

422
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,647
Any progress?

423
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,942
I've determined that we all
have exactly the same gap
in our memories.

424
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,527
It seems unlikely
that it would be a coincidence.

425
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,196
So you believe
the collective

426
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,365
deliberately wiped
your recollections

427
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,326
of the reassimilation process?

428
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,286
It is the most
likely explanation.

429
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,829
But...?

430
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,705
The collective
would not care

431
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,167
that four drones remembered
being reassimilated.

432
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,669
Something must have happened
during the process.

433
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,255
Something they wanted
to hide from you.

434
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,590
Let's look at this from
a different perspective.

435
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,384
Why would the collective

436
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,053
lock them into a neural
triad in the first place?

437
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,306
I don't know.
There is no advantage
to having three drones

438
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,974
linked together
in this manner.

439
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,477
Well, they obviously did
it for some reason...

440
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,519
and I get the feeling
that if we can answer

441
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,231
that question, the rest
should fall into place.

442
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,025
But I wish we
could find a way

443
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,568
to close the gaps
in your memories.

444
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,365
There is a way.

445
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,824
I assume there's
a reason

446
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,742
you didn't mention
it before now.

447
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,371
It would involve linking
my neural interface to theirs.

448
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,332
Together, we may be able
to restore the missing data.

449
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,460
However, I would again
be part of a group mind.

450
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:49,048
You're not eager
to revisit
that experience, hmm?

451
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,133
There's also the possibility

452
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,886
that I could become trapped
in the neural link.

453
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,596
Turning the triad
into a quartet.

454
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,016
I won't ask you to
take that kind of risk.

455
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,770
I do feel compelled
to help them,

456
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,733
but I am uncertain as to
the correct course of action.

457
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,696
Let me ask you something.

458
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:17,535
Do you think of these
people... as family?

459
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,579
Is it relevant?

460
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,123
There's an old saying:

461
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,334
"Blood is thicker
than water."

462
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,294
It means that
the ties of family

463
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,922
run deeper than any other
kind of relationship.

464
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,799
We'll often do things
for members of our family

465
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,511
we'd never dream of
doing for anyone else.

466
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,519
Seven!

467
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,895
Seven!

468
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,105
Naomi Wildman.

469
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,940
I heard about the drones.

470
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,066
Did they hurt you?

471
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,444
I am not damaged.

472
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,404
What do they want?

473
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,490
They are seeking
information from me,

474
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,034
but I am uncertain
whether I can help them.

475
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,745
Oh. Be careful.

476
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:07,960
Naomi Wildman,
do you consider me to be family?

477
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:13,132
I... I don't, I mean...

478
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,134
well...

479
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,969
yes.

480
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,305
Is... that okay?

481
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,141
I have no objection.

482
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,978
Do you...
think of me as family?

483
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,148
Yes.

484
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,155
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

485
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,616
<i>Seven of Nine has decided</i>
<i>to undergo the procedure</i>

486
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,076

00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,496

489
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:50,002
I'll be monitoring
your neural readings
while you're in the link.

490
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,005
But I'm not certain
I'll be able to counter
the effects if...

491
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,381
you become trapped.

492
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,967
I know you'll
do your best.

493
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,219
It's never a good sign
when the patient
feels the need

494
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,597
to comfort the doctor.

495
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,265
Good luck.

496
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,440

507

The collective

A Borg vessel
is on its way.

509
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,499
We will be one
with the Borg again.

510
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,376
No! I do not want

511
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,503
to rejoin the collective.
Agreed.

512
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,381
That is in violation of
all established protocols.

513
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,634
Forget the protocols.
You're not a drone.

514
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,762
You're a person, like us.
You have a name... a life!

515
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,056
All you have to do is embrace
who you really are.

516
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,142
No.<i> I</i> do not exist.

517
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,478
I am only part
of the greater whole.

518
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,146
That's what they
want you to believe.

519
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,439
That's what they want
us all to believe.

520
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,274
We are Borg.

521
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,568
Our primary function
is to serve the collective.

522
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,154
Not anymore.

523
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,368
Error! Input failure!

524
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,245
They may know what planet we're
on, but without the beacon,

525
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,955
it'll be far more difficult
to locate us.

526
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,040
If we can remodulate
our cortical implants,

527
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,709
we might be able
to elude their sensors.

00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,422
The nanoprobes will
create new interlink nodes

537
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:07,175
in your left hemisphere.
Resistance is futile.

538
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,053
(<i> panting</i> )

539
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,558
I will not comply!

540
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,019
I will not comply!

541
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,815
(<i> moans</i> )

542
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,574
State your designations.

543
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:16,536
Two of Nine,
Primary Adjunct
of Unimatrix 01.

544
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:20,916
Three of Nine,
Auxiliary Processor
of Unimatrix 01.

545
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:25,128
Four of Nine,
Secondary Adjunct
of Unimatrix 01.

546
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,922
What is your primary function?

547
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,590
ALL:
To serve the collective.

548
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,551
You will repair
the communications beacon.

549
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,725
TWO OF NINE: It was you!
You were responsible.

550
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,227
What have you done to us?
You linked us together.

551
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,521
You're responsible
for our suffering.

552
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,856
How could you do it?

553
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,524
If you didn't want
to return...

554
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,317
To the collective...
You didn't have to.

555
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,986
You don't understand
what happened.

556
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,947
(<i> all talking</i> )

557
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,532
Somebody help me!

558
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,951
(<i> all yelling</i> )
What's happening?

559
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,370
Somehow, they broke
their link with Seven.
They're malfunctioning.

560
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,038
Help me get them
to Sick Bay.

561
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,456
(<i> yelling continues</i> )

562
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,585
When they broke
the connection with you,

563
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,881
it must have overloaded
their cortical implants.

564
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,716
They went into neural shock.

565
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,969
And yet I was
undamaged.

566
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:16,262
I think I know why.

567
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,181
You said you remembered
injecting them

568
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,475
with nanoprobes
eight years ago...

569
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,019
Yes.

570
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,521
It created an interlink
between them.

571
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:28,107
It was the only way
to prevent them from
escaping the collective.

572
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,861
Well, it seems to have had
an unfortunate side effect.

573
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,489
Their higher brain functions
were somehow tied
into the interlink.

574
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,826
When they broke their connection
with you in the Cargo Bay,

575
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,954
the shock to their cognitive
systems was too great.

576
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,581
Can you revive them?

577
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,166
I could remove
the microcortical implants.

578
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,460
That would break the link
binding them together,

579
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,087
but it would also kill them.

580
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,297
They'd only live
a matter of weeks.

581
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,883
A month at the most.

582
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,385
What are the other options?

583
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,138
They could be returned
to the Borg.

584
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,101
If they were reassimilated
into the collective, they
would regain consciousness

585
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,978
and then live out
a normal life span.

586
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,479
As drones.

587
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:10,067
As drones,
but they'd be alive, Seven.

588
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:22,412
They have no hope of surviving
unless they return
to the collective.

589
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,331
Not exactly
a happy ending, is it?

590
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,625
No.

591
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,462
Back on that planet...

592
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,715
why do you think
you reacted so differently
from the rest of them?

593
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,051
Why were you so afraid
of becoming an individual?

594
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,305
When I was first assimilated
into the collective,

595
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,100
I was a child.

596
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,103
They were assimilated
as adults.

597
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,773
When our individual memories
began to resurface...

598
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,858
Yours were of being
a little girl...

599
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,319
a scared little girl.

600
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,031
I let that fear control me.

601
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,868
After I saw the drone
die in the swamp,

602
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,663
I... panicked.

603
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,707
I began to envision
my own death...

604
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,501
alone...

605
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,088
without even the sound of
another drone to comfort me.

606
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,092
So I forced them to return.

607
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:20,428
I infiltrated their left
cerebral hemispheres

608
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,473
with nanoprobes and created
a new interlink network--

609
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,934
one that they
couldn't resist.

610
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:29,146
And then I eliminated
the evidence of
what I'd done.

611
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,898
You were overwhelmed
by feelings you couldn't
begin to understand.

612
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,692
You're not responsible
for that.

613
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,861
Because of what I did,
they'll be forced to live

614
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,696
the rest of their lives
in the collective.

615
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,823
For that, I am responsible.

616
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,413
There's a difference
between surviving and living.

617
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,208
They'll survive
in the collective,

618
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,418
but they won't really be alive.

619
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,420
You know that better
than any of us.

620
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,757
There is no alternative.

621
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,676
How long would they survive

622
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,511
if the Doctor
deactivated this...

623
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,514
interlink network
you created?

624
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,099
A month at most.

625
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,770
A month as an individual
or a lifetime as a drone.

626
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,026
Which option would you choose?

627
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,665
Survival is insufficient.
I beg your pardon?

628
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,919
Eight years ago, I forced them
to return to the collective.

629
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,047
I won't make
the same mistake again.

630
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,299
They deserve to exist
as individuals.

631
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,011
We must terminate the link
between them.

632
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,890
I understand that you feel
a certain responsibility

633
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,433
for these patients.

634
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,144
But as their physician,
so do I.

635
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,773
It's my duty to preserve
their lives for as long as
possible, even if that means...

636
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,859
I will not return them
to the Borg.

637
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:01,613
Are you thinking of what's best
for them... or for you?

638
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,698
Clarify.

639
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,325
You said it yourself.
You made a mistake.

640
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,204
And Seven of Nine doesn't like
to make mistakes.

641
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,330
She strives
for perfection.

642
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:15,334
I want you to think about the
motivation behind your decision.

643
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,838
Are you doing what's right
for those three people...

644
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,299
or are you trying to alleviate
the guilt you feel

645
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,593
over what happened
eight years ago?

646
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,973
The damage I did
can never be repaired,

647
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,517
and my guilt is irrelevant.

648
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:37,983
I simply want them to experience
individuality... as I have.

649
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,859
As<i> you</i> have.

650
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,155
At one time,
you were confined
to this Sick Bay.

651
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,783
Your program was limited to
emergency medical protocols.

652
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,870
In some ways, you were not
unlike a drone.

653
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,791
But you were granted
the opportunity to explore
your individuality.

654
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,668
You were allowed to
expand your program.

655
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,712
Your mobile emitter gives
you freedom of movement.

656
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,174
Your thoughts are your own.

657
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,802
If you were told
you had to become
a drone again,

658
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,263
I believe you
would resist.

659
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,392
(<i> softly</i> ):
Yes, I suppose I would.

660
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,854
They would resist as well.

661
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:20,692
They would choose freedom,
no matter how fleeting.

662
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,865
Only you and I can truly
understand that.

663
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,118
Survival<i> is</i> insufficient.

664
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,966
It's so... quiet.

665
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:51,139
I had no idea
you were going to say that.

666
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,561
I don't know what
either of you is thinking.

667
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,815
I'd forgotten
what it was like

668
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,360
to be alone with
my own thoughts.

669
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,489
I'm leaving.

670
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,700
Where will you go?

671
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,912
I want to see the space station.

672
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,290
To meet new people.

673
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,376
To fill my life...

674
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,003
with life again...

675
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,383
in the time I have left.

676
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,493
I'm leaving as well.

677
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,080
There's an uninhabited planet

678
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,291
only a few light-years
from here.

679
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,044
I'd like to spend
my final days

680
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,423
in the open air.

681
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,358
My people don't believe
in holding grudges.

682
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,489
I wish you well,
Seven of Nine.

683
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,242
Thank you.

684
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:48,131
It's nice to be on a
Federation starship again.

685
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,345
I'd like to stay
aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

686
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:56,597
The Captain said you may
stay as long as you wish.

687
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,933
You mean as long as I have.

688
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,647
I can't forgive you
for what you did to us.

689
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,028
But I do understand
why you did it.

690
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,338
Naomi Wildman.

691
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,090
I thought you might
like some company.

692
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,758
Why?

693
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,470
Because of... what
happened with the drones.

694
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:39,432
I see that word travels quickly.

695
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,018
It's a small ship.

696
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,064
I thought maybe you might want
to spend some time with...

697
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,191
family.
