1
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,719
DOCTOR:
Turn 90 degrees
to the left please.

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,597
Turn 90 degrees
to the left please.

3
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,309
Turn 90 degrees
to the right please.

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,353
About face.

5
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,693
Try to hold
still, please.

6
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,736
Is it going to hurt?

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,530
Of course not.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,074
A few photons
never hurt anybody.

9
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,493
We didn't do
this last year.

10
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,623
That's because last
year, I didn't realize

11
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:43,251
what an exciting tool
my holo-imager could be

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,337
in the pursuit of
medical knowledge.

13
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,715
Is something wrong with me?

14
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,132
Your health
is excellent.

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,467
This is just
another way

16
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,427
to make sure that
it stays excellent.

17
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,471
Does my mother
have to do this?

18
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,598
Your mother and
everybody else on board.

19
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,726
I've made it part of
the annual checkup.

20
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,477
It's quite
handy really.

21
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,354
By attuning the
resonance spectrum

22
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,647
along a subspace band,

23
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,273
I can take an image
of my patients

24
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,067
all the way down to
the subatomic level.

25
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,360
Subatomic level?

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,237
I thought you said
this wasn't going to hurt.

27
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,824
I did...and it won't.

28
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,119
There...see?

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,747
Nothing to it.

30
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,542
Try to hold still please.

31
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,377
Are you making fun of me?

32
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,630
No.

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,090
It'll only take a second
to download your images

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,384
into the medical database,

35
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,177
if you'd like to stay
for a moment,

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,555
and see what you look like
from the inside out.

37
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,932
Why not?

38
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,309
Here we go.

39
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,199
Handsome fellow.

40
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,495
Hmm.

41
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,086
There's some
scar tissue

42
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,170
along the base of
your lower skull.

43
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,131
Computer, isolate
the occipital plexus,

44
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,466
magnification 500.

45
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,219
There.

46
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,555
Scarring along
the dura mater.

47
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,765
From what?

48
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,558
An operation.

49
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,603
Computer, isolate
the cranial meninges,

50
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,563
magnification 100.

51
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,484
More scarring.

52
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,819
No doubt about it,

53
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,862
somebody performed neurosurgery.

54
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,825
And that somebody...

55
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,119
was me.

56
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,330
These microlinear incisions
are a dead giveaway.

57
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,666
I developed that
procedure myself.

58
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,250
I don't understand.

59
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,837
I don't remember
having an operation.

60
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,172
I'm a little confused as well...

61
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,216
because I don't remember
performing it.

62
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,541
( door chimes )

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,751
Who is it?

64
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,294
DOCTOR:
The Doctor.

65
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,255
Come in.

66
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,632
I've finished giving the crew
their annual physicals.

67
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,718
But as usual,
the Captain was a no-show.

68
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,178
Let's get it
over with.

69
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,596
Specific complaints?

70
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,347
None. How's the crew?

71
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,433
In good health,
for the most part.

72
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,560
I found a nascent
alien retrovirus

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,438
bouncing between personnel
on Decks ten and 11,

74
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,440
but managed
to nip it in the bud.

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,317
And there's been a little
more wear and tear

76
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,236
on Seven of Nine's
cranial infrastructure.

77
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,321
I'm going to double
her maintenance routine.

78
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,406
Cyto-metabolism is normal.

79
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,492
Endocrine functions
functioning.

80
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,827
That's a relief.

81
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,206
I'd like you to
drop by Sick Bay

82
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,666
at your earliest
convenience.

83
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,793
I've adjusted my holo-imager
for deep body scans.

84
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,419
You're the only member
of the crew

85
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,838
who hasn't posed for me yet.

86
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,256
Maybe next week.

87
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,091
It's a fine
instrument, really.

88
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,425
I've already
discovered

89
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,552
something of a
mystery with it.

90
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,305
Apparently,
I performed

91
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,598
a complex neurosurgery
on Harry Kim.

92
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,475
According to the
isotope decay,

93
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,103
around the scars,
it was 18 months ago.

94
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,313
I don't remember that.

95
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,231
Neither do I and...

96
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,607
neither does the patient.

97
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,609
I checked my medical entries
for that period.

98
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,236
There's no mention of surgery.

99
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,780
Could your holo-imager have
misinterpreted the scans?

100
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,448
Possibly.

101
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,202
The computer is double-checking
the data now.

102
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,452
I'd also like to run

103
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,370
a complete diagnostic
on my own program,

104
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,748
and have a look
at my memory files.

105
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,167
B'Elanna and Harry
are both busy

106
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,626
with the plasma
relay repairs.

107
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,712
Let's make sure you're
next up on the list.

108
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,255
Thank you, Doctor.

109
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,431
Hello, Seven.

110
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,641
Doctor.

111
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,060
I'm here to ask you
a favor.

112
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,477
Another time.

113
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,687
I beg your pardon?

114
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,772
I am recalibrating
the deflector dish.

115
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,940
Come back tomorrow.

116
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,234
I should be
finished by then.

117
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,484
( sighs )

118
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,320
Looks like I'm two for two.

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,489
Oh, the Captain's acting
like she's allergic to me,

120
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,075
and now my
prized pupil

121
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,285
won't even give me
the time of day.

122
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,040
State your request.

123
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,625
A little mystery
has cropped up,

124
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,003
evidence that I performed
surgery on Ensign Kim

125
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,340
a year and a half ago,
before you came aboard.

126
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,051
The trouble is...

127
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,552
I don't remember it.

128
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,348
I wanted you to help me run
a self-diagnostic.

129
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,309
I will assist you...

130
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,643
in one hour.

131
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,645
Fair enough.

132
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,119
Computer, locate the
Emergency Medical Hologram.

133
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,162
COMPUTER:
<i>The EMH is inactive.</i>

134
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,663
Activate him.

135
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,125
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

136
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,627
I'm here to assist you,
as I agreed.

137
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,255
I've run a preliminary
diagnostic of your program.

138
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,173
Your suspicions
were correct.

139
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,050
I never asked you
to run a diagnostic.

140
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,136
Suspicions? What
are you talking about?

141
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,720
You don't recall speaking to me

142
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,889
in the Astrometrics Lab
one hour ago.

143
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,766
No.

144
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,017
The last I remember,

145
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,769
I was completing the
yearly physicals.

146
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,438
You mentioned
a neurosurgery

147
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,522
you performed on Ensign Kim
18 months ago.

148
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,192
Computer, locate
the holo-scans

149
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,695
I took of Ensign Kim
this morning.

150
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,448
Any operation would
show up on--

151
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:13,201
COMPUTER:
<i>Unavailable.</i>
<i>That file has been deleted.</i>

152
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,702
Let's have a look
at my program.

153
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,251
A deletion in your
short-term memory buffer.

154
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,379
Our chat in Astrometrics
never got filed.

155
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,381
That's why
I can't remember it.

156
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,715
Hmm...

157
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,634
If I were given to paranoia,

158
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,512
I'd say someone is trying
to keep me from finding out

159
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,681
what happened
18 months ago.

160
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,351
Hmm...

161
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,726
My photo album.

162
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,061
Doctor...

163
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,646
I was quite a
shutterbug back then.

164
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,190
Not a day went by

165
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,275
when I didn't record an
image for posterity.

166
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,486
Let's have a walk
down memory lane.

167
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,279
Meet me on Holodeck 2.

168
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,622
Computer, display
all holo-images

169
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,333
taken on
Stardate 50979.

170
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,751
COMPUTER:
<i>Those holo-images</i>
<i>have been deleted.</i>

171
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,546
Deleted? By whom?

172
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,589
COMPUTER:
<i>Unknown.</i>

173
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:15,972
I'm detecting residual photons
in the holo-buffer.

174
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,350
It may be possible to partially
reconstruct the images.

175
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,642
Try.

176
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,563
I've restored five images.

177
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,190
They are degraded but intact.

178
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,900
Let's see them.

179
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,570
The Mess Hall.

180
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,656
Do you remember this?
No.

181
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,118
Who is that?
The Ensign.

182
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,578
It seems to be
her birthday.

183
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,207
I've never seen her before.

184
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,753
The Ensign again.

185
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,464
I never went on a shuttle
mission with Harry Kim,

186
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,841
and certainly not with her.

187
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,636
And again.

188
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,285
I've isolated your memory files
from Stardate 50979.

189
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,494
They weren't deleted?

190
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,787
No.

191
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,080
Then why can't I remember them?

192
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,373
The program
was rewritten

193
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,208
to deny you access
to those memories.

194
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,877
I'm trying
to restore them.

195
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,881
<i>Here, here.</i>

196
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,174
ALL:
<i>Here, here.</i>

197
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,426
DOCTOR:
<i>Say cheese.</i>

198
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,843
ALL:
<i>Cheese. Cheese.</i>

199
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,055
What happened?

200
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,681
I was in
the Mess Hall.

201
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,850
The files are difficult
to localize.

202
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,936
The memories will be
out of sequence.

203
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,400
<i>What was that?</i>

204
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,568
<i>Our sensors are dead.</i>

205
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,361
PARIS:
<i>Make a wish.</i>

206
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,615
They've stopped.

207
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,284
One moment.

208
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,456
<i>Make a wish.</i>

209
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,050
<i>I'm gonna kill you.</i>

210
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,516
<i>Ensign, I haven't seen you</i>
<i>in months.</i>

211
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,143
<i>The price I pay for staying</i>
<i>in good health, I guess.</i>

212
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,728
<i>Acetylcholine,</i>
<i>25 microliters.</i>

213
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,065
( alarm bleeping )

214
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,484
<i>It's not helping.</i>

215
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,819
<i>I'm reading</i>
<i>massive synaptic failure.</i>

216
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,571
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i>

217
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,703
<i>This is the last one.</i>

218
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,997
<i>Say cheese.</i>

219
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,333
<i>Cheese.</i> 
<i>Cheese.</i>

220
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,926
Call the Captain.

221
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,436
I don't recognize this species.
Seven?

222
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,271
They are unknown
to the Borg.

223
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,315
Perhaps these images
have been manipulated.

224
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,816
No. They're real.

225
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,818
The image buffer
would've shown signs

226
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,986
of tampering.

227
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,779
I have
a different theory.

228
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,324
I believe there was an attack
on<i> Voyager</i> by this species,

229
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,661
and all our memories
of the event were erased.

230
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,040
This is the unknown
crewman I told you about,

231
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,791
Ensign Jetal.

232
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,003
The question is,
who was she?

233
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,298
An alien intruder posing
as a Starfleet Ensign?

234
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,301
Of course, it's impossible
to tell from a photograph,

235
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,346
but one thing is certain,
we are in immediate danger.

236
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,639
How so?

237
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,808
Only a few hours ago,

238
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,852
as I was beginning
this investigation,

239
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,021
someone shut
down my program,

240
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,275
and eliminated all my memories
of the last 24 hours.

241
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,943
An intruder may be on board.

242
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,030
Run a deck-by-deck
security sweep.

243
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,199
Understood.

244
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,868
Report to the Astrometrics Lab
and recalibrate the sensors.

245
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,036
See if you can

246
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,871
detect any cloaked
vessels nearby.

247
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,207
I'll review the medical records
of the rest of the crew.

248
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,000
Ensign Kim may not
have been the only one

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,877
who was injured
during the attack.

250
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,921
No. I want you to deactivate
yourself for now.

251
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,340
We'll erect a security field
around the main computer,

252
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,593
and encrypt all pathways
leading to your program.

253
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,637
If someone does try
to tamper with you again,

254
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,845
I want to be ready.

255
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,055
Captain--

256
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,557
It's for your own safety,
Doctor.

257
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,434
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

258
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,893
You will keep
me informed?

259
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,145
Absolutely.

260
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,105
Dismissed.

261
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,958
Computer...transfer my program

262
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,503
from the mobile emitter
to the Sick Bay systems.

263
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,464
COMPUTER:
<i>Transfer complete.</i>

264
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,260
Computer...

265
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,140
Duplicate all of my memory files

266
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,518
recorded within
the last 48 hours.

267
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,687
COMPUTER:
<i>Duplication complete.</i>

268
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:18,024
Now...I'm going offline.

269
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,361
If my program is altered
without my authorization,

270
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,156
reactivate me and restore
the duplicate memory files.

271
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,659
Interface with the holo-imaging
device.

272
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,577
If anybody enters this room,

273
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,205
commence imaging
in five second intervals.

274
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,541
COMPUTER:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

275
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,130
Computer, deactivate EMH.

276
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,841
( computer beeps )

277
00:14:55,936 --> 00:15:01,067
( door opens, closes )

278
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,668
( footsteps approaching )

279
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:23,757
( door opens, closes )

280
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,927
Please state
the nature

281
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,013
of the medical emergency.

282
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,433
Hello?

283
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,061
COMPUTER:
<i>Restoring memory files.</i>

284
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,232
<i>Restoration complete.</i>

285
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,975
Believe me, I was there.

286
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,268
So was I.

287
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,103
TUVOK:
Commander Chakotay
is correct.

288
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,980
Oh? And how
would you know?

289
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,733
In my youth, I studied
many forms of martial art,

290
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,568
including
the sumo of Earth.

291
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,570
I've followed the
sport ever since.

292
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,614
It was the
77th Emperor's Cup.

293
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,741
Takashi forced Kar-pek
out of the circle

294
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,493
in less than
three seconds.

295
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,035
I had a fifth row seat.

296
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,705
CHAKOTAY:
Then you must have been
ordering sake,

297
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,624
because Takashi's knee
broke the sand,

298
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,793
and the referee gave
the match to Kar-pek.

299
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,419
TUVOK:
Exactly.

300
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,839
If this is another house call,
it'll have to wait.

301
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,424
As you can see,
I've got a mutiny on my hands.

302
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,594
A mutiny? I suppose
that's better than a conspiracy.

303
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,098
Doctor.

304
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,767
Tell her, Captain.

305
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,479
Describe how you tampered with
my program,

306
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,857
how it was you
all along.

307
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,693
Perhaps you should accompany me
to Sick Bay, Doctor.

308
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,780
<i>Et tu,</i> Tuvok?

309
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,699
You're conspiring
against me, all of you.

310
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,033
Why?

311
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,913
In my ready room.

312
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,547
You've been manipulating
my program.

313
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,756
Don't deny it.

314
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,383
I don't intend to.

315
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,802
But...the alien ship,
the intruder,

316
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,804
did that attack
actually happen?

317
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,139
Yes. You were damaged
during the incident.

318
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,308
"Damaged"?

319
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,143
It caused a conflict
in your programming

320
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,645
that couldn't be resolved.

321
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,897
What kind of conflict?

322
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,857
I had no choice but
to deny you access

323
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,692
to your memories
of those events.

324
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,694
What kind of conflict?

325
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,029
If I told you that,
I might

326
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,697
set the whole thing
in motion again.

327
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,407
This "conflict"
in my programming...

328
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,658
Yes?
that's not good enough.

329
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,577
It'll have to be.
Captain!

330
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,704
I've made a command decision
for your own benefit,

331
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,372
and the welfare
of this entire crew.

332
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,665
I'm not willing to debate it.

333
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,667
How would you like it
if I operated on you

334
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,753
without your consent
or without your knowledge?

335
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,422
If the operation saved my life?
I could live with it.

336
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,673
I don't believe you.

337
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,550
You'd feel as violated
as I do right now.

338
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,886
Whether you believe me
or not is beside the point.

339
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,429
A year and a half ago,

340
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,890
the only solution was
to rewrite your program.

341
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,768
I have to perform
that same procedure now.

342
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,143
That isn't fair.

343
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,187
You're malfunctioning,

344
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,565
and you need to be repaired.

345
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,109
Return to Sick Bay
and wait for my orders.

346
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,787
( sighs )

347
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,760
( door opens )

348
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,970
Doctor.

349
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,596
What's happening?

350
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,681
What are you doing?

351
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,391
Lieutenant Torres
requires a copy

352
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,935
of your most recent
memory files,

353
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,227
including
the backups.

354
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,813
You're going
to rewrite my program.

355
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,731
The Captain thinks
it's for the best.

356
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,024
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,233
B'Elanna and Seven

358
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,986
are setting up the
procedure right now.

359
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,862
In the meantime,
you're to brief

360
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,365
Mr. Paris about any experiments
you're performing, any tests.

361
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,868
I'll be filling in
while your program's offline.

362
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,627
Okay. So you're running
some kind of cell analysis?

363
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,713
Yes.
Well, let's take a look.

364
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,048
What happened
18 months ago?

365
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,759
Doc...
Why won't the Captain tell me?

366
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,430
She has her reasons.
And you agree with her?

367
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,478
I was there...and yes,
I agree with her.

368
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,241
( classical theme playing )

369
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,555
( door chimes )

370
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,931
Come in.

371
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,938
Are you having
a little trouble regenerating?

372
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,650
My alcove is
functioning properly.

373
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,695
I am having trouble with
the nature of individuality.

374
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,405
( chuckles )

375
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,450
There's a time and a place
for philosophical discussion.

376
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,745
Two in the morning in my
quarters isn't one of them,

377
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,954
but I'll tell you what.

378
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,455
Meet me in the Mess Hall
tomorrow--

379
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,166
Tomorrow will
be too late.

380
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,835
We'll have already rewritten
the Doctor's program by then.

381
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,717
And violated his rights
as an individual.

382
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,052
Precisely.

383
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,679
If you've come to act
as my conscience,

384
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,014
you're a little late.

385
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,850
I considered these issues
18 months ago,

386
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,019
as I did again
this morning.

387
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,563
I came to the
same conclusion.

388
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,148
Your conclusion
is wrong.

389
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,989
Coffee, black.

390
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,958
Lukewarm.

391
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,334
Now I've told that replicator
a dozen times

392
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,629
about the temperature
of my coffee.

393
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,590
It just doesn't seem
to want to listen...

394
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,093
almost as if it's got
a mind of its own,

395
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,095
but it doesn't.

396
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,805
A replicator operates

397
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,599
through a series
of electronic pathways

398
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,434
that allow it

399
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,395
to receive instructions
and take appropriate action,

400
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,773
and there you go,
a cup of coffee,

401
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,900
a bowl of soup,
a plasma conduit,

402
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,027
whatever we tell it to do.

403
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,031
As difficult as it is
to accept...

404
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,742
the Doctor is
more like that replicator

405
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,452
than he is like us.

406
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,787
He would disagree.

407
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,371
I'm sure he would,

408
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,958
but I can't let that change
my decision.

409
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,876
I learned that the hard way,

410
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,087
when his program
almost self-destructed.

411
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,047
I won't take that risk again.

412
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,091
The risk isn't
yours to take.

413
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,011
If one of my crew
chose to put a phaser

414
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,888
to his own head,
should I let him?

415
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,432
It would depend
on the situation.

416
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,936
It always depends
on the situation, Seven,

417
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,148
but we can debate
philosophy another time.

418
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,735
When you separated me
from the collective,

419
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,070
I was an unknown risk

420
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,907
to your crew, yet
you kept me on board,

421
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,493
you allowed me to evolve
into an individual.

422
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,204
You're a human being.

423
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,080
He's a hologram.

424
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,458
And you allowed that hologram
to evolve as well,

425
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,752
to exceed
his original programming,

426
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,838
and yet, now you choose
to abandon him.

427
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,549
Objection noted.

428
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,509
Good night.

429
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,932
It is unsettling.

430
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,731
You say that I am a human being
and yet, I am also Borg...

431
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,692
part of me not unlike
your replicator...

432
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:25,612
not unlike the Doctor.

433
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,533
Will you one day choose
to abandon me as well?

434
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,618
I have always looked

435
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:37,041
to you as my example,
my guide to humanity.

436
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,586
Perhaps I've been mistaken.

437
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,213
Good night.

438
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,141
( door opens )

439
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,826
I'd like to think I made
my decision 18 months ago

440
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,494
for all the right reasons.

441
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:19,875
The truth is, my own biases
about what you are

442
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,460
had just as much
to do with it.

443
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,879
At the very least,

444
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,840
you deserve to know
exactly what happened...

445
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,135
if you're willing.

446
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,732
I'm ready.

447
00:24:55,786 --> 00:25:00,124
( console beeping )

448
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,042
PARIS:
You're standing on my foot.

449
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,461
DOCTOR:
I am not.

450
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,962
Shh...

451
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,422
( giggling )

452
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,756
If you ask me,
they should have

453
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,091
just locked
the turbolift...

454
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,843
Neelix...
the power's down.

455
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,304
Jetal to Torres.

456
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,847
TORRES:
Uh, go ahead,
Ensign.

457
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,016
Or should I say...

458
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,143
ALL:
Surprise!

459
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,979
( all clapping )

460
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:30,446
( jovial theme plays )

461
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,198
I'm gonna kill you.

462
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,952
I want you to go along on a
few of the shuttle surveys...

463
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,121
if I can talk you into it.
Another away mission?

464
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,956
Certainly.
I'm flattered.

465
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,416
I guess
the birthday girl and I

466
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,084
get the pleasure
of your company, Doc.

467
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,879
You launch at 1900 hours,
Shuttle Bay 1.

468
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,174
Hello, Doctor.

469
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,800
Ensign Jetal.

470
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,927
I haven't seen you
in months.

471
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,180
The price I pay
for staying in good health.

472
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,099
So, keeping busy
down on Deck 11?

473
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,558
Too busy.

474
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,769
We're modifying
one of the shuttles,

475
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,647
making it more maneuverable
and more...cool.

476
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,817
Hmm...I see you've been working
with Mr. Paris.

477
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,444
My condolences.

478
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,862
I thought
I picked up

479
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,281
a slight distortion
in subspace,

480
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,409
but it's not
there anymore.

481
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,369
Nothing on
our long-range sensors,

482
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,745
but a few
hydrogen atoms.

483
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,457
Candid shot?

484
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,000
DOCTOR:
Try to look natural.

485
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,752
At least
it's my good side.

486
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,799
Let's get one of the group.

487
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,891
( timer beeping )

488
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,809
This is
the last one.

489
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,977
Say cheese.

490
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,438
ALL:
Cheese.

491
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,231
Doctor, I have
a shuttle to fly.

492
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,774
Ah, yes.

493
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,070
What was that?

494
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,321
Our sensors are dead.

495
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,531
Power's being drained.

496
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,032
Shields and weapons
are offline.

497
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,409
How?

498
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,826
( alarm beeping )

499
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,833
( transporter whoosh )

500
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,842
( groans )

501
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,110
Doctor to<i> Voyager.</i>
Mayday.

502
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,528
We're under attack!

503
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,988
I've got wounded.
Mayday!

504
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,115
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Acknowledged, Doctor.</i>

505
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,326
<i>Set navigational controls</i>
<i>to return to</i> Voyager.

506
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,619
Commander, can
you hear me?

507
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,661
CHAKOTAY: Please respond.
Hello?

508
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,372
Computer,
engage auto navigation.

509
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,458
Lay in a course for<i> Voyager,</i>
full impulse.

510
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,666
Doctor...

511
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,876
Stay calm.

512
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,171
That weapon
carried quite a punch.

513
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,631
Is she okay?

514
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,633
She's unconscious.

515
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,092
<i>Voyager...</i>

516
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,844
We've lost contact.

517
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,473
I sent that alien
back to his ship.

518
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,890
You think they'd be grateful.

519
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,060
You should have beamed...
him...into space.

520
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,481
I'm not in the business
of killing people, Ensign.

521
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,815
( tricorder beeping )

522
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,066
Synaptic shock...?

523
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,110
But there was no neural damage.

524
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,322
Mr. Kim!

525
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,657
I don't understand!

526
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,744
Oh, no!

527
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,879
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Doctor, stand by for transport.</i>

528
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,089
Beam us directly to Sick Bay.

529
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,473
Prepare these people
for surgery.

530
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,436
PARIS:
Here, what happened?

531
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,063
DOCTOR:
We were fired on.

532
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,440
There's something wrong
with their nervous systems.

533
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,150
We've got to stabilize
their synapses.

534
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,527
Get me a choline compound.

535
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,736
Which choline compound?

536
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,904
It doesn't matter.

537
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,240
Just make sure
it's a pure base.

538
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,581
Her spinal cord's deteriorating.

539
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,544
Same rate of collapse.

540
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:16,796
Acetylcholine,
25 microliters.

541
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,675
( alarm beeping )

542
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,967
It's not helping.

543
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,886
I'm reading
massive synaptic failure.

544
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,972
This doesn't make any sense.

545
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,850
Paris to Engineering.

546
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,061
Transfer all available power
to Sick Bay.

547
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,646
TORRES:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

548
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,441
Some kind
of plasmic energy

549
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,735
is arcing between
their neural membranes.

550
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:41,071
That weapon...it was
designed to do this.

551
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,448
To leave a
residual charge

552
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,990
in the victim's body?

553
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,702
An energy pulse that remains
in the neural membranes,

554
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,412
working its way
up the spinal cord,

555
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,788
and into the brain.

556
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,123
They'll be dead in minutes

557
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,874
if we don't find
a way to stop it.

558
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,001
I've got to protect
their brain functions.

559
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,587
His neocortex
is failing.

560
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,088
A spinal shunt.

561
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,882
I'll isolate the spinal cord
from the brain stem...

562
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,676
until I can repair
the cellular damage.

563
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,010
But I don't have
time to perform

564
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,345
the procedure
on both of them.

565
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,639
Then talk me
through it.

566
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,432
We'll do them together.
It's too complex.

567
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,644
Then make a choice, before
we lose them both!

568
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,942
Subdermal scalpel.

569
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:24,030
( ominous theme playing )

570
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,828
Bioelectric
field generator.

571
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,169
( monitor beeping )

572
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,920
His vital signs
are stabilizing...

573
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,759
It's working.

574
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,093
Cellular regenerator.

575
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,231
His neural membranes
are reestablishing themselves.

576
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,693
Good...good.

577
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,653
( flatline tone )

578
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,091
The attack...

579
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,803
how did it end?

580
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,638
Were there more casualties?

581
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:35,060
We exchanged fire
for another few minutes,

582
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,646
then the aliens withdrew.

583
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,858
There was only
one casualty...

584
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,275
Ensign Jetal.

585
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,740
I don't mean to seem unfeeling,

586
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,743
but I'm programmed to accept
the loss of a patient

587
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,828
with professional
detachment.

588
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,634
We are assembled here today

589
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,136
to pay final respects
to our honored dead...

590
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,723
Ensign Ahni Jetal.

591
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,058
Her intelligence
and her charm

592
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,519
have made our
long journey home

593
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,521
seem not
quite so long.

594
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,733
As she continues on
a journey of her own,

595
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,527
we will keep her
in our hearts...

596
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,529
and in our memories.

597
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,624
DOCTOR:
We're low
on synthetic antigens,

598
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,041
and I'm sorry to report,

599
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,544
many of the medicinal plants
you've collected

600
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,880
over the past several months
were destroyed as well.

601
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,591
I have some herbs in storage
you might be able to use.

602
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,884
Been holding out on me?

603
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,093
No.

604
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,137
I was keeping them
around just in case.

605
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,680
Good planning.

606
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,599
As for the antigens,
I'll have

607
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,851
to start replicating
them in batches.

608
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,061
Which do you
want first?

609
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,648
Decisions, decisions.

610
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,904
How do you make
a decision, Mr. Neelix?

611
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,072
In general, I mean.

612
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:15,160
I guess I weigh the alternatives
and try to decide which is best.

613
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,956
Which is best?

614
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,124
How do you
determine that?

615
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,209
I never thought about it,
really.

616
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,086
Well, maybe you should...

617
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,005
think about it,
I mean.

618
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,675
I guess every situation
is a little different.

619
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,092
For me, it's rather simple.

620
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,970
While I'm faced
with a decision,

621
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,054
my program calculates
the variables,

622
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,431
and I take action.

623
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,809
For example, what
could be simpler

624
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,936
then a triage
situation in Sick Bay?

625
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:45,524
Two patients, for example,
both injured, for example,

626
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,652
both in imminent
danger of dying.

627
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,737
Calculate the variables.

628
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:54,407
My program needs to
ascertain which patient

629
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,369
has the greater
chance of survival,

630
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,871
and that's the
one I treat.

631
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,998
Oh!
Oh!

632
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:03,041
Simple.

633
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,419
But...what
if they have

634
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,006
an equal chance
of survival?

635
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,675
What then?

636
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,926
Hmm?

637
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,260
Flip a coin?

638
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,512
Pick a card?

639
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,805
Doctor...

640
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,973
Oh, I'm all right.

641
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,599
I'm a hologram.
I don't get injured.

642
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,894
I don't feel pain.
I don't die.

643
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:25,063
Unlike some people
I could tell you about.

644
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,858
For example, two patients,

645
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,067
both injured,

646
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,697
both in imminent
danger of...

647
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,448
Don't touch me.

648
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,658
I'm a hologram.

649
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,535
Photonic energy.
Don't waste your time.

650
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,828
Neelix to Security.

651
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,454
Send a team
to the Mess Hall, please.

652
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,082
A whole team, Mr. Neelix?

653
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,793
Throwing a little party,
are we?

654
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,922
Why, I attended a party
just recently.

655
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:53,050
A birthday party
for a very nice young woman.

656
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,469
I made a decision there too.

657
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,013
Several of them, in fact.

658
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,723
When I came through the door,

659
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,974
do I turn right,

660
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,475
or do I turn left?

661
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,896
As I recall,
I decided on...the latter.

662
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,397
Then, what should
I see before me,

663
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,690
but the hors d'oeuvre tray?

664
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,900
And another decision,

665
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,362
do I take a canapé...
or refuse?

666
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,573
Oh. That's an easy one.
I'm a hologram, I don't eat.

667
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,866
Something's wrong
with him.

668
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,076
Don't you know it's rude

669
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,869
to refer to somebody
in the third person?

670
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,579
You had a choice, Mr. Neelix,

671
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,957
"Should I do something rude
or not do something rude?"

672
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,960
Doctor, we must
return to Sick Bay.

673
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,461
Why should I?

674
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,504
What if I don't want
to return to Sick Bay?

675
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,839
What if I decide

676
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,467
not to return to Sick Bay?

677
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,719
No. I don't choose this.

678
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,554
Leave me alone! Let me go!

679
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,389
Why did she
have to die?

680
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,599
Why did I kill her?

681
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,434
Why did I decide
to kill her? Why?

682
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,978
Somebody tell me why!

683
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,730
It was downhill
from there.

684
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,941
You developed
a feedback loop

685
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,526
between your ethical and
cognitive subroutines.

686
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,403
You were having
the same thoughts

687
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,655
over and over again.

688
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,364
We couldn't stop it.

689
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,367
Our only option was to erase
your memories of those events.

690
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,620
You were right.

691
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,414
I didn't deserve
to keep those memories...

692
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,540
not after what I did.

693
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,501
You were performing
your duty.

694
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,753
Two patients,
which do I kill?

695
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,797
Doctor...
Doctor? Hardly.

696
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,466
A doctor retains
his objectivity.

697
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,093
I didn't do that, did I?

698
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,762
Two patients,
equal chances of survival,

699
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,181
and I chose the one
I was closer to?

700
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,350
I chose my friend?

701
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,601
That's not
in my programming.

702
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,227
That's not what I
was designed to do!

703
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,437
Go ahead!

704
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,897
Reprogram me!
I'll lend you a hand!

705
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,482
Let's start with
this very day,

706
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,692
this hour, this second!

707
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,486
Computer, deactivate the EMH.

708
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,904
( computer beeps )

709
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,159
Here we go again.

710
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,788
Captain?

711
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,625
It's as though there's a battle
being fought inside him...

712
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,837
between his
original programming...

713
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,882
and what he's become.

714
00:36:56,882 --> 00:37:01,511
Our solution was
to end that battle.

715
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,805
What if we were wrong?

716
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,765
We've seen what happens to him.

717
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,600
In fact, we've seen it twice.

718
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,938
Still...we allowed him
to evolve,

719
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,607
and at the first sign
of trouble...

720
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,408
We gave him a soul, B'Elanna.

721
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,078
Do we have the right
to take it away now?

722
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:30,082
We gave him
personality subroutines.

723
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,584
I'd hardly call that a soul.

724
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,416
Captain.

725
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,002
I'm having trouble...

726
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,922
with the nature
of individuality.

727
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,758
You require
a philosophical discussion.

728
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,760
There's a time and
a place for it.

729
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,470
This is one of them.

730
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,184
After I freed you
from the collective...

731
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,481
you were transformed.

732
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,691
It's been a
difficult process.

733
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,112
Was it worth it?

734
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,447
I had no choice.

735
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,324
That's not what I asked you.

736
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,704
If I could
change what happened...

737
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:55,250
erase what you did to me...
would I?

738
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,755
No.

739
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,469
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

740
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,306
<i>Our Doctor is now our patient.</i>

741
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,266
<i>It's been two weeks</i>
<i>since I've ordered</i>

742
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,934
<i>a 'round-the-clock vigil.</i>

743
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,854
<i>A crew member has stayed</i>
<i>with him at all times,</i>

744
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,649
<i>offering a sounding board</i>
<i>and a familiar presence,</i>

745
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,526
<i>while he struggles</i>
<i>to understand</i>

746
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,653
<i>his memories and his thoughts.</i>

747
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:27,490
<i>The chances of recovery...</i>
<i>uncertain.</i>

748
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:41,296
The more I think about it...

749
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,588
the more I realize

750
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,966
there's nothing I could've
done differently.

751
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:48,928
What do you mean?

752
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,808
The primordial atom burst,
sending out its radiation,

753
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,061
setting everything in motion.

754
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,771
One particle
collides with another,

755
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,774
gases expand,
planets contract,

756
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,484
and before you know it,

757
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,695
we've got starships
and holodecks,

758
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,989
and...chicken soup.

759
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,784
In fact, you can't help
but have starships,

760
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,870
and holodecks,
and chicken soup,

761
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,374
because it was all determined
20 billion years ago!

762
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:21,127
There is a certain
logic to your logic.

763
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,463
Progress?

764
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,050
I'm not sure if he's making
any sense of this experience,

765
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,886
or if his program's
just running in circles.

766
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,971
You've been here
for 16 hours.

767
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,807
Let me continue
while you rest.

768
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,809
I'll be all right.

769
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,895
Go back to the Bridge.

770
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,910
How can you read
at a time like this?

771
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,662
It helps me think.

772
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,749
Think? What do you need
to think about?

773
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:04,170
You. This book is relevant
to your situation.

774
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,548
Oh? What is it?

775
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,844
Poetry...written on Earth

776
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:16,808
a thousand years ago,
<i>La Vita Nuova.</i>

777
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:20,145
<i>La Vita Nuova,</i>
"The New Life"? Ha!

778
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,688
Tell that to Ensign Jetal.

779
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,817
Actually...

780
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,194
I killed her countless times.

781
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,948
What do you mean?

782
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:35,534
Causality, probability.

783
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:39,538
For every action, there's
an infinite number of reactions,

784
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:43,626
and in each one of them,
I killed her!

785
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,631
Or did I?

786
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,180
Too many possibilities...

787
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,767
Too many pathways
for my program to follow...

788
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,105
Impossible to choose...

789
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,195
Still, I...

790
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:13,572
I can't live with the knowledge
of what I've done.

791
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,616
I can't.

792
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,329
Captain?

793
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,793
Captain?
( gasping ):
Oh, sorry.

794
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,004
How could you sleep
at a time like this?

795
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,547
Well, it's been
a long day.

796
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,840
You were saying...?

797
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,091
What's wrong?

798
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,469
Nothing.

799
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:35,928
You're ill.
I have a headache.

800
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,138
Fever. You have

801
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,473
a fever.
I'll live.

802
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,807
Medical emergency!
Doctor...

803
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,600
Someone's got
to treat you immediately.

804
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,102
Call Mr. Paris.
You've got to get

805
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,312
to Sick Bay!

806
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,771
Doctor...

807
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,650
I'm a little
busy right now...

808
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,819
helping a friend.

809
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:00,245
I...I'll be all right.

810
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:04,707
Go. Sleep. Please.

811
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,918
I'll still be here
in the morning.

812
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,128
Sure?

813
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,131
Yes. Please.

814
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,843
I don't want to be responsible
for any more suffering.

815
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,613
Good night.

816
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,282
If you need anything...

817
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,824
I'll call.

818
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,535
Thank you, Captain.

819
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:29,501
<i>In that book,</i>
<i>which is my memory...</i>

820
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:32,003
<i>On the first page</i>
<i>of the chapter,</i>

821
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:38,092
<i>that is the day</i>
<i>when I first met you...</i>

822
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:44,849
<i>Appear the words,</i>
<i>"Here begins a new life."</i>

823
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:13,336
