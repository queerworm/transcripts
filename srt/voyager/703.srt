1
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,345
What's the matter, Harry?
You look a little pale.

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,349
I volunteered for a test flight,
not a suicide mission.

3
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,809
How can we put the new
<i>Delta Flyer</i> through her paces

4
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,853
without taking a few risks?

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,105
[groans]

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,317
Another risk like that, and we'll have
to rebuild her all over again.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,861
-[chuckles]
-[console beeping]

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:31,031
There's a vessel coming up fast
off our starboard beam.

9
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,115
Shields.

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,535
Range, 50 kilometers.

11
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,702
Ten.

12
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,246
It's pulling alongside.

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,333
Wow. Nice ship.

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,126
-It's scanning us.
-[intercom beeps]

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,297
This is Lieutenant Tom Paris.
Please identify yourself.

16
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,676
[woman] <i>Vectored exhaust ports,</i>
<i>accelerated driver coils...</i>

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,970
<i>Your vessel must be fast.</i>

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,847
Gets us where we want to go.

19
00:00:55,931 --> 00:01:00,561
<i>Check your scanners. You'll see a comet</i>
<i>on the other side of the asteroid field.</i>

20
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,605
<i>I wonder which of our ships</i>
<i>could get there first.</i>

21
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,399
Sounds like a challenge.

22
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,276
<i>Are you going to accept?</i>

23
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,821
We are not going to race her.

24
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,407
-This is a test flight, right?
-Yeah, but--

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,158
What better way to test the new ship

26
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,120
than to see how it stands up
to a little competition.

27
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,290
We're ready over here.
Should I count to three?

28
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,042
Guess not.

29
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,282
She's a lot more maneuverable
than we are.

30
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,868
Not that I'm endorsing
this misguided exercise,

31
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,704
but maybe we can even the odds.

32
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:29,584
-The new impulse thrusters.
-Ah. Now, that's the spirit, Harry.

33
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,054
We're catching up.
A hundred meters. Fifty.

34
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,766
Bring the backup generators on line
and reroute power to the thrusters.

35
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,741
And it's the <i>Delta Flyer </i>by a nose.

36
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,035
-[alarm beeps]
-Something's wrong with her ship.

37
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,288
The cabin's filling up with nyocene gas.

38
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,331
Stand by for emergency transport.

39
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,796
[coughs]

40
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,883
You all right?

41
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,093
I think so.

42
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,554
I told you this wasn't a good idea.

43
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,890
Oh, does that mean
you're afraid to try again?

44
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,893
Yeah, Harry? You afraid?

45
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,605
No. Of course not. It's just...

46
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,774
your ship is in no shape for a rematch.

47
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,234
My power transformer overloaded.

48
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,445
I bet we could find you a spare
back on <i>Voyager.</i>

49
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,156
We were about to head back
anyway. Right, Tom?

50
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,867
Yeah, whatever you say, Ensign Eager.

51
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,209
I've been looking forward
to my holodeck time all week.

52
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,711
Why can't you borrow three hours
from someone else?

53
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,297
Yours are the last piece to the puzzle.

54
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,636
Tom and I have finally managed
to get a weekend off together.

55
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,679
I've been trading favors
with members of the crew,

56
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,556
so that we could get
the holodeck to ourselves.

57
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,892
-A romantic getaway.
-Well, that's the idea. Yes.

58
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,729
Well... ordinarily,
I wouldn't hesitate to oblige,

59
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,857
but I've been looking forward
to indulging myself in a new hobby.

60
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,652
Something human doctors have
been enjoying for centuries.

61
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,615
I've already booked a tee time.

62
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,575
[sighs]
Well...

63
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,162
if your tee time is more important
than our happiness...

64
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:34,000
our first chance to be alone in months...

65
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,752
Fine.

66
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,171
Take my three hours.

67
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,756
Thank you.

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,008
So, what program are you planning to run?

69
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,970
-Something new called Gedi Prime.
-I've heard of that.

70
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:49,432
The vacation paradise
that makes Risa look like a tourist trap.

71
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,645
Endless kilometers of crystalline beaches,
mood reefs, bioluminescent waterfalls...

72
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,731
And a championship golf course,
if I'm not mistaken.

73
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,567
Why don't I just join you?

74
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,944
Somehow, I don't think
that would add to the mood.

75
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,739
Don't be so sure.
You haven't seen me in a bathing suit.

76
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,871
Could you hand me
the veridium injector?

77
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,004
Veridium injector...
Uh... let's see.

78
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,882
The one with the long handle.

79
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,218
Of course!

80
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,389
[sighs]

81
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,437
-Comfortable.
-My copilot thinks so, too.

82
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,147
Copilot?

83
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,900
I was on my way to meet him
when I ran into you.

84
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,030
So, tell me more
about where you're from.

85
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,951
It's a small trinary system
about half a parsec from here.

86
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,746
Three suns. It must make
for some long days.

87
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,043
Are you always this inquisitive?

88
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,130
That depends on who I'm talking to.

89
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:06,092
Your new power transformer
is installed and ready to go.

90
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,552
Thanks.

91
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,679
And your impulse drive
is a real beauty.

92
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,306
I designed it myself.

93
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,853
But I couldn't help noticing,
your warp system seems so rudimentary.

94
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,773
Warp's fine, if you like
going fast in a straight line,

95
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,817
but, to me, that's just physics,
not flying.

96
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,736
I guess it's a matter of taste.

97
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:30,033
Anyway, for the kind of flying
I'm here for, warp is not a factor.

98
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,786
The race course is only
two billion kilometers long.

99
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,037
Race course?

100
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,331
What kind of race course?

101
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,583
[Paris]
The Antarian Trans-Stellar Rally.

102
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,212
Three segments covering
2.3 billion kilometers.

103
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,174
With obstacles ranging from
dwarf star clusters to K-class anomalies.

104
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:50,512
Two-man crews, and most importantly,
each ship is limited to sublight speeds.

105
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,349
It... It is the ultimate test
of ship design and piloting skills.

106
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,727
Not to mention a serious drain
on <i>Voyager's</i> resources.

107
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,440
You're suggesting we reassign 15 crewmen
to modify the <i>Delta Flyer?</i>

108
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,859
The race has very specific guidelines.

109
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,196
All of the ships have to use
enriched deuterium fuel.

110
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,156
The <i>Delta Flyer's </i>not equipped for that.

111
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,951
Irina agreed to lend us a fuel converter.

112
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,830
Captain, this race is more
than just a sporting event.

113
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,082
Until recently,
this region was a war zone.

114
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,293
Four different species fought
for nearly a century to control it.

115
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,255
Now, for the first time,
they're competing peacefully

116
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,382
to commemorate the new treaty
that ended the war.

117
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,510
This race embodies everything
the Federation values...

118
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,388
a peaceful coexistence,
a free exchange of ideas--

119
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,265
I think it's a great idea.

120
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,393
-You do?
-You do?

121
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,811
Absolutely.

122
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,940
This competition is just
the sort of break we need.

123
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,484
It would give us a chance
to make some friends

124
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,571
and allow the crew a little R&amp;R.

125
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,866
Request granted.

126
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,493
Thank you, Captain.

127
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,746
One thing, gentlemen.

128
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,082
Now that we're in this race,
we're in it to win.

129
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,543
After all, Starfleet's honor is at stake.

130
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:09,132
-Don't worry. It's in good hands.
-[door opens, closes]

131
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,809
[door opens, closes]

132
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,652
A little tip, Doc.

133
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,989
This game was not meant
to be played indoors.

134
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,283
Here to rub salt in the wound?

135
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,077
I beg your pardon?

136
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,496
I planned to be putting
the greens at St. Andrews.

137
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,459
Instead, I'm putting into beakers
in Sick Bay, thanks to you.

138
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,252
-Me?
-Oh, don't be coy.

139
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,004
I've already approved your time off.

140
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,674
The captain's told you
about the race already?

141
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,844
What race? I was referring
to your romantic getaway.

142
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,349
Oh, no.

143
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,850
Don't tell me you forgot.

144
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,020
Uh, do me a favor, Doc.
Keep a lock on my bio-signs.

145
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,355
What for?

146
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,691
Because, in about five minutes, there may
be a medical emergency in Engineering.

147
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,613
Maybe I can get that tee time back.

148
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,076
Oh.

149
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,127
-Hi.
-You're early.

150
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,261
You packed?

151
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,929
Not yet.

152
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:42,851
Um, actually...
there might be a little problem.

153
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:43,935
Problem?

154
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,692
I have a chance to pilot the <i>Flyer</i>
in a race, a really unique race,

155
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,695
and the captain thinks it's a great idea.

156
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,949
So, I guess I got so excited
that I forgot about our plans.

157
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:03,288
But I don't have to do it.
The captain would understand.

158
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,248
-It's all right.
-No, no, I should have remembered.

159
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,251
It's just that this seemed like
such an amazing opportunity.

160
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,212
-Pilots from all over--
-I said it's okay.

161
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,966
Really?

162
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,012
The holodeck will always be here.
This race won't.

163
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,768
I do not deserve you.

164
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,770
You're right about that.

165
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,526
So, um, we'll plan this vacation
for another time.

166
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,029
-Sure.
-Okay. I'm going to make this up to you.

167
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,405
I promise.

168
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,043
Late night?

169
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,715
-Can I get you anything?
-No, thanks.

170
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,095
[groans]

171
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,556
-Are you okay?
-Oh, my feet. Ah!

172
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,309
I haven't had a chance
to sit down all day.

173
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,229
If you're thinking of cheering me up,
don't bother.

174
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,690
[groans]
Who, me? Never.

175
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,902
And, by the way, you can have
your holodeck time back.

176
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,363
What about your weekend with Tom?

177
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,989
He just canceled it.

178
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,411
Does he have any idea
how much planning it took?

179
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,082
No. And you're not going
to tell him, either.

180
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,006
He just entered this big race,
and he's really excited, and...

181
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,800
I don't want to spoil it for him.

182
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,596
Well, I'm sure if you tell him
how important this weekend was to you,

183
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,056
he'll reconsider.

184
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,101
Probably.

185
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,187
But he should be able
to do what makes him happy.

186
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,565
What about what makes you happy?

187
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,444
It's time I faced facts, Neelix.

188
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,991
Tom and I just don't belong together.

189
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,704
Then you're not in love
with him anymore?

190
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,122
I didn't say that.

191
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:14,419
But, B'Elanna,
if you still love each other...

192
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,546
Maybe that isn't enough.

193
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,050
Call me a hopeless romantic,
but I still think it is.

194
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,515
Yeah, well, there's a Klingon phrase
that my grandmother used to use.

195
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,934
<i>Mok'tah.</i>

196
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,603
It means "bad match."

197
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,814
That's what Tom and I are.

198
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,279
I just hate that it's taken me
three years to realize it.

199
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,161
If you're really such a <i>mok'tah,</i>
it must have been an awful three years.

200
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,747
No.

201
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,499
Tom is a great guy,

202
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,294
and we've had a lot of fun together.

203
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,504
And that seems to be enough for him.

204
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,967
But not for me.

205
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,804
Why aren't you saying
all this to Tom?

206
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,266
I plan to... after the race.

207
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,313
By which time, he'll already
have disappointed you again.

208
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,028
I may not know as much about
Klingon tradition as your grandmother,

209
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,824
but, somehow, keeping Tom in the dark
doesn't seem very honorable.

210
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,708
My feet are feeling better.
I should go back to work.

211
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,552
[Janeway]
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 54058.6.</i>

212
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,390
<i>Our request to enter the </i>Delta Flyer
<i>into the rally has been accepted.</i>

213
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,935
<i>I'm meeting with the race coordinator,</i>
<i>Ambassador O'Zaal,</i>

214
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,770
<i>to work out the details.</i>

215
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,730
We have teams that have traveled
quite a distance, Captain,

216
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,649
but none from as far
as the Alpha Quadrant.

217
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,985
We're always willing to go
that extra light-year for a good cause.

218
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,990
Well, your, uh, entrance petition
seems to be in order.

219
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:12,412
The <i>Delta Flyer </i>meets our guidelines.
Now, all you have to do is win.

220
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,789
Something tells me the other teams
aren't going to make that too easy.

221
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,332
-[intercom beeps]
-[Tuvok] <i>Bridge to the captain.</i>

222
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,708
Go ahead, Commander.

223
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,170
<i>There is an incoming transmission</i>
<i>for the ambassador.</i>

224
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,255
Route it here.

225
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,060
I asked not to be disturbed.

226
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,896
<i>I'm sorry, but the Aksani</i>
<i>are threatening to withdraw</i>

227
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,774
<i>unless they're allowed to host</i>
<i>the post-race ceremony.</i>

228
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,943
Did you explain that we've already
promised that to the Chessu?

229
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,572
<i>Yes. They said</i>
<i>that was... unacceptable.</i>

230
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,744
Arrange for another meeting. I'll have
to find some way of appeasing them.

231
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,371
[ends transmission]

232
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,168
Well, I hope the race you just entered
doesn't end before it begins.

233
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,963
-It's that serious?
-The peace is still very fragile.

234
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,592
Every decision I make, no matter
how trivial, is looked upon as symbolic.

235
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,303
So, every time you make a concession
to one participant...

236
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,473
-Another is offended, yes.
-Maybe we can help.

237
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,475
That would be wonderful, but how?

238
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,563
By providing neutral ground
for the pre- and post-race activities.

239
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,565
Since we've never taken sides
in your conflict,

240
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,443
you couldn't be accused
of showing favoritism.

241
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,488
If your racing skills are as sharp
as your diplomatic instincts,

242
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,823
the other teams won't have a chance.

243
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,743
[people speaking indistinctly]

244
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,632
There's someone to watch out for.

245
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,342
What's his story?

246
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:54,013
His name is Assan. He was a fighter pilot,
one of the most ruthless.

247
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,266
[clears throat]

248
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,896
-Uh, where you going?
-A little personal reconnaissance.

249
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,731
We are the hosts.

250
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,779
Lieutenant Tom Paris.
Welcome aboard.

251
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,246
Could I get you something? A drink?
Something to eat? Tour of the ship?

252
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,957
Were you assigned to serve me?

253
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,334
Um, not exactly.

254
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,670
Are we friends?

255
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,296
I guess not.

256
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,676
Then you must be one of those pilots
who believes in the fellowship of combat.

257
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,471
[chuckles]
Correct me if I'm wrong, but...

258
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,432
I thought this was
a friendly race, not a battle.

259
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,853
If that's what you believe,
then you've already lost.

260
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,440
Well...

261
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,317
Nice chatting with you.

262
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,407
Learn anything?

263
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,243
Yeah, I should leave
the hosting to Neelix.

264
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,953
-Joxom!
-Who?

265
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,040
-My copilot.
-Irina. Hi.

266
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,376
Oh, looks like they're good friends.

267
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,877
-They're teammates.
-Mm.

268
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,257
Close, personal teammates.

269
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,093
Oh, it was nice while it lasted.

270
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,095
Come on.

271
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,686
Seven, I need you to run a diagnostic
on the lateral sensor array.

272
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,939
-As soon as I'm finished.
-With what?

273
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,693
Plotting the most efficient course
for the first segment of the rally.

274
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,405
Seems like the entire crew
has come down with race fever.

275
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,533
Perhaps you could persuade the Doctor
to develop a vaccine.

276
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,622
I'm surprised you're
putting time into this.

277
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,458
Initially, I did find
the activity irrelevant,

278
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,711
but then, I realized that it's important
for the crew's morale

279
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,505
and for my relationship
with Lieutenant Paris.

280
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,800
[scoffs] Your relationship
with Lieutenant Paris?

281
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,970
I was speaking professionally.

282
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,140
I often work with him
on navigational problems.

283
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,476
He can be an erratic individual,

284
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,146
but he's also a very competent officer
and, clearly, a skilled pilot.

285
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,650
It's the erratic individual
that takes getting used to.

286
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,235
No doubt.

287
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,905
But I've learned that if I embrace
some of his interests,

288
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,990
support him in his personal goals,

289
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,618
we're able to function
more efficiently as crewmates.

290
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,756
[hatch opens]

291
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,633
Harry, where have you been?

292
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,760
[Torres]
Say "<i>Qapla'.</i>"

293
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,099
It means "success."
I just wanted to capture the moment,

294
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,018
not to mention that cute,
bewildered expression.

295
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,062
What are you doing in that flight suit?

296
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,898
There's been a change of plans.
I'm your new copilot.

297
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,191
[chuckles]

298
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,402
Look, I don't have time
for practical jokes.

299
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:58,197
Neither do I. Ready to bring
that impulse drive on line?

300
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,324
-B'Elanna--
-Okay.

301
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,869
I was upset that you canceled
our weekend, but then, I realized...

302
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,122
why should we spend this time apart

303
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,833
when we can be together
doing something you like?

304
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,293
What about Harry?

305
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,506
I assigned him to a level-5
diagnostic in Engineering.

306
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,924
Oh, that's terrible.

307
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,634
I'm just kidding.

308
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,430
I told him how hard it was for us
to get time together, and he understood.

309
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:27,435
Anyway, the way I see it, you're trading
an ensign for a chief engineer.

310
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:34,775
Well, you don't have to convince me.
I couldn't ask for a better copilot.

311
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,155
Now, just remember,
we're not on vacation.

312
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,115
The point is to win.

313
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,743
And you know how much I hate to lose.

314
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,081
Thrusters on line.
Opening Shuttle Bay doors.

315
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,170
The racers are moving into position.

316
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:58,549
Ambassador.

317
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,181
Welcome to the first running
of the Antarian Trans-Stellar Rally.

318
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,267
This moment marks a hopeful point
in our shared history,

319
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,811
<i>a chance to put aside old animosities</i>

320
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:15,399
<i>and come together in a spirit of peace</i>
<i>and friendly competition.</i>

321
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,611
<i>Good luck to all of you.</i>
<i>Prepare for the starting signal.</i>

322
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,619
Captain, the honor is yours.

323
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,038
Mr. Tuvok...

324
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,166
Fire.

325
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,109
We passed two more ships,
three still ahead of us.

326
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,444
How's my impulse engine?

327
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,572
Hot, but stable,
thanks to the new fuel converter.

328
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,159
That was the Number 8 ship.

329
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,702
Assan.

330
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,331
Whoever it is just grazed our shields.
Port thrusters are off-line.

331
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,542
Compensating.

332
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,794
Well, that was an old trick.

333
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,421
Back at the Academy,
we used to call that "scraping."

334
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,424
Well, Assan just almost
scraped us out of the race.

335
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,928
-How are we doing on time?
-Twenty seconds to the third marker.

336
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,848
Assan's already rounding it,
thanks to his little tactic.

337
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,642
Well, it's a long race.

338
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,852
We'll catch him.

339
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,648
How's our team doing?

340
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,569
I announced the <i>Delta Flyer's </i>progress
over the comm 11 minutes ago.

341
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,865
In a race like this,
11 minutes can be an eternity!

342
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,955
The <i>Delta Flyer</i> is in fourth position,
having completed 62% of the course.

343
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,042
The Aksani vessel is in third position,
having completed 68% of the course.

344
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:01,297
-You don't make it sound very exciting.
-I'm relaying the relevant information.

345
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,966
It's all in the delivery. Do you mind?

346
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,469
-[intercom beeps]
-Attention, all hands.

347
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,638
<i>Stand by for a race update!</i>

348
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,808
With only 58 million kilometers
left in the first segment,

349
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,228
the Aksani, Imhotep, and Terrellian ships
are still battling for the lead.

350
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,232
Wait. The Number 8 ship just cut off
the Number 3 in the Darla system.

351
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,692
Now, 3's changing course.

352
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,736
Using the gravity from a gas giant
to boost its speed,

353
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,362
it's making up for lost ground!

354
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:29,491
-Sounds like quite a race.
-Apparently, it's all in the delivery.

355
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:37,958
So much for the Aksani.
Now, it's just down to Irina and Assan.

356
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:41,253
In a few minutes, they'll just be echoes
in our aft scanners.

357
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,715
[chuckles] Well, we've still got
the Mobius Inversion coming up.

358
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,842
The what?

359
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,386
Tell me you read the course manual.

360
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,640
I skimmed it... more or less.

361
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,267
Oh, great.

362
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,020
So, what exactly
is this Mobius whatever?

363
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,480
Take a look.

364
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:04,026
Covers the entire last third
of the course.

365
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,696
Level-6 subspace distortions,
gravimetric shears.

366
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,617
Just think of it as a little wormhole
with a big attitude.

367
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,163
The Terrellian and Imhotep ships
are still in the lead,

368
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,248
the <i>Delta Flyer</i> trailing
by a few seconds.

369
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,251
Meanwhile, the two Chessu ships
are continuing to advance,

370
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,128
claiming fourth and fifth position.

371
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,631
-My weekly security report.
-I'll read it later.

372
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,091
There are a few matters
we should discuss.

373
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,968
She said later, Tuvok.

374
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,096
Something's wrong.
They're disappearing.

375
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,974
Radiation from the Mobius Inversion
is blocking our sensors.

376
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,642
How will we track their progress?

377
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,646
We can't. Not until they emerge
from the other side of the anomaly.

378
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,232
Want to talk about
that report now, Tuvok?

379
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,442
Later, if that's permissible.

380
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,361
Fifty meters.

381
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,571
Forty.

382
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,031
We can get through.

383
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,201
-No, they're too close to each other.
-I'm reversing our deflector polarity.

384
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:58,038
It'll repel their shields. Why wait
for an opening when you can make one?

385
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,332
-No, it's too risky.
-Too risky?

386
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,418
That doesn't sound
like the Tom Paris I know.

387
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,295
-What are you doing?
-Deploying auxiliary thrusters.

388
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,339
We'll need the extra maneuvering power
to get through the gap.

389
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,216
-B'Elanna--
-Just steer the ship.

390
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,093
[sighs]

391
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,689
It's them. It's the <i>Delta Flyer.</i>
They're in the lead!

392
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,607
They're pulling away!

393
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,610
-We did it!
-You should have waited.

394
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,030
-I saw a chance and I took it.
-I'm the pilot.

395
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,032
-That means I do the flying.
-[intercom beeps]

396
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,410
[O'Zaal] <i>Attention, all racers.</i>
<i>There's been an accident.</i>

397
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,454
<i>Stay in order</i>
<i>and shut down your engines.</i>

398
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,547
[tricorder beeping]

399
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,805
-Report.
-[Doctor] His condition is stabilizing.

400
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,309
I should be able to start
dermal regeneration in a few hours.

401
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,352
-[Irina] This was Assan's fault.
-Why?

402
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,773
He collided with me so many times,
my shield generator overloaded.

403
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,901
Joxom's console exploded.
He's lucky he's alive.

404
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,114
If I'm guilty of anything,
it's of coming in second,

405
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,409
a situation I'll remedy in the next leg.

406
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,828
[sighs] You're doing a poor job
of defending yourself.

407
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,664
We may have had something
to do with this, too.

408
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,085
We grazed both of their shields
while in the anomaly.

409
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,503
Intentionally?

410
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:31,423
It was a tight course.
Everyone was flying very aggressively.

411
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,426
Your team is not responsible, Captain.

412
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,012
My generators were already overloading
when they made contact.

413
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,848
Perhaps none of you is to blame.

414
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:45,020
I found this interfaced
with her ship's shield generator.

415
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:52,277
I ran an analysis. It's a phase inverter,
designed to cause a system overload.

416
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,406
It's hard to believe someone would go
this far just to knock a competitor

417
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,866
out of the race.

418
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,995
This may be more than a simple case
of cheating, Captain.

419
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,999
I think someone's trying
to end the peace.

420
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,717
Maybe I'm missing something, but we're
talking about a single act of sabotage.

421
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,511
How does that threaten your treaty?

422
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,972
By itself, it wouldn't...

423
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,809
but we've received several threats
of a more serious nature.

424
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:27,020
-From whom?
-Groups opposed to the alliance.

425
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,482
Arms dealers, isolationists,
political extremists.

426
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,068
Up until now, I wasn't sure
how seriously to take them.

427
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,363
-Clearly, they pose a security threat.
-Yes, yes.

428
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:40,284
We've done everything we could to protect
the racers, but that may not be enough.

429
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,164
I don't want to risk any more lives.

430
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,665
We should cancel the race
or at least postpone it,

431
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,667
until we can guarantee
everyone's safety.

432
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:54,339
No. If we stop now,
we'll be letting these extremists win.

433
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,758
She's right.

434
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,222
Very well, then.

435
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:06,018
If that's the consensus,
we'll resume tomorrow as scheduled.

436
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,521
Of course, Captain, if you decide
to withdraw, we'd understand.

437
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,941
Well, the last time I checked,
I believe we were winning.

438
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,577
There you are.
Congratulations on taking the lead.

439
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,496
-Thanks.
-Of course, uh, you're not going to win.

440
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,540
-Why is that?
-Because we are.

441
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,919
You're looking at your new copilot.

442
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,005
I checked with one of the race officials.
It's perfectly legal,

443
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,092
and it's a chance for both of us
to get back in the race.

444
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,720
I appreciate the gesture,
but my ship's damaged.

445
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,598
You don't know our Harry.
Once he sets his mind on something...

446
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:48,268
He'll not only fix your ship,
he'll polish the bulkheads.

447
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,979
How can you turn me down?

448
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,731
Apparently, I can't.

449
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,198
Come on, you can say it.

450
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,033
It's embarrassing.

451
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,744
I just want to make sure
we're clear on what we're doing.

452
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:11,041
"Right at the light,
then readjust my sight."

453
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,043
Meaning?

454
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:16,004
Come about 86 degrees at the red giant,

455
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,549
then recalibrate sensors to compensate
for photonic interference.

456
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,093
Great. Next?

457
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,054
Do I really have to spend my morning
reciting nursery rhymes?

458
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,181
It got me through the Academy.

459
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,849
You were expelled.

460
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,814
Okay, repeat after me.

461
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,817
"I am not the pilot.
I will not attempt to fly this ship."

462
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,361
That one doesn't even rhyme.

463
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,363
-Uh...
-[hatch opens]

464
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,864
Anyone home?

465
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,159
-Well, if it isn't our competition.
-Here to spy on us?

466
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,912
I just stopped by to borrow
a hyperspanner.

467
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,581
Looks like you didn't get much sleep.

468
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,751
-Irina and I were up all night.
-Oh, really?

469
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,504
-Making repairs.
-Uh-huh.

470
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,174
To be honest, I can't remember
the last time I had so much fun.

471
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,387
She's funny, smart,
we get along without trying.

472
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,558
I'm going to ask her if she wants to spend
some time on <i>Voyager </i>after the race.

473
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,310
What about Joxom?

474
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,730
Turns out they're just teammates.

475
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,606
-I know what you're going to say.
-No, no.

476
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,276
Actually, I was just going
to congratulate you.

477
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,739
I mean, she's not a Borg,
she's not a hologram, and she's not dead.

478
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,491
Looks like you might have finally
found yourself the perfect woman.

What glow?

You know, that look you get
when you first meet someone.

493
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,421
Yeah. His cheeks were
a little redder than usual.

494
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:26,927
We're through the pulsars.
Harry and Irina are right behind us.

495
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,097
You can ease up off the thrusters now.

496
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,474
I want to conserve some fuel
for the final leg.

497

they might even have a future together.

to be planning a wedding.

00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,824
No, I just meant that some people just
fit together without having to work at it.

503
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,244
And other people,
no matter how much they try...

504
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,913
Are we talking about them or us?

505
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,164
What?

506
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,543
No, I didn't--

507
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,379
If something's bothering you,
let's talk about it.

508
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,341
We should concentrate on the race.

509
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,760
[sighs]

510
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,264
[console beeping]

511
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,143
Well, maybe Harry and Irina
aren't such a great team after all.

512
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,228
They're falling behind.

513
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,440
I'm reading malfunctions
in the EPS relays,

514
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,775
but we double-checked
all of them last night.

515
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,652
We must have missed something.

516
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,864
At this rate, we're going to be
out of the race in a couple of minutes.

517
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,992
I think I can reroute power
through the impulse manifold.

518
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,160
No.

519
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,372
-Why not?
-It could damage the reactor coils.

520
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,042
What do the reactor coils have to do
with the impulse manifolds?

521
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,253
These systems are different
than what you're used to.

522
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,048
You do want to win, don't you?

523
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,676
Of course I do.

524
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,598
It just seems like every time
I make a suggestion,

525
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,683
you find a reason to reject it.

526
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,311
I'm more familiar with my ship
than you are.

527
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,480
-[beeping]
-Now what?

528
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,858
I think it's the injector ports.

529
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,651
No, it's an overload in my console!

530
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,279
[grunts]

531
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,410
That's the second time
your copilot's console exploded.

532
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,995
Quite a coincidence.

533
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,040
I'm sorry, Harry.

534
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,666
I really am.

535
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,760
You sabotaged your own ship... twice.

536
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,847
Why are you trying so hard
to get out of this race?

537
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,397
[both grunt]

538
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,277
What the hell is going on?

539
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,947
Sit down and hold still!

540
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:04,834
All right. If you won't talk to me...
maybe you'll talk to Antarian Security.

541
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:08,296
[console beeping]

542
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,923
You disabled the comm system.

543
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,470
We'll just wait.
Someone will come along eventually.

544
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:25,021
We're past the last marker.
Time to deploy the thrusters?

545
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,398
Whatever you say.

546
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,109
What happened to "I'm the pilot"?

547
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,405
That really bothered you, didn't it?

548
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,700
It's why you think we don't fit together
as well as Harry and Irina?

549
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,369
Could we talk about this later?
Assan is gaining on us.

550
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,705
[sighs] Well, then, I guess
you'd better deploy the thrusters.

551
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,707
Thrusters deployed.

552
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,838
-This isn't about the race anymore, is it?
-You tell me.

553
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,849
If we're going to just sit here,
we might as well see who's winning.

554
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,518
You're not exactly in a position
to be making requests.

555
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,731
Admit it, Harry, you're curious, too.

556
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,150
[sighs]

557
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,781
The <i>Delta Flyer</i> is still in the lead.

558
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,327
Good for them.

559
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,790
I thought that if we could do
this one thing together,

560
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,085
something that you cared about,
that it might help our relationship.

561
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,212
I didn't know it needed help.

562
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,298
Well, that's part of the problem.

563
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,052
-What's the rest?
-You know the rest.

564
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,554
[sighs]

565
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:44,017
So, we scrape shields occasionally.
It keeps things interesting.

566
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,311
Maybe interesting isn't enough for me.

567
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,816
What are you doing?

568
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,526
[Harry]
They're stopping.

569
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,445
They're dead in the water.

570
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,363
Ah-ah.

571
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,743
How far from the finish line?

572
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,120
Less than a million kilometers.

573
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,461
That was Assan!
Why are we just sitting here?

574
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:16,091
If we've got a problem, we're going
to resolve it right here, right now.

575
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,469
You've done everything possible
to take yourself out of the race,

576
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,679
and now you seem worried

577
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,181
that the <i>Delta Flyer</i>
won't reach the finish line.

578
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,729
I'm counting more
than a dozen ships there.

579
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,481
Spectators, officials...

580
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:36,277
All congregated in the name of peace.
Touching, isn't it?

581
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,948
You've planned some sort of attack.

582
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,867
There are hundreds
of innocent people there.

583
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,244
How can you do that?

584
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,537
[sighs]

585
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,664
Not everyone is as comfortable

586
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,333
mixing with other species
as you are, Harry.

587
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,295
Some of us believe it was better
when we were separate.

588
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,047
Hey, I never asked you
to give up this race,

589
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,716
or anything else that you care about.

590
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,426
I never asked you
to stop being yourself.

591
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,971
The only self that I want to be
is the guy that you're in love with.

592
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,266
Wow.

593
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,686
-I didn't know you felt that way.
-How can you say that?

594
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,024
Well, you always seem
to have other priorities.

595
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:18,403
I'm showing you my priorities right now.

596
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,157
The <i>Delta Flyer</i> wouldn't even be in
this race if you hadn't told us about it.

597
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,076
You gave us the fuel converter
so we could qualify.

598
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,455
The fuel converter.

599
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,123
That's why you're so concerned

600
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,543
about Tom and B'Elanna's
crossing the finish line.

601
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,545
What'd you do to it?

602
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,088
Rig it to explode?

603
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,307
How come you never talked to me
about this before?

604
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:52,562
Well, you've got that tough
Klingon exterior, and...

605
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,523
I didn't think you liked the mushy stuff.

606
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,860
Do I look that tough right now?

607
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,531
Well, does that mean you're
in the mood for some mushy stuff?

608
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,034
Maybe.

609
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,078
Exactly what kind of mush
are we talking about?

610
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,497
You tell me.

611
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,293
Well, there's, um...

612
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,049
kissy stuff.

613
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,635
That was nice.

614
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,680
And there's the...

615
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,392
"you're the most important person
in the world to me."

616
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,562
I like that one, too.

617
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,817
And there's the "happily ever after."

618
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,446
-How does that one work?
-[both chuckle]

619
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,450
Well, traditionally,
it requires a proposal...

620
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,913
[alarm beeping]

621
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,212
We're being scanned by some kind
of modulating pulse.

622
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,549
-It's from Irina's ship.
-They must be wondering why we stopped.

623
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,884
There's something odd
about the amplitude.

624
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:08,847
Wait a minute. Di-di-da...

625
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,473
That's Morse code.

626
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,643
Harry and I use it
in the Captain Proton holoprogram.

627
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,144
What's he saying?

628
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,606
"Fuel...

629
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,149
converter...

630
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,943
rigged.

631
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,486
Eject."

632
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,988
What does he mean by "rigged"?

633
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,117
That converter's leaking
veridium isotopes.

634
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,577
Why didn't the computer warn us?

635
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,496
The on-line sensors
have been tampered with.

636
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,248
Can you contain the leak?

637
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,001
Too late. The veridium is already reacting
with the warp plasma.

638
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,045
-That'll cause a warp core breach.
-In less than a minute.

639
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,964
Then do what Harry said.
Eject the converter.

640
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,258
It's too late. I have to eject the core.

641
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,175
Here?

642
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,511
We'll never survive the blast.

643
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,389
Neither will anyone else
within a million kilometers.

644
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,017
[flipping switches]

645
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,476
They're moving again.

646
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,983
Away... from the finish line.

<i>Warp core breach in 30 seconds.</i>

648
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,787
-Where are we going?
-A J-class nebula filled with ionized gas.

649
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,372
Should contain the explosion.

650
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,375
I can't get the ejection
subroutines on line.

652
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,630
[sighs]
So, what's your answer?

653
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:24,797
My answer?

654
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,508
Will you marry me?

655
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,677

656
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,513

-It's as good a time as any.

Damn.

00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,382
I'm sorry your team didn't win, Captain.

00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,037
On how you answer my question.

676
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,458
I thought you only asked it
because we were about to explode.

677
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,794
Well, we're still alive...

678
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,713
and I'm still asking.

679
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,093
How come you never asked me before?

680
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,720
How come you're still
avoiding the question?

681
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,972
-I'm thinking.
-Think faster.

682
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,765
Why? You're going
to withdraw the question?

683
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:02,061
No, but I might start to beg.
Could get embarrassing.

<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

685
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:12,405
<i>The Antarians have invited us to</i>
<i>participate in the post-race festivities,</i>

686
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,533
<i>which has allowed me to give</i>
<i>two of my senior officers time off</i>

687
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,494
<i>for a well-deserved romantic getaway.</i>

688
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,456
<i>The</i> Delta Flyer <i>still needs</i>
<i>a new warp core,</i>

689
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,042
<i>but I don't think they're in a hurry</i>
<i>to get anywhere.</i>

690
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,421
To... the winners.

691
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,596
"B'Elanna Paris."
That has a nice ring to it.

692
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,431
Thanks, but I already have a ring.

693
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,600
[both chuckle]

694
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:44,145
Anyway, I kind of like
the sound of "Tom Torres."

695
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,482
-I hope you're kidding.
-Hey...

696
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,609
it is the 24th century.
