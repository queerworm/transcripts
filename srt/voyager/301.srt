00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,671
NARRATOR:
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek Voyager...

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,173
<i>Chakotay, they're</i>
<i>going to take your son...</i>

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,634
<i>when Culluh saw,</i>
<i>the baby wasn't his.</i>

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,929
<i>Please, help us,</i>
<i>not for me, for your son.</i>

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,097
CULLUH:
<i>I told you</i>
<i>to stay out of here.</i>

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,766
<i>No!</i>

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,434
I have a duty to this crew.

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,645
I can't just leave and go
looking for the child.

9
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,313
And I'd never consider
letting you go

10
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,440
into a Kazon-Nistrim
stronghold by yourself.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,196
Captain, if I can get a shuttle
through the cross fire

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,907
<i>I can go back and bring</i>
<i>the Talaxians to help us.</i>

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,676
We're being boarded through
the shuttle bays, Captain.

14
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,344
MALE:
Stay where you are. Don't move.

15
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,725
Hold your fire.

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,977
Computer, activate
medical holograph recall.

17
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,020
Set for 12 hours.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,188
Mark.

19
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,273
A fitting end for a people

20
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,109
who would not share
their technology.

21
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,363
Let's see if you
manage to survive

22
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,781
without it.

23
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,282
We'll divide
the crew into teams.

24
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,201
Each of you will
be a team leader.

25
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,162
Make it clear to all your people
that we expect to be rescued.

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,209
<i>And now the conclusion.</i>

27
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,854
CHAKOTAY:
Let me help you.

28
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,439
No, really,
I'm all right.

29
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,481
Don't push yourself.

30
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,400
That goes for everyone.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,777
Perspiring wastes water.

32
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,489
(<i> rumbling</i> )

33
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,254
JANEWAY:
All right, people, follow me.

34
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,505
Let's take it slow.

35
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,448
This is the most
defensible location

36
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,825
we've seen so far.

37
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,743
The overhang should
provide us with shelter

38
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,287
and the breeze
should keep insects away.

39
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,581
All right,
let's make camp.

40
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,427
Neelix, look at this.

41
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,930
They almost look constructed.

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,641
Maybe the people on this world
are cave dwellers.

43
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,183
If that's true,

44
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,895
I'd say this is
a "do not disturb" sign.

45
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,438
Wouldn't you?

46
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,399
They look humanoid.

47
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,778
We might be able to use these
as tools or weapons.

48
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,490
Gather them up,
Mr. Hogan.

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,450
Is there a problem?

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,243
No, sir.

51
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,245
Do you want all of them?

52
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,789
Waste nothing.

53
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,749
That's one of the first rules
of survival.

54
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,710
FEMALE:
Neelix, over here.

55
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,428
(<i> distant thud</i> )

56
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,433
(<i> creature breathing heavily</i> )

57
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,062
(<i> Hogan screams</i> )

58
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,745
NEELIX:
Hogan!

59
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,946
Computer,
repeat stabilizer diagnostic.

60
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,363
<i>Damage has been detected</i>

61
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,908
<i>in the stabilizer</i>
<i>acceleration sensors.</i>

62
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,952
I just repaired
the acceleration sensors.

63
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,369
<i>Warning.</i>

64
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:14,415
<i>Vessel approaching</i>
<i>on intercept course.</i>

65
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,583
Signature.

66
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,462
<i>Kazon patrol vessel.</i>

67
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,006
Damn it, I don't
have time for this.

68
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,809
I don't have time for this!

69
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,186
Computer, all stop.

70
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,400
Engage impulse.

71
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,416
I told you,
I don't have time for this.

72
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,003
CHAKOTAY:
It's all that's left
of Hogan's uniform, Captain.

73
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,671
We didn't find anything else.

74
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,056
NEELIX:
This is my fault.

75
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,891
If I hadn't told Hogan
to pick up those bones...

76
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,601
You shouldn't blame
yourself, Neelix.

77
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,729
JANEWAY:
Stop it. There's no time
to worry about blame.

78
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,023
Hogan was a fine officer
and a good man.

79
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,858
And our job is
to make sure his death

80
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,111
is the last one
for a long time.

81
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,780
I will not let this planet
destroy my crew.

82
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,198
Kes, see to it
that everyone knows

83
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,699
the tunnels
are off limits.

84
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,952
I want clear safety
protocols established.

85
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,328
Mr. Tuvok,
we need weapons.

86
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,495
I have already begun to design

87
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,956
some rudimentary devices,
Captain.

88
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,540
What's our food
and water status?

89
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,875
I know it sounds grisly

90
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,294
but I can make solar stills

91
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,669
with the material
from this uniform.

92
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,546
We could have
water tomorrow.

93
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,090
Do it.

94
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,508
Captain,
none of the search teams

95
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,970
were able to find plants
of any nutritional value.

96
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,349
Then tell the crew to start
turning over rocks.

97
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,025
If anyone balks at eating these,

98
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,986
tell them it's an order
from their captain.

99
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,071
They may be the difference
between life and death.

100
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:24,004
Activate emergency medical
holographic program.

101
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,131
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency?

102
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,549
Hello, doctor.
Remember me?

103
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,717
How could I forget

104
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,845
such an intriguing
medical mystery?

105
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,431
A Bajoran crewman with
a Cardassian physiology.

106
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,515
How are you, Seska?

107
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,641
(<i> baby crying</i> )

108
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,102
I see we have
a new passenger.

109
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,189
Doctor, I have to inform you
about a change of command.

110
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,358
I'm curious how you'll react.

111
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,651
The Kazon-Nistrim
have taken<i> voyager.</i>

112
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,403
How interesting.

113
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,489
Does your program have
any problem with that?

114
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,449
One humanoid is pretty
much the same as another

115
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,284
from a holographic
point of view.

116
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,786
I'm programmed
to provide medical care

117
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,580
to anyone who needs it.

118
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,376
Tell me, is it within your
program's capabilities

119
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,544
to lie or be deceptive?

120
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,087
I've learned that
a bedside manner

121
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,881
occasionally
requires me to--

122
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,341
how shall I put it--

123
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,592
soft-pedal the truth.

124
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,513
But bald-faced lying,
calculated deceit--

125
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,182
I don't have much experience
with that sort of thing.

126
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,226
But my program is adaptive.

127
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,019
If you really need me
to be deceptive

128
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,229
I'm sure I could learn.

129
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,356
It's not exactly
what I meant.

130
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,107
I think we'll keep you
just as you are.

131
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,108
As you wish.

132
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,527
Your baby's in good health.

133
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:32,406
You don't know how primitive
Kazon medicine is.

134
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,614
I'm sure Chakotay would be glad

135
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,658
to know you're
looking after his son.

136
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,244
Chakotay's son?

137
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,204
That isn't Chakotay's son.

138
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,164
But you're wrong, doctor.

139
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,251
I impregnated myself
with his DNA.

140
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,670
That may have been
your intention...

141
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,131
but it certainly
wasn't the result.

142
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,258
Here.

143
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,342
See for yourself.

144
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,269
Your child has
Cardassian DNA strands here

145
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,604
and Kazon DNA here.

146
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,357
Human DNA has
a significantly different

147
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,775
nucleotide sequence.

148
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,610
(<i> crying</i> )

149
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,113
But I was so certain.
He looks...

150
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,281
He's the first offspring

151
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,074
of a Cardassian
and a Kazon.

152
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,658
We have no frame
of reference

153
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,287
by which to judge
his initial appearance.

154
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,830
Perhaps he will develop
more Kazon features

155
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,332
as he matures.

156
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,419
Maje Culluh
will be so pleased.

157
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,921
End medical
holographic program.

158
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,389
Medical log, stardate 50032.7.

159
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,308
I have determined
that Commander Chakotay 

160
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,602
is not the father
of Seska's child.

161
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:47,981
I only wish there was
some way to inform him.

162
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,358
What am I supposed to do--

163
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,902
lead a revolt with
the gang from Sandrine's?

164
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,072
Conjure up holograms
of Nathan Hale and Che Guevara?

165
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,783
I'm a doctor,
not a counterinsurgent.

166
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,285
Get a hold of yourself.

167
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,120
You're not just a hologram.

168
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,249
You're a Starfleet hologram.

169
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,292
Maybe...

170
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,089
Maybe I could access
a tactical database--

171
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,799
teach myself guerilla warfare.

172
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,969
But that would take time.

173
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,013
Computer, what is
the crew complement?

174
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,931
<i>There are 89 Kazon...</i>

175
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,099
<i>89...</i>

176
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,520
<i>and one Betazoid on board.</i>

177
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,271
What did you say? Betazoid?

178
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,689
<i>There is one Betazoid on board.</i>

179
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,233
Where? Who?

180
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,068
<i>Please restate</i>
<i>a single question.</i>

181
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,570
Who is it?

182
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,323
<i>Crewman Lon Suder.</i>

183
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,824
Suder?

184
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,075
Where is he?

185
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,495
<i>Between decks eight and nine.</i>

186
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,625
Doctor to Suder.

187
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,959
Yes.

188
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,710
Yes, doctor, I hear you.

189
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,299
<i>The ship has been taken over</i>
<i>by the Kazon-Nistrim.</i>

190
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,425
I know.

191
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,093
I've been hiding.

192
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,221
<i>Can you make it to sick bay?</i>

193
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,599
I think so.

194
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,060
Computer, emergency
medical priority, 1-1-4.

195
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,145
Delete the signature
of Mr. Suder's combadge

196
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,730
from the system. There is to be
no record of his being on board.

197
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,151
JANEWAY:
Huddle together in groups.

198
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,237
That'll preserve body heat.
This is no time to be shy.

199
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,572
Tuvok...

200
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,990
KIM:
Captain, how do you
like your eggs?

201
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,117
TORRES:
We found a nest
about two kilometers away.

202
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,244
And that's not all--

203
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,580
Cucumbers,
or something like them.

204
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,498
There are vines full of them
two hours from here.

205
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,832
Take them to Neelix,

206
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,959
and tell him to hold off
on the beetle stew,

207
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,378
at least for the time being.

208
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,217
How's she doing, Samantha?

209
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,262
I don't know, Captain.
She seems tired, listless.

210
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,681
JANEWAY:
Maybe she's just adjusting
to the environment.

211
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,974
After all,
she was born in space.

212
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,019
Make sure you
stay close to the fire...

213
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,938
as soon as we have one.

214
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,440
(<i> scraping</i> )

215
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,199
Trapped on a barren planet,

216
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,285
and you're stuck with the
only Indian in the universe

217
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,496
who can't start a fire by
rubbing two sticks together.

218
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,082
I was never good at this as a
child and I'm still not.

219
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,167
Don't be so hard on yourself,
none of the others have had

220
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,295
any success with it either.
It must be the wood.

221
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,756
We need kindling of some sort.

222
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,010
What?

223
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,472
Something my father once told me
about starting a fire.

224
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,693
There you go.

225
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,679
If we put some bigger
rocks around the fire

226
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,388
they'll reflect
the heat better.

227
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,931
I'm going to go get some.

228
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,408
Neelix!

229
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,664
You shouldn't go
too far away from camp!

230
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,723
Voyager's<i> been taken by</i>
<i>the Kazon-Nistrim.</i>

231
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,809
<i>They're flooding every subspace</i>
<i>frequency with the news.</i>

232
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,686
Is there any word on the crew?

233
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:59,607
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

234
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,900
If you can help me with repairs

235
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,527
we can be on our way
in a few hours.

236
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,905
<i>Lieutenant... our ships</i>
<i>are no match for</i> Voyager,

237
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,866
<i>and your shuttlecraft</i>
<i>can hardly--</i>

238
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:12,495
Commander Paxim,
my people are counting on you.

239
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,622
Look, no one knows<i> Voyager</i>
like I do<i> .</i>

240
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,500
I know every vulnerability,
every blind spot.

241
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,669
Don't worry. I have a plan.

242
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,961
(<i> sighs</i> )

243
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,422
<i>Very well.</i>

244
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,424
<i>We'll rendezvous in an hour.</i>

245
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:28,135
Paxim out.

246
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,638
One hour.

247
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,850
I should be able to come up with
some kind of plan in one hour.

248
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,280
I was beginning to think
you'd gotten lost.

249
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,489
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,409
They're still
repairing the ship.

251
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,327
I had to be careful.

252
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,579
We have no time to waste.

253
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,289
According to the computer,
we're at warp.

254
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,125
We've got to slow down before we
get too far from the crew.

255
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,752
That would seem to be
our first priority.

256
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:04,088
And then we have
to get some weapons...

257
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,841
Mr. Suder,
are you listening to me?

258
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,720
Yes.

259
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,972
Oh.

260
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,015
I see.

261
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:19,228
Perhaps you consider this...
an opportunity.

262
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,730
Opportunity?

263
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,524
To obtain
your freedom from confinement.

264
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,652
How foolish of me to think
you would want to help.

265
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,195
You're wrong.

266
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,156
I do want to help.

267
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,241
Then... what?

268
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,501
I'm going to have
to kill some of them.

269
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,254
It is possible.

270
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:50,176
Violence might be required
to retake the ship.

271
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,887
I've worked so...

272
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,766
so hard over
the last few months...

273
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,936
to control the violent feelings.

274
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,397
I'm almost at peace with myself.

275
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:07,861
I mean, I see the day coming
when I could be.

276
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,321
Mr. Suder...

277
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,739
if Lieutenant Tuvok were here

278
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,783
I know he would tell you
there are times

279
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,703
when violence is required
to defend yourself,

280
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:20,498
to defend your ship,
to defend your crew.

281
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,208
Yes.

282
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:27,338
There is a logical use
for violence for everyone else.

283
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,048
With me,

284
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,424
once it begins...

285
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,761
we must do this
together, Mr. Suder.

286
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,180
If you don't trust
yourself yet, then trust me.

287
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,726
I will help you
any way I can.

288
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,477
One hologram
and one sociopath

289
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,979
may not be much
of a match for the Kazon,

290
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:47,149
but we'll have to do.

291
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,569
There are signs of a struggle
near the edge of camp.

292
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,571
I found alien tracks.

293
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,865
We can't wait until
morning to go after them.

294
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,075
Well I'm better at tracking
than starting fires.

295
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,326
I've completed a few weapons

296
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,204
that might be appropriate,
Commander.

297
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,415
This is thoughtful
of you, Tuvok.

298
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,667
But my tribe never
used bows and arrows

299
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,419
and I've never even shot one.

300
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,837
This is mine.

301
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,839
I taught archery science
for several years

302
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,675
at the Vulcan Institute
of Defensive Arts.

303
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,761
Take as many crew
members as you need.

304
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,695
(<i> grunting</i> )

305
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,289

00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,333
Now, see here.

308
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,712
You just keep
your hands off her.

315
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,778
Commander,
thank goodness.

316
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,779
Are you all right?

317
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,405
KES:
They haven't
hurt us.

318
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,282
Have you been able to tell if
they have a leader?

319
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,409
I'd say it's the one
with the claw.

320
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,370
NEELIX:
I agree. The other two seem

321
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,414
to be trying to figure out
what to make of us.

322
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,501
In a manner of speaking, not
in the culinary sense, I hope.

323
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,131
Listen to the sound
of my voice

324
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,216
and you'll know that
I mean you no harm.

325
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,593
I come without weapons.

326
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,430
But I must have
my people back.

327
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,142

Thank you...

334
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,669
but she should
stay with you.

335
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,920
I must take them with me.

339
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,849
Over here. Fine.

00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,438
No. No!

343
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,067
That is unacceptable.

344
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,569
Kes, stand up slowly,

345
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,904
and walk away with us.

346
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,832
We have to go now.

<i>Kukhahun hin.</i>

348
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,254
Just keep walking.
Don't look back.

350
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,486
In there.

351
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,822
Commander, that looks just
like the tunnel where Hogan...

352
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,241
I know.
If they know it, too,

353
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,784
they won't follow us in.
Come on.

354
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,778
You'd think this crew had never
seen a warp drive before.

355
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,948
No one tried to adjust
the antimatter flow today?

356
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,658
No one.

357
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,368
If you're lying,
I'll have your head.

358
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,329
I swear it, Maje.

359
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,747
There should have
been some warning

360
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,292
before the antimatter
injector froze--

361
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,253
a drop in core temperature,
a magnetic constriction alarm,

362
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,255
something.

363
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,049
He's either lying or...

364
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,093
Or what?

365
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,305
Computer, run a level one
scan for intruders.

366
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,848
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

367
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,018
<i>Internal scanner relays</i>
<i>have been damaged.</i>

368
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,145
I thought you said all
repairs were complete.

369
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:38,398
They were.
I thought they were.

370
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,151
I want a
deck-by-deck search

371
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,028
<i>of all Jeffries tubes</i>
<i>and conduits.</i>

372
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,905
<i>Use the Federation tricorders.</i>

373
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,075
Do you have a portable
thoron generator?

374
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,285
Yes, of course.

375
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,329
We use it to treat
radiation burns.

376
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,497
It's an old Maquis trick.

377
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,667
Thoron particles neutralize
tricorder sensors.

378
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,881
Mr. Suder,
we need some weapons

379
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,341
if we're going
to retake the ship.

380
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,977
(<i> crying</i> )

381
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:15,978
She has a fever.

382
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,897
I don't know what to do.

383
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,190
Let me get her
some water.

384
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,490
(<i> rumbling</i> )

385
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,243
The baby needs water.

386
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,078
Those tremors seem
to be getting stronger.

387
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,871
Chakotay's team should
have been back by now.

388
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,622
We better look for them
before it gets too hot.

389
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,292
Get a few people together.
I'll join you in a second.

390
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,130
(<i> all shouting</i> )

391
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,804
Come on. We have to see if
there's another way out of here.

392
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,902
(<i> rumbling</i> )

393
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,724
KES:
I feel a breeze.

394
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,892
It's coming
from this way.

395
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,169
(<i> chanting</i> )

396
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,684
Do you really think
Commander Chakotay

397
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,478
would go in there after
what happened to Hogan?

398
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:21,854
He may have had
no other choice.

399
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,481
How do we get them
away from the tunnels?

400
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,191
A couple of phaser blasts
would do the trick.

401
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,484
Who are the fastest
runners here?

402
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,152
TORRES:
I was on
the decathlon team

403
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,570
before I quit the academy.
The track and field coach

404
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,281
was furious with me.

405
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,158
Anyone else here who can run?
Yeah.

406
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,161
Okay, you three will
be the sprint team.

407
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,247
Once you reach our camp,
you should be safe.

408
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,539
Which way
do you like, Tuvok?

409
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,750
From a tactical
point of view

410
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,919
the options are
not encouraging.

411
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,921
However, moving
past the creature

412
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,090
might lead us
to an exit.

413
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,342
All right,
let's take it slow.

414
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,385
Single file.

415
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,277
TORRES:
Hey, up here!

416
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,778
Up here!
You want us?

417
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,655
You want us?
Come and get us.

418
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,491
Come on, come and get us.

419
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,992

420
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,096
Pull this.

00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,550
KIM:
The tunnel's clear.

429
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,633
Go!

430
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,271
Everybody out!

431
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,193
Move! Let's go!

432
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,528
Go! Go! Go!

433
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,821
Go!

434
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,533
Chakotay, your spear.

435
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,384
Come on. Come on, go!

436
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,933
CHAKOTAY:
Come on.

437
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,731
I don't understand it.

438
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,692
Thoron particles are leaking
into the conduits

439
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,944
from somewhere.

440
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,821
I can't get
any other readings.

441
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,947
Check the next level.

442
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,032
Yes, sir.

443
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,106
COMPUTER:

<i>holographic channel.</i>

445
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,111
On the emergency channel?

446
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,072
<i>Doc, I hope you're</i>
<i>receiving this,</i>

447
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,700
<i>because if you're not,</i>
<i>I'm a dead duck.</i>

448
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,202
<i>I'm piggy-backing this message</i>
<i>on a fake Kazon signal</i>

<i>I'm sending to the bridge.</i>

<i>When the attack begins</i>

455
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,465
<i>I need you to get the computer</i>
<i>to block the discharge</i>

456
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,051
<i>from the backup</i>
<i>phaser power couplings.</i>

457
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,094
<i>You got that?</i>

458
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,637
<i>The backup couplings.</i>

459
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,889
<i>I'm taking out</i>
<i>the primary couplings myself.</i>

460
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,433
<i>But I need those backups</i>
<i>to overload</i>

461
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,685
<i>when they switch to them.</i>

462
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,770
<i>Don't do anything</i>
<i>until the attack begins,</i>

463
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,772
<i>or they might notice.</i>

464
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,482
<i>That's it for now.</i>

465
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,067
<i>I'll be seeing you soon.</i>

466
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,902
<i>I hope.</i>

467
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,155
(<i> thud</i> )

468
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,120
Good news.
Help is on the way.

469
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,663
Mr. Paris apparently
was able to...

470
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,709
Oh.

471
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,377
I didn't know
what to do.

472
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,962
I didn't think I
should leave him there

473
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,338
where they could find him.

474
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,965
Of course, you were smart
to bring him here.

475
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,342
We can put him
in a stasis drawer.

476
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,678
Well, we have weapons now.

477
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,393
You did what was
necessary, Mr. Suder.

478
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,272
Five cc's of improvoline
will help you calm down.

479
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,358
SUDER:
No. No drugs.

480
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,693
I just need to breathe--

481
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,780
see the white light
that is my breath.

482
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,790
We just received
a message

483
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:36,001
from our patrol ship.

484
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,838
They've tracked down
the shuttle from<i> Voyager...</i>

485
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,381
and destroyed it.

486
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,467
Were two people on board?

487
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,511
They didn't say.

488
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:49,097
Two people were unaccounted for
when we captured the crew.

489
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,768
Have they found any evidence
of an intruder on board?

490
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,520
No.

491
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,939
But the search has been slowed
down by a thoron particle leak.

492
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,108
Thoron particles?

493
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,528
That's an old Maquis trick
to fool tricorders.

494
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,866
TUVOK:
After what transpired,
I believe we have to

495
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,410
prepare ourselves for
an alien attack, Captain.

496
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,163
Our priority should be to
increase the weapons arsenal

497
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,833
and to begin training everyone
in the use of these weapons.

498
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,793
I don't like the sound of that,
Lieutenant.

499
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,587
We may have to coexist
with these aliens a long time.

500
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,714
Nevertheless...

501
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,215
CHAKOTAY:
I agree with the Captain.

502
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,050
We have to find a way
to share this world with them.

503
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,594
You may find nobility
in a savage, Commander,

504
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,971
but he is only interested
in killing you.

505
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,431
I don't believe that.

506
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,560
KES:
Captain!

507
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,103
The baby is very sick.
She's having trouble breathing.

508
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,648
She has a high fever. There's
nothing more I can do for her.

509
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,733
(<i> rumbling</i> )

510
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,817
Captain!

511
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,115
I think our top priority
has just been dictated.

512
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,577
Break camp. We've got to get out
of here before it blows.

513
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,832
Why are you still here?

514
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,958
I shut down your
program when I left.

515
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,419
You must be mistaken.

516
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,047
Where's your
thoron generator?

517
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:08,343
It was damaged on a recent away
mission and left behind.

518
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,012
Who else from<i> Voyager</i>
is on board<i> ?</i>

519
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:16,059
I wouldn't know.
I don't believe you.

520
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,061
There are several dozen
crewman on board actually,

521
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,813
and they have been
working around the clock

522
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:20,814
to sabotage your vessel.

523
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:21,981
That's a lie.

524
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,191
At most, there is one,

525
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,027
and I believe
it is a Maquis crewman.

526
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,529
Yes, of course.
You're right.

527
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,988
It is one of the Maquis.

528
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,241
I won't play these games
with a trick of light.

529
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,910
Sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

530
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,160
so you can imagine
how I feel

531
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,955
about being called names.

532
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,376
I don't believe you could
have sabotaged this ship alone.

533
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,711
Very well.

534
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,087
Since you are obviously

535
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,589
about to disable
my program anyway,

536
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:46,924
let me take
the credit I deserve.

537
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:50,594
I did sabotage the ship
all by myself

538
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,679
with the computer's
help, of course.

539
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,098
As a matter of fact, one of your
crewman came in unexpectedly

540
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,225
and caught me in the act.

541
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,522
You killed him?

542
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,441
He left me no choice.

543
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,277
Why create a thoron leak
if you're not hiding someone?

544
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,570
I would think it's obvious,

545
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,572
to make you believe
I was hiding someone.

546
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,157
I've had your people

547
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,242
crawling through the bowels
of this ship for hours

548
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,577
looking for an intruder.

549
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,329
You're more talented
in the art of deception

550
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,914
than you led me to believe.

551
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,167
I was inspired
by the presence of a master.

552
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,170
Computer,
Access Culluh zero-one.

553
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,338
Disregard all
voice commands

554
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,798
from Starfleet 
personnel.

555
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,883
Security lock-out.

556
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,301
(<i> rumbling</i> )

557
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,094
Seska to Bridge.
What's going on?

558
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,889
MALE:
<i>A couple of Talaxian ships</i>
<i>have fired on us.</i>

559
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,599
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

560
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,895
Good-bye, doctor.

561
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,356
I'd rather not take
any more chances.

562
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,615
(<i> rumbling</i> )

563
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,483
Doctor?

564
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,411
Activate emergency
medical holographic program.

565
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,120
<i>Unable to respond.</i>

566
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,332
<i>All Starfleet voice access</i>
<i>has been canceled.</i>

567
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,756
DOCTOR:
<i>Mr. Suder,</i>
<i>if you are hearing this,</i>

568
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,925
<i>you have just</i>
<i>unsuccessfully attempted</i>

569
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,010
<i>to access the emergency</i>
<i>medical program.</i>

570
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,887
<i>I have programmed</i>
<i>this message to play</i>

571
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,638
<i>in the event</i>
<i>that I have been disabled.</i>

572
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,682
<i>This means, of course,</i>
<i>that the fate of</i> Voyager

573
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,268
<i>now depends solely on you.</i>

574
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,604
<i>I can imagine how you</i>
<i>must feel at this moment.</i>

575
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,731
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>you have my full confidence.</i>

576
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,357
<i>You have already shown</i>

577
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,818
<i>great courage and dedication to</i>
<i>your crew.</i>

578
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,236
<i>I have left an</i>
<i>additional message for</i>

579
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,988
<i>Captain Janeway</i>
<i>and Lieutenant Tuvok</i>

580
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:20,285
<i>noting your heroism,</i>
<i>in case I am irretrievable.</i>

581
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,120
<i>You know what you have to do</i>

582
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,663
<i>and when to do it.</i>

583
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,041
<i>And I know that with our fate</i>
<i>in your hands</i>

584
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,334
<i>we will prevail.</i>

585
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,836
<i>Good luck, Mr. Suder.</i>

586
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,656
The Talaxians are retreating
toward the nebula.

587
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,742
We'll teach them the price
for attacking the Nistrim.

588
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,787
Lay in
a pursuit course.

589
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,122
<i>Commander Paxim to Paris.</i>

590
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,498
Go ahead.

591
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,041
<i>They're following us</i>
<i>as planned.</i>

592
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,501
<i>We're bringing them to you.</i>

593
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,545
Acknowledged. Ready and waiting.

594
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,714
I just hope you are, too, doc.

595
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,933
JANEWAY:
This way.

596
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,738
(<i> screams</i> )

597
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,230
It's okay.

598
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,699
Here we go.

599
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,794
What's happening?!

600
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,713
Our phaser power couplings
are under attack.

601
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,757
From where?
I don't see anyone.

602
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,884
I'm not picking up anything
on the scanners.

603
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,052
Shields are buckling.

604
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,012
Take evasive action.

605
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,655
(<i> groans</i> )

606
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,989
(<i> groans</i> )

607
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,057
I have it on the scanners.

608
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,059
It's a Federation shuttlecraft.

609
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,856
Lock phasers.

610
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,274
Destroy it.

611
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,484
Primary phaser
power is down.

612
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,570
Switch to backup systems.

613
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,405
Confirmed.

614
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,991
Phasers are locked on.

615
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,076
Fire!

616
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,623
I don't understand.

617
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm showing an overload.

618
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,298
PARIS:
Yes, doc, yes.

619
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,426
Paris to Commander Paxim.
Stand by.

620
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,678
I'm going to start transporting
your people to<i> Voyager.</i>

621
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,305
<i>Standing by.</i>

622
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,062
(<i> baby crying</i> )

623
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,285
Seska!

624
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,206
Seska!

625
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,501
(<i> baby crying</i> )

626
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,103
Seska...

627
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,163
<i>Engineering to Maje Culluh.</i>

628
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,872
<i>We're being boarded.</i>

629
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,125
Abandon ship.

630
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,002
(<i> baby crying</i> )

631
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,642
I'm sealing off
the Bridge manually.

632
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,895
I've got to get
the computer back on-line.

633
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,148
All Starfleet voice access
has been disabled.

634
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,566
I'm reading a Kazon shuttle
leaving the ship.

635
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,361
There are also escape pods
being launched.

636
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:10,569
Forget them.

637
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,280
We have more important
things to do.

638
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,226
She's breathing
better, isn't she?

639
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,897
<i>Sad katonk.</i>

640
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,815
PARIS:
Welcome back, Captain.

641
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,154
Well done, Lieutenant.

642
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,322
I had a lot of help.

643
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,783
The Talaxians,
the doc, Mr. Suder.

644
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,410
KIM:
Suder?

645
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,412
We thought he was killed
during the initial attack.

646
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:46,082
No. He and the doctor
sabotaged the ship.

647
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,460
Suder disabled the phasers
before they killed him.

648
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,927
You would have been
proud of him, Mr. Tuvok.

649
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,555
I offer you
a Vulcan prayer, Mr. Suder.

650
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,726
May your death
bring you the peace

651
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,395
you never found in life.

652
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:34,255
Mr. Kim, is this ship capable
of sustained flight?

653
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,425
All propulsion and navigational
systems are functioning

654
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,926
within normal parameters,
Captain.

655
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,471
Good. Take us away
from our new home,

656
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,640
and set a course
for the old one, Mr. Paris.

657
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,765
Warp eight.

658
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,436
Heading 4-1 mark 7-7.

659
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,770
Destination:

660
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,439
Alpha quadrant.

661
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,029
Engage.
