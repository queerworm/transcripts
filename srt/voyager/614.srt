00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,975
Who left their dirty plate
in the replicator? Tom?

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,351
It wasn't me.

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,520
It's a biohazard!
Take it easy!

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,480
We'll decontaminate you
when we get back home.

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,565
If I<i> ever</i> volunteer

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,442
for a two-week
away mission again,

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,820
would somebody please
confine me to Sick Bay?

8
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,071
Too much togetherness
for you, Harry?

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,406
Nothing personal, Commander.

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,116
To tell you
the truth,

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,076
I've enjoyed
our little junket together.

12
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,412
It's given the four of us
a chance to bond.

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,748
The bonding stopped
when the sonic shower
went off-line.

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,417
That's all part
of the experience,
the adventure.

15
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,128
Think of the great explorers
that came before us.

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,881
They survived
without creature comforts.

17
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,841
I wouldn't want to bunk
with them, either.

18
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,010
Now, there's a sight
for sore eyes.

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,895
Forget the candles.
Break out the champagne!

22
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,479
JANEWAY:
<i>I take it</i>
<i>the mission was a success.</i>

23
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,607
15 planets scanned in 14 days.

24
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,944
We've got a cargo hold
overflowing with dilithium ore.

25
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,112
JANEWAY:
<i>That's the kind of news</i>
<i>I like to hear.</i>

26
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,417
The explorers
return.

27
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,752
Welcome home.

28
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,587
I should go away
more often.

29
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,214
I'm not going
anywhere for
a long, long time.

30
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,716
Homesick, Harry?

31
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,300
Well, let's just say
I'm looking forward

32
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,177
to a hot shower and
a comfortable bed.

33
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,304
Don't forget to stop
by Sick Bay for
your checkup.

34
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,098
Checkup? For what?
Away team protocol.

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,393
Crew members are required
to submit to a physical

36
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,895
if the mission lasts
more than two weeks.

37
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,272
Now...
who's first?
(<i> sighs</i> )

38
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,775
I'll let you know
in the morning, Doctor.

39
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,736
Why put off till tomorrow
what you can do today...

40
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,362
Commander?

41
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,281
Mr. Paris?

42
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,241
I've been working
on a little surprise for you.

43
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,077
Oh! Naughty or nice?

44
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,369
Close your eyes.

45
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,704
I like it already.

47
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,332
Come on.

48
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,004
So, what do you think?

49
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,300
(<i> laughs</i> ):
A television set!

50
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,302
Circa 1956.

51
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,638
I replicated
the components,
but I assembled it myself.

52
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,849
(<i> sighs</i> )
This... is
the remote control.

53
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,226
You select
what you want to watch
by pressing this button.

54
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,937
PARIS:
A slight problem.

55
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,773
There<i> were</i> no remote
controls in the 1950s.

56
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,733
I took a little
poetic license.

57
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,026

00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,323

What's that?

Now, that is called a "jingle."

65
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,669
According to the research
I did, they inserted them

66
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,671
into the entertainment
programs.

67
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,465
I know, it's confusing,
but I kept them in

68
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,134
for authenticity.

69
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,136
I even replicated
popcorn.

except for one
tiny detail.

00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,311
What?

75
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,855
You forgot the beer.

00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,731
I can fix that.

<i>You didn't miss much</i>

78
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,280
The Doctor
gave a lecture

79
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,574
on "Insects Indigenous
to the Delta Quadrant."

80
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,826
Uh-huh.

81
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,452
It was pretty
boring...

82
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,663
until Ensign Farley
started snoring,

83
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,665
and then no one could
keep a straight face.

84
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,625
Of course, the Doctor
wasn't at all amused.

Hockey.

87
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,883
It was a shame
that we had to cut
the lecture short,

88
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,426
but the warp core
overloaded, and then
the Borg invaded,

89
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,637
and we were all
assimilated.
Mm-hmm.

I'm supposed to build

but I have to use
everyday things.

I'm not allowed
to use a replicator.

Carrots and celery?

00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,597
Uh... I don't think

176
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,599

I don't think that I'll
have time then, either.

00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,066
Well, then, why
don't I help you?

181
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,362
What's cooking?

182
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,738
Ouch!

183
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,365
Let me see
your hand!

184
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,242
I'm okay.
Your hand!

185
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,577
We've got to get
you to Sick Bay.

186
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,911
I'm fine.
Sick Bay!

187
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,871
(<i> laughter</i> )

188
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,706
That's the best joke
I've ever heard.

189
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,000
Get down.
Stay behind me.

190
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,918
What?!
I said get down!

191
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,966
Go, go! Quickly!

192
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,637
Come on!
Help me with this!

193
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,977
Keep moving!

194
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,230
Try not to move.

195
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,440
Get away from me!

196
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,690
I can help you.

197
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,320
I don't... want your help!

198
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,617
MALE:
We need help over here!

199
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,833
Hold your fire.
I said hold your fire!

200
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,418
We're under attack, sir!

201
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,628
Saavdra-- where is he?

202
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,046
I think he's at base.

203
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,389
We were supposed to
evacuate the colony,
not destroy it!

204
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,850
That was before the Nakan
started shooting.

205
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,810
They're civilians!

206
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,854
Civilians
with particle weapons.

207
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,606
<i>Tuvok to Commander Chakotay.</i>

208
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,441
(<i> gasping</i> )

209
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,860
<i>Commander, please respond.</i>
Go ahead.

210
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,697
<i>We have a security breach</i>
<i>in the Mess Hall.</i>

211
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,992
I'm on my way.

212
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,743
Tell them to call off
the attack!

213
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,288
Put down your weapon, Neelix.

214
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,456
Let us help you.

215
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,790
Stay away!

216
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,377
I won't let you
hurt her!

217
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,170
Get back!

218
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,175
He appears to be
hallucinating.

219
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,013
Neelix! This is
Commander Chakotay!

220
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,807
Let Naomi go!
No one's going
to hurt her!

221
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,394
That's an order!
No!

222
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,356
Not until Saavdra's
called off his attack.

223
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,066
There's a back entrance
to the galley.

224
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,693
If you can distract
him, perhaps...

225
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,403
I want to try
something first.

226
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,865
Neelix!

227
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,160
Listen to me.
It's okay.

228
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,913
Saavdra ordered
a cease-fire.

229
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,415
The colony's secure.

230
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,500
The battle's over.

231
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,504
Why do I still
hear weapons fire?

232
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,674
It's just a few soldiers.

233
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,259
They're celebrating.

234
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,843
The battle's over.

235
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,475
Neelix, please.

236
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,351
I'll protect Naomi.

237
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,439
How do I know
you won't trick me?

238
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,025
Because I'm on your side.

239
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,487
I want to end this conflict
as much as you do.

240
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,822
Let her go.

241
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,700
It's safe now.

242
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,452
The killing's over.

243
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,410
I gave him
a mild sedative.

244
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,496
Any idea what caused
the delusions?

245
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,291
His norepinephrine levels are
three times what they should be.

246
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,460
Neurochemically speaking,
he's suffering from a form

247
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,129
of post-traumatic
stress syndrome.

248
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,882
I dreamed I was fighting
in an alien war.

249
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,427
The same war Neelix
seemed to be reliving.

250
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,430
Harry Kim was in earlier.
He had an anxiety attack.

251
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,725
I haven't spoken
with Mr. Paris yet.

252
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,644
Three members
of the same away team.

253
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,146
Did you run into any kind
of trouble while you were gone?

254
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,357
None. The mission
was by the book.

255
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,694
Your engramatic activities
contradict that, Commander.

256
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,573
These are real memories,
not mere dreams
or hallucinations.

257
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,366
Maybe you were abducted...

258
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,368
manipulated
into fighting.

259
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,705
Our memories have been
tampered with before.

260
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,583
We're going to retrace
your mission.

261
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,502
Start reviewing
the<i> Delta Flyer</i>
sensor logs.

262
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,379
See if you come up
with anything unusual.

263
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,757
How long before Neelix
is back on his feet?

264
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,592
I can wake him now
if you'd like.

265
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,218
Do it.

266
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,347
Each of you seems to hold
a piece of the puzzle.

267
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,017
Let's see if we can start
putting them together.

268
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,813
I don't remember much,
just bits and pieces.

269
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:43,693
I dreamt I was on a planet
in the middle of a battle.

270
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,446
I have no idea
how I got there.
I can't remember.

271
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:51,743
When I was in
the Jefferies tube, I heard
weapons fire, screams.

272
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,538
People were screaming.
I got so frightened.

273
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,915
Of what?

274
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,666
I... I don't know.

275
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,376
I remember
getting shot.

276
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,754
There's no evidence
of a wound.

277
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,256
If our memories were wiped,

278
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,676
our physical injuries
could have been masked as well.

279
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,679
Do any of you recall
who you were fighting?

280
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,389
It was dark.

281
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,224
I couldn't see them very well.

282
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,768
They were
firing at us.

283
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,271
The Naka... Na... Nakana...

284
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,064
Nakan.

285
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,733
They were called
the Nakan.

286
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,944
Right. Right.

287
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,029
They... they lived
in a remote colony.

288
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,032
We were trying
to evacuate them.

289
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,452
But they were fighting us.

290
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,622
Why couldn't they just
do what they were told?

291
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,915
We had no right to be there!

292
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,249
It was for
their own good.

293
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,335
Gentlemen,
stay focused.

294
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,130
You said you were
trying to evacuate
their colony. Why?

295
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,257
Those were our orders.

296
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,592
Who gave them?

297
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,012
Saavdra.

298
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,014
Commander Saavdra.

299
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,934
He was in charge of our unit.
We were part of an attack force.

300
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,978
You were coerced?
No!

301
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,563
No, I volunteered.
We all did.

302
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,398
I find that difficult
to believe.

303
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,693
You were obviously
manipulated somehow.

304
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,488
No! No, no, no, no,
I remember now.

305
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,826
We held a, uh, a briefing
to plan the evacuation.

306
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,995
You were there, Commander.
Mr. Paris!

307
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,830
It was a command post.

308
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,375
That's right.
It was night, 0200 hours.

309
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,377
We'd been awake for days.

310
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,965
We were exhausted.

311
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,967
What do our spotters report?

312
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,803
The Nakan are unarmed.
They won't put up a fight.

313
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,305
Once we've disabled
their shield generators,

314
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,892
we'll deploy Units 5 and 6.

315
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:42,395
They may be unarmed, but they
won't be happy to see us.

316
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,480
Don't provoke them.

317
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,984
I want to come out of this
with zero casualties

318
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,652
on both sides.

319
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,195
Understood.

320
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,322
The perimeter is the weakest
in Sector 14.

321
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,949
The terrain's very flat.

322
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,035
It's an ideal landing spot
for transports.

323
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,828
Once we've secured
the village,

324
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,955
take the
colonists there.
Get them aboard.

325
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,750
Do your best to
reassure them.

326
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,712
Make them understand that this
is a temporary relocation,

327
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,089
that they're going
to be back there
within a few weeks.

328
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,800
Understood.
ALL: Yes, sir!
Aye, aye, sir.

329
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,389
Problem?

330
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,016
Just one.

331
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,851
This unit could
use a little sleep.

332
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,853
I suggest we wait
until daybreak.

333
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,273
I promised Command
we'd have this colony
secured today.

334
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,691
It can wait a few hours.

335
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,611
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,989
But when this mission's over,
how does a week

337
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,658
on Toranius Prime sound?

338
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,201
Never been there.

339
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,039
Compared to this place,
it's paradise.

340
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,751
The mission proceeded
as planned.

341
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,003
We disabled their
shield generators

342
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,504
and entered the colony.

343
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,548
We were rounding up the Nakan.

344
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,093
To be honest, I expected them to
give us a little more trouble.

345
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,844
But then we came
to the last enclosure.

346
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,722
Do you remember
the last enclosure?

347
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,349
It was empty.
Where were they?

348
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,810
They were supposed
to be there.

349
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,561
24 colonists
unaccounted for.

350
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,688
We thought the spotters
had made a mistake.

351
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,941
We should've known
something was wrong.

352
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,901
We should've
gotten out then.

353
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,612
This way.
Stay in line.

354
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,322

They fired the first shots.
It wasn't our fault.

You can't be sure of that.

It could've been
one of our own people.

Either way, it doesn't

We didn't have any other choice.

390

Like hell, we didn't.

That didn't give us
the right to murder civilians.

Why wouldn't

Well, you've got

Look, I appreciate what

just be alone.

Oh. "Difficult."

443
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,484
"Difficult" doesn't
quite cover it.

You don't know that.

00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:16,872
When I close my eyes,
I can see the bodies.

Then why isn't there
evidence of a war...?

452

I don't know!
All I'm asking

453
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,675
is that you consider
the possibility that
this didn't happen.

454
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,054
We'll keep
investigating.

455
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,931
There are sensor readings
on the<i> Delta Flyer</i>

456
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,016
that we haven't
even analyzed yet.

457

Did you send anyone
to the surface?

No, we only scanned
for dilithium deposits.

466
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,759
We were in orbit
for less than an hour.

shield generators,

488
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,013
entered the colony
and they were gone.

489
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,015
No one's going
to believe that.

490
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,725
They will if we all
keep to the same story.

491
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,601
I won't lie about
what happened here.

492
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,230
Then you say nothing.
We murdered these people!

493
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,148
In self-defense!
If that were true,

494
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,900
you wouldn't be
vaporizing the evidence!

495
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,527
You don't have
to listen to him.

496
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,112
We've got to let people know.

497
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,696
We panicked!
They'll understand!

498
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,989
No, they won't!

499
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,783
Move away.

I'm afraid
I had to sedate you.

508
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,152
I was there.

509
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,862
I was at

00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,153
I can imagine
the away team

being pulled
into an alien conflict.

521
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:22,242
But these people weren't
anywhere near this system.

522
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,037
We've analyzed
<i>Voyager's</i>
sensor records.

523
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,164
If we did participate
in a war,

524
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,958
all evidence of it
has been erased.

525
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,085
The dream was so vivid--

526
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,881
as real as anything
I've experienced.

527
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,218
But I refuse to believe
that<i> we</i> could...

528
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,555
Real or not,
the memories

529
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,182
are having a deleterious effect
on the crew.

530
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,934
The syndrome began to spread
once we entered this system.

531
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,478
I suggest we
reverse course,

gets worse.

533
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:57,486
No. If this massacre really
happened, someone is to blame.

534
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,239
I want to be certain
that it wasn't us.

535
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,366
With all due respect,
your judgment

536
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,326
may be clouded by
feelings of guilt

537
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,370
about an incident
that never occurred.

538
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,996
The danger
to our crew

539
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,998
here and now,
is indisputable.

540
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,379
I've seen you
looking better, Ensign.

541
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,756
Yes, ma'am.

542
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,634
I've felt better myself,

543
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,303
but we're going
to get through this.

544
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,858
The massacre took
place on Tarakis.

545
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,694
Go to Red Alert
and set a course.

546
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,029
Aye, Captain.
A neural suppressant.

547
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,990
It'll help keep
the memories from resurfacing.

548
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,381
Your favorites--

549
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,301
Talaxian stew
and terra nut soufflé.

550
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,969
The soufflé
has collapsed slightly,

551
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,971
but its nutritional content
is intact.

552
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,098
Thank you.

553
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,516
It looks delicious.

554
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,938
When Naomi Wildman is sad,
she consumes desserts.

555
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,775
She claims it improves
her emotional state.

556
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,110
Perhaps you should try it.

557
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,488
Naomi must be terrified of me...

558
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,615
after what happened
in the galley.

559
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,409
She's concerned about<i> you.</i>

560
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,411
She told me she wants
to visit you.

561
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:33,999
No, not like this.

562
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,794
I might do something
to scare her again.

563
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,296
I'll give her your regards.

564
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,091
Seven...

565
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,848
When you were a Borg,

566
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:54,687
you were involved in some...
unpleasant activities.

567
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,938
I helped to assimilate millions.

568
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,817
I don't mean to be insensitive,

569
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:06,365
but... do you ever feel shame
about what you did?

570
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,200
Frequently.

571
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,745
How do you manage
to keep going,

572
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,081
knowing that you've done
such horrible things?

573
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,042
I have no choice.

574
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,919
Guilt is irrelevant?

575
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,590
On the contrary,
my feelings of remorse

576
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,592
help me remember what I did

577
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,762
and prevent me from taking
similar actions in the future.

578
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:34,267
Guilt can be a difficult
but useful emotion.

579
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,106
It's certainly difficult.

580
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,989
Is that chocolate mixed in there
with the terra nuts?

581
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,116
I altered the
recipe slightly.

582
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,118
I hope you
don't object.

583
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,206
Not at all.

584
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,013
Tarakis, dead ahead.

585
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,181
Shields.

586
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,892
Stand by weapons.

587
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,226
On screen.

588
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,978
Scan for vessels.

589
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,941
There are none.

590
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,693
Take us into orbit.

591
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,236
Ma'am?

592
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,821
Do it, Mr. Paris.

593
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,206
Life signs?

594
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,417
The planet appears
to be uninhabited.

595
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,168
Looks the same as it did
a few days ago,

596
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,962
when we scanned
for dilithium deposits.

597
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,339
Signs of weapons fire
or phaser residue?

598
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,508
Negative.

599
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,844
Run a full
spectral scan.

600
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,638
Look for anything unusual.

601
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,682
Nothing on geometric sensors.

602
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,393
Hold on. I'm picking up
a power signature.

603
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,228
Source?
I can't tell.

604
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,021
The signal's erratic,

605
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,524
but it's coming
from the northernmost continent,

606
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,736
coordinates 172 mark 5.

607
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,835
Phasers.

(<i> birds chirping</i> )

609
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,181
Call it an educated guess,

610
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,934
but I don't think this
looks like a war zone.

611
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,894
There's something familiar
about it though.

612
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,146
I recognize those mountains.

613
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,064
Those trees weren't here.

614
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,733
Search the area.

615
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,238
(<i> bird cawing</i> )

616
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,842
Ensign?

617
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,844
The tunnel.

618
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:16,137
It's nearby.

619
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,056
The one where I, uh...

620
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,560
How'd you get into it?

621
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,603
There was a rock formation.

622
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,564
It hid the opening.

623
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,115
A faint energy signature.

624
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,747
This way.

625
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,182
Over here.

626
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,036
(<i> sighs</i> )

627
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,746
There's your
physical evidence.

628
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,206
I suggest we proceed
with caution.

629
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,666
Stand guard.

I... I... I can't.

634
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,745
Remain calm.

635
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,832
Slow, deep breaths.

(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

637
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,948
They were over there.

(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

639
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,797
I found the remains
of two humanoids,

640
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,383
but you were not responsible
for their deaths.

641
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,804
They died
over 300 years ago.

642
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,932

I think we found our war.

646
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,329
The structure contains
a synaptic transmitter.

647
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,207
I believe
it was designed

648
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:15,501
to send neurogenic pulses
throughout this system.

649
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,420
So anyone passing through

650
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,464
would experience
the Nakan massacre...

651
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,634
like we did.
SEVEN: Precisely.

652
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,262
Try running those symbols
inscribed on the base

653
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,597
through the translation matrix.

654
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:34,062
"Words alone cannot
convey the suffering.

655
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,730
Words alone cannot prevent

656
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,233
what happened here
from happening again.

657
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,986
Beyond words lies experience.

658
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,239
Beyond experience lies truth.

659
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,783
Make this truth

660
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,285
your own."

661
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,370
It's a memorial.

662
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,957
We weren't victims
of a conspiracy.

663
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,168
We were witnesses to a massacre.

664
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,794
More than witnesses.

665
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,796
By being forced
to relive those events,

666
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,714
half the crew's
been traumatized.

667
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,800
Maybe that was the point.

668
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,303
I certainly won't forget
what happened here.

669
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,182
Anything in that database
that might tell us who built
this thing?

670
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,391
No. The technology
has been neglected

671
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,269
for more than two centuries.

672
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,354
Its power cells
are deteriorating.

673
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,816
That could explain
why our memories
were so fragmented.

674
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,029
It was probably designed
to transmit the experience
in sequence.

675
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,405
Fascinating.
Now let's try to shut it down

676
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,700
so nobody else
has to go through this.

677
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,078
Kathryn?

678
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,081
Yes, of course.

679
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,794
Even if we do shut down
the transmitter,

680
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,881
I'm afraid your memories
of the massacre are permanent.

681
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,758
But we'll prevent this
from happening to
other passing ships.

682
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,593
If we do that,
all record

683
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,179
of what happened here
would be lost.

684
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,805
The monument
will still be here.

685
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,183
But that doesn't really
tell the story.

686
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,853
Someone put a lot
of time and care into
building that transmitter.

687
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,106
We can't just deactivate it.
We don't have the right.

688
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,650
Did they have the right
to force us to relive all that?

689
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,652
They wanted others to know
what it was like,

690
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,280
in the hopes
that nothing like it
would happen again.

691
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,242
Why should anyone have to
experience an atrocity
they didn't commit?

692
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:13,619
Because that's how you learn
not to make the same mistake.

693
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,249
If we destroy the evidence,
we're no better than Saavdra.

694
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,210
Maybe he had a point.
It wasn't our fault.

695
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,337
Given the danger involved,
it's only logical...

696
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:25,673
This isn't about logic!
It's about remembering!

697
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,593
Some things
are best forgotten.
Not this.

698
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,680
I stood by once before
and did nothing.

699
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,141
Not again.
Captain?

700
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,811
I watched while Saavdra
vaporized the bodies.

701
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,232
No offense, but those were
other people's memories.

702
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,067
The Obelisk at Khitomer,

703
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,693
the fields at Gettysburg,

704
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,238
those were other people's
memories, too,

705
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,407
but we don't
honor them any less.

706
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,285
The 82 colonists
who died here...

707
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,372
they deserve their memorial.
Captain...

708
00:40:57,414 --> 00:41:00,833
We're not going to shut down
the transmitter. Is that clear?

709
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,296
Is that clear?

710
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,215
Are you suggesting
we leave it intact?

711
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,842
I'm suggesting
that we repair it.

712
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,552
Recharge the power cells.

713
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,305
I want that monument

714
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,182
to function properly
for another 300 years.

715
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,559
We'll place
a warning buoy in orbit.

716
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,604
Anyone who enters this system
will know what to expect.

717
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,774
Dismissed.

718
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,528
We're ready, Captain.

719
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:17,618
I know this was hardest
on the four of you,

720
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,579
but if you hadn't
stopped at this planet,

721
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,292
all the people who died here
would have been forgotten.

722
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:28,171
And if they could,
I know they'd thank you.

723
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,716
Janeway to<i> Voyager.</i>

724
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,719
Stand by to initiate
power transfer.

725
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,432
Five to beam up.

726
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,862
(<i> monument powering up</i> )
