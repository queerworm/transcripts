00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,305
Come on,<i> Voyager.</i> 
I know you're there.

13
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,558
Hello?

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,853
<i>Voyager?</i>

15
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,022
Are you receiving
this transmission?

16
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,107
My designation is Mezoti.

17
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,902
You sound a little young
to be working the com.

18
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,445
I'm eight.

19
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,072
I see.

20
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,782
Are there any grownups
I could speak to?

21
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,784
My species is 689,

22
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,996
Norcadian.
What species are you?

23
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,042
That's a complicated question.

24
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,877
Explain.

25
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,962
I don't know how long
I can keep this channel open.

26
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,048
I need you to patch me through
to Captain Janeway.

27
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,552
I'll try, but my height
may be insufficient.

28
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,559
(<i> console beeping</i> )

29
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,565

30
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,692
Hello?

31
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,152
<i>Voyager?</i>

32
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:04,203
Mezoti, you are
not authorized
to be in here.

33
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,580
Are you going to report me
to the Captain?

34
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:11,292
Considering this is
your first offense,
a warning will suffice.

35
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,006
What were my
instructions?

36
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,175
To wait in the Cargo Bay
until you returned.

37
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,968
Why didn't
you comply?

38
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,929
You left the children
unsupervised.

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,430
Lieutenant Torres
required

40
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,015
my assistance
in Engineering.

41
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,558
I was gone for less
than ten minutes.

42
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,143
ICHEB:
We told her
not to deviate

43
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,895
from your
instructions.

44
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,189
She wouldn't listen.

45
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,275
When the Captain asked you
to take charge
of these children,

46
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,945
you assured her that
you could maintain order.

47
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,573
Controlling them is
proving more difficult
than I anticipated.

48
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,034
They're highly
unpredictable.

49
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:47,121
Meditation helps
Vulcan children
to control their emotions.

50
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,664
You might consider...
Mezoti!

51
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,042
I'm trying to talk
to the woman.

52
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,669
What woman?

53
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,673
The one transmitting
from Spatial Grid 2369.

54
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,679
She's made contact
with a small ship,

55
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,182
approximately
three light-years from here.

56
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,726
Alien vessel, this is
the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

57
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,352
Respond.

58
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,815
FEMALE:
Tuvok? That's you, isn't it?

59
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,651
This is Lieutenant
Commander Tuvok.

60
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,527
Sounds like
someone got promoted.

61
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,362
I want to hear all about it,
but first

62
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,323
I need to speak
to Captain Janeway.

63
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:32,415
You're a sight for sore eyes,
Captain.

64
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,042
You, too, Harry.

65
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,424
I'm sorry, but do we know you?

66
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,885
I'm Ensign Lyndsay Ballard.

67
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,720
I was a member of your crew.

68
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,640
Of course, I'm not surprised
you don't recognize me.

69
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,019
I don't know who you are,
but I'm not amused.

70
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,271
Ensign Ballard died almost...

71
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,481
It was on stardate 51563.

72
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,733
I can't blame you
for being skeptical, Captain.

73
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,903
But if you'd let me come aboard,
I can explain everything.

74
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,286
We'll beam you to Sick Bay.

75
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,497
I'm sure you'll want me
behind a level-10 force field.

76
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,249
No offense.

77
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,045
None taken.
I'm just glad to be home.

78
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,420
Captain?

79
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,008
What do you think?

80
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,093
She seems to have
intimate knowledge

81
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,512
of this ship and its crew.

82
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,015
I think we should
find out who she is.

83
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,101
Captain,
I'd like to come with you.

84
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,187
I was very close
to Lyndsay,

85
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,480
and if somehow it's her...

86
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,857
I'll know.

87
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,488
Harry and I were on our way
to a Class-M planet

88
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,615
in the Vyntadi expanse,

89
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,369
to recover dilithium ore
we'd detected
a few days earlier.

90
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,913
When we landed, we
realized it was a trap

91
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,413
set by a Hirogen
hunting party.

92
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,083
They'd reconfigured
a power cell

93
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,001
to give off false
dilithium readings.

94
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,794
That's exactly what happened.

95
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,922
Go on.

96
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,174
Harry and I headed
back to the shuttle.

97
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:08,095
We were ten feet away, when I
was hit with a neural disrupter.

98
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,597
Harry said
my injury wasn't that bad.

99
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,682
He always was a terrible liar.

100
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,477
I tried to get Lyndsay back
to<i> Voyager,</i> but...

101
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,939
she was already dead.

102
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,774
We buried her in space.

103
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,943
Go on with your story.

104
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,861
I woke up
on a ship,

105
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,114
in a stasis chamber
surrounded by aliens.

106
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,742
They told me they'd used their
technology to reanimate me.

107
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,620
I didn't believe them
when they said I'd died,

108
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,290
but they showed me visual scans
of my own corpse

109
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,167
lying in the torpedo casing
I'd been buried in.

110
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,628
The Kobali said
I'd been drifting for weeks.

111
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,171
"Kobali"?

112
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,424
If you ever met them,
you'd remember.

113
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,801
They look just like this.

114
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,636
After the reanimation process,

115
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,013
they spent months altering
my DNA.

116
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,599
They were constantly
scanning me, injecting me...

117
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,768
Just to make you look
like one of them?

118
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,353
That's how they procreate.

119
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,106
They salvage the dead
of other races.

120
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,566
I was given a Kobali name
and placed with a family

121
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,026
to help me acclimate.

122
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,987
You were a prisoner.

123
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,571
At first.

124
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,288
I wanted to contact you
to tell you I was safe,

125
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,166
but the Kobali wouldn't let me.

126
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,918
They said you were part
of my<i> kyn'steya...</i>

127
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,754
my...

128
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:29,843
my past life, and that I
needed to forget you...

129
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,719
all of you.

130
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,891
So I spent two years
letting my new family

131
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,518
think I'd accepted them.

132
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,770
When I finally earned
their trust,

133
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,607
I stole a shuttle and started
looking for<i> Voyager.</i>

134
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,067
That was six months ago.

135
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,069
They've been chasing me
ever since.

136
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,197
In spite
of her appearance,

137
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,492
I'm detecting traces
of human DNA.

138
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,743
I've compared them
with the genetic samples

139
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,330
from Ensign Ballard's file.

140
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,789
They match.

141
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,793
It's certainly
a convincing story.

142
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,753
But your Starfleet training
is telling you

143
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,006
to consider
all the possibilities.

144
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,258
Maybe I'm some sort
of hybrid clone

145
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,262
or a telepath who accessed
Ensign Ballard's memory somehow.

146
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,556
Believe me, I was suspicious
myself at first,

147
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,559
but I<i> am</i> Lyndsay Ballard.

148
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,444
Until we find evidence
to the contrary...

149
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,579
welcome home.

150
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,210
Captain, could you
give us a minute?

151
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,628
Doctor.

152
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,726
So it's really you.

153
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,478
In the flesh...

154
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,021
so to speak.

155
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,661
I've missed you, too.

156
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,507
I know you're all
as eager as I am

157
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,176
to welcome
Ensign Ballard back.

158
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,637
She's a fine officer

159
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,599
who's shown a lot
of courage and determination
over the past few years,

160
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,809
and we're lucky to have
her with us again.

161
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,270
So let's do everything we can
to make her feel at home.

162
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,063
Tom and I have already
taken the liberty

163
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,940
of removing Lyndsay's
personal effects from storage.

164
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,942
And whenever
you're ready,
your old shift

165
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,694
is waiting for you
in Engineering.
Thanks, Lieutenant.

166
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,616
Before we get ahead of
ourselves, let's not forget
the Kobali are still out there.

167
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,952
It seems they want her back
as much as we want to keep her.

168
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,997
We'll need to take precautions
in case they track her
to<i> Voyager.</i>

169
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,791
I've run preliminary scans
on the Kobali shuttle.

170
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,253
I believe I can adapt
our systems to counter
a possible attack.

171
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,299
Very good. Well, if there's
no further business...

172
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,723
Thank you for saying
those nice things about me.
You seem surprised.

173
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,393
To be honest, I never
thought you noticed me.

174
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,521
My mistake.

175
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,443
So, you still playing
the clarinet?

176
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,903
Actually, I've taken up
the saxophone.

177
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,572
Ambitious.

178
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,449
I bet you're
good at it.

179
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,992
You always were
my biggest fan.

180
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,203
Please, no past tense.

181
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,289
Sorry. This is a little
strange for me.

182
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,626
Really?
It's been a perfectly
normal day for me.

183
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,796
Deck 2.

184
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,549
It just so happens
that hearing you

185
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,176
play music again
is #26 on my list.

186
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,387
List?
Something I made up
to pass the time

187
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,971
while I was away.

188
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,931
I tried to think of
everything I would do

189
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,184
if I got
back to<i> Voyager--</i> 
including some things

190
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,811
I wasn't able to
accomplish the first
time I was here.

191
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,105
Like showing up
for duty shifts on time?

192
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,483
That's #27.

193
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,032
They're here.

194
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,078
Ah.

195
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,248
Why don't you and I
have a cup of tea while
the children play?

196
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,042
Thank you, but they require
my supervision.

197
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,002
I like your braid.

198
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,795
I could show you
how to do it.

199
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,797
SEVEN:
Mezoti.

200
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,300
Something wrong?

201
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,095
I've allotted one hour
for recreational activity.

202
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,514
There's no time
for irrelevant conversation.

203
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,182
It's not irrelevant.

204
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,850
Adhering to our schedule

205
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,395
will allow us to use our time
more efficiently.

206
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,021
We'll be able
to participate in a wider...

207
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,065
...Wider variety
of activities.

208
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,319
Fun will now commence.

209
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,449
Green.

210
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,117
Grid 313.

211
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,835
Counter. Grid 10.

212
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,757
They're cheating.

213
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,258
How?

214
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,968
Azan is using
his neural interface

215
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,928
to share
information.

216
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,472
Is this true?

217
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,184
You will exercise
Punishment Protocol 9-Alpha.

218
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,403
If they cannot participate,
neither will I.

219
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,489
You are encouraging
disorder.

220
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,325
And you never let us do
what we want.

221
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,580
<i>You</i> will exercise
Punishment Protocol 9-Alpha.

222
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,166
No... I won't.

223
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,968
There you go.

224
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,554
I can't believe
you saved all this.

225
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,474
Tuvok thought I should
recycle everything,

226
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,268
but I just couldn't
bring myself to do it.

227
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,061
My skates and I
thank you

228
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,854
from the bottom
of our hearts.

229
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,326
Do you know how long
it took me to fold those?

230
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,411
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Same old Harry.

231
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,790
What's that supposed
to mean?

232
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,959
You're still sort
of obsessive.

233
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,212
I'm tidy.

234
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,007
Is that why you used to request
baryon sweeps of your dorm room?

235
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,343
When you live
across the hall
from a slob...

236
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,886
Hey.

237
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,013
Show some respect for the dead.

238
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,561
Did I say something wrong?

239
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,856
It's nothing.

240
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,108
Just because I've been gone
for three years

241
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,403
doesn't mean I can't still
read you like a book.

242
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,407
I gave the eulogy
at your funeral.

243
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,202
Oh?

244
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,748
What'd you say?

245
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,042
Come on.

246
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,545
It's everyone's fantasy
to hear their own eulogy.

247
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,881
Absolutely not.

248
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,052
It's probably
for the best.

249
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,932
You always were
a terrible public speaker.

250
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,729
Just hope you didn't
stutter too much.

251
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,900
(<i> long sigh</i> )

252
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,153
I told them you had
a favorite saying...

253
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,073
something you got
from an old Klingon
battle cry.

254
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,911
"Own the Day."

255
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,955
I said that you
always believed in...

256
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,291
attacking each day...

257
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,042
possessing it...

258
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,881
and that that was what
made you so much fun
to be around.

259
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,426
Is that when everybody
burst into tears?

260
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,971
I said that, if
you'd been there,

261
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,516
you would've told them
to own<i> that</i> day,

262
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,185
to attack it,
make it their own

263
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,814
and plan to do the
same thing tomorrow.

264
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,486
Pretty strong stuff.

265
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,529
You were a strong person.

266
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,698
Not always.

267
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,742
These last six months
haven't been easy.

268
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,744
There were plenty of times
when I could have given up.

269
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,621
But you didn't.

270
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,039
You know why?

271
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,668
You.

272
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,045
I wanted to see you again.

273
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,261
Hmm. Guess I won't be
needing this anymore.

274
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,516
DOCTOR:
Sick Bay to Ensign Ballard.

275
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,978
I've finished analyzing
your bio-scans.

276
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,273
I'm on my way.

277
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,944
My scans identified
a genetic pathogen
in your bloodstream.

278
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:11,614
It appears to have converted
most of your human DNA

279
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,491
into a Kobali
protein structure.

280
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,576
Is there any way
to reverse it?

281
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,997
The biochemical changes
have affected every system
in your body.

282
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,708
I'm afraid there isn't
enough of your original DNA left

283
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,627
to make you
human again.

284
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,464
But I believe I<i> can</i> effect
some cosmetic changes.

285
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,968
Are you saying
you could make me
look like me again?

286
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,889
Yes. The alternations would
literally be skin-deep,

287
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,974
and it may take
several treatments,

288
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,100
but I've devised
an inaprovaline compound

289
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,186
which should do the trick.

290
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,022
Physiologically,
you'd still be Kobali,

291
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,690
with a multispheric brain,

292
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,692
a binary cardiovascular
system...

293
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,653
But I'd look human.
Oh, yes.

294
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,364
I've lived with this face
for long enough.

295
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,492
Let's do it.
Have a seat.

296
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,619
You may experience
some dizziness.

297
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,080
I'll hang on to
Harry for support,
if he doesn't mind.

298
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,623
That's what
I'm here for.

299
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,428
What?

300
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,179
Something wrong?

301
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,641
See for yourself.

302
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,410
Here we are...

303
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,081
one Jiballian Berry salad.

304
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,207
I have been looking
forward to this

305
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,919
for a very long time.

306
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,378
It was #6 on her list.

307
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,671
There isn't much variety

308
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,339
in the Kobali diet.

309
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,675
We ate the same gray
paste for three years.

310
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,892
It doesn't taste
the way I remember it.

311
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,894
What's wrong? Too sweet?

312
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,230
No offense, but it's got
sort of a metallic flavor.

313
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,279
Seems fine to me.

314
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,741
I guess my taste buds
are still Kobali.

315
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,785
Can I get you something else?

316
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,244
Thanks.

317
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,371
But I need to take
care of #16:

318
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,457
Dazzle Lieutenant Torres.

319
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,134
One minute early.

320
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,511
(<i> sighs</i> ):
There's a first time
for everything.

321
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,388
An alignment error
has been cropping up
in the dilithium matrix.

322
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,934
We can't seem to figure
out what's causing it.

323
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,145
I-I know that you're
still settling in,

324
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,271
so I'll give you
a couple of days to...

325
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,065
It's a<i> vyk'tiote.</i>

326
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,441
Excuse me?

327
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,111
Oh, a Kobali word to describe

328
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,488
a certain kind
of wave phenomenon.
It's hard to translate.

329
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,323
Try me.

330
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,910
Literally, it means
"crumpled dance."

331
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:07,623
All I need to do is<i> vyq'tal</i>
<i>the qen'dioqe</i> matrices,

332
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:11,836
stabilize the<i> per'cheya,</i>
<i>tez'tel se nenna...</i>

333
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,504
<i>Cham'bioque!</i>

334
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,257
What?

335
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,302
You were speaking Kobali.

336
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,394
I didn't realize.
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,646
Well, whatever
you did,

338
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,858
the alignment
error is gone.

339
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,359
Nice job.

340
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,319
Thanks.

341
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:42,742
I think there might be
a few... "crumpled dances"

342
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,618
in the warp core, too.

343
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,746
Feel like taking a look?

344
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,837
Any sign of the Kobali?

345
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,338
None.

346
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,632
The latest tactical reports
from Tuvok.

347
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,342
Commander...

348
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,804
I no longer wish
to serve as guardian

349
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,932
to the Borg children.

350
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,808
What's the problem?

351
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,061
Their behavior
is chaotic.

352
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,604
My attempts to
apply discipline

353
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,522
only result in
further disorder.

354
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,650
Well, kids and disorder
usually go hand-in-hand.

355
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,485
Neelix issued
a similar warning

356
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,571
prior to my taking
this assignment,

357
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,949
which is why I devised
an activities schedule

358
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,909
to promote focus and unity.

359
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,162
0700 hours, the children
emerge from their alcoves.

360
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,164
Nutrients are ingested
in the Mess Hall

361
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,251
prior to proceeding
to the Science Lab
to begin classes.

362
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,295
At 1300 hours, nutrients
are consumed a second time

363
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,172
before reporting
to the holodeck,

364
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,591
where they're studying
comparative alien physiology.

365
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,760
Doesn't sound like
there's much time for fun.

366
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,511
On the contrary.

367
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,973
I've scheduled
recreational activities.

368
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,225
You can't always
schedule fun, Seven.

369
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,685
Sometimes it needs
to be spontaneous.

370
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,688
According to my research,
children require structure.

371
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,316
I agree,
but not to this extreme.

372
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,027
You're treating them like
they're still on a Borg cube.

373
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,196
You're comparing me
to the collective?

374
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,032
You have all four children
functioning as<i> one.</i>

375
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,367
They do the same things together
at the same time.

376
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,746
So that each child has
the same opportunities to learn.

377
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,294
They're individuals.
Maybe they're rebelling

378
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,712
because you don't let them
express themselves.

379
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,714
Then grant my request.

380
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,467
Choose a more suitable
crew member to instruct them.

381
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,971
Sorry, Seven.
Permission denied.

382
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,436
Well, I see
you're finally

383
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,022
going to try
my hockey program.

384
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,316
Actually, I'm taking
Lyndsay skating.

385
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,276
Oh. Mm. You two sure
have been spending

386
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,735
a lot of time
together lately.

387
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,945
Don't start.

388
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,362
Oh, now, let's see...

389
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,990
for those of us
keeping score,

390
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,867
Harry Kim has fallen
for a hologram,

391
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,286
a Borg, the wrong twin,

392
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:51,954
and now, the
dearly departed.

393
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,580
We're friends.

394
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,708
Ah.
Just like before.

395
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,919
Uh, all right,
maybe there was a time

396
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,504
when I thought
of pursuing Lyndsay,

397
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,173
but I closed
the door on that

398
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,716
when we both got assigned
to<i> Voyager.</i>

399
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,176
Mm. Don't look now,

400
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,678
but that door
is creaking open.

401
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,183
(<i> sighs</i> )

402
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,569
What do you think?

403
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,072
Uh... you look great.

404
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,074
Doctor thought I should stick
to my original color,

405
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,491
but this seemed more exciting.

406
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,535
Hair is one of
my specialties,

407
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,914
despite evidence
to the contrary.

408
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,624
It's just too bad
that beneath this
beautiful red hair

409
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,044
still lies the six-lobed
brain of a Kobali.

410
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,005
Well, are you feeling human
enough for a little skating?

411
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,300
I'd love to, but I
already have a date.

412
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,677
Who with?
The Captain.

413
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,347
She's invited me
to her quarters for dinner.

414
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,515
In six years, I have
never been invited

415
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,226
to the Captain's
quarters for dinner.

416
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,228
Well, I'll give her
your regards.

417
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,154
Oh, damn!

418
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,530
(<i> door chimes</i> )

419
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,782
Come in.

420
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,161
Formal dress
wasn't required, Ensign.

421
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,039
Well, I just... I figured
dinner with the Captain...

422
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,916
I'd hardly call this dinner.

423
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,919
My replicator decided
to<i> liquefy</i> the pot roast.

424
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,046
It looks fine to me.

425
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,383
Stop trying
to get on my good side
and grab a slice of bread.

426
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:31,345
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.
I hope you don't mind.

427
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,348
Not at all.
I lived on them
at the Academy.

428
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,393
So, how was your first day
back on the job?

429
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,186
Pretty good, I think.

430
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,521
Lieutenant Torres called
my work "competent."

431
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,067
Trust me, that's<i> high</i> praise
coming from B'Elanna.

432
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,199
Commander Tuvok finished
his analysis of your shuttle

433
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,576
and presented me
with 37 different ways

434
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,536
of repelling a Kobali attack.

435
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,289
Did he include
your pot roast?

436
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,707
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,335
I didn't mean...

438
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,378
I can't believe
I just said that.

439
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,172
Why? It was funny.

440
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,798
We're not on the Bridge,
Lyndsay.

441
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,633
You have permission
to speak freely.

442
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,677
Do you really mean that?

443
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,347
I wouldn't
have said it otherwise.

444
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:19,935
Then... there's something
I've wanted to ask you
for a long time.

445
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,147
Why me?

446
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,232
I'm sorry?

447
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,152
Why did you choose me
for that away mission?

448
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,989
Well, I suppose I thought you
were best suited for the job.

449
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,532
No, I wasn't.

450
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:38,287
Dilithium extraction was always
Lieutenant Torres' specialty.

451
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,832
And Tuvok had
far more experience
conducting away missions,

452
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,960
but you didn't send
either one of them.

453
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,838
Was it because
they were closer to you?

454
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,217
You blame me.

455
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,469
No. No, that's not what I meant.

456
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,803
It's okay, Lyndsay.
No, it's not.

457
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,222
I'm not offended.

458
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,015
No, you don't understand.

459
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,270
"Never harbor anger toward those
who brought you death,

460
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,232
for they gave you the chance
to live again."

461
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,109
In letting me
die, Captain,

462
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,695
you gave me life.

463
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,575
I'm sorry.
Lyndsay...

464
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,995
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.

465
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,634
You're late.

466
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,844
We expected you hours ago.

467
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,137
For what?

468
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,638
Your farewell party.

469
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,140
You weren't supposed
to come back.

470
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,725
You don't belong
here anymore.

471
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,561
Harry, what's going on?

472
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,229
"Lyndsay Ballard,
beloved friend

473
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,189
and crewman"--
does that sound right?

474
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,524
What?

475
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,900
For your eulogy...

476
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,569
does that
sound okay?

477
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,113
Harry, I'm not dead.

478
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,574
Denial: one of
the final stages.

479
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,617
It was illogical for you
to return.

480
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,081
Please, I don't want to go.

481
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,125
I couldn't save
you before, Lyndsay.

482
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,710
What makes you think
I can save you now?

483
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:15,801
<i>Jen'to ka'siote...</i>
<i>Jhet'leya.</i>

484
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,057
(<i> door chiming</i> )

485
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,894
Come in.

486
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,360
What's wrong?

487
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,737
Bad day, I guess.

488
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,990
B'Elanna told me
you did great in Engineering.

489
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,367
I solved
a simple problem.

490
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,077
Didn't sound
so simple to me.

491
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,956
Any Kobali can discern
simple wave distortions.

492
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,167
Even if B'Elanna
was impressed,

493
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,628
the others were
staring at me.

494
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,338
I'm sure it was
just your imagination.

495
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,006
And then, to make
matters worse,

496
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,216
I started babbling
in front of the Captain.

497
00:27:56,258 --> 00:28:00,304
Oh. I used to get pretty
nervous around her, too.

498
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,390
Yeah, don't worry.

499
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,059
I'm sure she didn't
take it personally.

500
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,190
Hey...

501
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,194
I know this isn't easy...

502
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,281
but I'll help you
through this.

503
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,246
You have always been
far too nice to me.

504
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,956
Why is that?

505
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,921
You really don't have
any idea, do you?

506
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,300
Think about it.

507
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,969
I rearranged my schedule
at the Academy

508
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,223
just so we'd be
in the same classes.

509
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,268
I let you teach me how to skate,
even though I hate the cold.

510
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,399
I'm crazy about you.

511
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,527
I have been
since the day we met.

512
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,363
Why didn't
you ever tell me?

513
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,035
I was never good
at public speaking, remember?

514
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,791
But I figure
how often do you get
a second chance.

515
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:17,548
Which is why I'd very much
like to kiss you now.

516
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,054
"Own the Day."

517
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,914
Sorry.

518
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,917
You are creating disorder.

519
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,628
Seven will be angry.

520
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,588
I don't care.

521
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,765
They're cubes.
I can see that.

522
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,226
Precisely 1/1,000 the
size of a Borg vessel.

523
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,770
Well done.

524
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,984
A 26-sided polyhedron,
composed of hexagons,

525
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,111
octagons and squares.

526
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,196
Impressive.

527
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,911
What's this?

528
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,747
Can't you tell?

529
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,417
It's you.

530
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,671
I don't see the resemblance.

531
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,548
Look. Here's your
ocular implant,

532
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,592
your nose,
your mouth...

533
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,969
You were instructed to create
a geometric shape.

534
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,680
I reminded
her of that.

535
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,515
She wouldn't comply.

536
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,391
This was more fun.

537
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,229
Don't you like it?

538
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,024
It is crude.

539
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,361
However, it does demonstrate

540
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,447
ingenuity and individuality.

541
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,325
She deviated
from your instructions.

542
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,244
Aren't you going to implement
a punishment protocol?

543
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,581
No.

544
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,461
Resume your disorder.

545
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,555
Lyndsay?

546
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,684
They're coming.

547
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,234
Red Alert.
Raise shields.

548
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,695
We are being hailed.

549
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,154
On screen.

550
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,032
I've come for Jhet'leya.

551
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,076
If you're referring
to Ensign Ballard,

552
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,912
she's made it clear that she
doesn't want to go with you.

553
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,539
She's my daughter.

554
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,711
Please... I've come a long way.

555
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,672
I only want to speak with her.

556
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,680
You don't have
to see him, you know.

557
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,390
They can't make you.

558
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,684
I want to, Harry.

559
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,103
It's time
to stop running.

560
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,733
I appreciate this, Captain.

561
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,109
I'm willing
to oblige

562
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,694
as long as
you understand

563
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,362
that this
meeting is over

564
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,073
as soon as Ensign
Ballard says it is.

565
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,911
What have they
done to you?

566
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,121
Given me my life back.

567
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,624
You were so beautiful.

568
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,879
It's good to see
you, Jhet'leya.

569
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,756
My name is Lyndsay.

570
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,759
Why did you leave us?

571
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,219
I wanted to be
with my people again.

572
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,848
<i>These</i> people?
The same ones who set you
adrift in space?

573
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,935
We jettisoned her body
in accordance with our customs.

574
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,103
You abandoned her.

575
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,064
You had no right to
tamper with her remains.

576
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,401
We were acting in accordance
with<i> our</i> customs.

577
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,736
You mutilated her.

578
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,070
Ensign...

579
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,282
The reanimation
process

580
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,034
usually results in
extensive memory loss,

581
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,996
which makes the
transition less painful.

582
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,666
Unfortunately,
some remember

583
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,960
their former lives
more than others.

584
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,711
Jhet'leya, for example.

585
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,338
I told you to call me...

586
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,340
Lyndsay Ballard.

587
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,675
She's dead.

588
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,887
She has been
for three years.

589
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,389
Forgive me for being so blunt,

590
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,477
but when we found her,
she was a lifeless corpse.

591
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,524
We salvaged that raw material
to create a new person--

592
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,943
my daughter-- whom I love.

593
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,862
I'm not your daughter.

594
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,614
You may have altered
your appearance,

595
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,617
but do you still think
like these people?

596
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:59,496
Even now, the first words
that come into your head,

597
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,248
are they in<i> their</i> language
or mine?

598
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,084
I realize this place

599
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:09,172
is familiar to you,
but it's not where you belong.

600
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,926
Your sister misses you.

601
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,470
Tynsia.

602
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,847
She keeps asking

603
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,348
when you're coming home.

604
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,935
What should I tell her?

605
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,947
Tell her that her sister's dead.

606
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,453
I'll escort you
to the transporter room.

607
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,706
I won't give her up, Captain.

608
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,958
She made her wishes clear.

609
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,710
She's confused.

610
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,837
Thanks to what
you did to her.

611
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,840
I don't want to fight you.

612
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,467
Your ship is no match
for<i> Voyager.</i>

613
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,806
Every life is precious
to my people, Captain.

614
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,770
I won't be coming back alone.

615
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,909
Midnight snack?

616
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,707
Kobali cuisine
at its finest.

617
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,879
So I was giving
some thought to #32--

618
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,672
"Make Tuvok laugh."

619
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,842
He has this holo-program,
"The Temple of T'Panit."

620
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,636
I thought we might tweak it,

621
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,345
so that instead
of Vulcan prayers,

622
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,016
the monks recite
Ferengi limericks.

623
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,520
You're not laughing.

624
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,899
Sorry.

625
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,401
I can't stop thinking
about Q'ret.

626
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,989
I can't believe he had the nerve
to call himself your father.

627
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,492
I'll bet Professor Ballard
would have had something
to say about that.

628
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,744
Who?

629
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,998
Your... dad.

630
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,750
Doesn't he teach
at some university?

631
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,878
I don't remember.

632
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,299
I don't remember
anything about him.

633
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,892
Let's get down to the holodeck.
We've got some monks to tweak.

634
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,310
Sure.

635
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,354
(<i> gasps</i> )

636
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,981
What's wrong?

637
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,080
Why did she start to
revert all of a sudden?

638
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,541
Our old friend,
the pathogen.

639
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,127
It's adapting
to counteract my treatments.

640
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:55,547
It's possible she'll suffer
occasional relapses
for the rest of her life.

641
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,382
You said you could
maintain my appearance.

642
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,218
I can, but it looks like
I'll need to increase

643
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,012
the frequency
of your treatments.

644
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,389
You'll have to see me
at least twice a day.

645
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,184
How am I supposed to do my job
if I'm in here all the time?

646
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,644
How am I supposed
to<i> do</i> anything?

647
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,604
Please try to underst...
<i>Stoi'gia!</i>

648
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,482
<i>Net'staika</i>
<i>pen'daeli shevaob!</i>

649
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,112
I'm sorry.

650
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:34,252
(<i> hatch opens, closes</i> )

651
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,048
Wow.

652
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,968
This place sure is lived-in.

653
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,263
If you're here to lecture
me about cleanliness...

654
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,307
I'm here to ask you
to stop the treatments.

655
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,644
You know what
happens if I do.

656
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,188
You'll look Kobali again?

657
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,397
So what?

658
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,859
I thought you were cute bald.

659
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:03,198
I don't care if you're human,
Kobali or Bolian.

660
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,033
I just want you to be happy.

661
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,493
I wouldn't fit in.

662
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,996
Are you saying Tuvok
and Neelix don't fit in?

663
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,958
That's different.
They got to grow up
in their own cultures.

664
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,752
They know where they
come from, who they are.

665
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,587
Wherever they come from,

666
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,465
they're part of this crew now,
just like you.

667
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,425
<i>Lyndsay</i> was part
of this crew.

668
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,011
If I stop the treatments,
I won't be Lyndsay anymore.

669
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,680
(<i> sighs</i> ):
You don't honestly believe that.

670
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,895
Since the day I got back here,
I haven't felt right.

671
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,982
First I thought
it was<i> Voyager.</i> 
Things had changed so much,

672
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:41,153
I thought if I just
gave myself more time
I'd get used to it.

673
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,823
But it's me.

674
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,993
<i>I've</i> changed.

675
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:55,125
And the more I try to deny it,
the more I feel like a ghost.

676
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,135
I'm sorry, Harry...

677
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,887
but I can't
keep fighting anymore.

678
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,348
What about us?

679
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,646
The girl you were in love with
died three years ago.

680
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,117
Shields down to 48 percent.

681
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,161
Target the lead ship's
weapons array.

682
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:34,164
Life support's
failing on Decks
6 through 10.

683
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,875
Reroute power
to compensate.

684
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,793
Shields at 20 percent.

685
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,628
Hail them. Tell them
you'll surrender me.

686
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,755
Don't listen to her, Captain.

687
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,633
I appreciate
the gesture, Lyndsay,
but I'm not giving you up.

688
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,344
It's not a gesture.
I want to go.

689
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,346
I don't belong here.

690
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,848
She's not well.
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

691
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,851
I know exactly what I'm saying.

692
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,020
Shields at 13 percent.

693
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:00,023
I'm detecting power fluctuations
in the lead vessel's warp drive.

694
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,234
A polaron burst
could overload the core.

695
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,902
That would destroy
the ship.

696
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,987
They're not leaving
us much choice.

697
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,990
Whatever we do,
we have to do it fast.

698
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,118
You're sure
this is what you want.

699
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,120
Captain,

700
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,081
I can fire that
polaron burst myself.

701
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,540
Stand down, Ensign.

702
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,625
We can't just let
them take her!

703
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:24,463
Even if you stop them,
I can't stay
on<i> Voyager.</i>

704
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,799
I don't want to lose you.

705
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,635
You already did, but
at least this time,

706
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,389
we've been given the
chance to say good-bye.

707
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:40,730
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53679.4.</i>

708
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,982
<i>The Doctor has stopped</i>
<i>Ensign Ballard's treatments,</i>

709
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,734
<i>and her Kobali physiology</i>

710
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,986
<i>is already beginning</i>
<i>to reassert itself.</i>

711
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,697
<i>All but one of us</i>
<i>have said our good-byes.</i>

712
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,046
<i>Vien'ke debala,</i>
<i>Jhet'leya.</i>

713
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,925
I taught myself
to say a few words in Kobali.

714
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,719
That's very sweet of you,

715
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:15,014
but you just told me
the comets are tiresome.

716
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,603
Guess I better work
on my pronunciation.

717
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,189
I'm sorry
you didn't get to finish
everything on your list.

718
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,991
I think I took care of
what really mattered.

719
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,701
That's pretty.

720
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,039
It belonged
to a friend of mine.

721
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,005
Would you like it?

722
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,132
Your friend wouldn't mind?

723
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,301
I think she'd be happy

724
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,554
knowing I gave it to someone
with such pretty hair.

725
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,934
Seven's letting us go
to the holodeck by ourselves.

726
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,355
She says we can run
any program we want.

727
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,148
Do you want to come?

728
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,985
Have you ever heard
of "The Temple of T'Panit"?

729
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,821
It's a Vulcan program.

730
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,907
Sounds boring.

731
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,492
Don't worry.

732
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,411
We'll make a few tweaks.
