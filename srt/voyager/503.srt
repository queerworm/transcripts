If we instruct the probe

119
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,812
The basic design

120
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,898
adequate.

121
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,234
High praise.

122
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,695
If we used isomagnetic EPS
conduits in the plasma manifold,

123
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,990
we could maximize
the power distribution.

124
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,700
That's the spirit, Harry.

125
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,953
My shield designs could be
successfully applied

126
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,788

127
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,956
Big of you to admit it, Tuvok.

128
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,665
CHAKOTAY:
And you think

129
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,294
it'll be able to withstand
the gas giant's atmosphere.

130
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,962
The probe did.

131
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm impressed.

132
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,673
But how quickly
can it be built?

133
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,927
We could replicate the alloys
and the new design components,

134
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,972
use spare parts
from storage.

135
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,432
If we worked around the clock,

136
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,142
we could have it up
and running inside a week.

137
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,727

182
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,615
B'Elanna...

183
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,909
what's going on?

184
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,454
Nothing.

185
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,705
Well, then
how come it's impossible

186
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,665
to have a conversation with you?

187
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,252
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,462
I don't want an apology.

189
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,796
I want an explanation.

190
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,675
Tom, I'm tired.

191
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,178
Asleep is more like it.

192
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,848
You hardly said three words
in that last meeting.

193
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,101
And then when Seven
changed your design,

194
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,685
you acted like...

195
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,646
like you didn't care.

196
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,356
I guess I didn't.

197
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,862
I don't get it.

198
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,158
How many times have we talked
about how great it would be

199
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,201
to do what we're doing now?

200
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,497
To<i> really</i> collaborate--
my piloting skills

201
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,373
and your engineering
expertise.

202
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,834
We finally get the chance
to create something

203
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,836
together from the ground up

204
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,839
and you're not the slightest
bit enthusiastic?

205
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,715
I'm doing my job, aren't I?

206
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:18,011
I delivered the thruster
specs on schedule.

207
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,514
B'Elanna, I'm not your boss.

208
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,183
I'm not questioning
your productivity

209
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,520
or keeping tabs
on how many hours you put in.

210
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,938
I just want to know
what's going on.

211
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,529
I have to go.

212
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:59,386
Computer, activate holodeck
program Torres 2-1-6.

213
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,638
COMPUTER:
<i>The program is active.</i>

214
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,682
Disengage safety protocols.

215
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,476
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Disengaging safety protocols</i>

216
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,811

00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,897
Override.

218
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,232
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

219
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,360

221
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,468
( growling )

222
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,262
( grunting )

223
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,471

227
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,731
( coughing )

228
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,613
Ooh!

229
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,865
( B'Elanna panting )

230
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,378
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

231
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,424
Ensign, put us
into a high orbit.

232
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,676
I want to stay well-above
that ionospheric turbulence.

233
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,136
Aye, ma'am.

234
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,513
There's the probe.

235
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,390
10,000 kilometers

236
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,310
beneath all that methane
but still intact.

237
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,478
We're not alone.

238
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,147
I'm reading massive
theta radiation.

239
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,149
It's being dumped
by a Malon freighter

240
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,318
approaching from the far side
of the planet.

241
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,778
They're hailing.

242
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,738
Well, they're more talkative
than the last ones.

243
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,031
Open a channel.
KIM: Aye, sir.

244
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,784
<i>Leave orbit of this planet now.</i>

245
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,702
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

246
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm Captain Janeway.

247
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,829
<i>I know exactly who you are.</i>

248
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,540
<i>You are the person responsible</i>

249
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,042
<i>for the destruction</i>
<i>of one of our freighters</i>

250
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,836
<i>and the deaths</i>
<i>of nine Malon citizens.</i>

251
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,798
I'm very sorry
that lives were lost,

252
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,342
but you're leaving out
an important detail.

253
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,052
Your people were trying
to steal a probe from us.

254
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,639
We warned them to stay away
from the gas giant,

255
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,265
but they didn't listen.

256
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,644
<i>I'm taking your probe</i>
<i>as compensation for our losses.</i>

257
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,646
That's going to be
a little difficult.

258
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,523
It's stuck
beneath the atmosphere

259
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,983
of the same gas giant
that crushed your other ship.

260
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,445
<i>My people are expert</i>
<i>at salvage operations.</i>

261
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,447
Well, Mr....

262
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,616
<i>Vrelk. Controller Vrelk.</i>

263
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,576
Vrelk.

264
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,454
We have a little expertise
of our own.

265
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,373
We're a very determined crew.

266
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,459
So my suggestion is
that<i> you</i> leave orbit

267
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,336
and in the future,
if you come across anything

268
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,255
that bears the insignia
of the USS<i> Voyager,</i>

269
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,341
head in the other direction.

270
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,051
<i>You are making a serious error.</i>

271
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,845
End transmission.

272
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,058
Why would people in the business
of toxic waste disposal

273
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,352
be so anxious
to get hold of a probe?

274
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,687
It's not just any probe.

275
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,438
It's multispatial technology.

276
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,816
Maybe they think it'll
help them find new places

277
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,150
to dump their garbage.

278
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,500
( gasping softly )

279
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,853
( clattering )

280
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,774
B'Elanna.

281
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,442
What a nice surprise.

282
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,903
I was just getting
ready to close.

283
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,279
Business has been slow

284
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,198
with so many people
busy on the new shuttle.

285
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,160
Oh.

286
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,371
I-I was just hoping
we could catch up.

287
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,665
You want to catch up?

288
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,916
W-with me?

289
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,960
If you have the time.

290
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,336
Are you kidding?

291
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,255
Yeah, we-- can I
get you something?

292
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,343
Name your poison.

293
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,261
Oh.

294
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,764
Um...

295
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,432
Come on, B'Elanna,
I handed that one to you

296
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,684
on a silver platter.

297
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,519
Huh?

298
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,895
Name your poison?

299
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,689
I was expecting one of those

300
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,775
scathing but affectionate
insults you always make

301
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,026
about my cooking.

302
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,319
Sorry.

303
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,905
You'll feel wittier
on a full stomach.

304
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,239
So, uh, what'll it be?

305
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,951
You know, actually...

306
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,496
I was hoping
for banana pancakes.

307
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,040
Huh. I-I-I don't think
I ever heard

308
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,959
of<i> banana</i> pancakes before.

309
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
My grandmother used to make them
for me when I was a kid.

310
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,007
It's always put a smile
on my face.

311
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,676
Well, then...

312
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,636
one smile coming right up.

313
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,562
Computer,
one stack of banana pancakes.

314
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,235
( sniffing )

315
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,573
Smells delicious.

316
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,491
Thanks.

317
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,502
So how have you been?

318
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,463
Oh, just great.

319
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,132
My security training
is going really well.

320
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,343
Tuvok told me the other day
that I'm, uh...

321
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,678
( clearing throat )

322
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,889
( imitating Tuvok ):
Not completely inept.

323
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,852
( normal voice ):
Aren't you going to try them?

324
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,478
Oh, sure.

325
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,908
Well?

326
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,580
Delicious.

327
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,167
I have to get back to work.

328
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,755
(<i> slow theme playing</i> )

329
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:55,551
( door opens, closes )

330
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,265
What are they still doing here?

331
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,642
Apparently,
they're not willing

332
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,018
to give up on the probe
so easily.

333
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,895
JANEWAY:
The question is:
How do they expect

334
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,396
to get their hands on it?

335
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,856
It's reasonable to assume

336
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,984
they're waiting for us
to retrieve the probe,

337
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,737
at which time, they'll
attempt to steal it again.

338
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,031
Maybe, but they have to know
we're prepared for that.

339
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,825
If they were planning
to fight, you'd think

340
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,035
they'd call in reinforcements,
try to outgun us.

341
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,788
Sensors don't show any other
Malon ships in the area.

342
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,206
<i>Seven of Nine to the Captain.</i>

343
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,500
Janeway here.

344
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,127
Report to the Astrometrics Lab.

345
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,421
I have important information
regarding the Malon vessel.

346
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,632
Tuvok?

347
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,429
What have you got?

348
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,682
I've been using
coherent neutrino beams

349
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,685
to document activity aboard
the Malon freighter.

350
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,062
In other words,
you've been spying on them.

351
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,481
I've made
a troubling discovery.

352
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,358
This is
a polythermal image

353
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,902
of an interior section
of the alien ship.

354
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,030
The shaded figures you see
are Malon crew members.

355
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,824
That appears to be
a small ship.

356
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,117
Correct. The Malon

357
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,161
are constructing
a spacecraft

358
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,163
composed of
tetraburnium alloys.

359
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,915
Theoretically, such a ship
would be capable

That's not
all, Captain.

364
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,591
According to
my projections,

365
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,259
they will finish

Well, then...

370
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,354
I'd say we've got

00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,648

I keep telling you

381
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,967
we've got to reinforce
the hull with kellinite.

382
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,510
That's all there is to it.

383
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,263
Proposing the same flawed
strategy over and over again

384
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,057
will not make it
more effective, Ensign.

385

Well, we've got

Sorry, sir.

PARIS:
Look, we could spend

392

weeks trying to solve this,
but we've got a ticking clock.

393

394
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,373
I say we launch now
and hope for the best.

395
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,628
Mr. Paris, that is perhaps
the most illogical statement

396
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,963
you've ever made.

397
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,967
Unless we find a way

398
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,885
to reconfigure
the structural integrity field,

399
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,221
the hull will incur
microfractures during descent.

400
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,431
PARIS:
<i>Microfractures,</i> Tuvok.

401
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,600
Doesn't necessarily mean
we'll have a hull breach.

512
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,134
But you didn't seek
treatment for any of these.

513

With the safety protocols on,
there's no way to be sure

Would you like to look
at my personal logs as well?

537
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,330
B'Elanna, I'm
worried about you.

538
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,790
If there's something
wrong, I want to help.

539
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,584
Nothing's wrong.

540
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,504
Okay?

541
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:54,089
No. It's not okay.

542
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,341
And until you decide

543
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,925
to be more forthcoming,
you'll remain

544
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,428
under the doctor's supervision,

545
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,180
which means
you're off the shuttle project.

546
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,889
I'm sorry.

547
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,559
I'm not.

548
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,858

something wrong.

let's talk about B'Elanna.

557
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,766
Tom, you had no idea
about these injuries

558
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,810
or how she got them?

559
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,355
She never complained
about being hurt.

560
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,606
But then again,

561
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,233
she's barely speaking
to me lately.

562
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,528
It's almost as if she's been

563
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,946
intentionally trying
to hurt herself.

564
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,198
You think all these injuries

00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,658
have been happening
on the holodeck?

566
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,992
Well, where else?

567
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,661
If they'd happened
while she was working

568
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,664
as she claims, somebody would've
filed an injury report.

569
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,710
Any idea what sort of programs
she's been running?

570
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,089
You're thinking
the same thing I am.

but if she won't tell us
what's going on

575

I don't think
we have much choice.

577
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,187
He's right.

Recovery from what?
