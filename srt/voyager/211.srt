1
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,758
Whatever she wants us for,
it'd better be good.

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,134
Bridge.

3
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,761
I had you right where
I wanted you.

4
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,053
What are you
talking about?

5
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,515
I was ahead-- 19-7.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,557
I was just lulling you

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,934
into a false sense
of security.

8
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,059
Sure you were.

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,478
I'll win the next
couple of points

10
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,105
then you'll start
to tense up.

11
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,900
I do not tense up.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,901
Easy, B'Elanna.

13
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,986
It's only hoverball.

14
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,403
You wanted
to see us, Captain?

15
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,780
Yes, Commander.

16
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,824
We've picked up an intriguing
transmission.

17
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,242
I have a source on the signal.
A ship?

18
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,954
Negative. It appears
to be a beacon of some kind.

19
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,831
A beacon?

20
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:39,999
We are being hailed

21
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,834
by someone using
a Federation signal.

22
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,280
How could someone
be transmitting

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,616
a Federation signal
from the Delta Quadrant?

24
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,535
PARIS:
Maybe Starfleet found a way
to get a probe here.

25
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,870
Maybe they're
looking for us.

26
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,163
I'd like to believe that too,

27
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,706
but let's not jump
to conclusions.

28
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,792
See if you can
authenticate the signal.

29
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,418
The carrier
wave frequency

30
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,130
does correspond to standard
Starfleet security codes.

31
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,255
As of when?

32
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,715
According to
the encryption key,

33
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,467
this particular code
was not scheduled

34
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,344
for implementation until
stardate 48423.

35
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,014
KIM:
That's a month after
we left deep space nine.

36
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,473
They must be looking for us.

37
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,559
Your optimism may
be premature, Mr. Kim.

38
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,020
Sorry, Captain.

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,646
But it's also infectious.

40
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,731
Mr. Paris,

41
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,274
lay in a course
for the beacon.

42
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,860
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,828
We're approaching the beacon's
coordinates, Captain.

44
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,204
It's drifted inside
an ionized hydrogen cloud.

45
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,415
The cloud's interfering
with our sensor readings.

46
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,710
Can you get any information
from the beacon?

47
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,670
I'm afraid not.
Should I beam it aboard?

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,922
CHAKOTAY:
I'd advise against
bringing it on board

49
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,423
before we've gotten
a look at it.

50
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,300
Even if it is emitting
a Federation signal.

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,053
Agreed-- and I don't want
to fly blindly

52
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,721
into a hydrogen cloud either.

53
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,098
Mr. Tuvok, tractor the probe
into sensor range.

54
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,225
Aye, Captain.
Targeting scanners locked.

55
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,935
Initiating tractor beam.

56
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,228
Report!

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,064
We are taking fire
from inside the cloud.

58
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,023
Source?

59
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,066
Unknown.

60
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,984
Battle stations.

61
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,580
A Kazon raider is closing
at 158, mark 9.

62
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,207
Hail them, Mr. Kim.

63
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,584
They're not responding, Captain.

64
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,627
Warp three, Mr. Paris.
Get us out of here.

65
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,963
Aye--

66
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,049
Warp engines are off-line,
Captain.

67
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,884
Initiate evasive pattern
omega-three.

68
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,594
Mr. Tuvok, return fire.

69
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,345
Aye, Captain.

70
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,724
KIM:
The Kazon ship is in pursuit.

71
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,768
An opening is forming
in the starboard shields

72
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,895
72 centimeters in diameter.

73
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,438
See if you can
close it, Commander.

74
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,567
Try rotating
the shield harmonics.

75
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,360
TUVOK:
They are continuously matching

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,655
their weapons frequency 
to our shield frequency.

77
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,990
How the hell
can they do that?

78
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,408
I don't know.

79
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,701
The diameter of the opening

80
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,494
has widened to
approximately two meters.

81
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,705
Set the shield harmonics
to rotate continuously.

82
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,832
Aye, Commander.

83
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,293
The opening is now four meters.

84
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
It's as if they know
our access codes.

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,422
Captain, I am picking up
a smaller vessel

86
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,216
emerging from
the hydrogen cloud.

87
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,718
It is heading directly toward
the opening in our shields.

88
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,470
All hands,
brace for impact.

89
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:27,077
<i>Warning, hull breach</i>
<i>on deck four, cargo bay two.</i>

90
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,914
Structural integrity
is at 50% and dropping.

91
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,457
The hull is starting to buckle.

92
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,584
We're losing life support
on deck four.

93
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,336
I'm trying to initiate
an emergency containment field.

94
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,464
However, the collision
has caused

95
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,008
a power failure on deck four.

96
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,302
Rerouting power to compensate.

97
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,096
Containment field activated.

98
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:50,184
<i>Warning, intruder alert</i>
<i>in cargo bay two.</i>

99
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,559
Mr. Tuvok!

100
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,853
Tuvok to security.

101
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,395
Meet me outside cargo bay two.

102
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,439
MALE:
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

103
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,280
TUVOK:
Drop your weapons!

104
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,416
It's no use.

105
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,252
We're not going anywhere
with that shuttle

106
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,586
sticking out
of our side.

107
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,340
It's totally destabilizing
our warp field.

108
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,092
Mr. Kim, did you reroute power
to transporter room two?

109
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,552
No, sir.

110
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,678
Bridge to Tuvok.

111
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,138
Tuvok here.

112
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,598
<i>There may be intruders</i>
<i>in transporter room two.</i>

113
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,101
I'm on my way.

114
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,245
Tuvok to Bridge.
JANEWAY:<i> Go ahead.</i>

115
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,996
The Kazon have beamed away,
Captain.

116
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,665
And they've taken one of our
transporter modules with them.

117
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,666
Can you lock on

118
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,834
to the module and beam it back?

119
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,169
<i>Not at the moment.</i>

120
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,879
<i>As soon as the Kazon</i>
<i>dematerialized,</i>

121
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,547
we lost all transporter power.

122
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,799
Mr. Chakotay, lock a tractor
beam on to their ship.

123
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,509
They're not leaving
with that module.

124
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,136
Aye, Captain.

125
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,764
KIM:
The Kazon are powering
their warp engines, Captain.

126
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,765
Make it fast, Commander.

127
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,725
Engaging tractor beam.

128
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,769
I've got them, Captain.

129
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,604
The Kazon ship
is hailing us.

130
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,439
Suddenly they
want to talk.

131
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,690
On screen.

132
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,027
<i>Captain Janeway.</i>

133
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,988
<i>First Maje Culluh</i>
<i>of the Kazon-Nistrim.</i>

134
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,490
I remember you, Culluh.

135
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,618
That transporter module
you just stole

136
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,745
is specifically designed
for our ship.

137
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,372
You'll never be able
to integrate it

138
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,790
into your systems.

139
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,542
<i>I've had some help</i>
<i>updating our technology</i>

140
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,002
<i>since we last met.</i>

141
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,469
Seska!

142
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,845
<i>That's right, Captain.</i>

143
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,680
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>I'm in the process</i>

144
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,143
<i>of restoring</i>
<i>my Cardassian physiology.</i>

145
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,646
<i>Hello, Chakotay.</i>

146
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,023
I should have known
you were involved.

147
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,025
<i>Yes, you should have.</i>

148
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,862
<i>Just like I knew you'd try</i>
<i>to stop us with a tractor beam.</i>

149
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,992
<i>You've always been</i>
<i>so predictable.</i>

150
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,662
Captain, their deflector shields
are creating a feedback loop.

151
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,789
It's neutralizing
the tractor emitter.

152
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,874
Attempting to compensate.

153
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,460
SESKA:
<i>Good-bye, Chakotay.</i>

154
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,962
<i>Lovely to see you again.</i>

155
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,424
PARIS:
It's too late.

156
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,758
They've gone to warp.

157
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,603
They modified the bow
to puncture our hull.

158
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:44,774
I've never seen the Kazon
do anything like this before.

159
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,776
Until now, the Kazon
have never had an advisor

160
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,903
with Cardassian, Maquis
and Starfleet

161
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,197
tactical experience.

162
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,781
The question is,
how do we dislodge it

163
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,492
without losing
structural integrity?

164
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,369
With power down,
our containment field's

165
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,661
already extremely unstable.

166
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,497
We'll have to reroute
additional power

167
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,873
to the containment field

168
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,833
and tow their shuttle out
with one of our own.

169
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,335
Then we can repair the breach.

170
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,795
The shields and the warp drive
will have to wait.

171
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,089
Warp drive isn't going to do us
much good with this knife

172
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,924
stuck in our belly.
Get it out fast.

173
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,134
We don't want
the Kazon to put

174
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,760
too much distance
between us.

175
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,472
Forgive me, Captain,
but are you sure

176
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,639
going after the Nistrim

177
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,433
is the wisest
course of action?

178
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,394
After what they've
already done to us?

179
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,687
Let me make something
very clear.

180
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,147
The Nistrim
are in possession

181
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,690
of Federation technology.

182
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,901
That is
an unacceptable situation.

183
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,195
Even though
all they've stolen

184
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,155
is a small
computer component?

185
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,948
That "small component"
has the potential

186
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,160
to cause vast problems
in this quadrant.

187
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,953
You're our resident expert
on the Kazon.

188
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,621
What do you think
the other sects will do

189
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,956
when they realize
the Nistrim

190
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,958
have transporter
capabilities?

191
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,293
They'll try to get it

192
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,254
for themselves any way
they can. You're right.

193
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,923
It could alter the balance
of power among the sects.

194
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,008
Exactly,
and it is our duty

195
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,094
to do everything we can,
no matter how dangerous

196
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,345
to stop that from happening.

197
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,930
You can count on me,
Captain.

198
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,349
CHAKOTAY:
From the look
of these sensor readings,

199
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,476
Seska wants us
to come after her.

200
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,103
Commander?

201
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,646
I think Seska's leading
us into another trap.

202
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,190
She masterminded
a precision raid

203
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,193
that made us look like
first-year academy students,

204
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,029
but she left a warp trail
for us to follow.

205
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,031
After such a flawless
performance,

206
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,158
why would she suddenly make
that kind of mistake?

207
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,287
You think she wants more
than the transporter?

208
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,372
Are you suggesting
we don't follow her?

209
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,873
No, I agree with
everything you said

210
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,000
about preventing the spread
of our technology,

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,836
but conventional tactics aren't
going to work with Seska.

212
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,298
We'll need to come at her with
a few surprises of our own.

213
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,341
I'm open to suggestions.

214
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,093
Perhaps Commander Chakotay

215
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,928
could use his intimate
knowledge of Seska

216
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,055
to manipulate her
in much the same way

217
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,681
she manipulated us.

218
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,481
CULLAH:
It can move people
great distances

219
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,233
in the blink of an eye, Haron,

220
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,112
but this "transporter"
is only the beginning.

221
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,864
Go on.
I'm listening.

222
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,951
There is a ship filled
with new technology.

223
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,037
Devices that can
make food, water,

224
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,374
even weapons,
appear out of thin air.

225
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,752
A computer system which uses
neural tissue that can react

226
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,464
twice as fast as ours.

227
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,633
Very interesting, Culluh,
but what does all this

228
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,635
have to do with me?

229
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:22,223
That ship is on
its way here.

230
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,394
Help us, and we
can divide the spoils.

231
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,693
The module Seska stole

232
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,988
contains a quantum
resonance oscillator.

233
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,906
So, we modify
this coil scanner

234
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,825
to detect the oscillator.

235
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,536
Then we get close
enough to beam it back.

236
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm betting Seska's
figured out a way

237
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,873
to shield the module
from our transporters.

238
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,875
We might have to
destroy it instead.

239
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,793
How do we do that?

240
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,879
We borrow a trick
from Seska's book.

241
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,881
Remember how we disabled
the computer core

242
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,716
on the Cardassian frigate
orbiting Bajor?

243
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,011
Seska modified
an anti-proton beam

244
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,596
to penetrate
its shields and hull.

245
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,889
Exactly.

246
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,391
But if I remember
correctly,

247
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,684
the beam
was only effective

248
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,810
from an extremely
close range.

249
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,522
How do we get near enough
to the Nistrim ship?

250
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,107
One thing at a time.

251
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,569
You're taking this all
very personally, aren't you?

252
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,529
Why shouldn't I?

253
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,114
You are not responsible
for what happened.

254
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,784
Oh, no? I let her
join the Maquis.

255
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,329
I took her
into my confidence.

256
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,039
I even got...

257
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,667
intimately involved
with her.

258
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,712
So you have lousy
taste in women.

259
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,131
Look, Chakotay,
she fooled us all.

260
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,634
She was my best friend--

261
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,303
or at least that's
what I thought.

262
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,098
Well, I, for one, am through
being manipulated by her.

263
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,225
Are you sure?

264
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,728
Because she's
affecting you.

265
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,690
That's just where
she wants you.

266
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,233
Don't tense up.

267
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,153
So now I'm getting advice

268
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,115
about controlling
my emotions from you.

269
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,078
Our sects have been

270
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,248
blood enemies for generations.

271
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:14,294
And yet, now you ask for my help
to defeat this<i> Voyager.</i>

272
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,129
Why not simply
do it yourselves?

273
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,506
I'll tell you why.

274
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,883
Because the Nistrim are weak

275
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,471
and the Relora are strong.

276
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,433
Your grandfather's time
has passed, Culluh.

277
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,185
You presided over the demise
of your own sect,

278
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,479
whittled away your strength--

279
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,521
Enough!

280
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:42,029
You may have ships
and soldiers

281
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,823
but I have the technology.

282
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,869
And I congratulate you

283
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,872
on the daring and cunning
of your raid.

284
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,668
Now, why don't
you give me

285
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,753
this transporter
technology,

286
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,338
assuming it's authentic,

287
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,966
and let the Relora do
what we do best.

288
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,760
When we have defeated
the<i> Voyager,</i>

289
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,054
we will not forget
the Nistrim's assistance.

290
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,309
You think I'm a fool.

291
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:16,564
I won't hand this
technology over to you.

292
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,275
Then perhaps we
will have to take it.

293
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,237
Why don't we let
the maje

294
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,989
go back to his ship

295
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,825
while we consider
his offer?

296
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,661
Listen to your woman,
Culluh.

297
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,120
(<i> growls</i> )

298
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,965
I'm picking up a gap

299
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,718
in the Nistrim's warp trail,
Captain.

300
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,678
All stop.
Let's take a look.

301
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,722
KIM:
Captain, I've got
some floating debris

302
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,473
at bearing 319.4.

303
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,558
On screen.

304
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,019
What is it?

305
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,270
KIM:
Not sure yet.

306
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,980
Magnify.

307
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,536
DOCTOR:
I'm detecting a residual
transporter signature.

308
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,247
There is no doubt that this man
and his unfortunate companion

309
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,623
were beamed into space.

310
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,083
And according
to these readings,

311
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,461
they were alive
at the time, Captain.

312
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,171
It looks like Seska's
already adapted

313
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,091
the transporter module
into the Kazon systems

314
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,968
and started
experimenting with it.

315
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,554
Her early trials
appear to have been

316
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,055
less than successful.

317
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,973
I'm not so sure these men

318
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,934
died by accident, Captain.

319
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,937
You see this green band
he's wearing?

320
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,524
It means he was the first maje
of the Kazon-Relora.

321
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,609
Relora?

322
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,780
Sworn enemies
of the Nistrim.

323
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,490
It's conceivable
that Seska and Culluh

324
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,494
used the transporter
to execute these men.

325
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,505
JANEWAY:
<i>I have convened a meeting</i>
<i>of the senior staff</i>

326
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,634
<i>to determine how we can get</i>

327
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,052
<i>to deploy the anti-proton beam.</i>

328
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,139
Where's Chakotay?

329
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,390
He was
in engineering

330
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,016
helping me modify
the coil scanner.

331
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,268
He said
he'd be right up.

332
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,311
Janeway to Chakotay.

333
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,648
Computer, locate
Commander Chakotay.

334
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,900
<i>Commander Chakotay</i>
<i>is not aboard the ship.</i>

335
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,621
Computer, when will we intercept
the Kazon vessel?

336
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,123
<i>Approximately 30 minutes.</i>

337
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,545
What I want to know,
Mr. Tuvok,

338
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,506
is how he was able to get
a shuttle off this ship

339
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,174
without either of us
knowing about it.

340
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,718
Apparently, he was able to
override the lock-out command.

341
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,679
I guess Seska's
not the only one

342
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,931
who knows how to compromise
our security systems.

343
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,517
I assure you, Captain,
it will not happen again.

344
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,768
See that it doesn't.

345
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,060
Did Chakotay leave
any clue

346
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,312
about what he's up to?

347
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,897
I have accessed
his personal logs,

348
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,024
but there is no reference
to his leaving<i> Voyager.</i>

349
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,151
I guess he was in too big
a hurry to leave a note.

350
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,945
TORRES:
The coil scanner was
right here.

351
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,989
He must have taken it
with him.

352
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,324
Then I guess it's pretty clear
he's going after Seska.

353
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,035
Looks like that.
You were working with him.

354
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,578
Did he say
anything to you?

355
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,330
Just that he felt
responsible for Seska,

356
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,332
and was determined
to stop her,

357
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,710
but I never thought he
would try to do this alone.

358
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,753
How big a head start
does he have?

359
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,129
Approximately three hours.

360
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,923
Janeway to Conn.
<i>Paris here, Captain.</i>

361
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,299
Lay in a pursuit course

362
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,385
for Chakotay's shuttlecraft,
maximum impulse.

363
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,761
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

364
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,513
And Mr. Tuvok, I want
a complete review

365
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,264
of all security
protocols on this ship

366
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,976
by 2200 hours.

367
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,227
Aye, Captain.

368
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,858
You said the Relora
would join us.

369
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,109
I should never
have listened to you.

370
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,905
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

371
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,408
Kazon sects do not
help one another.

372
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,911
Don't be so sure
about that.

373
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,162
What did you do to the two men
who refused your offer?

374
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,539
I killed them.

375
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,709
Yes, and by doing that,
you sent a message:

376
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,336
"the Kazon-Nistrim
are powerful again.

377
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,839
"First Maje Jal Cullah
has technology

378
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,925
"that no other sect
possesses.

379
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,803
Join with him,
or suffer the consequences."

380
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,973
Maybe the mistake was
to approach the Relora.

381
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,975
They're already strong.

382
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,436
But the transporter
may be enough

383
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,439
to convince
the Hobii to join me

384
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,565
and perhaps the Mostral.

385
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,025
Yes.

386
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,652
And with a few more ships,
you can defeat<i> Voyager.</i>

387
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,696
And when you have
the rest of their technology,

388
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,406
the other sects
will have no choice

389
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,992
but to fall into line.

390
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,702
That's why I sent
a subspace message

391
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,037
to the Mostral,

392
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,830
the Hobii,
and the Oglamar.

393
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,457
You did what?

394
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,043
I told them
about the transporter.

395
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,920
Asked them to help us
take<i> Voyager.</i>

396
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,423
You have gone too far.

397
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,425
I sent the messages
in your name.

398
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,469
I am the leader
of this sect.

399
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,430
You are only a woman.

400
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,932
I'm sorry, Cullah.

401
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,226
You will address me
as maje!

402
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,396
Yes... maje.

403
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,274
Please...

404
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,234
Forgive me.

405
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,446
So...

406
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:22,078
how did the other sects
respond to my request?

407
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,080
They're on their way
to join us.

408
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,793
I could do
what no one has done

409
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,587
since Jal Sankur
united the sects

410
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,380
to overthrow the Trabe.

411
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,507
Yes, Maje.

412
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,050
I could have hundreds of ships

413
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,719
and thousands of soldiers
under my command.

414
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,429
Yes, maje.

415
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,809
I could be the most
powerful Kazon in the quadrant.

416
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,061
Yes, maje.

417
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,281
(<i> door chimes</i> )

418
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,908
Come in.

419
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,284
Do you have a minute,
Captain?

420
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,995
It's about Chakotay.

421
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,789
That's not exactly my favorite
subject right now, Lieutenant.

422
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,749
Well, I thought that maybe
I could explain...

423
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,292
Explain what?
Why my first officer

424
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,711
publicly defied my authority

425
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,796
by commandeering a shuttle
without permission?

426
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,298
I know it was never
his intention to defy you.

427
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,675
He respects your authority.

428
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,926
But?

429
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,344
But he's a very proud man,

430
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,929
and he's been...

431
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,849
embarrassed by Seska.

432
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,767
What Seska did,
she did to all of us.

433
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,769
Frankly, I find it

434
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,771
more than a little
self-indulgent of Chakotay

435
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,899
to assume this is all
about him.

436
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:41,199
He never said it
to me directly, but...

437
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,950
I think he was
in love with her

438
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,244
and then he found out
that everything he knew

439
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,955
about her was a lie.

440
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,167
You said that he publicly
defied your authority.

441
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,002
Can you imagine what
it must have been like

442
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,588
for someone as private
as Chakotay

443
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,008
to be publicly humiliated
by someone he loved?

444
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,509
And then, as if
that weren't enough,

445
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,802
she came back
to taunt him

446
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,055
in front of the entire
bridge crew.

447
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,348
I'm sure it was
very painful for him

448
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,850
but what you're saying is

449
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,435
he's got a personal score
to settle.

450
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,438
That's only part of it.

451
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,565
I know Chakotay.

452
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,317
This is his way
of taking responsibility.

453
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,029
In his mind, he's trying
to protect the rest of us

454
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,656
from a dangerous situation
which he created.

455
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,158
Maybe, but that doesn't give him

456
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,868
the privilege
of ignoring this ship's

457
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,994
chain of command.

458
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,122
I know that.
It's just that...

459
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,459
Chakotay would never tell you
any of this himself.

460
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,255
And assuming we get him back in
one piece, you want to make sure

461
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,090
I take his personal feelings
into account

462
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,092
before I decide
how to discipline him.

463
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:44,178
I know that you are
well within your rights

464
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,265
to throw him
into the brig, but...

465
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,017
well...

466
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,937
Chakotay is lucky to have
such a good friend.

467
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,606
I'll tell you what.

468
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,526
Why don't we deal
with getting him back

469
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,862
in one piece first.

470
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,406
We can worry about
the discipline later.

471
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,700
Thank you.

472
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,624
Computer, when will we enter

473
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,793
the Kazon vessel's
scanner range?

474
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,211
<i>Approximately six minutes.</i>

475
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,546
Reduce power
to maneuvering thrusters

476
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,715
and life support
to five percent.

477
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,135
Cut all power to other systems.

478
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,311
SESKA:
The Mostral should be here

479
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,854
in less than 20 hours.

480
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,480
The Hobii in 15.

481
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,149
Come look at this.

482
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,697
Intermittent
EM readings?

483
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,740
I don't think so.

484
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,926
Computer,
initiate continuous scans

485
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,427
for the transporter oscillator.

486
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,680
<i>Initiating scans.</i>

487
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,640
Those aren't normal
fluctuations.

488
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,434
They're energy spikes
from maneuvering thrusters.

489
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,395
Probably a shuttle
running shadow maneuvers.

490
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,772
He knows our scanners

491
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,275
can't pinpoint
energy readings that low.

492
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,318
Who?

493
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,569
Maybe we can resonate

494
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,571
a coherent polaron pulse
off his hull.

495
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,489
Get a lock on him
that way.

496
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,407
Initiate a continuous stream
of pulses

497
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,910
from the lateral deflectors.

498
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,119
Maje?

499
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,667
Come on, Seska.

500
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,502
Where did you hide that module?

501
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,799
SESKA:
There you are.

502
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,425
Open a channel.

503
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,677
To whom?

504
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,805
Just transmit
on wide-band subspace.

505
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,307
He'll hear me.

506
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,061
Come on, find it!

507
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,354
SESKA:
<i>Hello, Chakotay.</i>

508
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,189
<i>Very clever maneuvering</i>

509
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:04,777
<i>but I'm not about to let you</i>
<i>ruin all my hard work.</i>

510
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,570
Deploy a spread
of photonic charges

511
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,573
centered on coordinates
124 by 217--

512
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,491
20% nominal yield.

513
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,119
That won't be enough.

514
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,205
We want that shuttle
intact.

515
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,253
Got you.

516
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,005
Computer, power
the anti-proton generator.

517
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,506
<i>Generator ready.</i>

518
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,717
Target a concentrated beam
to these coordinates.

519
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,886
<i>Beam targeted.</i>

520
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,138
Initiate!

521
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,598
<i>The generator is off-line.</i>

522
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,850
Great.

523
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,561
Computer, launch the automated
message beacon.

524
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,063
<i>Beacon launched.</i>

525
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,733
Now take the inertial dampers
off-line.

526
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,235
He's lost control
of the shuttle.

527
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,653
We have him.

528
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,281
Lock the towing emitter
onto his vessel

529
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,908
and bring him into
the main hangar.

530
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,588
Culluh calling Seska.

531
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,506
<i>This is Seska.</i>

532
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,343
He's not here.

533
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,178
He must have
transported aboard.

534
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,179
Find him!

535
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,805
CHAKOTAY:
I'm right here.

536
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,059
Activate the message beacon.

537
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,276
Lovely to see you again.

538
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,170
TUVOK:
Captain, I'm detecting
a Federation beacon

539
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,755
at bearing 059, mark 72.

540
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,299
This one's definitely ours--

541
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,258
Starfleet issue.

542
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,801
All stop.

543
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:57,473
The beacon is transmitting
an automated message.

544
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,017
It is from Commander Chakotay.

545
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,101
On screen.

546
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,188
<i>...to Voyager.</i>

547
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,898
<i>If this signal</i>
<i>has been activated,</i>

548
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,525
<i>it means that I have destroyed</i>

549
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,110
<i>the Nistrim's</i>
<i>transporter capabilities.</i>

550
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,572
<i>Captain, I apologize for acting</i>
<i>without authorization,</i>

551
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,492
<i>but I ask you</i>
<i>not to put the ship or crew</i>

552
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,661
<i>in further jeopardy</i>
<i>by attempting to rescue me.</i>

553
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,789
<i>It's unlikely</i>
<i>that I'm still alive.</i>

554
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,666
<i>Chakotay to</i> Voyager.

555
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,626
<i>If this signal</i>
<i>has been activated...</i>

556
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,560
You can go.

557
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,027
I see the Nistrim
take orders from you now.

558
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,322
Let's just say I'm in a position
of some influence,

559
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,615
which is fortunate for you.

560
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,453
Culluh wanted to
execute you immediately,

561
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,956
but I convinced him that
you'd be a valuable prisoner

562
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,209
and that I should be the one
to interrogate you.

563
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,626
Lucky me.

564
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,589
Would you like a drink?

565
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,841
The Kazon word for this
is "enemy's blood."

566
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,634
it's not exactly fine cognac,

567
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,763
but I've developed
a taste for it

568
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,432
try some.

569
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,312
No, thanks.

570
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:29,022
You know, I've got
to hand it to you.

571
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,775
I thought all these months
answering to Janeway

572
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,361
would have made you soft,

573
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,822
but all you needed was
a little slap in the face

574
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:40,326
to get that Maquis heart
of yours beating again.

575
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,328
Here's to old times.

576
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,456
I have no interest
in reminiscing with you.

577
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,249
I destroyed
the transporter module.

578
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,209
The game's over.

579
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,545
What do I need with a single
transporter module

580
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,131
when I've got your shuttle
and all its technology

581
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,924
sitting in our hanger?

582
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,844
I think you'll find
that technology useless.

583
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,181
I wiped the computer core
before I transported.

584
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,726
I should have anticipated that.

585
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,438
So if you're going
to have me killed, just do it.

586
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,444
You're still the noble one,
aren't you?

587
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,112
Ready to die for your shipmates.

588
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,658
You know, Chakotay,

589
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,743
I may not have
the transporter anymore,

590
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,121
but I've got
something better:

591
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,041
You.

592
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,127
Maybe that's all
I really wanted.

593
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,711
I've missed you.

594
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,088
You can't possibly believe

595
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,298
that you and I
could still--

596
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,133
Don't flatter yourself.

597
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,343
It was never that good.

598
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,927
You might have been
an interesting

599
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,304
diversion now and then,

600
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,181
but I've always been
less interested in you

601
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,642
than in the information
you could provide me with.

602
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,852
First, you gave me your
Maquis secrets

603
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:53,440
and now I want
<i>Voyager's</i> command codes.

604
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,318
If you think I'm going
to give you those codes,

605
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,905
you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

606
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,700
Maybe not, but
for old time's sake

607
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,035
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

608
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,287
There are half a dozen ships
from other Kazon sects

609
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,707
on their way
here right now.

610
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,459
They're joining us
to help take<i> Voyager.</i>

611
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,835
Why are you telling me this?

612
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,339
I'm not a monster.

613
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,175
I still care about Torres
and some of the others.

614
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,135
I don't want to see
anybody get hurt.

615
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,512
I never did.

616
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,723
I'm touched.

617
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:29,017
These Kazon aren't as
reasonable as you and I.

618
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,644
I'm going to have to
use all my influence

619
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,938
to make sure they
don't kill you all.

620
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,148
But you've got to give me
something to work with.

621
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,067
<i>Voyager's</i> not coming.

622
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,945
I left them explicit
instructions not to follow me.

623
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:40,946
So you can stop worrying

624
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,491
about people getting hurt.

625
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,077
They'll come.

626
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,870
They'd never leave
their first officer

627
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,665
in the hands of the Kazon.

628
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,167
You may not give me
the command codes,

629
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,797
but when Culluh gets through
with you, you'll wish you had.

630
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,512
The message appears
to be authentic, Captain.

631
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,888
We've got
to go get him.

632
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,807
Commander Chakotay has
expressly requested

633
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,100
that we not attempt
to do so.

634
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,851
We don't have
to honor that request.

635
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,978
Captain?

636
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,354
If a rescue
attempt forces us

637
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,439
to engage the Kazon,

638
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,732
there is always
a possibility

639
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,066
that more
of our technology

640
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,110
will fall
into their hands.

641
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,361
<i>Kim to the Captain.</i>

642
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,738
<i>I'm picking up several vessels</i>

643
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,575
<i>converging</i>
<i>on the Nistrim's location.</i>

644
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,041
My gut tells me

645
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,127
we should
go after Chakotay...

646
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,881
but my better judgment...

647
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:46,052
tells me we should honor
his request.

648
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:49,848
I would never want you to
ignore your judgment, Captain

649
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:54,645
but let me ask you this:
In your judgment

650
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,730
how would the loss
of our first officer

651
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,274
affect this crew?

652
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,444
What would it do to
the morale on this ship?

653
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,196
Maybe this is
an instance

654
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:08,908
when your gut is giving
you better advice.

655
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,245
Janeway to Conn.

656
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,122
<i>Paris here.</i>

657
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,462
Resume a course for
Chakotay's shuttle.

658
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,672
Aye, Captain.

659
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,806
CULLUH:
I'm losing patience,
Federation.

660
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,857
Just tell him what
he needs to know.

661
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:46,279
She's quite a
woman, isn't she?

662
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,114
Does she rub
your shoulders

663
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,991
and tell you you're
the most exciting man

664
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,993
she's ever known?

665
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,038
That's what she
used to do for me.

666
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,832
What's the matter?

667
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,876
Didn't she tell you
about us?

668
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:02,880
Stop playing games
and give me the command codes.

669
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,133
Flattery, devotion, sex...

670
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,720
I always thought she had
a lot to offer a man.

671
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,346
You talk too much,
Federation,

672
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,599
but you're not telling me
what I need to know.

673
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,225
You're wrong, Culluh.

674
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,604
I'm telling you exactly
what you need to know.

675
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,647
She's using you.

676
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,357
I'm the one
who's using her.

677
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,317
You've done an
even better job

678
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,069
on him than
you did on me.

679
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,614
You talk to me,
not to her.

680
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,282
Then what's
she doing here?

681
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,200
Watching you work?!

682
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,327
She used to like
to watch me work too.

683
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,872
I don't believe a word
you're saying,

684
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,583
so you can stop trying
to distract me now

685
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,376
and start answering
questions.

686
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,297
You know one thing
I especially liked?

687
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,006
The little mole on her stomach.

688
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,887
I've guess you've seen it.

689
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:58,351
I'm through wasting
my strength on you.

690
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,744
(<i> distorted</i> )
Now give me the command codes.

691
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,122
I'll give you something better.

692
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,749
What?

693
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,418
Firsthand information.

694
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:27,172
Go ahead.

695
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,757
When Seska's through with you...

696
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,135
(<i> laughing</i> )

697
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,346
...she's going to kill you.

698
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,852
He's delirious.

699
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,020
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

700
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,149
Give him some time.

701
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,694
I'll be back in one hour.

702
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:52,739
For his sake, he'd better
be more cooperative.

703
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:05,585
Very clever ploy, Chakotay,

704
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,337
but you know
I'm not a killer.

705
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,133
(<i> groaning</i> )

706
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,182
If I were, you'd
have been dead

707
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,351
a long time ago.

708
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,071
I have located
the Nistrim vessel

709
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,447
on long-range sensors.

710
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,491
Distance: .4 light years.

711
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,743
However, they are not alone.

712
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,160
There are now at least

713
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,788
six other Kazon ships
in the immediate vicinity.

714
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,874
I didn't think Culluh
had that many ships.

715
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,500
They must belong
to enemy sects.

716
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,293
That may be so,

717
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,963
but the ships have not
powered their weapons systems.

718
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,214
What do you make of it,
Neelix?

719
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,884
It's certainly
unusual for rival

720
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,761
Kazon sects
to congregate peacefully.

721
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,470
Is it possible the Nistrim
have formed

722
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,514
an alliance with
other sects?

723
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,018
I've never known the Kazon to do
anything like that before.

724
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,812
If the Nistrim have added
six ships to their force,

725
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,815
it would be tactically unwise
to engage them.

726
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,483
Then we'll just
have to find a way

727
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,903
of getting Chakotay out of there
without picking a fight.

728
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,905
We can transport him out.

729
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,449
We would have to slow down once
within transporter range,

730
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,534
giving the Kazon
ample time to open fire.

731
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,911
Not necessarily.

732
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,830
We could beam him out
at warp speed

733
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,164
without even slowing down.

734
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,333
The Kazon would never
be able to catch us.

735
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,544
KIM:
That's difficult enough
when both ships

736
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,587
are traveling at warp.

737
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,130
The Kazon ship's not moving.

738
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,299
I can compensate for that.
How?

739
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,842
By synchronizing
the transporter's

740
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,219
annular confinement beam
to the warp core frequency.

741
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,013
KIM:
Maybe, but at a relative speed

742
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,723
of two billion kilometers
per second,

743
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,642
it's pretty tough
to get a lock on somebody.

744
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,226
Ensign Kim is correct.

745
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,436
We would risk scrambling

746
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,229
his transporter signal
and killing him.

747
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,941
It would be a direct violation
of Starfleet safety protocols.

748
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,276
Do you have
a better idea?

749
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,444
Trust me, Captain.

750
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,361
I can do it.

751
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,572
How can you be
so sure?

752
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,742
Because
I've done it before.

753
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,494
When you are a Maquis,

754
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,245
you don't always have
the luxury

755
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,581
of following protocols.

756
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,251
CULLAH:
Ah!

757
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,130
Jal Surat of the Mostral.

758
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,508
May I present
Jal Loran of the Hobii

759
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,761
and Jal Valek of
the Oglamar?

760
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:23,264
We've met before...

761
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,558
in battle.

762
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,187
Please, Jal Surat, sit down.

763
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,444
Today is a day
Kazon children

764
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,656
will remember for generations.

765
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,199
Today is the day we put aside

766
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,617
our differences,

767
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,537
and join forces
to defeat<i> Voyager.</i>

768
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,457
Today is the day
that marks the end

769
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,670
of the supremacy
of the Relora and the Ogla,

770
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:59,634
because, after today, we will
have the Federation technology

771
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:04,139
and the other sects
will run when they see us.

772
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,976
That's a fine speech, Culluh,
but what makes you think

773
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:12,605
<i>Voyager</i> won't use
this technology to defeat us?

774
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,984
Because I have
<i>Voyager's</i> command codes.

775
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,527
I have heard what you did

776
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,864
to the Relora maje
and his companion.

777
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:24,076
Very impressive.

778
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:26,119
But before I make
an enemy of these Federations,

779
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,207
I want proof that you have
their command codes.

780
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,387
May I present
Commander Chakotay,

781
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,224
<i>Voyager's</i> first officer. 

782
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,404
60 seconds to transporter range,
Captain.

783
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,615
Bridge to Torres.
Have you located Chakotay?

784
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,993
I'm reading Kazon life signs,
but still no Chakotay.

785
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,579
Captain, I must reminder you
that we have no direct evidence

786
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,330
the commander is still alive,
or if he is,

787
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,832
that he's still
aboard that ship.

788
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,042
I'm not conceding that yet.

789
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,710
Can you give me
anything, B'Elanna?

790
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,798
I'm picking up some kind
of localized dampening field.

791
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,758
It's blocking
our targeting scanners.

792
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,510
Maybe Seska's found a way
to hide Chakotay from us.

793
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,180
You may be right.

794
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,724
I've got to re-initialize
the targeting scanners

795
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:35,188
to match the relative phase
of the dampening field.

796
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,481
I've found him, Captain.

797
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,066
<i>He's still alive.</i>

798
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,400
Can you get him
out of there?

799
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,444
<i>The dampening field</i>
<i>is disrupting</i>

800
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,487
our transporter signal.

801
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,030
I can't get a lock on him.

802
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,282
Red alert.

803
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:48,576
Mr. Paris,
take us out of warp.

804
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,288
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

805
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,497
It's<i> Voyager.</i>

806
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,665
Well, Culluh?

807
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,167
What are you waiting for?

808
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:59,171
Use the command codes
to disable them.

809
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,339
Bridge, this is
First Maje Culluh.

810
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,635
Lock weapons onto
the Federation ship and fire.

811
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,308
Mr. Paris, evasive
pattern delta-four.

812
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,767
Mr. Tuvok, return fire.

813
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,186
Firing phasers.

814
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,188
Bridge to Torres,
can you transport Chakotay?

815
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,231
I'm matching
the pattern buffer frequency

816
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,150
to the Kazon dampening field.

817
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,235
<i>Make it fast.</i>

818
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,903
I've got a lock.

819
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,530
Initiating transport.

820
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,629
Do you have him, B'Elanna?

821
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,006
I had him for a second

822
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,050
but they've re-modulated
the dampening field.

823
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,301
<i>Can you compensate?</i>

824
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,553
I'm trying,
but I need more time.

825
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,806
We'll try to hold them off,
but we don't have long.

826
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,892
Mr. Tuvok, phasers
to maximum.

827
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,894
Let's give them
a little distraction.

828
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,692
Why are you allowing them
to continue firing?

829
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,277
It's taking longer
than I thought

830
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,778
to interface
with their systems.

831
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,489
You must order your ships
to provide cover.

832
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,744
I hope you know
what you're doing.

833
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,583
The other Kazon vessels
have opened fire.

834
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,668
Mr. Paris, evasive
pattern omega-two.

835
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,711
Aye, Captain.

836
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,171
Bridge to Torres.

837
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,048
You're going to have
to hurry it up down there.

838
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,841
<i>We can't hold them off</i>
<i>much longer.</i>

839
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,053
I'm doing the best I can.

840
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:34,099
We're losing patience, Culluh.

841
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,353
Where are you going?

842
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,478
To the Bridge.

843
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,980
I might have better luck

844
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,233
interfacing with<i> Voyager's</i>
systems from there.

845
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,234
I'll go with you.

846
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:48,947
You'll stay right here.

847
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,949
Aft shields down
to 23%, Captain.

848
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,242
Bridge to Torres.

849
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,993
Can you transport
Chakotay out or not?

850
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,912
They've put the dampening field
on some kind

851
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,164
of randomly fluctuating
modulation.

852
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,959
It'll take me at least an hour
to match the phase variances.

853
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,336
Shield's at 16%.

854
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,503
Captain, we
must retreat.

855
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,005
Lieutenant,
just how localized

856
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,465
is that dampening field?

857
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,592
<i>A little more than two</i>
<i>meters in diameter.</i>

858
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,387
Just enough to isolate
Chakotay. Why?

859
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,931
I think I've got an idea.

860
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:18,143
I don't think you ever
had those command codes.

861
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,394
I think you're a liar.

862
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,854
What does it matter?

863
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,231
If we work together,

864
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,108
we don't need
the command codes to beat them.

865
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,693
You're right.
We can beat them,

866
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:31,156
but we're going to
do it without you.

867
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,783
We're taking your ship.

868
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,960
TUVOK:
Please stay
where you are.

869
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,586
You will find that
our transporters

870
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,799
have rendered
your weapons useless.

871
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:53,928
I will make you very sorry
for this, Culluh.

872
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,763
Here are the terms,
gentlemen.

873
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,017
The safe return of our first
officer and shuttlecraft

874
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,685
in exchange
for your freedom.

875
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,854
I presume you will find that

876
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,023
an acceptable arrangement.

877
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,701
JANEWAY:
<i>Now that Commander Chakotay</i>
<i>has made a full recovery,</i>

878
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,411
<i>I'm faced</i>
<i>with the difficult task</i>

879
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:22,332
<i>of responding to his failure</i>
<i>to follow procedure.</i>

880
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,833
Just tell me one thing.

881
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,751
What were you thinking?

882
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,923
About keeping our technology
out of Kazon hands.

883
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,384
I thought if I did it on my own,

884
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,719
I could keep the rest
of the crew out of danger.

885
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,930
That may be
a very noble sentiment,

886
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,308
but it wasn't
your decision to make.

887
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,442
Oh, Chakotay...

888
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:53,530
we've spent the last ten months
together on this ship.

889
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,240
I thought we had
an understanding.

890
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,117
Why did you choose
to ignore procedure?

891
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,331
Seska was my problem--

892
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,042
a problem I felt
it was my duty to solve.

893
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,585
So you had a...

894
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,754
personal score to settle.

895
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,258
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

896
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,342
Really?

897
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,510
Tell me this--

898
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,850
how do you expect me
to keep order

899
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,769
when the first officer
takes it upon himself

900
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,230
to run off like some cowboy
because he decides

901
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,191
it's a good idea?

902
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,360
What you did
was commendable.

903
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,613
The way you did it was not.

904
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,741
You set a terrible example,
and on a personal level

905
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,618
you've made my job
more difficult.

906
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:47,125
If that's so, I regret it.

907
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,419
I'm putting you on report,

908
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:53,047
in case that means
anything anymore.

909
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,342
It means something
to me, Captain.

910
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,469
It means
I've let you down

911
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:00,263
and for that,
I'm truly sorry.

912
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,931
TUVOK:
<i>Bridge to Ready Room.</i>

913
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,266
Go ahead, Mr. Tuvok.

914
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,892
<i>I think you</i>
<i>and Commander Chakotay</i>

915
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,436
<i>should come in here.</i>

916
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,062
On our way.

917
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,444
I have located an automated
message beacon, Captain.

918
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:15,694
Another one?

919
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,905
It is a message
to Commander Chakotay

920
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,325
from Seska.

921
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,493
Would you like Mr. Kim

922
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,369
to put it through
to your office?

923
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,581
No, I think I've spent
enough time alone with Seska.

924
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,582
Very well.

925
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,626
Put it on screen.

926
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,294
<i>Hello, Chakotay.</i>

927
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,588
<i>Congratulations</i>
<i>on your victory.</i>

928
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,673
<i>I look forward</i>
<i>to our next meeting.</i>

929
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,301
<i>Oh, and there's something</i>
<i>you should know.</i>

930
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,928
<i>While you were unconscious, I</i>
<i>took the liberty of extracting</i>

931
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,472
<i>a sample of your DNA.</i>

932
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,850
<i>I impregnated myself with it.</i>

933
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,729
<i>So, I guess more</i>
<i>congratulations are in order.</i>

934
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,566
<i>You're going to be a father.</i>
