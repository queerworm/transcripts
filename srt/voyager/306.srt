Janeway:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50203.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>We're three days away</i>
<i>from Enara Prime--</i>

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,177
<i>home of the passengers</i>
<i>we picked up from a colony</i>

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,846
<i>in the Fima system.</i>

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,849
<i>Our high warp capability</i>
<i>has greatly reduced the time</i>

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,518
<i>it normally takes them</i>
<i>to make the journey home.</i>

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,645
<i>In return,</i>
<i>the Enarans have shared</i>

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>their energy conservation</i>
<i>technology with us,</i>

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,734
<i>and perhaps more importantly,</i>
<i>their friendship.</i>

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,361
You've never
been there?

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,989
Well, the trip back to the
homeland usually takes so long.

12
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,866
I didn't want
to see it that badly.

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,409
I've spent my whole life
in the Fima colony

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,328
and I've always
considered it my home.

15
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,538
You'll change your mind

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,415
when you see the Daeleus
cliffs at dawn.

17
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,960
Yes, I've heard
they're beautiful.

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,798
You'll know what
"beautiful" truly means,

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:52,302
when you stand on the
cliffs on a rainy morning

20
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,972
and watch the raindrops...

21
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,684
turn to mist when they
hit the molten sea.

22
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,395
TORRES: That sounds wonderful.
(<i> console beeping</i> )

23
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,147
It looks like our new components
are still slightly out of sync

24
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,150
with your EPS system.
I can't isolate it.

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,986
We'll have to check
through all of them.

26
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,198
Maybe Harry could
give us a hand.

27
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,826
Well, I'm sure he would

28
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,078
if<i> you</i> asked him.

29
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,330
Harry, you
got a minute?

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,916
Sure.

31
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,585
Could you help us check
the modified power relays?

32
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,336
There is
a minor flow problem.

33
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,505
I'd be happy to help.

34
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,925
Good. Then we'll get started
first thing in the morning.

35
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,052
Well, if we're done
for the night,

36
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,721
maybe we could all go
get something to eat.

37
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,765
Thank you, but I'll be
headed back to bed.

38
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,894
I'm sure you young people
will manage without me.

39
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,186
Good night.

40
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,980
Good night.

41
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:51,403
So, I guess it'll just
be the three of us.

42
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:55,950
Actually, getting some rest
sounded like a pretty good idea.

43
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,660
Why don't you...
go on without me?

44
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,875
No, really, I insist.

45
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,627
(<i> sighs</i> )

46
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,715
(<i> tapping</i> )

47
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,939
What took you so long?

48
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,274
(<i> laughing</i> )

49
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,912
Aah!

50
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,706
(<i> both laughing</i> )

51
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,959
Korenna...
Shh!

52
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,135
(<i> both panting</i> )

53
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,350
CHAKOTAY:
<i>B'Elanna.</i>

54
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,772
B'Elanna, wake up.

55
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,694
What?

56
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,988
Your duty shift
started 20 minutes ago.

57
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,532
I tried to reach you on the com,
but you didn't answer.

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,661
I guess...

59
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,039
I guess I must have
slept right through it.

60
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,623
Sorry.

61
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,210
Are you feeling all right?

62
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,797
Yes, of course.
I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,867
This is the second morning
you've been late.

64
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,869
I'll make up the time.
It won't happen again.

65
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,621
I'm not concerned
about the duty schedule,

66
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,081
B'Elanna.
If there's something wrong...

67
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,499
I'm fine.

68
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,417
You mean, fine like when
you insisted on finishing

69
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,628
the hoverball championship
with a broken ankle?

70
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,088
I mean there's
nothing wrong.

71
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,756
I was only late
because...

72
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,300
I've been having
these dreams.

73
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,342
They're very intense.
That's all.

74
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,390
(<i> sighs</i> )

75
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,185
Intensely bad?

76
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,644
No.

77
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,313
Just the opposite.

78
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,106
So they're enjoyable?

79
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,440
Stimulating?

80
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,319
They are the most
sensual dreams

81
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,445
I've ever had
in my life...

82
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,324
and they feel
absolutely real.

83
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,828
I don't suppose
you've been dreaming

84
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,496
about anyone in particular?

85
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,956
Nobody you know.

86
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,791
Actually...

87
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,710
he's nobody
I know either.

88
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,086
He's Enaran.

89
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,629
One of our passengers?

90
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,922
No. No.

91
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,967
In the dreams, I know him.

92
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,054
More than that,
I'm in love with him.

93
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,348
But it's not really me
in the dream.

94
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,099
It's somebody else entirely.

95
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,810
In a way, it's...

96
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,562
liberating.

97
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,814
I'm sure.

98
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,733
So I assume I won't
have to write up

99
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,985
a report on your
chronic oversleeping?

100
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,238
If you say a word
about this to anyone...

101
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,698
I know. You'll rip
my heart out

102
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,075
and eat it raw.

103
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,660
Your secret's
safe with me.

104
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,256
So, what exactly
is this big surprise?

105
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,590
All I know is that Neelix

106
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,342
has been working
on it all afternoon.

107
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,052
He wouldn't even let me
in there to get a snack.

108
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:11,848
(<i> delicate, ethereal</i>
<i>music playing</i> )

109
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,563
NEELIX:
Welcome to Enara!

110
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,191
It's... very...

111
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,483
colorful.

112
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,861
Specifically, the colors
of the Enaran flag.

113
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,988
The decor, the
music, the menu--

114
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,157
All authentically
Enaran.

115
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,451
What happened to
the tables and chairs?

116
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,578
Enarans don't use them.

117
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,829
After a big meal,

118
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,124
you can just lie back
and take a nap.

119
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,499
Very practical.

120
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,377
It's a little cold
in here, isn't it?

121
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,629
Perhaps a bit chillier
than we're used to,

122
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,672
but just about
perfect for...

123
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,967
Enarans. I got it.

124
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,802
You<i> must</i> try
some of these

125
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,595
delightful algae puffs.

126
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,139
They're fresh
from the oven.

127
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,598
ENARAN FEMALE:
Harry?

128
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,352
Maybe later.

129
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,072
(<i> music continues</i> )

130
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,053
(<i> music ends</i> )

131
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,682
Oh, that was wonderful.

132
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,558
What a lovely
piece of music.

133
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,061
You should thank
Jora Mirell.

134
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,480
She composed it.

135
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,984
I still think you're
rushing the harmonics

136
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,111
in the second movement.

137
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,571
I love music. I've always
regretted

138
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,699
that I never learned
to play an instrument.

139
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,576
I'd be glad
to help you if you like.

140
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,038
I'd like it
very much.

141
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,289
I'm sure I could
find time

142
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,748
for a few lessons.

143
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,134
(<i> playing instrument expertly)</i>

144
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,984
(<i> gasps</i> )

145
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,194
Captain?

146
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,778
I'm all right.

147
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,114
I did understand
you correctly

148
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,409
that you wanted to share
my knowledge of music?

149
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,537
I didn't realize
you were offering

150
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,163
to share it so directly.

151
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,832
The sensation was just
a little... overwhelming.

152
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,252
I am terribly sorry,
Captain.

153
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,380
I assumed since you knew of
our telepathic abilities...

154
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,132
I-I never would have dreamed
of making a connection

155
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,343
without your consent.

156
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,262
You intended
to give me a gift...

157
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,056
and it was wonderful.

158
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,975
Your abilities allow you
to transfer knowledge

159
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,270
from your own mind
to another's?

160
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,397
Not precisely.

161
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,899
We're able to share
our experiences

162
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,484
through a telepathic link.

163
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,820
I remembered lessons
and hours of practice.

164
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,490
Were those
your experiences?

165
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,451
Intriguing.

166
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,661
Remarkable.

167
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,669
You take a couple
of these...

168
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,089
roll them around
like this...

169
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,300
and voilà!

170
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,344
Your hands are clean
and disinfected.

171
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,055
The Enarans
are very hygienic.

172
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,640
Hmm.

173
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,434
I haven't seen
Lieutenant Torres

174
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,643
around here tonight.

175
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,978
I suppose
she's putting in

176
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,646
another late night
in Engineering.

177
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,064
Actually, I think

178
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,649
she might have gone
to bed early tonight.

179
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,333
I'm not one to dictate
who your friends are,

180
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,418
but I'm sure you can see
as clearly as I can

181
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,546
that some friends
are less suitable than others.

182
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,965
Like Dathan?

183
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,592
Yes. You promised

184
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,843
you wouldn't
see him anymore

185
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,094
and then I heard
you were talking

186
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,762
to him again
the other day.

187
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,598
He came up to me
on the street.

188
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,391
I couldn't help it.

189
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,645
Korenna,
don't you see

190
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,605
I am thinking of him
as well as you?

191
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,815
Now, you only
encourage him this way

192
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,359
and that isn't
very fair, is it?

193
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,402
What isn't fair is
that you treat him

194
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,613
like everybody else.
He's different.

195
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,407
If you just talked to him,
you'd understand that.

196
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,993
You know, one of the things
I love about you most

197
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,037
is your compassion
for others.

198
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,497
But you're still young.

199
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,290
You don't realize that
there are some people

200
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,668
that might take advantage
of that compassion.

201
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,128
Now, I want you
to promise me,

202
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,548
if he comes up to you again,
you'll just walk away.

203
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,550
That should be
clear enough.

204
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,885
I'm sure.

205
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,763
And finish your tarin juice.

206
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,391
It's good for you.

207
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,537
He's gone.

208
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,915
(<i> giggling</i> )

209
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,458
I should go.

210
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,503
He's leaving for work soon.
It's safer to wait.

211
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,676
You know, this will
only encourage me.

212
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,512
I hope so.

213
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,971
(<i> laughing</i> )

214
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,323
(<i> startled cry</i> )

215
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,120
No! No!

216
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,081
(<i> gasping</i> )

217
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,172
We've completed
the modifications

218
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,674
on the primary EPS
conduits.

219
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,800
I have a crew starting
on the backup systems.

220
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,969
Can you get it done

221
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,512
before we drop off
the Enarans?

222
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,641
Yes. We'll have to pull
some longer shifts,

223
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,477
but two more days
should do it.

224
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,607
Is there something
else on your mind?

225
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,444
Those dreams
I've been having...

226
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,407
um, they're getting
kind of strange.

227
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,576
In what way?

228
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,120
Last night,

229
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,665
in the middle of the dream,

230
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,792
I was...

231
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,795
kissing him--
My lover--

232
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,756
And suddenly he was dead.

233
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,299
Burned.

234
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,259
B'Elanna...

235
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,095
But there's more going on
than just a love affair.

236
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,598
I'm having a relationship
with this man,

237
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:12,519
but my father doesn't approve,
so we have to sneak around.

238
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,190
It's like each new dream
advances the story.

239
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,692
It sounds like
a holonovel.

240
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,068
But it feels like
it's actually happening.

241
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,363
I mean, physically,
emotionally,

242
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,573
it's no different
from real life.

243
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,618
I've never had dreams
like this before.

244
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,495
It can't be a coincidence
that this is going on

245
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,664
while we have a group
of telepaths on board.

246
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,374
Exactly.

247
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,583
I want to find out more

248
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,210
about what these
Enarans can do.

249
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,838
Why don't you ask
your friend in Engineering?

250
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,088
I'm going to.

251
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,923
I'll talk to the Captain.

252
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,593
She should know about anything
that might involve our guests.

253
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,094
Right.

254
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,813
JARETH:
Once, I stood where you are

255
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,441
during the early days
of interstellar exploration.

256
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,611
It was an important
leap forward for our people,

257
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,780
and I was proud
to be part of it.

258
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,031
Today, with the advent

259
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,450
of terraforming,
we stand ready

260
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,452
to take another leap forward

261
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,620
into an era

262
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,707
of expansion
and colonization.

263
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,793
You will show us
the way.

264
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,462
There are some
who resist progress.

265
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,508
Do not let the voices
of fear and ignorance

266
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,176
discourage you.

267
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,303
Claim your
rightful place

268
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,347
as leaders of a new era.

269
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,934
The future of Enara
is in your hands.

270
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,982
Now, today, we honor
a group of young people

271
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,359
who represent our best hope

272
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,652
for that future.

273
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,112
It is a great
pleasure to give

274
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,156
this first award
to my own daughter, Korenna.

275
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,834
I'm so very proud of you.

276
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,398
DATHAN:
It looks good on you.

277
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,071
What are you doing here?

278
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,908
Today's important for you.

279
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,117
I wanted to be here.

280
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,829
I'm glad you came.

281
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,706
(<i> sighs</i> )

282
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,625
I know this award
will help me get

283
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,710
into the District
Education Center.

284
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,630
I could be a junior instructor
in less than a year.

285
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,008
I'm really happy
for you.

286
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,218
Maybe you could take
the entrance examination, too.

287
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,762
You know
that's impossible.

288
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,305
I can't go
to the Center.

289
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,224
Nothing is impossible
if you want it badly enough.

290
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,895
I want us to be together.

291
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,356
I love you, Korenna.

292
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,444
It's just
so frustrating.

293
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,697
I can't stand being away
from you all the time.

294
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,990
Oh, I know.

295
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,994
Oh, I wish I could hold you
right now.

296
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,793
What would you do
if you could?

297
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,339
I'll show you.

298
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,387
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

299
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,638
(<i> bell tolls</i> )

300
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,973
(<i> voices approaching</i> )

301
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,391
I'll see you tonight.

302
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,434
No. No. There's going
to be a big dinner

303
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,561
with my father's friends.

304
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,229
(<i> bell tolls</i> )

305
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,856
Tomorrow night,
then.

306
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,691
Tomorrow.

307
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,026
(<i> tolling continues</i> )

308
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,986
MALE:
Single file. Identification.

309
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,907
MALE 2:
Next.

310
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,742
Let's go.

311
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,535
Have identification ready.

312
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,995
This way, this way.

313
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,455
All the way out.

314
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,752
Let's move.

315
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,924
B'Elanna!

316
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,842
Can you hear me?

317
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,720
Kes to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

318
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,397
(<i> gasps</i> )

319
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,441
Good to see you're
awake, Lieutenant.

320
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,652
What happened?

321
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,946
I found you unconscious

322
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,239
in the corridor
near Engineering.

323
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,119
I was dreaming again.

324
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,414
Not according to your
cortical theta wave readings.

325
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,665
The pattern clearly indicated

326
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,292
that you were
experiencing memories.

327
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,169
Specifically,
implanted memories.

328
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,421
Implanted?

329
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,090
By the Enarans?

330
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,925
There's strong evidence
of telepathic activity

331
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,509
in your
frontal lobe.

332
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,012
My experience with
the Enarans' telepathy

333
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,056
seems to be very different
from yours.

334
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,392
Jor Brel was standing near me

335
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,645
when I received his memories.

336
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,564
Were there any Enarans near
you when you had your dreams?

337
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,316
No, I was alone every time.

338
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,026
You've also
been asleep

339
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,320
or unconscious every time.

340
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,489
The shared memories
feel like...

341
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,366
vivid dreams to you.

342
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,868
In the Lieutenant's
case, the memories

343
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,829
seem to have been placed
in her unconscious.

344
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,580
They're only emerging
when her conscious mind

345
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,790
is inactive.

346
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,374
Why did she pass out?

347
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,585
The synaptic patterns
of the implanted memories

348
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,630
are not quite compatible
with her neural pathways.

349
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,966
There's been some minor cortical
damage, which I've corrected.

350
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,010
Can you prevent
further damage?

351
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,013
This inhibitor will control
her theta-wave activity.

352
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,765
That should suppress
the memories.

353
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,391
I won't have any more
of the dreams?

354
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,852
That's the idea.

355
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,355
What's wrong?

356
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,524
If the dreams stop,

357
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,776
I'll never know what happens
to these people.

358
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,863
I mean, this woman,
Korenna,

359
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,115
I... I feel
what she feels.

360
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,574
And right now,

361
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,953
she is torn and confused
about her loyalties,

362
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,288
and I don't know what I'm--
what<i> she's</i> going to do.

363
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,415
DOCTOR:
I don't think satisfying
your curiosity

364
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,793
is worth risking brain damage,
Lieutenant.

365
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,300
I'm giving you
the next two days off duty.

366
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,219
Use them to rest.

367
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,721
I'll speak with Brel

368
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,514
and find out what's
happening to you.

369
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,683
I'd like to come with you,
Captain.

370
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,560
I'd rest a lot better
if I had some answers.

371
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,647
I find it impossible

372
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,566
that any of us could be
doing this purposely.

373
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,275
You do possess
the capability

374
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,528
to share your experiences
without mutual consent.

375
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,865
Yes, but, uh,
it just isn't done.

376
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,324
I-I know that we had

377
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,869
a misunderstanding
before, Captain,

378
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,496
but I assure you,
we have strict ethics.

379
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,207
We're not suggesting
otherwise.

380
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,541
We're only trying
to find out

381
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,918
how this is happening.

382
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,544
Well, I have heard of instances

383
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:57,381
where members of some alien
races have been affected

384
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,259
by the slight telepathic field
we generate, but nothing

385
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,427
as intense as what

386
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,096
your Lieutenant
has described.

387
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,640
Well, according to our Doctor,
they're memories.

388
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,267
That's possible.

389
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,686
She may be picking up
stray thoughts and memories

390
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,689
from every Enaran on the ship.

391
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,692
It must be terribly confusing.

392
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,652
Perhaps that's why her
mind has organized it

393
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,654
into a kind
of narrative.

394
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,782
Are you saying that
I'm making this all up?

395
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,075
No, no, no.

396
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,993
Some elements
may very well have come

397
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,661
from our actual experiences.

398
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,956
I confess I...
I may have crawled

399
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,332
into a bedroom window or two
in my youth.

400
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,669
You mentioned
a citizenship award.

401
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,632
There are several
past recipients in our group.

402
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,884
We may be each contributing

403
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,011
some small details
to your story.

404
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,306
Nothing really happened
the way I remember it?

405
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,683
It's highly unlikely.

406
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,523
We appreciate your help,
Jor Brel.

407
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,778
I wish there was something more
that I could do.

408
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,781
I truly regret any ill effects

409
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,741
that our presence here
has caused you.

410
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,702
Well, fortunately, those
effects are under control now.

411
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,247
The Doctor was able
to suppress the memories.

412
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,624
I'm very glad to hear that.

413
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,795
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

414
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,547
His explanation is plausible.

415
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,799
B'Elanna?

416
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,593
I don't know.

417
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,387
Those dreams are so real...

418
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,056
Maybe he's right.

419
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,557
The Enarans haven't

420
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,935
shown any hint of subterfuge--
Any hidden agenda.

421
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,521
They've been nothing
but straightforward and honest.

422
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,606
You're in no
immediate danger.

423
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,066
They'll be gone in another day.

424
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,068
The situation
will resolve itself.

425
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,864
And yet, you fully intend
to continue investigating.

426
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,406
I wonder how long it's been

427
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,701
since I did anything
that surprised you.

428
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,205
I share your concern, Captain.

429
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,165
We haven't ruled out
the possibility

430
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,209
that this may be
a deliberate act.

431
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,919
I want to talk to more
of the Enarans,

432
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,213
see what they have to say.

433
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,672
I'll talk to Jessen and Mirell.

434
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,299
They've been working with me
in Engineering.

435
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,591
You've done enough already,
B'Elanna.

436
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,261
I want you to get some rest.
But...

437
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,555
You need to get away from this.
We'll take it from here.

438
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:15,895
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50211.4.</i>

439
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,521
<i>We're approaching Enara</i>

440
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,566
<i>and preparing to host a</i>
<i>farewell party for our guests.</i>

441
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,609
<i>They've made every effort</i>
<i>to help us understand</i>

442
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,196
<i>their telepathic abilities,</i>
<i>but it's still a mystery</i>

443
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,908
<i>why they've affected</i>
<i>Lieutenant Torres so strongly.</i>

444
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,870
(<i> sighs</i> )

445
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,881
(<i> instrument powers off</i> )

446
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,450
Korenna, are you ready?

447
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,706
You'll do well.

448
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,499
I'll be there
with you.

449
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,587
This is all voluntary,
isn't it?

450
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,880
They want to be resettled?

451
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,173
Of course.

452
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,385
Although it's impossible
to understand

453
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,845
what these Regressives want.

454
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,847
They simply don't
think like we do.

455
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,725
How do we relate to people

456
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:41,688
who refuse all but the most
primitive technology?

457
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,940
Who live their lives

458
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,109
without a communications
interlink

459
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,403
or microfusion generators?

460
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,696
If that's the way
they want to live...

461
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,324
why can't they?

462
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,908
Well, they can.

463
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,368
That's why we're
helping them to resettle,

464
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,578
so that they can be
completely comfortable

465
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,998
practicing a way of life
that they've chosen.

466
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,791
They could do that here

467
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,709
in their village.

468
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,296
You wouldn't say that if you'd
ever been inside that place.

469
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,800
Do you realize they won't
even use radioseptics

470
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,220
to sterilize their homes,
or their hands before they eat?

471
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,807
It's a miracle they haven't
started a plague by now.

472
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:22,229
Then... it's dangerous
to have them living here.

473
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,023
Yes, it is.

474
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,358
And we've been tolerant

475
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,608
for a very long time,

476
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,487
but I think by now
even they realize

477
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,072
that they'd be better off
living somewhere else.

478
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,949
But some of them
want to stay here.

479
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,453
Well, there are always some
people who resist change

480
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,537
even if they know
it's best for them,

481
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:43,125
but once they see
their friends and family

482
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,793
happily settled
in the new colony,

483
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,295
they'll want to go as well.

484
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,849
Demalos.

485
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,434
MALE:
Demalos, move along.

486
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,104
Sanric.

487
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,481
MALE:
Sanric.

488
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,566
Farran.

489
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,777
What's going
to happen to us?

490
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,406
You'll have a new place
to live with your own kind.

491
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,824
You'll be much happier there.
Please...

492
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,368
Move it along.
...can you
tell me...

493
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,827
I only want to know
where we're going.

494
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,162
Peshar.

495
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,708
Alaris.

496
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,795
Dathan Alaris!

497
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,470
Where is he?
He couldn't be leaving today.

498
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,804
Did you warn him?

499
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,265
Did you tell him
he was on the list?

500
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,517
I didn't even know
that he was.

501
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,643
You put his name there,
didn't you,

502
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,937
to keep him away from me.

503
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,439
FEMALE:
Fredik! Don't!

504
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,773
No!

(<i> gasps</i> )

506
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,699
Computer, locate Jora Mirell.

507
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,910
Jora Mirell is in her quarters.

(<i> moaning</i> )

509
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,057
I'll get you to Sick Bay.
No.

510
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:27,020
I have to give you
the rest of it.

511
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,359
You are Korenna.

512
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,654
These are your memories.

513
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,907
Yes.

514
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,869
Why give them to me?

515
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,123
You won't deny the truth.

516
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,751
We've been hiding it.

517
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,838
I couldn't anymore.

518
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,674
They found out
I was sharing it with you.

519
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,302
Who did?

520
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,721
Don't let the memories die.

521
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,182
Promise me.

522
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,850
I don't understand...

523
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,738
(<i> playing soft music</i> )

524
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,616

My father's home.

If he hears you...

529
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,590
What happened?

530
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,425
One of your friends
made some trouble

531
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,968
on the resettlement line today.

532
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,012
You were on the list too.
Where were you?

533
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,430
Some of us got away.

534
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,140
We're leaving tonight.

535
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,018
Come with me.

536
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:51,146
Korenna, it's the only way
we can be together now.

537
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,025
You're asking me
to abandon my family,

538
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,276
my career...

539
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,819
Yes, I am.
Leave it all behind.

540
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,279
What's happening here
is wrong, Korenna.

541
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,822
Don't be a part
of it anymore.

542
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,659
It's just a resettlement.
It is more than that.

543
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,744
My uncle and his family
were resettled two months ago

544
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,413
and we haven't heard
from them since.

545
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,789
Nobody I know
has had<i> any</i> contact

546
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,375
with this new colony
we're supposed to be going to.

547
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,043
There could be
a perfectly good reason...

548
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,753
There are stories.

549
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,297
I've heard that the transports
don't really go anywhere,

550
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,717
that the passengers
just get vaporized

551
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,134
in some kind
of thermal sweep.

552
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,011
Korenna, thousands of us
have gone already.

553
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,263
We are being slaughtered.

554
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,598
It's ridiculous.

555
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,725
No one is being killed.

556
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:31,270
My father told me--
Your father is lying to you!

557
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,606
I'm sorry, but you have
got to make a choice.

558
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,774
You can't go on trying to
believe in both of us anymore.

559
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,569
Either he is right and you
should never see me again,

560
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:42,406
or I'm right, and he is
part of a terrible crime.

561
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,991
No. My father
is a good man.

562
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,952
I can show you
how we're rounded up

563
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,412
for these voluntary
resettlements,

564
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,747
how the soldiers
treat Regressives

565
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:50,997
who won't go quietly.

566
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,292
I know it is hard to face,
but you have to.

567
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,501
It is too important.

568
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,753
Now let me show you.
No, I...

569
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:58,505
(<i> knock at door</i> )
JARETH: Korenna?

570
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,723
Come in.

571
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,978
I was, I was just practicing.

572
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,898
I've always said
you have the talent

573
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,150
to play professionally.

574
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,903
How are you feeling?

575
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,406
I've been better.

576
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,325
Don't think
about it anymore.

577
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,952
That Regressive was
completely irrational.

578
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,996
He attacked you
for no reason.

579
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,914
KORENNA:
Maybe he thought
he had a reason.

580
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,792
Maybe he was afraid.

581
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,173
I know there are some
very disturbing rumors

582
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,258
coming from these people.

583
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,219
You may have heard them
from that boy.

584
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,692
You know, the thing
that is so insidious

585
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:00,900
about these Regressives

586
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,778
is that they pretend
to be passive,

587
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,530
not harming anyone

588
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,574
and all the while
they are spreading their lies,

589
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,951
trying to make you believe
these awful things.

590
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,537
Why would they do that?

591
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:17,125
They have some twisted ideas
about resisting progress,

592
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,752
which they think
gives them the right

593
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,379
to hold us back
in any way that they can.

594
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,840
They're trying
to undermine us,

595
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,843
to cause
dissent and doubt.

596
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,013
Just look at how
they've affected you.

597
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,560
But...

598
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,437
what they're saying
is so horrible.

599
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,482
Yes, but it isn't very
plausible.

600
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,192
Korenna, think.

601
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,779
A secret conspiracy
against their people?

602
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,282
Organized murder
on such an enormous scale?

603
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,369
Do you really believe
that your family and friends

604
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,246
are capable of that?

605
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,752
No.
'Course not.

606
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,879
Now, I know how hard it is

607
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:05,006
for you to accept
that anyone, even Regressives,

608
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,966
could lie
about something like that,

609
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,302
but it is all part
of their manipulation.

610
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,930
These people have
no conscience.

611
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,433
They'll say anything
to get what they want.

612
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,895
Like that boy Dathan.

613
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:32,075
Has he told you
he's in love with you?

614
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,788
He's not.

615
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,292
It's his way
of gaining your sympathy.

616
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,088
And not only yours.

617
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,339
I've seen him talking

618
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,675
to quite a number
of young women.

619
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,849
Has he been asking you
to trust him?

620
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,185
He's poisoning you
against your own people.

621
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,898
Even your own family.

622
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,942
Hmm?

623
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,407
That's very cruel.

624
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,036
No wonder
you've been confused.

625
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,915
But now you understand

626
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,000
what these people
are really like.

627
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,865
You!

628
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,741
DATHAN:
No. No!

629
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,117
(<i> scuffling</i> )

630
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,084

631
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,630

(<i> locks clicking</i> )

633
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,439
JARETH:
These criminals represent

634
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,067
a growing threat
to Enaran society.

635
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,778
As responsible citizens,
we must fight back!

636
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,989
(<i> shouting agreement</i> )

637
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,324
With their punishment,

638
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,869
we send a clear signal
to all Regressives.

639
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,080
We will protect
ourselves and our ideals

640
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,123
from their
destructive influence

641
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,834
by whatever means necessary.

642
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,006
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

643
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,093
(<i> crowd shouting</i> )

644
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:02,392
CROWD (<i> chanting</i> ):
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

645
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:07,105
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes!

646
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,028
GIRL:
Why did they
all move away?

647
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,447
KORENNA:
Because they didn't want to live
with the rest of us anymore.

648
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,823
Why?

649
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,035
The Regressive people
had very strange ideas

650
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,453
about how to live.

651
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,329
They didn't want to
learn new things

652
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,082
or use any of the technology

653
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,125
that we tried to share
with them.

654
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,003
They decided to live
somewhere else on their own,

655
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,964
and we let them go.

656
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,967
But they couldn't take
very good care of themselves.

657
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,885
They fought
with each other.

658
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,763
They spread all
kinds of diseases.

659
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,014
And they all died?

660
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,558
They destroyed themselves.

661
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,103
It was very sad.

662
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:51,108
But... we can learn
from their mistakes.

663
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,359
That's why we keep
this gate here--

664
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,656
To remind us never to be
stubborn and backward

665
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,907
like they were.

666
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,076
We'll remember.

667
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,995
I know you will.

668
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,362
I'd like to indulge in a new
custom that I've learned.

669
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,032
It's called making a toast.
(<i> people chuckling</i> )

670
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:43,035
To Captain Janeway
and her gracious crew.

671
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:46,163
We are very grateful to you
for bringing us home.

672
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,623
You will always
have friends here.

673
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,627
Murderers.

674
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,587
Lieutenant.

675
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,465
You tried to hide
what you did, but I know.

676
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,092
I saw everything.

677
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,137
The Regressives,
the executions.

678
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,847
Wiping out
an entire population,

679
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,140
and then
blaming them for it.

680
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,225
This is most uncomfortable,
Captain.

681
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,686
Perhaps a more private
discussion would be...

682
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,437
No, that's what you've been
doing all along--

683
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,981
Hiding the truth.

684
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,526
Hoping that it would
just die away quietly!

685
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,778
Please.
This has to come out.

686
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,113
I think it's time
we all understood

687
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,656
what's been happening here.

688
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,951
My dreams--
They are real memories

689
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,327
from Jora Mirell.

690
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,997
When she-- When all
of them were younger,

691
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,917
there was a group of people
they called Regressives.

692
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,753
They just wanted to lead
a different kind of life,

693
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,965
but... but they don't exist
anymore, do they?

694
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,217
You exterminated them.

695
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,220
These accusations
are completely untrue.

696
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,889
You spent your whole life
covering it up,

697
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,306
and then you realized

698
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,893
that someone was passing
the memories on to me.

699
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,728
So you...

700
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,856
you used me to figure out
who it was,

701
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,066
and then you killed her,

702
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,026
but, you know,
you were too late,

703
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,154
because Korenna gave me the last
of her memories before she died.

704
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,698
Korenna Mirell
is dead?

705
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,450
And you have evidence
that she was murdered?

706
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,369
No, they made it look like
it was natural causes.

707
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,955
You should know, Lieutenant,

708
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,082
that I spoke with
Jora Mirell yesterday.

709
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,751
I asked her specifically about
the memories you experienced.

710
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,586
She claimed not to know
anything about them.

711
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,672
Of course she would say that.
She was afraid for her life.

712
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,883
No, you're lying. The Enarans
would never do anything

713
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,969
like what you're saying.
It's unthinkable.

714
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,470
It is the truth.

715
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,264
I know that you don't
want to believe it.

716
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,267
In fact, they're counting on
that. They always have.

717
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,935
I know B'Elanna,
and I trust her.

718
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,271
It can't hurt to listen.

719
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,439
Nobody thinks you're lying,
Lieutenant.

720
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,026
The poor woman has been ill
for a long time.

721
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,903
Her memories may be distorted

722
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,115
or<i> perhaps</i> your perception
of them was colored

723
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,117
by elements
from your culture.

724
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,409
No.

725
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,666
I know that it's easier for you
to believe

726
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,835
that I'm crazy
or hallucinating,

727
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,212
but this woman
shared her life--

728
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,880
Her whole identity-- With me.

729
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,049
I was with her every
step of the way

730
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,384
as she convinced herself
that what she did--

731
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,305
Betraying the man she loved,

732
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,016
playing her part
in the massacre--

733
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,600
That it was
all somehow

734
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,727
for the good
of Enaran society.

735
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,063
She showed me everything.

736
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:21,067
No apologies, no request
for forgiveness,

737
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,070
just the truth.

738
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,032
At least she had
the conscience

739
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:32,162
to stand up and realize
what she'd done wrong...

740
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,956
which is more
than I can say for you.

741
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,210
I think it best that we...

742
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,212
now prepare
for our departure, Captain.

743
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,630
If you don't mind, I'd like
to go to your Sick Bay

744
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,590
to attend Jora Mirell.

745
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,558
I'm going to talk
to the Doctor.

746
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,394
I want to see you in my
ready room in one hour.

747
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,741
I know that I could have found
a better way

748
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,035
to handle the situation
than just charging

749
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,452
into the mess hall
like that.

750
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,997
I was just too angry
to think straight.

751
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,707
Not the first time
that's happened, I know,

752
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,126
but if you had seen
what I saw...

753
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,879
I might have done
exactly the same thing.

754
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,298
You believe me.

755
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:29,052
I believe that the memories
you experienced were real.

756
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,929
Then we've got to do
something about it.

757
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,931
We have to make this public.

758
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,641
You tried that today.
They didn't want to listen.

759
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,894
Then we have to find proof.

760
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,563
Let me go down
to the planet.

761
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,691
There must be some evidence left
of what really happened.

762
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,693
Maybe there are
other people like Korenna

763
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,486
who might be willing
to tell the truth.

764
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,530
Whatever the Enarans
have done,

765
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,118
it's not our place
to bring them to justice.

766
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,494
If they've chosen to conceal
part of their history

767
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,496
from their own descendants,
that's their decision,

768
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,749
whether we approve
of it or not.

769
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,626
It's not just
a matter of history.

770
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,794
This could happen again

771
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,421
if no one knows
it happened before.

772
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,048
We simply have no right
to get involved.

773
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,343
Jora Mirell was murdered
on board this ship,

774
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,262
which gives us a reason
to investigate.

775
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:15,723
Maybe if we can expose
the reason why she was killed,

776
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,017
the Enarans will start
to ask questions.

777
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,855
I've gotten a full report
from the Doctor.

778
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,941
He specifically looked
for evidence

779
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,525
to support your
accusations.

780
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,739
He didn't find any.

781
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,784
They could have used
their telepathy somehow,

782
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,036
in some way that the Doctor
couldn't detect.

783
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,165
We have no basis for
a murder investigation.

784
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,128
I released her body
to the Enarans.

785
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,635
So that's it?

786
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,181
We just go on our merry way

787
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,184
and nobody ever has to take
any kind of responsibility?

788
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,602
I've canceled
our trade negotiations,

789
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,188
as well as shore leave.

790
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,069
We'll leave orbit as soon
as the Enarans are off the ship.

791
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,616
B'Elanna?

792
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,410
I believe the
Enaran engineers

793
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,080
are collecting the last
of their equipment right now.

794
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,584
If there's anything more
you'd like to say to...

795
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,253
any of them...

796
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,260
Thank you.
Thank you, Captain.

797
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,645
I'm relieving you.

798
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,900
Can we talk
for a minute?

799
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,110
I have nothing
to say to you.

800
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,571
Then just listen.

801
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,242
Like Harry said,
it couldn't hurt to do that.

802
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,118
I'm leaving soon.

803
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,294
I know you have
no reason to believe

804
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,129
what I've said
about your people.

805
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,632
All you have is my word

806
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,511
against everything
you've ever been taught.

807
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,264
That's right.

808
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,349
So prove me wrong.

809
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:26,145
Go down to Enara
and find the colony

810
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,981
where the Regressives
were supposed to live.

811
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,692
Talk to people.

812
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,571
Ask questions.

813
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:37,532
Learn the truth for yourself.

814
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,162
Let me tell you
about my experiences.

815
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,831
Maybe that will give you
someplace to start.

816
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,376
I wish...

817
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,463
I had your abilities.
I could just show you.

818
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,424
You would do that?

819
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,386
Share your experiences openly?

820
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,263
Of course.

821
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:03,849
Then you'd know
I'm telling you the truth.

822
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,279
I can make the connection
between us.

823
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,051
(<i> tapping</i> )

824
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,316
What took you so long?

825
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,733
(<i> giggling</i> )
