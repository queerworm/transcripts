So, how was
school today?

63

Wonderful. Tuvok helped me
with a sensory focus exercise,

64

we worked on
my precognitive skills

65
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:11,232

Apparently so.

But before I could
analyze them,

81
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,828
the life-signs
simply ceased.

82

dead or alive,

They're sporocystian.

95

The caretaker was
a sporocystian life-form.

96
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,822
But according
to my readings,

97
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,699
the life-signs aren't coming
from the remains.

98
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,326
The remains are simply
resonating

99
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,745
in response to an external
energy source--

100
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,288
some other life-form.

The life-signs are gone.

110
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,984
These remains
could be responding

111
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,861
to the caretaker's mate.

112
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,783
If that's true, maybe we could
use them to track her down.

113

And if we can find her,
she might have

the ability
to send us home.

We've placed the remains in

118
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,383
The next time it responds
to sporocystian energy,

119
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,509
the field should give us
a heading to the source.

120
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,511
You're using the remains
like a compass.

121
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,846
Exactly.

122
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,556
Good work.
Keep us apprised.

123
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,725
Janeway out.

124
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,940
Captain, the caretaker was
a being of considerable power.

125
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,984
And although his intent
was not hostile,

126
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,860
we were essentially
at his mercy.

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,862
I do not care to repeat
that experience.

128
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,157
And if we<i> are</i> about
to meet his mate,

129
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,284
you'd like it to be
on more even ground.

130
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,661
Precisely. I have
studied the doctor's

131
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,331
biochemical analysis
of the caretaker remains

132
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,625
and I believe it is possible to
create a sporocystian toxin--

133
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,171
something which might
debilitate the life-form.

134
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,343
Sounds like a sensible
precaution. Get on it.

from the array.

180
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,510
Let's hear it.

181
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,055
<i>You're not wanted here.</i>

182
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,228
We pose no threat to you.

183
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,687
I'm Captain Kathryn
Janeway of the--

184
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,149
<i>You have been warned.</i>

185
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:56,697
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

186
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,788
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

187
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,540
They are Ocampa?

188
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,460
That's right. There appears
to be an entire colony.

189
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,045
And, according
to our sensors,

190
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,299
the station is
at least 300 years old.

191
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,675
Kes, is there
any Ocampa history

192
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,595
about people who
left your planet

193
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,222
or were captured
by aliens and taken away?

194
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,350
No.

195
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,809
The idea that
there could be Ocampa

196
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,144
anywhere but
on the homeworld

197
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,938
is something no one
ever considered.

198
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,399
I thought I was
the only one.

199
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,943
Since you're definitely
the only one on<i> Voyager,</i>

200
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,695
I want you to act
as an intermediary.

201
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,407
Gladly. What should I do?

202
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,034
The first step
is to arrange a meeting.

203
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,827
Let's see if we can
get that far.

204
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,787
Hail the array.

205
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,916
<i>This is becoming tiresome,</i>
<i>captain.</i>

206
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,169
<i>If you force us to take</i>
<i>further aggressive action--</i>

207
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,047
I have someone here
who wishes to speak with you.

208
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,307
My name is Kes.
I'm an Ocampa.

209
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,184
<i>This is some kind of trick.</i>

210
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,977
I assure you,
it's not a trick.

211
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,606
<i>What would an Ocampa</i>
<i>be doing on an alien starship?</i>

212
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,025
It's a long story.

213
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,069
But I'd like to know
what an Ocampa

214
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,655
is doing on
an alien space station.

215
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,408
<i>That is also a long story.</i>

216
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,576
Then I suggest we meet

217
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,245
and tell each other
our stories.

218
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,163
May we come aboard
your station?

219
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,458
<i>No, but I am willing</i>
<i>to come to your ship.</i>

220
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,922
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

221
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,467
Our readings identified

222
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,678
a sporocystian life-form
in this area.

223
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,598
We've been looking for
that life-form for months.

224
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,517
Why? To destroy it?

225
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,060
No.

226
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,105
On the contrary, we believe
it has the technology

227
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,148
that could send us home.

228
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,111
Captain, are you aware
of how your ship is regarded?

229
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:02,156
That when<i> Voyager</i> appears,
people fear destruction?

230
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,743
Your ship is known
as a ship of death.

231
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,162
What?

232
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,457
You've established
quite a reputation.

233
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,166
You killed the caretaker

234
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,376
declared war on the Kazon,

235
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,296
raided planets for their
resources.

236
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,796
None of that is true.

237
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,925
We've never attacked anyone
except in self-defense.

238
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,136
And we did not
kill the caretaker.

239
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,679
He died of natural causes.

240
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,724
Mr. Tanis, please
try to understand.

241
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,933
We only want to find

242
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,226
the entity we've
been looking for.

243
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,229
TANIS:
<i>I want to talk to you alone.</i>

244
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,814
JANEWAY:
Our sensors tell us she's
somewhere in this region.

245
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,734
Can you help us
find her?

246
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,446
Captain, I'd like to speak
to Tanis alone if I may.

247
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,533
Very well.

248
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,250
Why should I believe
any of this?

249
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,961
These are kind people, Tanis.

250
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,464
They saved my life
at great risk to themselves

251
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,549
when they didn't have to.

252
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,842
They wouldn't lie to you.

253
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:12,018
I will admit, these people
are hardly what I expected.

254
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,314
But more unexpected
was finding you here, Kes.

255
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,982
I had no idea any Ocampa

256
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,318
had left the homeworld
so recently.

257
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,446
I have about a thousand
questions to ask you.

258
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,784
I know. And I'm going to
try to answer them.

259
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,744
Is this where
you spend your time?

260
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,831
You mean
in this room? No.

261
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,917
This is where the bridge
officers usually meet.

262
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,086
I want to see where you live.

263
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,506
I want to see the place
that is special to you.

264
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,176
You did all this?

265
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,344
I had a little help,

266
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,137
but, yes, most of it
is my work.

267
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,889
Well, you've done well--

268
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,307
bringing something
so beautiful

269
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,226
into a place so sterile.

270
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,855
Sterile.<i> Voyager?</i>

271
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,231
Ha. Look
around you, Kes.

272
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,317
This is a cold
and barren place.

273
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,486
There are over
150 people on board.

274
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,238
I'd hardly
call that barren.

275
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,489
There are people,

276
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,577
but there's so little life.

277
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,579
Part of me weeps
to see you in this place.

278
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,081
You're so isolated.

279
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,458
Corridors, bulkheads...

280
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,044
all cutting you off
from the world around you.

281
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,295
You live on
a space station.

282
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,673
How is it
any different?

283
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,800
I assure you,
it's very different.

284
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,220
You're very young,
aren't you?

285
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,514
Two years.

286
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:35,226
Would it surprise you to know
that I'm 14 years old?

287
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,145
That's not possible.
( laughs )

288
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,857
The oldest Ocampa
only lived to be nine.

289
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,777
You know so little
about your own people.

290
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,863
There's so much for you
to learn about yourself...

291
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,115
about the galaxy.

292
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,410
Being here on this ship
is holding you back.

293
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,829
These people
are helping me.

294
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,080
I'm a member of the crew.

295
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,416
( laughs )

296
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,710
I suppose we were
like you once--

297
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,379
innocent, naive.

298
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,549
But when Suspiria brought
us here 300 years ago,

299
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,885
she began to teach us
how to become stronger

300
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,470
than we ever could have
on the homeworld.

301
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,180
Suspiria--is that
your caretaker?

302
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,934
We don't think of her
as a caretaker.

303
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,394
Her species is actually
called the Nacene.

304
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,356
Then you<i> do</i> know her.
Where is she?

305
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,484
Nearby.

306
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,321
But she's so different
from the entity you knew.

307
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,241
He was only interested
in maintaining the status quo.

308
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,537
He kept our people
servile and weak.

309
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,749
Suspiria taught us to develop
our psychokinetic skills

310
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,752
that had lain dormant
for so long.

311
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,923
We have abilities far beyond
anything you can imagine.

312
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,760
Like what?

313
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,349
( rustling )

314
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,725
( laughs )

315
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,811
TANIS:
<i>We can enhance life.</i>

316
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,021
<i>And that's only</i>
<i>the beginning, Kes.</i>

317
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,483
(<i> tender theme playing</i> )

318
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,217
<i>I have to</i>
<i>return to the station.</i>

319
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,927
<i>We'll talk again.</i>

320
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,570
Sounds like you've established
a dialogue with Tanis.

321
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,113
It's an excellent beginning.
Good work.

322
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,824
Thank you, captain.

323
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,784
Kes.

324
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,747
Is there something wrong?

325
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,290
Not exactly.

326
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,045
I'm just a little overwhelmed.

327
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,088
I always believed that
my people had the potential

328
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,007
to be more than
what they were--

329
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,052
that our mental abilities
could be somehow heightened,

330
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,055
and now I've met someone
who's realized that potential,

331
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,558
and I don't know whether
to be excited or frightened.

332
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,561
A non-emotional response
would be more useful.

333
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,731
But since you're
not a Vulcan,

334
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,441
I say a mixture
of the two emotions

335
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,150
would be appropriate.

336
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,903
It's an exciting moment, Kes,

337
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,073
and I'm very happy for you.
But just remember,

338
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,241
we know very little
about these Ocampa.

339
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,161
Be cautious
in your dealings with Tanis.

340
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,497
I will.

341
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,959
But I just have
a good feeling about him.

342
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:50,004
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

343
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,857
TANIS:
<i>I've met with the Ocampa girl.</i>

344
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,859
<i>She has potential.</i>

345
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,402
WOMAN:
<i>I don't care about the girl.</i>

346
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,780
<i>She's yours.</i>
<i>Bring me the ship.</i>

347
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,240
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

348
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,412
( Neelix laughs )

349
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,999
This is delicious!

350
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,628
Mr. Tanis, is it true
you're 14 years old?

351
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,965
Yes. That's quite common
with my people here.

352
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,050
Suspiria helped us
develop a technology

to extend
the Ocampa life-span

354
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,138
three generations ago.

355
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,766
My father lived
to be 20 years.

356
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,853
Would that technology
work for Kes?

357
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,270
Possibly.

358
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,732
Where does Suspiria live?
On another array?

359
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,526
Oh, nothing
so corporeal as that.

360
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,113
She exists as pure
sporocystian energy.

361
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,447
She only assumes
physical form

362
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,908
when we need to
communicate with her.

363
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,243
Does she occupy
our space-time continuum?

364
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,204
I don't know.

365
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,124
All I know is, when we
need her, she comes.

366
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,168
I'll take you
to the meeting place.

367
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,962
I'm sure all your questions
will be answered then.

368
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,173
You'll enjoy
meeting her, Kes,

369
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,257
as well as the other
Ocampa here.

370
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,926
I'd love to visit the station.

371
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,261
Visit? Why not stay with us?

372
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,517
Stay?
Yes. I think you could

373
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,729
learn a lot from us,
we from you.

374
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,272
We haven't been in contact
with the Ocampa homeworld

375
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,816
for hundreds of years.

376
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,360
We'd be fascinated to hear
about our distant cousins.

377
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,863
That sounds wonderful,
but, uh--

378
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,699
Kes, you certainly
don't have to decide

379
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,243
something this important
right now.

380
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,995
Give it some thought.

381
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,126
She's absolutely right.
There's no rush.

382
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,544
I appreciate that.

383
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,671
I<i> am</i> curious
about your mental abilities.

384
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,631
They're so much greater
than mine.

385
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,342
Do not underestimate
your own potential, Kes.

386
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,097
Your mental abilities
are rapidly maturing.

387
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,640
I might be able
to help you.

388
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,017
No offense to Mr. Tuvok,

389
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,478
but I am more familiar
with the Ocampa mind.

390
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,232
I would appreciate any insight
you could give me.

391
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,859
Oh, good.
Maybe later this evening.

392
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,741
It is a highly reactive
sporocystian toxin.

393
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,869
<i>I ran a micro-cellular analysis</i>
<i>of the caretaker's remains,</i>

394
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,163
<i>and discovered</i>
<i>a critical enzyme</i>

395
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,790
<i>in his cellular structure.</i>

396
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,166
The energy
in this cylinder

397
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,085
is formulated to break
down that enzyme.

398
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,462
It would result in
temporary paralysis.

399
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,881
Mr. Tanis says
she's harmless.

400
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,633
It is my hope that we
only have to use it

401
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,219
as a precautionary measure.

402
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,387
Very well. Proceed.

403
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,561
In your mind,
visualize your hand.

404
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:57,441
Now reach out with that hand
and grab the teacup.

405
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,653
Reach out with the fingers
of your mind.

406
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,238
Grasp it.

407
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,368
Do you have it?

408
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,080
I can feel the handle
and the texture of the metal,

409
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,623
but I can't move it.

410
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,667
Don't try to move it.

411
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,502
Just take a drink from it.

See? You<i> can</i> do it.

415
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,267
I don't understand.
I didn't try to move it.

416
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,645
No. You just tried to drink
from it.

417
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,481
And what would you do
if you wanted to take a drink?

418
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,025
I'd reach out and pick it up.

419
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,526
That's right.

420
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,528
But you wouldn't be thinking
about picking it up.

421
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,071
You'd simply do it.

422
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,990
And that's what
you just learned.

423
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,576
Focus on the goal, not the task.

424
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,122
When you wanted the tea,
it came to you.

425
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,083
Uh, excuse me...

426
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,626
we're not finished.

427
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,713
I know you're tired.

428
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,548
But I want you to try
one more thing.

429
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,385
It's cold.

430
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,763
Wouldn't it taste better
if it were hot?

431
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,688
See past the liquid.

432
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,439
Not with your eyes,
with your mind.

433
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,607
What your eyes
show you

434
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:24,111
is only the surface
of reality.

435
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,487
Look deeper.

436
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,283
There is no liquid,

437
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,244
there is no cup.

438
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:35,122
There's only a collection
of molecules and atoms,

442
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,805
<i>How would you heat them up?</i>

443
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,267

That's right.

00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,352
But that's enough for tonight.

Tomorrow, I'll take you
to the next level.

Until then, good night.

00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,367
May I say something now?

456
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,577
Of course, Neelix.

I knew you could do it.

This is a whole new
beginning for you, Kes.

00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,508
I know. I know.

00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,052
What if I did go?

00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,222
Go?

To the Ocampa array.

If I decided to live
with Tanis and the others...

466
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,603
would you go with me?

467
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,108
I'd go anywhere with you.

Please.

00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,750
and I would regret not
continuing as your instructor.

530
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,293
Thanks, Tuvok.

531
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,882
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

532
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,814
TANIS:
How's the Vulcan?

533
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,192
Is he going to recover?

534
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,860
KES:
You heard?

535
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,114
In a manner of speaking.
I was aware of what happened.

536
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,451
He's going to be all right,
no thanks to me.

537
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,993
Tanis, I've been thinking--

538
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,288
I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

539
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,123
TANIS:
What's wrong?

540
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,710
If I can't control my abilities,
there might be another accident.

541
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,755
I'm afraid it isn't going
to get any easier, Kes.

542
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,798
You're already starting
to manifest abilities

543
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,301
far beyond anything
you've ever imagined.

544
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,679
Soon you'll be so far beyond
the other beings on this ship

545
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,349
that you'll look at them
as they look at...pets.

546
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,934
They're not pets.

547
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,978
They're people.
They're my friends.

548
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,230
And I'm sure you care
for them very much.

549
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,065
I'm sure
they're wonderful people.

550
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,486
They certainly seem
that way to me, but...

551
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:23,363
it's time that you began
to accept how different

552
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,574
you are from them.

553
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,743
The people on this ship--
they live their lives

554
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,078
trapped inside
their primitive skulls,

555
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,664
depending on flesh and bone

556
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:34,040
to tell them
what the universe is like.

557
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,837
They don't know what it is
to see beyond the physical.

558
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,297
Touch it.

559
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,967
This is how<i> they</i>
know their universe.

560
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,970
They touch the flower,
the nerve impulses

561
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,847
travel up their arm
to the brain

562
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,100
and in their mind, they sense
the moisture of the petals,

563
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,937
the texture of the leaves,
the sharpness of the thorns,

564
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,565
and they think they know
what it feels like,

565
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,901
but they don't.

566
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,945
Now touch it.

567
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,156
Reach out with
your thoughts.

568
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,576
<i>Feel</i> it...for
the very first time.

569
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,997
Think of nothing
but the flower.

570
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,168
It's the only object
in the universe.

571
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,795
Know it.

572
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:24,090
Know it in a way
only an Ocampa can.

573
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,343
(<i> suspenseful theme playing )</i>

574
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,927
Can you see it?

575
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,681
Yes.

576
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,932
It's more than seeing.

577
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,268
It's more than touching.

578
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,771
I know this flower.

579
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,398
You can do more.

580
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,858
Reach out.

581
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:43,276
Feel all the life
in this room.

582
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,655
(<i> mysterious theme playing )</i>

583
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,799
Yes, I can feel it.

584
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,551
I know them all.

585
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,469
They're so beautiful.

586
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,222
It can be more beautiful.

587
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,015
Bring the fire.

588
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,226
( panting )

589
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,794
(<i> gentle theme playing</i> )

590
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,843
How did it feel?

591
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,267
They're dead.

592
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,148
They're all dead.

593
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,150
Amazing.

594
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,277
You felt life.

595
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,738
You embraced its essence
with your mind,

596
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,741
and then you transformed it.

597
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,577
There's nothing else
like it in the universe.

598
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,705
I killed those plants...

599
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,040
just like I almost
killed Tuvok.

600
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,960
But I don't want
to hurt anybody.

601
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,505
Of course you don't.
That's not the point.

602
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,007
Hurt people, help them,

603
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,968
give life, kill.

604
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,303
It's all the same.

605
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,096
Once you see beyond
the physical,

606
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,642
you see the universe
as it truly is.

607
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:42,646
Now you know why you can't stay
with these people.

608
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,523
Why you<i> have</i>
to come with me.

609
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:49,569
Come back to the station.

610
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,988
We'll care for you.

611
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,364
We'll train you.

612
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,828
Oh, I don't know.

613
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,621

00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,248
( sighs )

615
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,210
I still need some more time
to think about it.

616
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,380
Take all the time you want.

617
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,256
But when you meet Suspiria,

618
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,925
I think you'll decide
to join us.

619
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,593
Why?

620
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,304
Because Suspiria is your future.

621
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:20,183
She's part of us,
and we're a part of her.

622
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,353
All the Ocampa here
are connected in a way

623
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,023
that can't be put into words.

624
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:29,026
And if you develop
your abilities far enough,

625
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:35,114
Suspiria will invite you
to go with her to Exosia.

626
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,909
Exosia?

627
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,369
A place the humanoids
on this ship call

628
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,706
"A subspace layer,"
a place of pure thought,

629
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:46,626
pure energy,
a place of the mind.

630
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,378
Think about it, Kes.

631
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:53,216
When you're ready,
Suspiria will embrace you.

632
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,968
Good night.

(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

635
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,745
Torres to bridge.

636
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,706
The caretaker's remains
are resonating again.

637
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,460
It's definitely reacting
to a sporocystian life-form.

638
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,753
And from what I can tell,

639
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,422
that life-form is right
on top of us.

640
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,132
Acknowledged.

641
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,385
Captain, there's a subspace
rupture forming directly ahead.

642
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,345
Yellow alert. Janeway to Tanis.

643
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,806
Will you please come
to the bridge?

644
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,058
I believe we've made contact
with Suspiria.

645
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:46,352
TANIS ( on communicator ):
<i>I know. I'm on my way.</i>

646
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,396
I think we should run
a bio-spectral analysis.

647
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,983
Some of these readings
are pretty strange.

648
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:56,321
And get me the sensor logs on
that subspace rupture out there.

649
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,825
Captain, I'm picking up some
strange readings in engineering.

650
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,910
Some kind of plasmatic
energy field is forming.

651
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,453
Janeway to Torres.

652
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,371
We're picking up some odd
plasmatic readings down there.

653
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:10,168
Can you confirm?
Janeway to Torres.

654
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,795

in main engineering.

657
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,697
It's time to go.

658
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,240
Go...where?

659
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,784
Back to the Ocampa station.

660
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,578
Everyone's waiting for you, Kes.

661
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,455
The connection has been made.

662
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,041
You're part of us now.

663
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,085

already begun.

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,561
Tuvok to bridge.

JANEWAY ( on communicator ):
<i>Go ahead.</i>

667
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,356
I believe the female
caretaker is here.

668
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,735
Commander,
you have the bridge.

669
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,241
TANIS:
Can't you feel
the connection?

670
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,536
Your people
are calling to you.

671
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,954
Listen to them.

672
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,624
Yes.

673
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,171
I can hear them.

674
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,131
All of them.

675
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,217
And can you hear
Suspiria?

676
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,111
Tuvok?

677
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:02,114
( soft crying )

678
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,873
Who are you?

679
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,377
Suspiria.

680
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,842
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

681
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,636
Why?

682
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:28,056
Because I had the opportunity
to talk to your companion

683
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,891
before he died.

684
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,393
Yes, I know.

685
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,479
I can feel her presence.

686
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,564
She's powerful.

687
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,733
Turbulent.

688
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,322
She's upset.

689
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,491
( gasping )

690
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,826
She's angry!

691
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,119
Kes.

692
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,708
She wants to destroy the ship!

693
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,710
Kes, listen to me.

694
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,254
There's nothing to worry about.

695
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,713
Am I interrupting?

696
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,092
He told us that you were curious

697
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,845
and went off to explore
the galaxy.

698
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,596
We're explorers, too.

699
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,350
But your friend brought us to
this quadrant against our will,

700
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,602
and we haven't been able
to find a way back.

701
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,646
Is that why you killed him?

702
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,857
We didn't kill him.

703
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,485
You destroyed the array,
and you took his remains.

704
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,736
I assure you--

705
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,488
No!

706
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,824
( adult voice ):
You killed him.

707
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:31,036

Now you will know what frail,

What's going on?

714
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,450
I don't know.

715
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,162
It's like the entire molecular
structure of the ship

716
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,955
is coming apart.

717
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,415
Red alert.

We're losing hull integrity.

Increase power

KIM:
Aye, sir.

724
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,177
Forget these people.

725
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,512
You're beyond them.
No.

726
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,681
Leave her alone, Tanis.

727
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,142
Remember how you felt
in the airponics bay?

728
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,852
( gasping )

729
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,230
You've never felt that way
in your entire life, have you?

730
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,439
Get away from me.

731
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,400
That was only
the beginning, Kes.

732
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,110
I said leave her alone!

733
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,320

00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,738
Neelix!

735
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,116
Leave him.
Leave him, Kes.

736
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,243
He's nothing
compared to you.

737
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,535
Nothing!

738
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,912
You have to trust.

Oh, Neelix.

744
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,606
Suspiria.

So, now you kill me
as you did my mate.

749
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,146
No. I told you
we didn't kill him.

750
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,941
Please try to understand.

751
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,068
We don't want to hurt you.

752
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,196
We don't want to hurt anyone.

753
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:14,032
We just want to get home.

754

Tuvok, release the force-field.

Do it.

( computer beeps )

757
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,352
You'd show me mercy
after what I did to you?

758
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,731
Yes, I would.

00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,709

00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,548
Take me with you...please.

761
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,888
It appears she has descended
into subspace.

762
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,432
Can you track her position?

763
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,435
Negative. The rupture
has been sealed.

764
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,188
She is gone, captain.

765
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,281
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

766

<i>We've resumed our course</i>

<i>and convince her</i>

771
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:52,838
I looked at the tea,

772
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,467
and I tried to make it boil,
but nothing happened.

773
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,676
Without Tanis' help,
I just can't do it.

774
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,220
Nevertheless,

775
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,806
your psychokinetic abilities
are still part of you.

776
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,558
They might resurface one day.

777
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,852
To be honest, I never want to
see that part of myself again.

778
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,729
To which part
are you referring?

779
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,189
To the part of me

780
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,191
that got pleasure from
destroying those plants

781
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,734
in the airponics bay.

782
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,488
To the part of me that was
tempted to go with Tanis.

783
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:19,407
I never realized I had
such dark impulses.

784
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,534
Without the darkness,

785
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,661
how would we
recognize the light?

786
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,497
Do not fear
your negative thoughts.

787
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,457
They are part of you.

788
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:30,209
They are a part of every living
being. Even Vulcans.

789
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,961
You?

790
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,132
The Vulcan heart was forged
out of barbarism and violence.

791
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,593
We learned to control it,

792
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,637
but it is still part of us.

793
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,096
To pretend it does not exist

794
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:46,142
is to create an opportunity
for it to escape.

795
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,477
