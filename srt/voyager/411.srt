1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,881
( crowd yelling )

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,800
<i>Animali!</i>

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,595
<i>Bruti animali!</i>

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,221
<i>Animali!</i>

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,350
WOMAN:
No, Leonardo,
you are the animal!

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,477
MAN:
A bird who cannot fly!

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,729
Better than a man
who cannot think!

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,021
WOMAN:
The pigeon speaks!

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,398
( people cooing )

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,024
( growling )

11
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,610
Maestro!

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,531
<i>Stupido!</i>

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,616
Foolish Florentines!

14
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,955
A bird is
a mechanical instrument

15
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,208
that works according
to mathematical laws.

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,043
An instrument that surely
I can recreate.

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,963
How did it fail?

18
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,008
Maybe you underestimated
the wingspan.

19
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,010
Had not the River Arno
taken us to its arms,

20
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,845
we would both
have died.

21
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,096
Jumping off the bridge
was a wise precaution.

22
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,892
Against death, yes.

23
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:02,021
Against humiliation...no.

24
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:05,232
"The great bird
will take flight,

25
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,818
and bring glory
to its nest."

26
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,320
So I have bragged for months.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,492
Instead, we almost drown
with half of Florence watching.

28
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,077
( grunts )

29
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,787
<i>Finito!</i>

30
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,080
No more.

31
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,124
Catarina...

32
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,961
have you been to France?

33
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,462
Not recently.

34
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,925
Ah. The king of France
is a great admirer of mine.

35
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,052
"The divine Leonardo"
is all I hear

36
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,012
when I walk through
his streets.

37
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,432
And what music do I find
in the streets of Florence, eh?

38
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,770
The cooing of pigeons
and the babbling of fools.

39
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,522
Catarina,
we are leaving.

40
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,946
You're giving up.

41
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,864
Hmm?

42
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,824
Again.

43
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,368
Your beautiful painting
of the Adoration...

44
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,578
the great

45
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,330
bronze horse
in Milan...

46
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,124
the Battle of Anghiari...

47
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,667
unfinished, all of them.

48
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,502
You were going to publish
your notebooks.

49
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,754
You never did.

50
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,214
You have given up,

51
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,717
abandoned your most
important works.

52
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,052
Why?

53
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,684
There is a...

54
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,394
a tavern just outside Paris,

55
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,687
Catarina,

56
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,315
a charming bistro
where the wine is...

57
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,566
<i>Terramotto.</i>

58
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,901
Janeway to the Bridge.

59
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,778
CHAKOTAY:
<i>We're under attack, Captain.</i>

60
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,237
I'm on my way.

61
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,158
( horses whinny, people scream )

62
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,245
Earthquakes...and idiots.

63
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,331
Florence be damned.

64
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,866
Who are they and why
are they shooting at us?

65
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,034
Unknown, Captain.

66
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,535
They're not responding
to hails.

67
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,955
Damage?
TUVOK: None.

68
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,957
KIM:
I'm reading a slight
destabilization

69
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,166
along the shield perimeter.

70
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,542
Attempting
to compensate.

71
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,012
Uh, Torres to the Bridge.
JANEWAY:<i> Go ahead.</i>

72
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,931
We just lost
the warp diagnostic assembly.

73
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,224
<i>What do you mean "lost"?</i>

74
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,516
It disappeared.

75
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,904
I'm picking up
dematerializations on Decks 4

76
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,530
through 12.
Evasive maneuvers.

77
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,659
They're matching
our course changes.

78
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,046
It's definitely some kind
of transporter beam.

79
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,506
Fire at will.

80
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,175
TUVOK:
I have the will,

81
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,469
but not the means, Captain.
Targeting control is down.

82
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,637
Why?

83
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,972
KIM:
Captain, the main

84
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,556
computer processor is gone.

85
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,058
We've lost weapons, navigation

86
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,268
and propulsion.

87
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,270
Backup systems
are coming on line.

88
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,896
Full phasers,
manual targeting,

89
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,690
keep firing
until you hit something.

90
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,821
The other ships are retreating.

91
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,198
Chakotay
to all decks.

92
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,241
Full damage reports.

93
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,077
I feel like
we've just been mugged.

94
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,464
They were employing
a high-energy transporter beam,

95
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,134
designed to locate objects
of technological value

96
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,593
and remove them.

97
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,428
They removed a lot.

98
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,639
Five tricorders,
three phaser rifles,

99
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,308
a couple of photon
torpedo casings,

100
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,392
two antimatter
injectors,

101
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,229
a month's supply
of emergency rations.

102
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,355
No great loss there.

103
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,898
DOCTOR:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

104
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,900
<i>You're forgetting</i>
<i>the most important thing</i>

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,484
of all, my mobile emitter.

106
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,070
<i>Without it,</i>
<i>I'm stuck in Sick Bay.</i>

107
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,363
<i>I can't go anywhere.</i>

108
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,822
We'll do
the best we can, Doctor,

109
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,406
but our top priority
is the main

110
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,243
computer processor.

111
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,245
B'Elanna, I want a defense
against another

112
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,787
transporter attack.

113
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,706
Harry, do everything you can
to track

114
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,957
those ships.
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,292
Dismissed.

116
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,794
( console beeping )

117
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,380
( door opens )

118
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,673
Seven...hey...

119
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,966
If you're here
to fraternize,

120
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,385
I do not have
the time.

121
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,220
Actually, the Captain
wanted me to locate

122
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,428
the ships
that attacked us.

123
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,972
I've pushed
the long-range sensors

124
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,515
about as far
as they'll go...

125
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,517
And now you believe the
sensors can be extended

126
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,395
by using the deep space
imaging system.

127
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,397
Well, yes.

128
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,481
I've been working
on that exact procedure

129
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,359
for the past two hours.

130
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,361
Really?
Let's have a look.

131
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,072
Do you doubt my ability
to finish the task?

132
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,656
It...

133
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,950
Look...

134
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,619
I came here to work.

135
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,664
Um...I realized you'd
already started the job...

136
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,625
so I offered to help.

137
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,918
That's all.

138
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,337
I offered to help.

139
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,881
An algorithmic feedback

140
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,758
is interfering
with the resolution.

141
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,594
Decompile data banks
59 through 17

142
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,012
and attempt
to isolate it.

143
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,392
Now...

144
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,478
or you should leave.

145
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,563
Okay.

146
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,653
I'm a pretty
easygoing person.

147
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,571
I mean, it takes
a lot to...

148
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,282
ruffle my...
feathers.

149
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,908
( clears throat )

150
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,369
But that's not
true of everybody.

151
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,663
You've got to learn
how to phrase things

152
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,582
a little more...
diplomatically.

153
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,963
Or not.

154
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:33,138
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51386.4.</i>

155
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,974
<i>With ship's systems</i>
<i>at nearly half capacity,</i>

156
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:40,020
<i>it's taken us ten days</i>
<i>to track our stolen technology.</i>

157
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,771
I'm picking up
Starfleet signatures

158
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,315
from two of the continents.

159
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,650
Can you find the main
computer processor?

160
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,278
It's on the northern
continent...

161
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,530
in what looks
like a city...

162
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,282
but there's a lot
of signal interference.

163
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,159
I'll never be able to
localize it from here.

164
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,495
TUVOK:
Captain, I've identified

165
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,831
nearly 27 kinds of alien ships
in orbit of this planet.

166
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,167
It appears to be an active
center of commerce.

167
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,252
We should be able to place
an undercover away team

168
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,546
on either continent
without attracting attention.

169
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,964
That's good enough for now.

170
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,050
Tuvok, you and I
are going after the processor.

171
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,468
Tom, Neelix, I want you

172
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,428
on the other continent,
find out what you can.

173
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,264
At the very least, try to get
our emergency rations back.

174
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,640
Chakotay, you have the Bridge.

175
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:34,408
( conversing in alien language )

176
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,540
It never fails
to impress me.

177
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,124
No matter how vast
the differences

178
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,460
may be between cultures,
people always have something

179
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,088
that somebody else wants
and trade is born.

180
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,006
Or more to the point,
theft.

181
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,425
What have you got?

182
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,634
The materials in the
construction of this city,

183
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,220
and the technology in use,

184
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,472
appear to have originated
from numerous sources.

185
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,681
No doubt stolen.

186
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,308
The myriad signatures
have resulted

187
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,809
in high interference levels.

188
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,563
I am unable to...
A moment.

189
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,440
I am picking up
a Starfleet signature.

190
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,774
The computer
processor?

191
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,983
I don't believe so.

192
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,735
The signal magnitude
is too low.

193
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,447
The signature is...

194
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,697
approaching.

195
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,990
DA VINCI:
Catarina!

196
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,409
<i>Che maraviglia!</i>

197
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,577
Out of my way!

198
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:19,953
Out of my way!
<i>Scusa.</i>

199
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,204
<i>Perdono.</i>

200
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,331
Catarina!

201
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,665
Welcome!

202
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,043
Welcome to America!

203
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,722
Tell me, Catarina,

204
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,182
what do you think
of the New World?

205
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,767
How did you get here?

206
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,312
A question I have
asked myself many times.

207
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,606
One moment, I was packing
for my journey to France,

208
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,983
the next, I was in
this land of marvels.

209
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,320
Possibly, upon leaving
my workshop,

210
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,863
I was accosted
by Spanish sailors...

211
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,575
rendered unconscious,
delivered to a galleon

212
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,328
in the port
of Genoa and carried

213
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,623
like a sack of grain
across the vast Atlantic.

214
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,999
Curious ears.

215
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,503
My traveling companion,
Tuvok.

216
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:13,089
Oh, what the old
philosophers say is true,

217
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,550
"monstrous and wonderful
are the peoples

218
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,469
of undiscovered lands."

219
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,262
But tell me,
Catarina...

220
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,722
how did you come
to the Americas?

221
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,142
Oh, it's a long story.

222
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:28,062
A Portuguese ship,
some Turkish pirates...

223
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,481
a couple of hurricanes...

224
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,399
I'll tell you all about
it some other time.

225
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,733
Excuse me.

226
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,653
There is the man that I
have been looking for.

227
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,904
He has an apparatus that
I need for my next invention.

228
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,865
My patron is
a demanding taskmaster.

229
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,241
Your patron?

230
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:44,538
The prince
of this city.

231
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,913
<i>Buon giorno, signori.</i>

232
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,210
The da Vinci character
is interpreting this world

233
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,546
through the limited capacity
of his holodeck program.

234
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,964
He sees everything
in 16th century terms.

235
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,592
But what is
he doing here?

236
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,386
I was running
the da Vinci simulation

237
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,721
when we were attacked.

238
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:06,434
His program must have been
active in the computer's memory

239
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,269
when the processor
was beamed off the ship.

240
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,147
And then downloaded into the
Doctor's mobile emitter.

241
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,649
But by whom?

242
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,108
His patron?

243
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,527
The prince?

244
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,825
Marvelous, no?

245
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,286
A plasma injector
conduit.

246
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,621
Starfleet issue.

247
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,206
Call it
what you will.

248
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,748
With this machine,
I can make

249
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,252
mercury flow
in three directions at once.

250
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,712
You must see my new workshop.

251
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,296
The prince has been
very supportive.

252
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,673
<i>Andiamo.</i>

253
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,384
Let's go.

254
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,644
So, Catarina...

255
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,521
what do you think of this place?

256
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,773
My workshop in Florence

257
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,485
was but a cave of ignorance
in comparison.

258
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,322
Your new patron
gave you all this?

259
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,617
He is the perfect prince.

260
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,827
Intelligent, but
not overly so.

261
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,205
In awe of my talent,
but not threatened by it.

262
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,459
And above all,
and most importantly,

263
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,336
his purse
is inexhaustible.

264
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,382
And in return for
all this support?

265
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,717
I give him my ideas.

266
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,309
I have even resurrected
my great bird,

267
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,686
like the phoenix
of legend.

268
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,105
They have materials
here, Catarina,

269
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,274
that are so strong
and so light,

270
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,694
that surely my prototype
will ascend to the heavens.

271
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,327
Be careful!

272
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,746
They have found a way

273
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,791
to harness the energy
of a thunderstorm,

274
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,459
and to expel it
with great force.

275
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,710
A<i> pistole</i>

276
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,545
that shoots
not a lead ball,

277
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,838
but a bolt
of lightning.

278
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,432
Well, I'd like to meet
this patron of yours.

279
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,101
And so you shall
this very evening.

280
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,645
But I caution you...

281
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,648
he is as ruthless as a Borgia.

282
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,533
CHAKOTAY:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51392.7.</i>

283
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,951
<i>Though we've yet to hear</i>
<i>from the Captain and Tuvok,</i>

284
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,162
<i>Paris and Neelix have returned</i>
<i>from their mission</i>

285
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,374
<i>to the southern continent</i>
<i>with some disturbing evidence.</i>

286
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,042
Who sold you
these things?

287
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,419
I didn't come here
to be interrogated.

288
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,588
You told me you had
a warp coil to trade.

289
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,673
I said you could

290
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,717
talk
with Commander Chakotay.

291
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,386
I didn't say he'd necessarily
do business with you.

292
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,804
Well, this is
a waste of my time.

293
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,806
I agree.

294
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,973
There's the door.

295
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,433
What?
Goodbye.

296
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,061
Make sure he doesn't get lost on
the way out.

297
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,312
No, wait, wait.

298
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,523
His name is Tau.

299
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,734
He controls the Seventh
Province of the North.

300
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,235
He sells weapons
and technology.

301
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,528
Yes.

302
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,363
Which he confiscates
from passing ships.

303
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,407
Yes, using
his translocator device.

304
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,075
Which he
also stole.

305
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,869
It's made him a rich man.

306
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,413
There are a few items
I'd like to get back.

307
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,914
Where can I find him?

308
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,541
I deal with a go-between.

309
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,669
I've answered
enough of your questions.

310
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,170
Let's talk about
that warp coil.

311
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,505
I'm looking
for something--

312
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,048
You can keep what you've got.

313
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,008
We'll call it even.

314
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,848
This was a waste
of my time.

315
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,140
Not really.

316
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,143
These colors
look good on you.

317
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,945
Torpedoes,
plasma grenades...

318
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,196
particle beam rifles...

319
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,740
I can even get
a ceremonial spear

320
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,990
if you're interested.

321
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,951
I am not interested.

322
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,706
My point is, no matter
what the weaponry,

323
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,458
if you desire it,

324
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,167
chances are I have it.

325
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,462
Or I can get it.

326
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,931
Your prices are said
to be unreasonable.

327
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,057
"Unreasonable" is
such a strong term.

328
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,434
But if I can't
sell to you,

329
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,102
I'll sell to one
of the other colonies

330
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,353
in your system.

331
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,521
A violent sort,

332
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,856
your neighbors,
aren't they?

333
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,524
I'd hate to make
your life difficult

334
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,526
by offering my
weapons to them.

335
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,904
But if you don't
give me a choice...

336
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,950
There can be no doubt

337
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,327
our computer processor
is not in the city.

338
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,287
Well, that certainly
makes things

339
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,164
a little more
difficult.

340
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,250
Leonardo's new patron.

341
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,836
He's quite
the businessman.

342
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,797
We may have no choice
but to do business with him.

343
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,340
DA VINCI:
Catarina!

344
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,968
Here are some friends
I want you to meet.

345
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,219
Try to keep
our hologram occupied.

346
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,721
TUVOK:
But, Captain...

347
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,222
Well make small talk.

348
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,224
Vulcans do not make small talk.

349
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,935
Improvise.

350
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,188
Thank you.

351
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,564
That is very considerate.

352
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,816
Catarina,
wait a minute!

353
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,985
Mr. Da Vinci,
how have you been?

354
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,820
<i>Benissimo.</i> Now if
you will pardon me.

355
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,321
I wish to speak
with you.

356
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,572
What about?

357
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,907
About you.

358
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,409
You are most intriguing.

359
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,036
Ah,<i> grazie.</i>

360
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,329
And you, Signore Tuvok,

361
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,039
are equally provocative.

362
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,708
Where, exactly,
are you from?

363
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,501
Scandinavia.

364
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:31,384
So...what do the
Scandinavians think

365
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,760
of this New World?

366
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,555
It is...fascinating.

367
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,515
And you are
obviously enjoying it.

368
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,600
Beyond words.

369
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,352
Yes.

370
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,771
Italy is already
a fading memory.

371
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,607
This city is full
of mechanical marvels,

372
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,818
the countryside
alive with creatures

373
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,196
strange and wonderful.

374
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,948
I'm curious.

375
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,200
How have you spent
your time here?

376
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,539
I work...on my
inventions and my art,

377
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,167
and I accompany
the prince

378
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,879
when he goes to visit
his great fortresses.

379
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,297
Well, this fascinating
conversation...

380
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,468
has left me as dry as Vulcan.

381
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,136
Vulcan?

382
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,014
An island off Sicily.
Have you been there?

383
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,640
No.

384
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,100
Pity.

385
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,529
We'll talk later.

386
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,406
Good evening.

387
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,324
And to you.

388
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,827
Enjoying yourself?

389
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,079
Not yet.

390
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,329
No?

391
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,957
How can I change that?

392
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,374
By having exactly what I want,

393
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,376
and selling it to me
at a low price.

394
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,130
The former's quite likely,
but as for the latter,

395
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,008
I don't sell
inexpensive merchandise.

396
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,385
I have a client
who runs a colony

397
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,345
about 20 parsecs from here.

398
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,389
His computer is outmoded,

399
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,434
so I'm...looking
for a replacement.

400
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:08,355
A computer that could coordinate
the systems of an entire colony.

401
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,732
That's no small order.

402
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,317
But I think
I might have something

403
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,610
that will interest you.

404
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,747
Hello, Computer,
and how are you today?

405
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,334
COMPUTER:
<i>All systems are functioning</i>
<i>within normal parameters.</i>

406
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:32,588
Verbal interface.
Impressive.

407
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:37,176
Computer, tell us your
technical specifications.

408
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,805
<i>Simultaneous access</i>
<i>to 47 million data channels,</i>

409
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,682
<i>transluminal processing</i>

410
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,685
<i>at 575 trillion calculations</i>
<i>per nanosecond.</i>

411
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,269
Interested?

412
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,148
<i>Operational temperature margins</i>
<i>from ten degrees Kelvin</i>

413
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,316
<i>to 1,790 degrees Kelvin.</i>

414
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,193
I could sell it to you,

415
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,864
but I could hardly let it go
for anything less than...

416
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,532
a warship.

417
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,495
Or we could find something else
in your price range.

418
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,676
JANEWAY:
We should be looking
for a stronghold

419
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,094
or storage facility,

420
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,139
anyplace Tau might keep
the stolen technology.

421
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,141
There are
several possibilities,

422
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,144
all within a ten-kilometer
radius of the city.

423
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:32,982
I must admit, your Mr. da Vinci
is an astute observer of nature.

424
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,650
These maps
couldn't be improved upon

425
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,610
by<i> Voyager's</i>
topographical computer.

426
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,031
He was a Renaissance man, Tuvok.

427
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:44,785
Interpreted, reinterpreted,
deconstructed, fantasized about

428
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,495
all through history.

429
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,372
Vasari thought he was an angel.

430
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,623
Freud thought he had

431
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,167
a problem
with his mother.

432
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,169
James T. Kirk
claimed he met him,

433
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,129
although the evidence
is less than conclusive.

434
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,547
DA VINCI:<i> </i>
<i>Buon giorno, amici.</i>

435
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,049
Good morning, Maestro.

436
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,341
Did you sleep well?

437
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,843
Too well, I'm afraid.

438
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,097
My apologies, Catarina.

439
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,347
The morning is half gone.

440
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,349
Nevertheless, the images

441
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,310
that come before the eyes
upon awakening

442
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,146
can be inspiring.

443
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,525
( chuckling )

444
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,487
Indeed.

445
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,449
Catarina, where did I leave
my silver-tip pen?

446
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,784
I could swear
it was here on the--

447
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,121
Captain, we should
return to<i> Voyager.</i>

448
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,082
With my tricorder readings
and Leonardo's maps,

449
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,500
we can use the ship's sensors
to triangulate

450
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,294
the exact location
of our processor.

451
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,965
We'll work
on two fronts.

452
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,549
You go back to the ship.

453
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,010
I'll stay on the surface and
keep working with Leonardo.

454
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,178
He has access to Tau,

455
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,596
and he knows
the territory.

456
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,889
Inadvisable.

457
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,892
Charming as your
childhood hero may be,

458
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,478
the program was not designed
for use outside the holodeck.

459
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,981
This is Leonardo da Vinci
we're talking about.

460
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,524
Simulation or not,
he's one of the greatest

461
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,485
creative minds
in Earth's history.

462
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,196
The program reproduces
the entire range

463
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,032
of da Vinci's behavior,
his genius,

464
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,367
and his notorious
unreliability.

465
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,453
We have an
opportunity here...

466
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,000
and I want
to take advantage of it.

467
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,258
Tuvok to<i> Voyager.</i>

468
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,592
One to beam up.

469
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,311
...table.

470
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,520
Where did he go?

471
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,189
Back to the ship.

472
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,940
The ship?

473
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,359
You mean, the Portuguese
are still in the harbor?

474
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,240
Well...not exactly...
but they're nearby.

475
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,492
Ah.

476
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,662
Mad sea dogs, the Portuguese.

477
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,715
So, what's new?

478
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,217
New?

479
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,843
What's been happening
on the ship?

480
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,094
Nothing of consequence.

481
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,386
The Captain and Tuvok

482
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,223
are still searching
for the processor.

483
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,308
What's the mood?

484
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,434
If you're referring
to the crew morale,

485
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,063
they seem focused
on their mission.

486
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,316
Hmm. I heard there was
something of a fuss

487
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,525
in the Mess Hall
last night.

488
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,110
A trivial
misunderstanding.

489
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,611
Oh?

490
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,448
Well, you seem
in excellent health.

491
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,117
Most of your implants
are stable,

492
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,453
but your optical interface
is misaligned again.

493
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:37,541
I told you to come in
for maintenance once a week.

494
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:42,504
So...what happened
in the Mess Hall?

495
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,260
Lieutenant Torres
and I were working

496
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,594
on some astrometric data.

497
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,970
There was
a disagreement.

498
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,890
I understand things got
a little...heated.

499
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,017
Lieutenant Torres
became emotional.

500
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,894
She chose to
display hostility

501
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,812
rather than to counter
my argument.

502
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,564
What did she say exactly?

503
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,815
It is irrelevant.

504
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,650
Suffice it to say,
I was correct.

505
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,818
She was not.

506
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,988
Details, Seven,
I want specifics.

507
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,531
I see no reason
to discuss

508
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,075
these trivialities.

509
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,327
Without my mobile emitter,
I am a prisoner in here.

510
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,121
I need to know
what is going on

511
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,123
beyond these walls,
trivial or not.

512
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,875
( sighing )

513
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,336
Torres referred to me
as an automaton.

514
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,629
She also employed

515
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,424
a series of profane
Klingon insults.

516
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,508
Shall I translate
them for you?

517
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,676
By all means.
I very much--

518
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,511
TUVOK:
<i>Tuvok to Seven of Nine.</i>

519
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,680
<i>Report to the Astrometrics Lab.</i>

520
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,100
You may go.

521
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,559
I'll be right
there, Commander.

522
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,353
Come back whenever you feel
like talking.

523
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,149
I'll be right here...
all by myself.

524
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,238
I am entering
Leonardo's maps,

525
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,116
and my tricorder data
into the imaging system.

526
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,491
I will create
a search pattern

527
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,994
for our missing processor.

528
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,578
Da Vinci has
accurately rendered

529
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,080
the topographical detail.

530
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,041
However, his coordinate
axes are pre-Cartesian.

531
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,668
You will have
to convert them.

532
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,961
Understood.

533
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,922
It is puzzling that even

534
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,049
a Vulcan would refer
to a holographic character

535
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,218
by name, as if it were alive.

536
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,014
It seems somehow...illogical.

537
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,186
Localizing grid.

538
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,314
Altitude,
20 kilometers.

539
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,815
One of these
storage facilities

540
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,524
undoubtedly contains
the processor.

541
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,611
Increase sensor resolution
to maximum and scan the area.

542
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,991
There.

543
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,660
Our computer processor
is inside this structure.

544
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,954
Unfortunately, the building

545
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,789
is surrounded
by a dispersion field.

546
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,624
Transport will be impossible.

547
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,918
If the captain can get
inside the facility

548
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,297
and reach the processor itself,
she may be able to assist us.

549
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:52,426
If she were to initiate
a power surge in the processor,

550
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,388
it might produce a signal strong
enough for us to lock onto.

551
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,515
That is what I
was referring to.

552
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,433
I will inform
the captain.

553
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,112
It's not too far,
across open country.

554
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,657
Leonardo says he's been there,
and he can help me get inside.

555
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,117
TUVOK:
<i>Understood.</i>

556
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,536
Stand by for my signal.

557
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,912
If I can find the processor,

558
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,621
be prepared
to beam it back to<i> Voyager.</i>

559
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,375
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>
<i>Tuvok out.</i>

560
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,128
So it's Captain?

561
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,882
I see you and my hologram
are old friends.

562
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,529
My engineers have
developed a defense

563
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,197
against
your transporter,

564
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,075
so I suggest you return
what you took from us,

565
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,493
and let me go.

566
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,911
Or what?

567
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,496
You're in no position
to bargain.

568
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,582
The only ones who will
bargain will be your crew

569
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,916
and it'll cost them

570
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,752
a great deal to get
their Captain back.

571
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,670
I wonder what you're
worth to them...

572
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,089
( groans )

573
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,134
He'll be fine.

574
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,510
Let's move.

575
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,677
I'm not going.

576
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,971
You said
you'd help me.

577
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,389
I have already
gone too far.

578
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,808
He was threatening you,
I had no alternative.

579
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,851
But I must be here when
he recovers his senses.

580
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,312
I will try to explain.

581
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,397
Maybe, if I am lucky,
he will not have me executed.

582
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,689
We are leaving.

583
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,899
Your time here is over.

584
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,192
I will not leave
this New World!

585
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,986
Your New World
is a prison.

586
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,237
You are under
his control.

587
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,572
When are we not
in prison?

588
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,864
Hmm?

589
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,825
When are our lives free
from the influence

590
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,701
of those who have
more power than us?

591
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:48,542
If this New World is a cage,
than it is a cage of gold,

592
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,960
of marvels...

593
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,171
of opportunities.

594
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,550
If this prince is violent,
violence can be tempered.

595
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,636
But you can't stay
here forever, Leonardo.

596
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,262
Europe is your home.

597
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,764
Europe is despicable.

598
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,310
Here I am free to do
what I wish,

599
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,062
free from judgment,
free to fail,

600
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,065
without a sense
of shame, without...

601
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,234
without the taunts
of the ignorant.

602
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,945
Leonardo, whether you want
to admit it or not,

603
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,406
they do need you back home.

604
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,493
In Florence, Milan, Avignon,

605
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,829
they need your genius,
they need your heart,

606
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,165
and right now
I need you too.

607
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,458
So come on.

608
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,548
I will not go...

609
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:39,343
for Florence or Milan
or Avignon...

610
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,222
but for you, Catarina...

611
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,394
for you, I will go.

612
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,322
I've lost the Captain's
combadge signature.

613
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,491
Scan for the holo-emitter.

614
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,414
It's 4.7 kilometers
outside the city.

615
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,873
So Leonardo's
on the move.

616
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,375
Is the Captain with him?

617
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,252
Her combadge may have
malfunctioned.

618
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,753
Or she might have been
discovered.

619
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,589
Should I beam da Vinci
back to the ship?

620
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,923
If the Captain is with him

621
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,799
and attempting to recover
the processor,

622
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,134
she may need his assistance.

623
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,803
Keep a lock
on the mobile emitter,

624
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,930
and stand by.

625
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,348
KIM:
Aye, sir.

626
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,520
JANEWAY:
Where's the entrance?

627
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,854
DA VINCI:
I can't recall.

628
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,106
Why not?

629
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,399
These fortresses,

630
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,734
I've been to half
a dozen of them.

631
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,569
All are similar,
but each is different.

632
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,096
Catarina,

633
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,098
observe the construction,

634
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,392
like the veins and arteries
of a great animal.

635
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,644
Now, this is
the way to build,

636
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,978
using nature
as your guide.

637
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,187
No more lessons.

638
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,564
I need to get into

639
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,441
this building and I need
to get into it now.

640
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,734
That is not the way

641
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,694
an apprentice should address
her master.

642
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:27,117
Maestro, your prince is
going to come after us.

643
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,035
The only escape
is inside.

644
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,287
Escape?

645
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,331
We will be trapped inside.

646
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,958
No. There is a wondrous
invention inside this building.

647
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,169
It's called
a computer processor.

648
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,296
We can use to send
a beacon to...

649
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,256
to the Portuguese ship.

650
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,049
And they'll come
and rescue us.

651
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,635
Computer?

652
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:47,053
This invention,
how does it work?

653
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,597
Well, it's complicated...

654
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,931
but trust me when I say

655
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,975
it can send messages
over great distances.

656
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,311
All we have to do is find it
and we will be rescued.

657
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,022
But the question is,
how do we get inside?

658
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,446
Shadow and sunlight.

659
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,200
Shadow and sunlight.

660
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,080
The prince, like
any other thief,

661
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,167
will fear theft
above all else.

662
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,086
So this stronghold will
have but one entryway,

663
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,715
on the side facing
away from the sun.

664
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,174
So the bright light

665
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,218
would be in the eyes of
anyone who might attack.

666
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,261
<i>Esatto.</i>

667
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,812
Hmm...

668
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:40,148
I'm no longer reading
the mobile emitter.

669
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,650
They've gone inside
the structure.

670
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,026
KIM:
Commander,

671
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,236
they are being pursued.

672
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,571
Over 30 armed guards

673
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,406
are converging on
the storage facility.

674
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,449
All available power
to the transporters.

675
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,368
Let's try to get them
out of there.

676
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,830
DA VINCI:
Even Theseus could not
negotiate this labyrinth.

677
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,289
JANEWAY:
Not without a compass.

678
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,541
( tricorder beeping )

679
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,334
Your compass
is speaking to you.

680
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,087
This way.

681
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,422
( distant clanging )

682
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,400
A trove of invention.

683
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,365
The prince has done
well for himself.

684
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,201
Phasers...

685
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,370
warp plasma injectors...

686
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,247
a site-to-site transporter.

687
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,254
Your computer?

688
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,547
Yes.

689
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,677
Computer, do you recognize
my voice?

690
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,053
COMPUTER:
<i>Affirmative.</i>

691
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,806
Well, that's a start.

692
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,265
<i>Che bella!</i>

693
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,309
There's a
mechanical woman inside.

694
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,102
In a way, yes.

695
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,814
Initiate a level-4
induction relay overload.

696
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,274
<i>That procedure</i>
<i>is not recommended.</i>

697
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,819
Command override,
Janeway-pi-one-one-zero.

698
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,280
<i>Authorization confirmed.</i>
<i>Initiating overload.</i>

699
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,284
That's it.

700
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,535
And now?

701
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,370
We wait for
the Portuguese.

702
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,498
TUVOK:
Commander, I'm detecting
a power surge

703
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,082
in the subspace
frequency range.

704
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,334
It could be the processor.

705
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,543
Lock on.

706
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,378
Increase power
to the confinement beam.

707
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,546
With any luck,

708
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,089
we might be able
to pull the Captain

709
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,424
out of there along with it.

710
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,763
( power surging )

711
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,933
Step close, Leonardo.

712
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,184
We're going
for a ride.

713
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,519
I don't understand.

714
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,938
Trust me.

715
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,089
The building is probably
surrounded by now.

716
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,424
There's only one way out.

717
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,680
Maestro, come here.

718
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,683
Catarina,
what just happened to me?

719
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,352
I was shot...yet I live.

720
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,646
Such things are not possible.

721
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,197
This is an invention
from another land.

722
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,700
It's called
a site-to-site transporter.

723
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,035
In the blink of an eye,

724
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,203
it can move us
out of this building,

725
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,205
and a few kilometers
away from here.

726
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,707
How?

727
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,792
Come on.

728
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,428
I must have
an explanation.

729
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,057
Leonardo,
you've always said

730
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,975
that it's
a poor apprentice

731
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,769
who can't surpass
her master.

732
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,646
There are things
in this world

733
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,733
that I understand,
and you don't.

734
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:13,779
( rapid beeping )

735
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,076
<i>Madonna mia.</i>

736
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,583
The processor is on board.

737
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,293
The Captain?

738
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,753
Still on the planet.

739
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,296
KIM:
Commander.

740
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,425
Thirteen vessels are
approaching<i> Voyager</i>

741
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,676
from the surface.

742
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,053
Tom, take us
into a higher orbit.

743
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,262
Bridge
to Torres.

744
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,639
I want that
processor

745
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,848
back on line.

746
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,391
We've still got
a Captain down there.

747
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,143
TORRES:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

748
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,569
DA VINCI:
I cannot believe it.

749
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,071
I will not believe it.

750
00:35:56,071 --> 00:36:00,117
My mind cannot accept
the evidence of my eyes.

751
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,410
Is this sorcery?
Are we in purgatory?

752
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,162
JANEWAY:
Neither.
You said yourself

753
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,497
this place was full
of marvels.

754
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,833
Marvels, yes,
but this is magic,

755
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,751
enchantment,
not science.

756
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,295
And I refuse to believe
in enchantment.

757
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,339
I'll explain later.
We've got to keep moving.

758
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,632
No!

759
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,385
I must understand.

760
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,805
Catarina...

761
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,432
to see objects disappear
into thin air...

762
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,103
to see lightning
pass through my body...

763
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,273
Are we spirits?

764
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,360
Catarina...am I dead?

765
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,445
Let me ask you something.

766
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,824
If you were something
other than a human being...

767
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,826
if you were a different
kind of animal...

768
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,077
( bird singing )

769
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:47,039
if you were a small bird,
a sparrow...

770
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,665
what would your world be like?

771
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,002
I should make my home
in a tree

772
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,503
in the branch of an elm.

773
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,631
I should hunt insects
for food,

774
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,633
straw for my nest,

775
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,927
and in the springtime,
I should sing for a companion.

776
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,429
Then you would know nothing
of the politics of Florence?

777
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,681
The cutting of marble,

778
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,932
or mathematics?

779
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,225
Of course not.

780
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,434
But why not?

781
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,103
My mind would be too small.

782
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,440
As a sparrow, your mind
would be too small

783
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,401
even with the best of teachers?

784
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,612
If Aristotle himself
were to perch on my branch,

785
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,158
and lecture till he fell off
from exhaustion...

786
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,285
still the limits of my mind

787
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,580
would prevent me
from understanding.

788
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,041
And as a man, can you accept

789
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,376
that there may be
certain realities

790
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,588
beyond the limits
of your comprehension?

791
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,467
If I could not accept that...

792
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:45,889
then I would be a fool.

793
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,224
MALE:
Spread out! You...

794
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,516
Come on.

795
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,396
Catarina, this way,
up the hill.

796
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,190
I know just
the escape.

797
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,030
Torres to Bridge.
We're in business.

798
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,033
We've got full navigation...

799
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,160
full propulsion,
and full transporters.

800
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,536
Good work B'Elanna.

801
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,080
Sensors show the
Captain and da Vinci

802
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,414
have left
the structure.

803
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,999
If we could dip
into a lower orbit,

804
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,127
I should be able to lock on
to the mobile emitter.

805
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,711
Set the confinement beam wide,

806
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,422
and prepare to transport
both of them back to the ship.

807
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,841
How close do we have to be?

808
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,843
At least 500 kilometers
from the surface.

809
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,096
Those ships will try
to block our descent.

810
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,431
Ready for some fancy flying?

811
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,849
You bet.

812
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,481
( da Vinci panting heavily )

813
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,775
<i>Momento, Catarina.</i>

814
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,237
( sighs )

815
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,698
Escape,<i> signorina,</i>
is very near.

816
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,659
I'm starting to wonder.

817
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,452
( whispers ):
Where are you, Chakotay?

818
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,746
Help me to the summit.

819
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,847
We're at 1,000 kilometers.

820
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,183
950...

821
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,018
900.

822
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:16,896
TUVOK:
The ships are
powering weapons.

823
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,857
Go to Red Alert.

824
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,239
Shields are holding.

825
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,074
Eight hundred fifty kilometers.

826
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,120
Evasive maneuvers.

827
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,831
DA VINCI:
When Petrarch climbed
Mount Verdoun,

828
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,083
and saw all Europe
below him,

829
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,545
he knew he was witnessing
the birth of a new age.

830
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,048
He was witnessing
the Renaissance,

831
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,757
the rebirth
of our world.

832
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,385
So, Catarina,
at this summit here,

833
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,554
you and I
will be reborn.

834
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,808
Reborn...with wings.

835
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,788
This could be a problem.

836
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,707
Hurry, there's
not much time.

837
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,088
Sir, they seem to be
on the edge of precipice,

838
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,964
but we're still too
high for transport.

839
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,218
You've made some
improvements.

840
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:31,012
I took your advice
after the last attempt,

841
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,972
and increased the
reach of the wings.

842
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,473
And the angle
of attack?

843
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,850
Yes, yes, that too.

844
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,395
Unfortunately, the River
Arno is quite absent.

845
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,313
This time, if we fail,

846
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,941
only the stones
will break our fall.

847
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,026
The wing is stationary,
that's good.

848
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,361
This looks like duranium alloy.

849
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,612
It should be light enough.

850
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,863
Catarina,

851
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,656
this time it will work.

852
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,284
( phaser shot )

853
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,079
Let's find out.

854
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,872
I'm reading weapons fire
on the surface

855
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,207
near the Captain's position.

856
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,209
We're running out
of time, sir.

857
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,961
Seven hundred kilometers.

858
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,546
Hold on, Kathryn,
just a few more seconds.

859
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,215
Together...up.
<i>Andiamo.</i>

860
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,178
( grunts )

861
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,315
Catarina, we're flying!

862
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,565
Like the birds!

863
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,858
Like the birds!

864
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,079
( sighs )

865
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,379
I have a fix on the Captain.

866
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,756
They are...in mid-air,

867
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,092
on what appears to be
a crude gliding apparatus.

868
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,218
Five hundred kilometers!

869
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,594
KIM:
I'm locking on.

870
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,347
Broad confinement beam.

871
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,889
Energize.

872
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,983
Got them!

873
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,567
I beamed
the whole contraption into

874
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,777
Cargo Bay 1.

875
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,529
Get us out of here, Mr. Paris.

876
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,495
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51408.3.</i>

877
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,372
<i>We're back on course</i>
<i>to the Alpha Quadrant.</i>

878
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,748
<i>With the ship's computer,</i>
<i>and the Doctor's emitter</i>

879
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,417
<i>returned to proper places,</i>

880
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,086
<i>I've set aside some time</i>
<i>to check on the Maestro.</i>

881
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,635
( door closes )

882
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,015
Leonardo, where
are you going?

883
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,392
France.

884
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,353
These Florentines
do not deserve my genius.

885
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,230
I have written
to the king of France,

886
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,732
telling him of my adventures
in the New World,

887
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:51,777
and invited him to soar with me
off the towers of his castle.

888
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,155
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

889
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,698
Why not?

890
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,950
We ourselves have tested
the design.

891
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,453
But the materials...

892
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,498
you'll never find
those metals in France.

893
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,667
No?
Then others will suffice.

894
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,254
Machines that fly
through the air!

895
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,339
Lightning flung
from one's hands!

896
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,342
Mechanical women

897
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,676
who live in boxes!

898
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,221
These things I have seen!

899
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,765
And these things
I must recreate.

900
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,350
And who knows?

901
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,436
Possibly improve upon.

902
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:27,522
Leonardo, I think
that little flight of ours

903
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,940
went to your head.

904
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,359
And my heart.

905
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,861
My oldest memory, Catarina,

906
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,740
is of a great bird
perched on my bed,

907
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,578
its feathers open towards me
as if summoning me.

908
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:46,332
Now, you yourself,
have accused me of giving up,

909
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,960
of, uh, failing to
complete my project.

910
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,253
I was trying
to encourage--

911
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,504
No, no.

912
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,755
You were right.

913
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:57,427
All my life
I have wanted to fly.

914
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:00,346
Perhaps my failure to do so

915
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:05,101
has caused my heart
to remain in flight.

916
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:08,480
Leaping from one thing
to another.

917
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,315
Never satisfied.

918
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,026
Never complete.

919
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,821
And now, that you've
actually flown?

920
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:22,785
Now, who knows what
I cannot accomplish.

921
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,498
I'd like to find out.

922
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:30,335
Give my regards
to the king of France.

923
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,185
Catarina,

924
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,895
will you walk with me
to my carriage?

925
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,356
It would be my pleasure.
