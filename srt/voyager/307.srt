00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:07,090
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 50063.2.</i>

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,844
<i>We've accepted an invitation</i>
<i>from the Nechani</i>

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,680
<i>to take a few days'</i>
<i>shore leave on their world.</i>

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,099
<i>We're enjoying the opportunity</i>
<i>to learn about their culture.</i>

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:20,604
NECHANI MALE:
This sanctuary honors
our Ancestral Spirits.

6
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,065
Their presence
is very strong here.

7
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,876
Those are brothers
of the Nechisti Order.

8
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,168
They've devoted
their lives

9
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,796
to serving
the Spirits.

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,965
Here's something
you might find interesting.

11
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,973
What do you think
this means?

12
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,599
Hard to tell.

13
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,309
A fertility
symbol, maybe?

14
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,437
Or a blessing for
good luck or wisdom.

15
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,690
Or happiness and love.

16
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,484
Do you hear something?

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,569
What?

18
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,756
Look at that.
It's beautiful.

19
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,507
It looks like a shrine.

20
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,180
Come on, sweeting,

21
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,557
we don't want to
be left behind.

22
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,308
I just want to take
a quick look.

23
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,945
Kes!

24
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,949
Kes.

25
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,491
Can you hear me?

26
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,702
Help!

27
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,037
Somebody!

28
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,538
We need help!

29
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,442
TORRES:
What happened?

30
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,071
NECHANI:
Oh, you mustn't be here.
This shrine is protected.

31
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,655
She didn't touch anything.

32
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,157
She went as far as that archway

33
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,909
and then an energy field
knocked her down.

34
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,161
Torres to<i> Voyager.</i>
We have a medical emergency.

35
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,829
Beam Kes and Neelix
directly to Sick Bay.

36
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,206
MAN:
<i>Yes, Lieutenant.</i>

37
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,129
Oh, this is most unfortunate.

38
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,090
Please, I must ask you
to leave as well.

39
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,382
We aren't going anywhere

40
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,051
until we find out
what happened to her.

41
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,803
What kind of energy
was she exposed to?

42
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,222
I-I-I have no idea.

43
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,681
This is a sacred place.

44
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,892
Only the monks truly understand
what happens here.

45
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,643
Then we'll bring
scanning equipment down

46
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,145
and investigate
for ourselves.

47
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,396
That's out of the question.

48
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,148
It would show disrespect
to the Spirits.

49
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,150
One of our crew has
been critically injured.

50
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,985
We aren't going to stand
by and do nothing.

51
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,361
There's nothing you can do.

52
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,947
She's been punished
by the Spirits.

53
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,322
She's going to die.

54
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,034
If you prevent us
from helping Kes,

55
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,494
we will hold you
directly responsible

56
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,038
for anything
that happens to her.

57
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,958
I will make a full report
to our Captain.

58
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,626
I'm sure you'll be hearing
from her.

59
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,086
I'll be happy to talk to her

60
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,545
and to do
whatever I can to help,

61
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,880
but your presence here

62
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,924
only makes
a delicate situation worse.

63
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,093
Please, leave now.

64
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,977
Her life signs are
very weak but stable.

65
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,645
It appears that her
synaptic pathways

66
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,563
have undergone
a severe neuroleptic shock,

67
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,523
which is disrupting
all cortical functions.

68
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,859
It is similar to
a comatose state,

69
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,903
but with none of the usual
biochemical markers.

70
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,238
You can cure her,
can't you?

71
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,864
I can't even speculate
on a treatment

72
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,033
until I know more about
what caused her condition.

73
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,618
We're working on that.

74
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,912
We aren't allowed near the area
the accident occurred.

75
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,456
but Kim and Torres are scanning
the sanctuary from<i> Voyager.</i>

76
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,208
They'll report
their findings to you.

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,460
And I have an appointment
to talk to the magistrate.

78
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,296
I'm hoping he'll be able
to cut through some

79
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,089
of the restrictions
the monks have set up.

80
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,675
MAGISTRATE:
Excuse me, Captain...

81
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,927
I'd like to do
something to help.

82
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,806
The Nechani must have records.

83
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,433
Some kind of scientific data
on this energy field.

84
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,936
Go down to the planet
and see what you can find.

85
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,774
I'll be back soon.

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,779
Please understand, Captain,

87
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm caught in a most
difficult situation.

88
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,533
I'm an official
of the government

89
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,784
not a spiritual leader.

90
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,077
I don't pretend
to understand

91
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,537
why the Spirits do
what they do.

92
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,539
Then perhaps I could
talk with the brothers.

93
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,041
I've asked
the Nechisti Council

94
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,416
to give you an audience,

95
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,377
but I'm afraid they consider
the matter closed.

96
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:22,381
They've asked me to express
their sympathies for your loss.

97
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,383
There is no loss
at this point.

98
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,136
Kes is still alive.

99
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,762
Surely, there's some
way to treat her.

100
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,598
Can't you insist that
the monks meet with me?

101
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,726
We have an agreement
with the Council.

102
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,853
They don't involve
themselves with government

103
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,105
and we don't interfere
in their spiritual matters.

104
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,733
It's been that way for
centuries and it's always

105
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,901
worked well for us.

106
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,694
Then can you tell me
what you do know

107
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,779
about the sanctuary
and what happens there?

108
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,657
I'll try.

109
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,662
That particular shrine
is where the monks go

110
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,082
to receive the gift
of purification--

111
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,291
cleansing of the soul.

112
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,959
It is one of our
most holy places.

113
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,670
You mean the monks can enter it
without being harmed?

114
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,131
They prepare themselves
with a sacred ritual

115
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,800
during which they speak directly
with the Ancestral Spirits.

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,136
After that, they are able
to enter the shrine safely.

117
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,679
What happens in that ritual?

118
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,015
How does it offer protection
against the energy field?

119
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,768
Captain, you seem to want
explanations for everything.

120
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,144
I don't have them.

121
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,188
Only the brothers who've
gone through the ritual

122
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,691
know what happens there,
and they're sworn to secrecy.

123
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,945
The energy field
that Kes encountered--

124
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,571
is there anyone
who could give me

125
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,116
scientific information
that would help us analyze it?

126
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,994
All we know is that it is a
naturally occurring phenomenon.

127
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,496
If you're telling me...

128
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,625
that there's nothing
you can do to help Kes,

129
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,252
I simply won't accept that.

130
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,045
If I could help you, I would.

131
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,380
I swear it.

132
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,550
I blame myself.

133
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,094
If I'd watched more carefully,

134
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,179
seen that she was approaching
the shrine...

135
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,850
There's nothing more
to be done now.

136
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,603
You have our sympathy.

137
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,861
Have Kim and Torres
given you a report?

138
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,572
Yes. I received
a fascinating lesson

139
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,492
in the challenges of getting
clear scanner readings

140
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,494
through solid rock.

141
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,579
We were eventually able
to distinguish

142
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,458
an intense biogenic field
at the site of Kes's accident.

143
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,210
That would certainly explain
the neuroleptic shock.

144
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,212
She was lucky not to have
been killed instantly.

145
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,922
As I understand it,
the Nechani monks

146
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,591
are able to enter the field
without being harmed at all.

147
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,386
Really? I don't expect
they'd care to tell us how?

148
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,429
No, they wouldn't.

149
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,596
(<i> door opens</i> )

150
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,024
She's not responding
to conventional treatments

151
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,818
and frankly, I'm running out of
unconventional ideas as well.

152
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,695
The level of activity
in her brain is so low,

153
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,280
I can't rule out
the possibility

154
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,700
of permanent damage,
even if I<i> can</i> revive her.

155
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,827
The longer she stays
in this condition,

156
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,579
the less likely it is
she'll ever recover.

157
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,005
How is she?

158
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,299
I'm afraid there's
been no change.

159
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,388
I've researched
everything I could find

160
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,014
about the sacred shrine.

161
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,309
I didn't uncover
much scientific evidence,

162
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,269
but there was one story--

163
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,190
it was in a very old text,
I'm not sure how reliable--

164
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,650
about a boy who recovered
from a condition like Kes's.

165
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,819
He was a young prince.

166
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,531
He wandered into
the shrine accidentally

167
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,074
and he went into
a death sleep.

168
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,494
Everyone said it was
the will of the Spirits.

169
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:42,582
His father, King Nevad,
refused to accept that,

170
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,167
so he went through
the ritual

171
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,836
to seek an audience
with the Spirits

172
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,423
and he pleaded
for his son's life.

173
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,092
The Spirits,
in their infinite mercy,

174
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,010
granted his request.

175
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,430
That was the only trace
of hope that I could find.

176
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,726
Maybe it's enough.

177
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,396
<i>Well, you've certainly done</i>
<i>your research, Captain.</i>

178
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,357
<i>I'm familiar with the story.</i>
<i>I heard it as a child.</i>

179
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,068
It suggests that there's
still a chance for Kes.

180
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,695
MAGISTRATE:
<i>You're talking</i>
<i>about a very specific case.</i>

181
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,656
<i>Nevad was able to claim</i>
<i>responsibility for the prince,</i>

182
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,242
<i>as a father and as a king.</i>

183
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,370
<i>That's why the Spirits</i>
<i>were willing to listen to him.</i>

184
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,913
The Captain of a starship

185
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:25,083
is fully responsible
for every member of her crew.

186
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,209
(<i> sighs</i> )

187
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,086
<i>So she is.</i>

188
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,046
Then on that basis,

189
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,799
I'd like to go through
the ritual myself.

190
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,518
I haven't heard
from the magistrate yet,

191
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,853
but he seemed to think
there was a strong possibility

192
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,981
the monks would let me
go through the ritual.

193
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,316
Captain, forgive me,

194
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,235
but you've never been
one to put much trust

195
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,945
in religious ceremonies.

196
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,030
Exactly what is it
you hope to accomplish?

197
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,824
If you're asking
whether I expect to speak

198
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,118
to the Ancestral Spirits--
no, of course not.

199
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,078
But something happens
to the monks

200
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,538
when they go through the ritual,

201
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,832
something that allows them
to withstand the effects

202
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,292
of the biogenic field.

203
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,668
I want to find out what that is.

204
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,337
It might provide clues
to a treatment.

205
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,255
Some kind of physiological
change, maybe.

206
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,007
That's what I'm guessing.

207
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,802
The shamans of the Karis Tribe
on Delios VII practice a ritual

208
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,514
that increases the electrical
resistance of their skin.

209
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,390
It protects them
from plasma discharges

210
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,850
in their sacred caves.

211
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,685
Something similar must happen
during this ritual.

212
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,480
We'll have to find a way
to allow the doctor

213
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,315
to monitor
your physical condition,

214
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,067
and you should have a way to
call for an emergency beam-out

215
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,445
if you need it,
as a precaution.

216
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,905
We don't have any idea
what the ritual entails.

217
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,992
I've been reviewing the
Federation's cultural database.

218
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,203
Most traditional
spirit quest ceremonies

219
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,079
involve some kind
of physical challenge

220
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,414
or a test of endurance--

221
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,543
to prove the mastery
of spirit over body.

222
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,337
My instinct tells me
this one will be similar.

223
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,465
A series of ordeals that will
result in biochemical changes.

224
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,009
Of course, there's always
the possibility

225
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,595
that the Ancestral Spirits
really<i> do</i> control

226
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,472
what happens
in the shrine.

227
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,433
To each his own, Commander.

228
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,769
But I imagine if we
scratched deep enough,

229
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,106
we'd find a scientific basis
for most religious doctrines.

230
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,442
I remember when my mother
taught me about the science

231
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,027
underlying the vision quest.

232
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,697
In a way I felt... disappointed.

233
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,657
Some of the mystery was gone.

234
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,160
Maybe the Nechani have chosen
not to lose the mystery.

235
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,828
Under other circumstances,

236
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,248
I'd be more than happy
to go along with their choice.

237
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,791
Right now, it's killing
one of my crew.

238
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,877
KIM:
<i>Bridge to the Captain.</i>

239
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,003
Janeway here.

240
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,754
<i>You have</i>
<i>an incoming transmission</i>

241
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,173
<i>from the magistrate.</i>

242
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,800
Put it through
to Chakotay's office.

243
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,135
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

244
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,806
<i>I must congratulate you,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

245
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,601
<i>Your creative approach</i>
<i>to this problem</i>

246
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,352
<i>has fascinated</i>
<i>the Nechisti Council.</i>

247
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,978
Then they've approved
my request?

248
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,564
<i>Eagerly.</i>

249
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,899
<i>They consider it an honor</i>
<i>that you want to seek</i>

250
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,484
<i>the Spirits.</i>

251
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,070
<i>The ritual traditionally</i>
<i>begins at sunset.</i>

252
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,198
<i>A guide will meet you at</i>
<i>the entrance to the sanctuary.</i>

253
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,451
Thank you.
I appreciate your efforts.

254
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:09,163
<i>I have been greatly troubled</i>
<i>by your misfortune, Captain.</i>

255
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,083
<i>If you are able</i>
<i>to convince the Spirits</i>

256
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,212
<i>to spare your friend,</i>
<i>no one would be happier than I.</i>

257
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,053
<i>Everything seems to be working.</i>

258
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,556
<i>The subdermal bioprobe</i>
<i>will transmit any changes</i>

259
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,766
<i>in your biochemistry.</i>

260
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,142
KIM:
And, Captain,

261
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,060
the implant also
contains a homing beacon,

262
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,479
which we'll be able to pick up

263
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,314
no matter how far into the
sanctuary you go.

264
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,814
Just tap it
like a combadge,

265
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,567
and we'll transport
you immediately.

266
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,693
Thank you both.

267
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,828
I don't think
that will be necessary.

268
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,289
It is standard procedure

269
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,207
to carry arms
on an away mission,

270
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,335
particularly when you
don't know what to expect.

271
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,212
This is strictly an
information-gathering mission.

272
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,838
I don't want to appear hostile.

273
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,096
Energize.

274
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,836
(<i> buzzing</i> )

275
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,641
(<i> tapping</i> )

276
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,436
(<i> chuckling</i> )

277
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,063
I don't suppose
you know anything

278
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,815
about chromodynamic lights?

279
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,025
No, not really.

280
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,943
Oh...

281
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,907
I suppose I could look at it.

282
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
They're as fussy
as<i> Tarchee</i> cats.

283
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,494
You tune them too high,
they burn out.

284
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,538
You tune them too low,
they sputter.

285
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,831
I've told the monks

286
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,041
to replace them all
with neodyne lights.

287
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,543
It would save hours
of repair work.

288
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,545
That device you've got,
what is that?

289
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,046
It's called a tricorder.

290
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,172
A tricor...

291
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,592
What exactly does
a tricorder do?

292
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,051
It's a scanning device.

293
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,803
Interesting. May I?

294
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,139
Oh. Atmospheric reading,
energy field analysis,

295
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,267
full technical database.

296
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,019
This is certainly
a convenient thing to have.

297
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,646
Oh, I didn't mean
for you to keep it.

298
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,189
I'll need that back.

299
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,108
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Ah...

300
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,317
No, you won't.

301
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,364
You're my guide.

302
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,324
Guide, advisor,
spiritual companion--

303
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,660
whatever term you prefer
is fine with me.

304
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,371
Well, why didn't you say
something earlier?

305
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,374
Shall we get started?

306
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,439
It's all right,
Kathryn.

307
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,888
Would it be breaking
any vows of secrecy now

308
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,432
to tell me what this ritual
will involve?

309
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,351
Why do you think I know?

310
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,728
Haven't you been through
this before?

311
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,855
Don't worry.

312
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,982
I'll help you
find your way.

313
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,441
Tell me--

314
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,568
have you completely
committed yourself

315
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,987
to this journey?

316
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,196
Yes.

317
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,739
You're willing
to go through

318
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,616
what the monks have
been doing for centuries

319
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,993
to help them find
the Spirits?

320
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,494
Yes.

321
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,372
So you can send
biochemical data

322
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,999
back to your ship?

323
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,959
No, it wasn't magic.

324
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,919
Our bio-scanners
detected the microprobe

325
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,379
under your skin.

326
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,381
I hope that won't be a problem.

327
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,383
Makes no difference
at all.

328
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,678
You are fond of your little
devices, aren't you?

329
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,472
They've always served me well.

330
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,391
I'm sure they have.

331
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,685
Please, come this way.

332
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,658
Who are you?

333
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,369
I'm Kathryn Janeway.

334
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,287
Is this where
the ritual begins?

335
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,957
Oh, the ritual... yes.

336
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,500
We're waiting.

337
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,335
Come, join us.

338
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,338
What exactly
are you waiting for?

339
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,425
Just... waiting.

340
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,512
How long have you been
sitting here?

341
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,890
Uh, how long has it been?

342
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,893
Why are you asking me?! I've
lost track!

343
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,770
It's been a while.

344
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,897
I know that.

345
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,523
Oh, it's been...

346
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,318
as long as we can remember.

347
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,579
Are you telling me
I have to wait a lifetime

348
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,497
before I can go
through the ritual?

349
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,042
I didn't hear anyone
say that, did you?

350
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,712
Certainly not, all we said
was that we're waiting.

351
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,506
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

352
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,217
The monks I saw
in the sanctuary were young.

353
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,011
They couldn't have waited
such a long time

354
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,554
to go through their rituals.

355
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,598
Now, she's right
about that, you know.

356
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,558
She's a smart one.

357
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,311
She thinks she is,
at any rate.

358
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,647
This is a test of some kind,
isn't it?

359
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,732
To prove my determination.

360
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,568
A test? She thinks
we're a test.

361
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,612
What is she
talking about?

362
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,905
She must like tests.

363
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,325
I suppose tests
make sense to her.

364
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,078
Has anyone ever tried
to open this door?

365
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,748
How many times
do we have to tell you

366
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,875
that we are waiting?!

367
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,171
My dear, why don't
you just sit down and relax?

368
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,965
You're much too tense.

369
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,634
You're welcome
to wait with us.

370
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,178
I don't want to wait. I have
a friend who's depending on me.

371
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,638
I have to go through
the ritual.

372
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,390
I wonder if she's
always this impatient!

373
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,392
Oh, she's just
determined.

374
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,895
She wants to get on with it.

375
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,397
Seems to me, she
could be friendly

376
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,399
and sit for
a few minutes.

377
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,277
No, no. She knows
what she wants to do.

378
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,571
She's not the kind
to sit around

379
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,158
when she has a mission
to accomplish.

380
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,705
(<i> sighs</i> )

381
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,748
I told you.

382
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,917
I told you
it was locked.

383
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,883
(<i> banging on door</i> )

384
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,136
Yes?

385
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,598
I mean no disrespect.

386
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,975
But unless
there's something

387
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,894
I'm supposed
to accomplish here,

388
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,604
I'd like to continue
with the ritual.

389
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,106
By all means.

390
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,245
I'm not sure
how to begin.

391
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,789
Do you want me to give
you orders, Captain?

392
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,124
I'll do whatever
you ask of me.

393
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,458
I see.

394
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,044
So you think that
this is just a matter 

395
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,545
of doing what
you're told.

396
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,131
No, I'm sure there is
spiritual significance

397
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,133
behind the challenges
involved.

398
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,928
Challenges?
That's what you expect.

399
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,304
I don't have any idea
what to expect.

400
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,557
I've studied a number
of ritualistic societies

401
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,392
and many of the rites
have commonalities.

402
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,561
This one may be
completely different.

403
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,064
I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary.

404
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,648
I don't doubt that.

405
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,944
But do you realize that all
of this is meaningless?

406
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,653
That the only thing
that matters

407
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,406
is finding your connection
to the Spirits?

408
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,992
I'm going to make
every effort to do that,

409
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,412
but I didn't come here
for personal enlightenment.

410
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,998
I'm trying to save
a member of my crew.

411
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,167
That's a worthy cause.

412
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,502
I hope the Spirits
listen to you.

413
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,421
Then let's begin.

414
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,802
The first challenge.

415
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,262
Stand like this.

416
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,975
Hold that.

417
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,601
Mmm.

418
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,686
Now...

419
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,648
what do you see
in your hands?

420
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:02,155
I see... a stone.

421
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,824
Keep looking.

422
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,372
DOCTOR:
Her respiration and pulse
have remained steady.

423
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,416
But there's been a gradual
buildup of lactic acid

424
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,585
in her extensor muscles
over the last hour.

425
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,254
What does that mean?
Is she in danger?

426
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,588
Not at all.

427
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,715
She's probably experiencing
light strain.

428
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,302
What you'd expect
in an endurance ritual.

429
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,387
Then there's nothing
so far

430
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,473
that would suggest
a treatment for Kes?

431
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,349
It's too early to tell.

432
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,602
I'm downloading
every iota of information

433
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,105
from the bioprobe sensors
into a physiometric program,

434
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,773
which is analyzing the data.

435
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,942
Even the smallest
physiological change

436
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,068
may prove significant.

437
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,112
We can't discount anything.

438
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,955
What do you see now?

439
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,170
I still see... a stone.

440
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,306
I guess you're not going to tell
me what I'm supposed to draw.

441
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,474
That would be too easy,
wouldn't it?

442
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,560
It's up to you--
draw whatever feels right.

443
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,145
I've never been
able to draw.

444
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,438
My sister was the artist
in the family.

445
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,815
And you were the scientist.

446
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,483
It's true.

447
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,944
When other children
were outside playing games,

448
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,155
I was doing
mathematics problems.

449
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,950
Mathematics? I can see
why you enjoyed it.

450
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,286
Solve a problem,
get an answer.

451
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,954
The answer's either
right or wrong.

452
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,831
It's very absolute.

453
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,625
I've always found that
satisfying.

454
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,127
I'm sure you did.

455
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,336
What did you see?

456
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,132
I'm not sure.

457
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,841
Describe it.

458
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,016
Aha.
What?!

459
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,435
What is it?!

460
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,644
What have you found?

461
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,354
There have been
significant increases

462
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,398
in the Captain's
respiration, neuropeptides

463
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,358
and adenosine
triphosphate levels.

464
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,651
Is that bad?

465
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,527
It certainly suggests
she's going through

466
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,155
a grueling physical
experience.

467
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,324
But it's the neuropeptides
that are interesting.

468
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,826
The saturations have risen
to quite an abnormal level.

469
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,535
Is that good or bad?

470
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,122
I can't say it's either, so far
as the Captain is concerned.

471
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,748
But it certainly seems

472
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,750
a substantial piece
of information.

473
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,961
Neuropeptide levels this high

474
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,340
could well create a natural
barrier to biogenic energy.

475
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,716
So you have something
that will help Kes.

476
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,635
Not yet, but it's
the first piece of data

477
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,054
that allows me even
to formulate a hypothesis.

478
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,265
It should be me going
through all that.

479
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,059
I was the one who let Kes
get hurt in the first place.

480
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,311
Mr. Neelix, you're wallowing.

481
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,646
I'm...
Wallowing in useless remorse.

482
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,814
I'll have to ask you to stop.

483
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,274
It's bad for the patient.

484
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,861
It's just frustrating
to be so helpless.

485
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,448
If it's any consolation,
Mr. Neelix,

486
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,451
I do understand.

487
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,749
I'm exhausted.

488
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,126
Oh, thank you.

489
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,379
Your microprobe
should be transmitting

490
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,589
all kinds of interesting
information back to the ship.

491
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,343
(<i> hissing</i> )

492
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,679
What is that?

493
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,555
It's a<i> nesset.</i>

494
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,351
They're able to travel
from this world

495
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,894
into the spirit realm.

496
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,522
They serve as gatekeepers.

497
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,232
Gatekeepers.

498
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,235
Then I'm ready to enter
the spirit realm.

499
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,404
Do you think you're ready?

500
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,616
Yes, I do.

501
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,576
Then you are.

502
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:22,289
Go ahead.
Put your hand in.

503
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,126
(<i> hissing</i> )

504
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,095
(<i> squealing</i> )

505
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,597
We can stop right now
if you like.

506
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,100
No, I'm not quitting.

507
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,106
(<i> hissing</i> )

508
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,693
(<i> sharp twang</i> )

509
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,945
(<i> gasping</i> )

510
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,825
Don't be afraid.

511
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,245
Oh... it's burning me!

512
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,288
Oh, my chest!

513
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,081
Getting tight!

514
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:07,126
(<i> panting</i> ):
Oh, oh, oh...

515
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,305
Kes:
<i>Captain?</i>

516
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,640
<i>Captain?</i>

517
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,394
Kathryn?

518
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,938
I'm dying.

519
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,232
Everyone dies
eventually.

520
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,035
It's been three days
since she had any sleep.

521
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,037
How long are we going
to let her go through this?

522
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,290
I understand your concern,
but I must point out

523
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,958
that her vital signs are stable.

524
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,960
She seems to be
in no immediate danger.

525
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,004
She's been poisoned
with some unknown toxin.

526
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,797
It may be having an effect
we can't gauge.

527
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,424
It could lie dormant
for a few days

528
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,675
and then suddenly fluctuate
and kill her in minutes.

529
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,596
You seem to be implying that
I'm not paying attention.

530
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,556
I assure you, I am
monitoring her constantly.

531
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,558
If I thought she were
in jeopardy, I would act.

532
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,977
Doctor, is there anything
which might be preventing her

533
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,854
from using the homing signal
in her implant?

534
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,856
Not that I'm aware of.
She's fully conscious

535
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,399
and has complete motor control.

536
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,401
If she wanted to transport,
she could signal us.

537
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,487
Are you getting enough
meaningful information

538
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,489
to justify
her continuing this ordeal?

539
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,574
I am getting
some remarkable data.

540
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,618
Her entire biochemistry

541
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,912
is undergoing a series
of unique interactions. Look.

542
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,705
This amino acid
has been formed

543
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,957
as a result of the breakdown

544
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,543
of the toxin
in her bloodstream.

545
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,045
It's affecting the normal flow
of neurotransmitters

546
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,214
and very likely having
a hallucinogenic effect.

547
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,632
Is she delusional?

548
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:37,966
I think she's experiencing

549
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,885
the Nechani version
of a psychoactive drug.

550
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,720
Then is it possible
she's in no condition

551
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,055
to activate the homing signal?

552
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,682
I don't believe that's the case

553
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,642
and I strongly suspect
this biochemical change

554
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,852
is going to give us
the answers we need.

555
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,896
The toxin in her bloodstream

556
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,315
may very well be the key
to creating a treatment for Kes.

557
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,610
Commander, the decision
is ultimately yours, of course.

558
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,071
However, I believe it would
be the Captain's desire

559
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,447
to complete the ritual.

560
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,578
All right. We'll leave
her there for now.

561
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:08,539
But I'm not moving from this
monitor until she gets back.

562
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,385
Oh.

563
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,732
(<i> rustling</i> )

564
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,318
What is this?

565
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,030
An hallucination?

566
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,075
I'm only here
to serve as a voice--

567
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,662
an interpreter
for the Ancestral Spirits.

568
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,789
I see.

569
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,959
If there are
other beings here,

570
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,003
could I see them myself?

571
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,549
You mean you want proof
that we exist?

572
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,259
That would be helpful.

573
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,052
It's irrelevant.

574
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,390
I don't want to be
disrespectful.

575
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,726
I have gone through
every part of the ritual

576
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,270
that I have been asked to.

577
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,648
Everything you've gone through
is meaningless.

578
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,066
You've been told that.

579
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,276
I know.

580
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:24,364
I just want to bring this
to completion--

581
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,366
to make my request.

582
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,993
Then, by all means, do so.

583
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:39,087
I cite the story
of King Nevad as precedent.

584
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:44,468
In the same way
he pleaded for his son,

585
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:48,388
I ask that Kes
be restored to health.

586
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,184
Your request
is inconsequential.

587
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,812
You have what you need
to save her yourself.

588
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,611
Welcome back.

589
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,865
How long?

590
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,283
Does that matter?

591
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,368
Oh...

592
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,952
I'd like to know.

593
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,996
39 hours.

594
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,041
You must take care of yourself.
Your body's weak.

595
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,627
I guess the physical
conditioning programs

596
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,630
on the holodeck didn't
quite prepare me for this.

597
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,299
Has it been worthwhile?

598
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,009
I think so.

599
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,766
I was told that I had
what I needed to save Kes.

600
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,518
Then it must be true.

601
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,855
The Spirits would not
deceive you.

602
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,986
Whenever you're ready.

603
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,913
Thank you.

604
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,388
You could use a good night's
sleep and a solid meal,

605
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,474
but otherwise,
you're in good shape.

606
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,184
When can you begin
treating Kes?

607
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,686
Right away.

608
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,522
The ritual may have been arduous
for you, Captain,

609
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,441
but it was certainly worthwhile.

610
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,317
As I suspected,
the toxin was the key.

611
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,152
That's what produces
the natural immunity

612
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,446
the Nechani monks acquire

613
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,155
before they enter
the biogenic field.

614
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,867
How does that translate
into a cure for Kes?

615
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,993
I've created
a physiometric program

616
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,915
to analyze the immune mechanism
and develop a treatment regimen.

617
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,165
Then let's get started.

618
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,751
Captain,
if you'll excuse me.

619
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,961
I'm probably more useful
on the Bridge right now.

620
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,182
I'll carry out
the treatment in stages

621
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,561
to reduce the physical stress
from the metabolic changes.

622
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,771
(<i> beeping</i> )

623
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,314
What's that?
Is something wrong?

624
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,356
I don't believe so.

625
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,858
(<i> beeping continues</i> )

626
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,736
Hmm. Her electrolyte balance
is deviating,

627
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,988
but that's not entirely
unexpected.

628
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,323
It isn't.

629
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,491
Hmm...

630
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,827
What does that mean--
"hmm" what?

631
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,287
Mr. Neelix, if you keep on
pestering me with questions,

632
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,331
I won't be able to concentrate
on what I'm doing.

633
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,166
(<i> siren-like beep</i> )

634
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,417
(<i> beeping continues</i> )

635
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,002
Something<i> is</i> wrong.

636
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,255
What is it, doctor?

637
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,092
Her cardiac functions
are being disrupted.

638
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,803
I don't understand it.

639
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,558
Lectrazine should counteract
the disruptions.

640
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,936
(<i> beeping continues</i> )

641
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,521
This is baffling.

642
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,898
Her biochemical levels
are exactly what they need to be

643
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,274
to correct the damage.

644
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,860
She should be awake and alert.

645
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,861
Then why isn't she?!

646
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,445
I can't explain it.

647
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,780
Her vital signs are unstable.

648
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,282
I have to discontinue treatment.

649
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,579
I don't understand it.

650
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,625
Can't we try again?

651
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,877
It's too dangerous.

652
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,461
Do you have
any other options?

653
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,715
No. I'm sorry, Captain,

654
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:13,010
but it appears that everything
you went through...

655
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,260
was meaningless.

656
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,990
You meant what you said,
didn't you?

657
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,242
Everything I went
through was meaningless.

658
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,368
Yes.

659
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,705
I did everything
you asked of me.

660
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,583
You led me to believe that
would allow me to help Kes.

661
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,252
I haven't led you anywhere,
Kathryn.

662
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,838
You've taken me along
wherever you wanted to go.

663
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,631
This was<i> your</i> ritual.

664
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,718
You set these challenges
for yourself.

665
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,971
It's true that I came here
with certain expectations...

666
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,061
Are you saying
that you simply...

667
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,897
fulfilled<i> my</i> expectations?

668
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:10,149
You'd have settled
for nothing else.

669
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,986
I'm not ready to give up.

670
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:16,907
If there's still a way
to save Kes, I want to try.

671
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,409
You've come back
to seek the Spirits.

672
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,997
I don't know what I'm seeking.

673
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,919
Then I believe
you are ready to begin.

674
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,597
Well. Look
who's come back.

675
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,776
So, your little adventure
didn't quite work out

676
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,069
the way you'd
planned it.

677
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,321
You put yourself through
a lot of trouble

678
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,448
and for nothing, didn't you?

679
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,533
Don't feel bad.

680
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,410
You wouldn't believe
some of the things

681
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,203
people have done to themselves

682
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,998
on their way
to seek the Spirits.

683
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:09,084
So there's no real ritual
after all.

684
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,169
"Real" is such a relative term.

685
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,796
Most of the challenges in life

686
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,007
are the ones we create
for ourselves.

687
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:19,218
And you are particularly hard
on yourself, aren't you?

688
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,514
I've always been driven
to succeed.

689
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,224
Stubborn, I'd say.

690
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,810
You didn't really consider

691
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,146
sitting and waiting
with us, did you?

692
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:32,482
Well, I'm here now,
and I'm asking for your help.

693
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,484
I want to understand the purpose

694
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,696
of waiting
in this room.

695
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,866
But isn't it enough
to sit and be sociable?

696
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,160
We're good company.

697
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,038
That's what I'm supposed to do--

698
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,915
talk to the Ancestral Spirits.

699
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,042
Oh...

700
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,793
first, we were a test,

701
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,629
and now we're
the Ancestral Spirits.

702
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,716
Are you?

703
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,802
That would be nice
and quantifiable for you,

704
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,179
wouldn't it?

705
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,222
If the Spirits
were something

706
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,432
that you could see
and touch and scan

707
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,351
with your little devices.

708
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:12,355
If you can explain everything,
what's left to believe in?

709
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,026
I know it's an important part
of your religion

710
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,486
to trust the Spirits
without question,

711
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,321
but I wasn't brought up
that way.

712
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,574
It's hard for me to accept.

713
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:27,037
So much for your tolerant,
open-minded Starfleet ideals.

714
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,830
There's a difference
between respecting

715
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,832
the spiritual beliefs
of other cultures

716
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,667
and embracing them myself.

717
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,960
Fine.
Don't embrace a thing.

718
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,045
It's all
the same to us.

719
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,546
Go on back
to your ship

720
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,049
and play with your
molecular microscanner.

721
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:42,177
WOMAN:
You've tried
all that already,

722
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,721
but it didn't work,
did it?

723
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,639
Kes didn't get better.

724
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,892
No, she didn't.
Why not?

725
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,977
The doctor couldn't explain it.

726
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,771
So it's inexplicable.

727
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,690
A miraculous nonrecovery.

728
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,817
We haven't found the reason yet.

729
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,444
But of course you will.

730
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,656
You'll find all
the answers eventually

731
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,451
with enough time
and study

732
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,037
and the right
sort of tools.

733
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,873
That's what you believe,
isn't it, as a scientist?

734
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,458
Be honest.

735
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,296
Yes, that's what
I've always believed.

736
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,382
Even when her science fails
right before her eyes,

737
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,509
she still has
full confidence in it.

738
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,554
Now there's a leap of faith.

739
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,974
Unconditional trust.

740
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,642
Now that's promising.

741
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,393
All right...

742
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,437
if you're saying that science

743
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,232
won't help Kes,
what will?

744
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,566
You won't like it.

745
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,694
I'm willing to do
whatever's necessary.

746
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,114
Kill her.

747
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,741
She's as good as dead already.

748
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,201
Finish the job.

749
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,078
Give her another jolt of that--

750
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,496
what do you call it?--

751
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,956
biogenic field.

752
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,250
Oh... that would do it.

753
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,877
It would do what exactly?

754
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,337
There you go again.

755
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,048
Always looking
for a rational explanation.

756
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,341
Well, there isn't one.

757
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,970
Your orbital scans
and medical research

758
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,055
have given you the facts...

759
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:14,435
and they tell you
the biogenic field is lethal.

760
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,271
If you<i> believe</i> the facts.

761
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,982
Let all of that go, Kathryn.

762
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,734
Take Kes back into the shrine

763
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,529
and trust the Spirits
to return her soul.

764
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:31,203
The ritual I went through
was meaningless...

765
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,454
and Kes has done nothing
to prepare herself.

766
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,541
How could either of us be ready
to go through the field?

767
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:40,628
If you<i> believe</i> you're ready,
then you are.

768
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,882
There's no more to it
than that.

769
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:49,346
But if you go in with any doubt,
with any hesitation,

770
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,389
then you're<i> both</i> dead.

771
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,770
So, what are you going
to do, Captain?

772
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,274
You know I won't stand by
and watch Kes die

773
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,526
if there's anything
I can do to save her.

774
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,447
I want to believe it's possible.

775
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,412
I'm going to try.

776
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,584
<i>Janeway to Chakotay.</i>

777
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,419
Captain, we've been worried
about you.

778
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,088
<i>I'm all right.</i>

779
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,965
<i>I want you to beam Kes</i>
<i>down here to the sanctuary.</i>

780
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,176
Acknowledged.
I'll bring her down myself.

781
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,594
Chakotay to Sick Bay.

782
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,346
Doctor, prepare Kes
for transport.

783
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,680
DOCTOR:
<i>Understood.</i>

784
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,566
(<i> whoosh of active transport)</i>

785
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,115
The doctor says her life signs
are deteriorating.

786
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,284
He almost wouldn't let us
take her out of Sick Bay.

787
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,618
You've found a
way to help her.

788
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,036
Yes, I have.

789
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,956
I'm taking her back
into the biogenic field.

790
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:01,376
I hate to question you,
Captain, but why?

791
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,920
I believe it will save her life.

792
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,547
You have some new information
on the effects of the field?

793
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,633
I can't explain it to you.

794
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:13,512
Captain... you've been through
a lot in the past few days.

795
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,513
I know what I'm doing.

796
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,933
Are you sure of that?

797
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,561
There are 800 megajoules
of biogenic energy running

798
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,896
through that shrine.

799
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,357
The thoron radiation levels
are off the scale.

800
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:27,652
That's what you'd be taking
her and yourself into.

801
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,612
Why don't you take some
time to think about this

802
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,740
and let us run
a few more scans?

803
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,242
No.

804
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,036
Captain...

805
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,663
this isn't like you.

806
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,040
You know you'll always have
my gratitude

807
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,251
for everything you've done
to save Kes,

808
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,171
but I couldn't--
and I know she couldn't--

809
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,547
ask you to risk your own life
like this.

810
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,508
There are too many other people
who need you.

811
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,177
He's right.

812
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,595
It's my responsibility
to keep you safe--

813
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,764
for the crew's sake,
if not for your own.

814
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,975
I'd rather not have
to relieve you of duty,

815
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,269
but if your judgment's
been impaired in any way...

816
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,771
He can't really
do that, can he?

817
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,564
Yes, he can.

818
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,068
I suppose it might
be necessary

819
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,988
if the Captain of a ship
were really mentally impaired,

820
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,699
but you're not crazy, Kathryn.

821
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,242
You know that.

822
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,703
NEELIX:
These are the same people
who were willing

823
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,789
to let Kes die just for
disturbing their shrine.

824
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,333
Can you take their word for it

825
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,502
that you'll be
safe in there?

826
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,837
I can't give you
my word on that.

827
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,215
Nobody knows what
will happen to them

828
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,842
in the shrine
until they go in.

829
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,387
I don't know the answers...

830
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,430
but you do.

831
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,859
Captain...

832
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,777
I don't understand this.

833
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,113
Neither do I.

834
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,657
That's the challenge.

835
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,666
Kes...

836
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:55,883
(<i> sighs</i> )

837
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,636
The tricorder readings Commander
Chakotay took at the shrine

838
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,887
reveal traces of iridium ions,

839
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,556
which we could've
known about sooner

840
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,975
if we'd been permitted
to take those readings at first.

841
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,102
And iridium ions
are significant?

842
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,521
They caused a temporary
dielectric effect

843
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,022
in the outer epidermal layers,

844
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,484
which neutralized
some of the biogenic energy--

845
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:15,945
not much, but enough to make the
Captain's altered biochemistry

846
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,905
an effective defense.
Then how was I cured?

847
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,698
The metabolic treatment
I administered

848
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,701
protected you against the full
impact of exposure to the field

849
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,703
when the Captain
took you through.

850
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,333
That exposure functioned like
a natural cortical stimulator

851
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,210
and reactivated
your synaptic pathways.

852
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,837
KES:
That's fascinating, doctor.

853
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,132
Captain?

854
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,052
If there's something
about my analysis

855
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,471
you disagree with...

856
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,641
It's a perfectly sound
explanation, doctor.

857
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:48,561
Very... scientific.
