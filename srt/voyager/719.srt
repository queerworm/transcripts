1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,671
Though it was a blatant violation
of the Prime Directive,

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,882
Kirk saved the Pelosians
from extinction,

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,300
just as he had the Baezians

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,886
and the Chenari,
many years earlier.

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,306
Finally, in the year 2270,

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,309
Kirk completed
his historic five-year mission,

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,437
and one of the greatest chapters
in Starfleet history

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,272
came to a close.

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,401
A new chapter began when Kirk
regained command of the Enterprise.

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,570
How many more chapters are there?

11
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,322
Thirty-four.

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,825
This was supposed to be
a 20-minute presentation.

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,161
I was trying to be thorough.

14
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,372
I-I could shorten the report.

15
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,957
That won't be necessary.

16
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,793
You obviously know
the subject matter.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,503
Congratulations, Cadet.

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,923
You have just passed
Early Starfleet History.

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,299
Thank you, Captain.

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,520
I would've failed him.

21
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,772
Kirk may have been
a lowly human,

22
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,482
but at least he had pizzazz.

23
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,359
That report made him sound
about as exciting

24
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,361
as a Vulcan funeral dirge.

25
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,946
Janeway to Security.

26
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,698
Don't bother.

27
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,950
I trapped your crew
in a temporal loop.

28
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,412
They keep experiencing the last 30 seconds
over and over.

29
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,789
Almost as monotonous
as drone boy's essay.

30
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:21,915
Who are you?

31
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,752
I know he's grown
since you last saw him, Kathy,

32
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,298
but don't tell me you can't see
the family resemblance.

33
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,592
This is my son...

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,719
Q.

35
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,164
I'm a little hurt
you didn't recognize Junior.

36
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,749
You are his godmother,
after all.

37
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,543
The last time I saw him,
he was an infant.

38
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,210
Four years ago in human time.

39
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,754
You called me "adorable."

40
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,339
You remember?

41
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,842
I may have looked like an infant,
but I was still a Q.

42
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,052
Maybe you should've picked
a better godparent.

43
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,721
I wonder if it's too late
to ask Jean-Luc.

44
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,180
What do you want, Q?

45
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,891
Oh, Junior's taking a little vacation
from the Continuum.

46
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,602
-I recommended he spend it with you.
-Why?

47
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,441
Oh, he's always been fascinated
by the old man's stories about humanity.

48
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,360
I thought it was time he had
some firsthand experience.

49
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,904
I am flattered
that you would entrust me

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,490
with your firstborn,
but I really don't have time.

51
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,326
He's as quiet as a Zyznian
church mouse.

52
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,078
You'll forget he's even here.

53
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,625
[sighing]
Well, if you're going to stay,

54
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,128
we'll need to lay down
a few ground rules.

55
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,671
[laughs]

56
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,010
I make my own rules.

57
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,304
[sighs]

58
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,723
[Tuvok] I'm not detecting either Q.

59
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,433
I want to be alerted
if they resurface.

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,226
Keep running scans.

61
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,020
Scan, scan, scan.

62
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,772
That's all you people ever do.

63
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,107
I've been through every deck
on this ship,

64
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,942
and do you know
what I've seen?

65
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,570
Bipeds pushing buttons,

66
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,114
bipeds replacing relays,

67
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,116
bipeds running diagnostics.

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
When are you going to do
something interesting?

69
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,954
Say hello to Q, everyone.

70
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,334
We could fly into fluidic space

71
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,795
and fight species 8472...

72
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,422
or we could detonate
a few Omega molecules.

73
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,674
What do you say?

74
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,468
No.

75
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,722
20 minutes observing humanity.
I'm already bored.

76
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,309
I guess I'm just going
to have to amuse myself.

77
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,144
<i>Torres to the Captain.</i>

78
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,979
<i>I need you in Engineering.</i>

79
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,648
[sighs]

80
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,192
[harsh techno dance music blaring]

81
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,497
One dance, B'Elanna!

82
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,749
That's all I ask--
one dance.

83
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,262
If he doesn't stop
his little light show,

84
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,805
the warp core's going to breach.

85
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,347
Relax. It's a party.

86
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,100
This party is over.

87
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,853
Get your... guests
off my ship.

88
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,688
I like you, Aunt Kathy.

89
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,482
You've got gumption,
but what you don't have

90
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,443
is unlimited control
of space, matter and time,

91
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,362
which means I give
the orders around here.

92
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,076
I could assemble
a security team

93
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,662
and attempt to take
Engineering by force.

94
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,371
We all know
that wouldn't do any good.

95
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,040
Besides, I'll bet that's exactly

96
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,334
the kind of reaction
he's hoping for.

97
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,421
He's doing everything he can
to get under our skin.

98
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,882
If we deny him the satisfaction
of a response,

99
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,968
he may become bored
and return to the Continuum.

100
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,057
[Q2] Talk about perfection.

101
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,770
If you're attempting to embarrass me,
you won't succeed.

102
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,606
I'm just observing humanity.

103
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,112
Aren't you going to scamper away,

104
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,324
make some futile attempt
to cover yourself?

105
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,759
Coffee, black.

106
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,719
[Computer]<i> Make it yourself.</i>

107
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,263
[Neelix] You can thank Q's son.

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,016
He thought the computer
needed more personality.

109
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,935
Charming.

110
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:21,149
I've been giving some thought
to the Q situation.

111
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,736
Maybe ignoring him
isn't the best solution.

112
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,238
I'm open to suggestions.

113
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,117
He may be omnipotent,

114
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,870
but he's still a young man
in need of guidance.

115
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,998
Perhaps if someone were
to approach him as a friend.

116
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,667
You think he needs a mentor.

117
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,961
-Exactly.
-Are you volunteering?

118
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,797
Well, I am good with children.

119
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,258
[chuckles]
Q is no ordinary child.

120
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,011
I'm no ordinary mentor.

121
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,355
Can I help you,
Kitchen Rat?

122
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,399
I thought you and I
could spend some time together.

123
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,859
Ha! Excellent maneuver.

124
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,236
What are you watching?

125
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,946
What's it look like?

126
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,699
It's a battle between
the Vojeans and the Wyngari.

127
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,452
We passed through that region
a few months ago.

128
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,957
They were at peace.

129
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,626
Not anymore.
Watch this.

130
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,132
You have to stop this.

131
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,050
It's not like
there's anything else to do.

132
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,177
We could play Kadis-Kot.

133
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,054
Are there explosions
in Kadis-Kot?

134
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,849
-Well, no...
-Then I'm not interested.

135
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,359
Instead of hurting people,
maybe you could help them.

136
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,655
The Wyngari are suffering
a food shortage on their world.

137
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,701
-Maybe you could use your powers to...
-You know what, Talaxian?

138
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,620
You talk too much.

139
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:02,542
[Doctor] His jaw's been fused
and his vocal cords removed.

140
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,587
I might be able to undo some
of the cosmetic damage,

141
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,923
but only Q can restore his voice.

142
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,760
Janeway to the Bridge.
Report.

143
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,929
[Q2]<i> I've got a surprise for you,</i>
<i>Captain. Come see.</i>

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,350
Q said I should pay attention

145
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,270
to how you humans
act under pressure.

146
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,945
Is this enough pressure?

147
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,750
We're venting plasma.

148
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,294
Reroute power to aft shields
and return fire.

149
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,171
You're just prolonging the inevitable.

150
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,091
We've defeated the Borg before.
We'll do it again.

151
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,926
Not this time.

152
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,304
Weapons are off-line.

153
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,597
I'm losing thrusters.

154
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,765
Shields are down.

155
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,489
We were just getting
to the good part.

156
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,576
If the Continuum's told you once,
they've told you a thousand times...

157
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,580
Don't provoke the Borg!

158
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,542
Now... I want you to give
Aunt Kathy your word,

159
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,419
-you won't do it again.
-Oh, he won't do it again,

160
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,089
because he's leaving now.

161
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,966
Excuse us, son.

162
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,885
The grownups
need a moment in private.

163
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,474
He isn't so bad,
once you get to know him.

164
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,809
He's just misunderstood.

165
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,061
He tried to kill my crew.

166
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,062
No one was hurt.

167
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,022
I-I repaired
the damage to your ship.

168
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,400
I even gave your pet Talaxian
his vocal cords back.

169
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,652
Everything's exactly as it was.

170
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,655
And how long do you think
it will take your... son

171
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,741
to come up with another way
to amuse himself?

172
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,118
Oh...

173
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,247
If you knew he was dangerous,
why did you send him here?

174
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,958
Ah, is this another lesson for humanity?

175
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,210
It's supposed to be a lesson for him.

176
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,837
Think back to my last visit.

177
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,089
I made you the offer
of a lifetime.

178
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,009
Asking me to mate with you
was hardly the offer of a lifetime.

179
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,011
If you hadn't turned me down,
I wouldn't have been forced to mate

180
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,637
-with that other Q.
-Oh, get to the point.

181
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,349
My point is, Junior was supposed
to inspire peace and compassion,

182
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,020
but instead of order,
he's brought chaos.

183
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,105
He's been starting wars
among innocent species,

184
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,482
tampering with primordial gene pools,

185
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,152
punching holes
in the fabric of space-time.

186
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,779
Where's his mother been
during all this?

187
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,615
She's been so humiliated
by his antics,

188
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,910
she's disowned him,
and she's blamed me for everything.

189
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,954
I've managed to undo
most of the damage,

190
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,831
but that wasn't good enough
for the Continuum.

191
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,626
They're hounding me to
straighten the boy out.

192
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,669
That's why I brought him here,

193
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:56,341
in hopes that your vaunted
Starfleet ideals would rub off on him.

194
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,092
Obviously, that hasn't happened.

195
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,138
You can't just dump your child on someone
and hope he learns something.

196
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,515
-I can't?
-He needs to be parented.

197
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,851
And how exactly am I
supposed to do that?

198
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,978
Q is the first child
born in the Continuum,

199
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,105
which makes me
the first parent.

200
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,358
I don't even know
where to begin.

201
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,361
You could start
by spending time with him.

202
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,695
[groans]

203
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,866
Parenthood is more than just
cleaning up your child's messes.

204
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,910
You need to set an example.

205
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,204
It's the only way he'll learn.

206
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,372
Of course.

207
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,291
Once he begins to know me better,
he'll idolize me.

208
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,043
Then he'll do anything I say.

209
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,920
Kathy.

210
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,881
You're a genius.

211
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,844
[Paris] I've made
a full sensor sweep.

212
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,973
There's no sign
of any more Borg vessels.

213
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,726
-The boy?
-He's gone.

214
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,729
[sighs]
I am going to my quarters.

215
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,357
You have the Bridge.

216
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,281
[gasps]

217
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,241
I take it back--
you're not a genius.

218
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,202
I should've known better than to take
the advice of a human.

219
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,412
Q!

220
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,080
Your brilliant plan didn't work.

221
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,623
I smothered the boy with attention,

222
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,085
spent every waking moment with him,
but things only got worse.

223
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,963
You've been gone
for less than ten minutes.

224
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,341
On your temporal plane, maybe,
but in Q time,

225
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,260
we've spent years together.

226
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,762
Now he's embarrassed
to be seen with me,

227
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,556
and it's all your fault.

228
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,765
My fault?

229
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,436
Tell me how you plan to rectify
the situation.

230
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,438
[sighs]

231
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,898
What happened after you left<i> Voyager?</i>

232
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,151
Well, Q got away from me

233
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,113
and rearranged the tectonic plates
on Bozel Prime.

234
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,364
Did you punish him?

235
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,869
Well, I tried to get him to apologize
to all 16 billion Bozelians,

236
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,163
but he got angry
and stopped talking to me.

237
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,790
So you gave in to him.

238
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,127
I told him he could shift
as many continents as he liked,

239
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,879
as long as no one got hurt.

240
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,966
You're not going to do your son
any favors by indulging him.

241
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,761
-[scoffs]
-You need to make him understand

242
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,347
that there are consequences
to his actions.

243
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,807
Consequences?

244
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,142
Hmm.

245
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,811
Kathy, I take it back.

246
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,564
You are a genius.

247
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,907
I think that's long enough.

248
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,162
What was that for?

249
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,207
What's wrong-- you didn't enjoy life
as an Oprelian amoeba?

250
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,336
No. I was shapeless and slimy.

251
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,171
The only thing to eat was paramecia.

252
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,007
-[spits]
-Sounds unpleasant.

253
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,634
I'm sure you'll do
whatever you can

254
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,095
to avoid returning
to that petri dish.

255
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,679
What are you talking about?

256
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:53,226
The Continuum and I have come
to an agreement about your future.

257
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,522
Either you become
an upstanding citizen of the cosmos,

258
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,733
or you'll be sentenced
to eternity as an amoeba.

259
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,693
How's that for consequences?

260
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,031
You'd turn your own son
into a microscopic life-form?

261
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,242
You have one week
to change your ways.

262
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,119
I suggest you make the most of it.

263
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,663
Fine.

264
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,957
I'll see you in seven days.

265
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,545
[laughing]

266
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,922
We've temporarily
relieved you of your powers,

267
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,217
to ensure that you're on
your best behavior with the Captain.

268
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,803
You're leaving me here?

269
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,306
I thought we agreed that you were
going to take a more active role.

270
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,185
I'd like to, Kathy,
but we both know

271
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,604
that you're a million times
the parent I am.

272
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,231
I'm not a parent.

273
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,400
Well, maybe not in
a biological sense,

274
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,902
but you're certainly
a mommy to this crew.

275
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,822
Just look how quickly
you housebroke that Borg drone.

276
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,866
It's taken years...

277
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,368
for Seven to become an individual.

278
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,830
You're asking me to change your son
in one week?

279
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,041
I'm sure you'll think of something.

280
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,918
What if she doesn't?

281
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,672
Then it's single-cellular city
for you, my boy.

282
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,469
I'm getting off this ship.

283
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,393
Janeway to Security.

284
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,604
What you no longer have, Q,

285
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,441
is unlimited control
of space, matter and time,

286
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,651
which means I give
the orders around here.

287
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,695
Do I make myself clear?

288
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,657
Your quarters.

289
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,249
[laughs]

290
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,335
The petri dish was less cramped.

291
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,003
Get some sleep,
you're going to need it.

292
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,379
What for?

293
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,966
I'm preparing a curriculum for you
to follow while you're here.

294
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,678
You're going to learn respect
and responsibility.

295
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,681
Don't tell me you're actually
going through with Q's plan.

296
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,351
I may not approve
of his methods,

297
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,312
but, for once, his heart
seems to be in the right place.

298
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,024
I think his desire
to help you is genuine.

299
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,320
He abandoned me on an antiquated
flying machine run by primates.

300
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,740
We primates are your only hope.

301
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,079
Seven days?

302
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,666
How hard could it be?

303
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,674
Seven of Nine will be instructing you
in spatial causality.

304
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,301
You will learn how your actions
can have widespread repercussions.

305
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,678
I read the padd.

306
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,514
You're going to tell me
how I can't create anomaly A

307
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,974
without causing phenomenon B,

308
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,352
which, in turn,
affects civilization C, right?

309
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,816
I'm Icheb.

310
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,025
Oh, I know who you are.

311
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,194
You're the drone
with the Kirk fixation.

312
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,780
You would be wise to follow
Icheb's example.

313
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,658
By applying himself, he's become
a valued member of this crew.

314
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,868
Can I see you naked again?

315
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,423
Computer,
run Diplomacy Scenario 12-Alpha.

316
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,049
[holodeck doors open]

317
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,051
[Man] The planetoid is
in Nausicaan space.

318
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,387
-It belongs to us now.
-After you.

319
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,389
Come anywhere near it,
and we'll attack you.

320
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,974
You can't intimidate us.

321
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,935
We've as much right to mine
that dilithium as you do!

322
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,980
What are you doing here, Starfleet?

323
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,691
Computer, freeze program.

324
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,652
I assume you're familiar
with these species.

325
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,530
Nausicaan, Bolian,
Cardassian, Romulan,

326
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,532
Ferengi, and Bajoran.

327
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,993
They're fighting over
the mining rights to a planetoid.

328
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,037
Your job is to settle the dispute.

329
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,248
These aliens mean nothing to me.

330
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,167
What do I care
if they can't get along?

331
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,545
One of your responsibilities as a Q

332
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,756
is to maintain order
in the universe, right?

333
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,758
So I've been told.

334
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,345
Well, if you can't help these races
come to an agreement,

335
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,638
there might be a war.

336
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,890
The Alpha Quadrant
would be thrown into chaos.

337
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,728
Why don't we try running
the first scenario together?

338
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,315
I don't need your help.

339
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,900
I can do this myself.

340
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,654
If you want to try...

341
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,322
be my guest.

342
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,241
I'll be back in 30 minutes
to check on your progress.

343
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,536
And remember--

344
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,955
Security is right outside.

345
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,671
Computer, resume program.

346
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,590
The planetoid
is in Nausicaan space.

347
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,718
-It belongs to us now.
-You can't intimidate us.

348
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,888
We have as much right to mine
that dilithium as you do.

349
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,852
Aren't you supposed to be
supervising our young guest?

350
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,063
He says he doesn't need supervision.

351
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,523
And you accepted that?

352
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,732
Of course not.

353
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,859
I'm just giving him the chance to fail.

354
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,195
Then he'll have to ask for some help.

355
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,657
Sounds like a good strategy.
Let me know how it goes.

356
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,076
[applause]

357
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,453
[indistinct conversation]

358
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,832
Settling the planetoid predicament
didn't take very long,

359
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,210
so I used the rest of the time
to convince the Cardassian

360
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,713
to apologize for
the occupation of Bajor.

361
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,090
How's that for order
in the universe?

362
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,720
Welcome. It's so nice
to see you this evening.

363
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,431
I hope you're hungry.
Step right up.

364
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,392
There's plenty for everyone.
Enjoy!

365
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,935
Do you ever stop?

366
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,063
Oh, I'm sorry.

367
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,314
I forgot.

368
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,817
My talking annoys you.

369
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,695
Too bad you can't just...
[snaps fingers]

370
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,989
...shut me up again, huh?

371
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:44,118
Crewman Biddle, where have you
been hiding yourself?

372
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,288
-I haven't seen you in days!
-If it isn't drone boy.

373
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,915
You come to put me to sleep with
another one of your presentations?

374
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,793
Actually, I was wondering
if you'd like to participate

375
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,545
in some recreational activities.

376
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,255
I don't have the time.

377
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,049
Aunt Kathy's forcing me
to write an historical essay

378
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,634
on the Q Continuum.

379
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,636
That's a challenging subject.

380
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,599
I've never written an essay before.
I don't know where to start.

381
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,894
The origin of the Q seems like
the most logical place,

382
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,439
followed by an analysis of
their interaction with humanity.

383
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,401
You could conclude with a description
of the events that led you to<i> Voyager.</i>

384
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,320
Would you mind writing
some of this down for me?

385
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,780
I'll get a padd.

386
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,329
Insightful, informative.

387
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,705
I'm impressed.

388
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,167
-Too bad you didn't write it.
-What do you mean?

389
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:37,046
I'd recognize Icheb's style anywhere.

390
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:41,592
He gave me a few notes
on my first draft, that's all.

391
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,096
I negotiated a peace treaty
between six belligerent species

392
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,681
in just 13 minutes.

393
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,850
When Commander Chakotay
left the room,

394
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:54,063
you altered their personality subroutines
to make them more agreeable.

395
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,485
We may be common bipeds,
but we're not stupid.

396
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,781
Your training is over.
Go back to your room

397
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,533
and wait for your father to return.

398
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,994
If you don't help me, the Continuum
will turn me into an amoeba.

399
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,871
I wanted to help you,

400
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,875
but instead of trying to live up
to your potential, you cheated.

401
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,254
Do you think it's easy
to live up to my potential?

402
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,258
I was supposed to be the savior
of the Q Continuum.

403
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,803
Tell me, how do you save a race
that's already omnipotent?

404
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,515
Those were the Qs' expectations,
not mine.

405
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,101
All I asked was that you make
a sincere effort,

406
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,144
but you weren't even willing to try.

407
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,188
Please, Aunt Kathy...

408
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,441
you're my only hope.

409
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,986
Well, I'm glad
you finally realize that.

410
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,699
Now, if your motives are sincere,

411
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,617
I'm willing to give you
another chance.

412
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,996
But step out of line again,
and I'm through with you, understood?

413
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,163
Understood.

414
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,623
Dismissed!

415
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,016
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54704.5.</i>

416
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,227
<i>It's been four days since</i>
<i>my ultimatum to the young Q,</i>

417
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,187
<i>and he appears to be making progress.</i>

418
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,064
<i>His instructors inform me</i>
<i>that he's taking on</i>

419
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,567
<i>his assignments</i>
<i>with new determination,</i>

420
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,653
<i>and he's made a concerted effort</i>
<i>to be more courteous to the crew.</i>

421
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,197
<i>It's hard to believe this is</i>
<i>the same brazen young man</i>

422
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,991
<i>that came aboard a few days ago.</i>

423
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,159
[Q2] Captain?

424
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,036
This is for you.

425
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,205
It's a new draft of my essay.

426
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,957
I know you didn't ask for one,

427
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,336
but I felt I owed it to you
for giving me a second chance.

428
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:45,174
"I, Q: An Insider's View
of the Continuum."

429
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,635
If the essay is half as clever
as the title,

430
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,094
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

431
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,017
Lieutenant Paris has offered
to give me a piloting lesson.

432
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,810
I thought you might like
to join us.

433
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,856
Oh, thanks, but I have to help
Crewman Chell scrub the plasma conduits.

434
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,359
I think you've earned a break.

435
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,945
This is the only time off
I'm giving you.

436
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,780
I suggest you take advantage of it.

437
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,657
Yes, ma'am.

438
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,911
[Q2] Piloting lesson, huh?
Where are we going?

439
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,211
Steady...

440
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,462
Ease up a little
on the thrusters.

441
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,426
In case you forgot,
I'm mortal now.

442
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,388
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't fly us into a rock.

443
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,683
Maybe Q could take over
for a little while.

444
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,476
What do you say?
You want a turn at the wheel?

445
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,438
Ordinarily,
a Q wouldn't demean himself

446
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,774
by operating primitive machinery,

447
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,819
but these aren't ordinary circumstances.

448
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,655
[chuckles]

449
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,281
[clears throat]

450
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,076
[alarm beeps]

451
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,828
Uh, did I do something wrong?

452
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,456
Just a little ion imbalance
in the impulse drive.

453
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,208
Nothing to worry about.

454
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,419
Well, it's very distracting.
Can't you fix it?

455
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,548
Well, I could, but we'd have to go back
to<i> Voyager</i> and run diagnostics.

456
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,718
If you two don't mind
cutting your lesson a little short.

457
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,138
That won't be necessary.

458
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,890
In fact, I barely hear it anymore.
Do you hear it?

459
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,976
-Hear what?
-[laughs]

460
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,442
-Going up?
-I'll catch the next one.

461
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,610
Hmm.

462
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,822
[sighs]

463
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,455
Oh, you can't get away
from me that easily.

464
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,539
It's only been five days.
Why are you back?

465
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,084
Oh, I thought I'd just pop in
and check on Junior.

466
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,670
I'm not an entirely
uninvolved father, you know.

467
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,173
Well, he got off
to a pretty shaky start,

468
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,549
-but he's made some progress since then.
-Really!

469
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,844
He's been working extremely hard.

470
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,180
We're talking about the same Q?

471
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,600
If you don't believe me,
maybe you should see for yourself.

472
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,812
The Continuum has been perceived
in a variety of ways--

473
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,856
a dreary desert road,

474
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,274
a blood-soaked battleground--

475
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,443
but with the help of<i> Voyager's</i> crew,

476
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,738
I've begun to perceive it
in another context-- a home.

477
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,115
I look forward to the day
when I return there

478
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,743
and make that perception
a reality.

479
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,082
Well?

480
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,458
Huh?

481
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,959
What did you think?

482
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,669
Oh, it's very nice.

483
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,213
Nice?

484
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,298
Yes, I especially liked the part
about the Continuum.

485
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,135
The entire essay
was about the Continuum.

486
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,180
Yes, and it's very nice.

487
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,516
I'm late for my
temporal mechanics lesson.

488
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,935
Q...

489
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,646
Well, if there's nothing else,
I'll be on my way.

490
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,523
He worked so hard on that paper.

491
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,983
The least you could have done
was tell him you were proud of him.

492
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,276
But I'm not.

493
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,653
[groans]

494
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,447
And frankly, it's a little hard
to be impressed

495
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,032
with any of the boy's accomplishments.

496
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,035
He's been here for five days,
and what have you taught him?

497
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,620
How to scribble essays
and play with holograms.

498
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,248
What's next, basket weaving?

499
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,999
Whether you're willing
to admit it or not,

500
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,210
your son has made progress here.
He has the potential

501
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,337
to be a better Q
than you will ever be.

502
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,257
Potential isn't going to be enough
for the Continuum.

503
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,842
Then what will be enough?

504
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,594
The boy needs to demonstrate
nothing less than...

505
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,054
exemplary Q-ness.

506
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,390
And what exactly is Q-ness?

507
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:24,893
Oh, it's impossible
for your minuscule mind to comprehend,

508
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,856
but I know Q-ness when I see it,
and this...

509
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,732
is not it.

510
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,694
[Q teleports]

511
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,741
[door chimes]

512
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,623
[sighs]

513
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,041
Come in.

514
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,713
I wanted to see how you were.

515
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,341
I'm perfectly fine.

516
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,302
Why wouldn't I be?

517
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,179
I thought you might be upset

518
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,347
by Q's reaction to your essay.

519
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,602
He's impossible to please.

520
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,896
I don't care what he thinks.

521
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,569
We have two days left.

522
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,654
Let's make the most of them.

523
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,910
Aunt Kathy...

524
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,581
do you think the Continuum will be
any more impressed with me than Q was?

525
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,419
That's what I thought.

526
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,550
If the Continuum decides
they won't take you back,

527
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,845
I'll ask them to let you stay here.

528
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,682
I don't think they care
where an amoeba spends eternity.

529
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,518
That's not what I meant.

530
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,231
I'll ask them to let you remain human.

531
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,611
I appreciate that...

532
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,948
but I don't want to be human.

533
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,952
I want to be a Q...

534
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,913
like my father.

535
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,801
[Q2] Itchy! Are you in here?
Itchy?

536
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,804
What can I do for you, Q-Ball?

537
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,555
I need your help.

538
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,853
Remember that ion imbalance

539
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,147
Lieutenant Paris mentioned
during our lesson?

540
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,857
We're going to repair it for him.

541
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,401
Did you get permission?

542
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,860
That would ruin the surprise.

543
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,946
The surprise?

544
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,365
The Captain's been encouraging me
to take more initiative.

545
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:47,035
I want to show her I can do things
for others without being asked.

546
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,955
I'll help you,
on one condition.

547
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,123
Name it.

548
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,668
You won't refer to me as "Itchy"
in front of the senior officers.

549
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,134
I've realigned the last pair
of power couplings.

550
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,886
You can start
the preignition sequence.

551
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,513
Understood.

552
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,895
I'm not detecting
any ion fluctuations.

553
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,147
We did it.

554
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,107
You can power down the engine now.

555
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,359
[engine rumbling]

556
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,070
Q?

557
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,241
What are you doing?

558
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,409
You're gonna love this.

559
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,995
I once learned how
to open a spatial flexure,

560
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,873
using nothing more
than a deflector array.

561
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,666
"Flexure"?

562
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,376
It's like a tunnel through space.

563
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,879
I'm going to open one
to the Clevari system.

564
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,423
Just wait till you see the females.
They're spectacular.

565
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,676
We need the Captain's permission
to leave<i> Voyager.</i>

566
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,553
Do you think she'd give it to us?

567
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,763
No.

568
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,848
Then there's no point in asking.

569
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,225
You've been doing so well.

570
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,852
Why break the rules now?

571
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,355
I'm bored.

572
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,231
Icheb to Security.

573
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,900
They can't hear you.

574
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,069
I've dampened
all outgoing communications.

575
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,324
Just sit back, Itchy.

576
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,951
Enjoy the ride.

577
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,171
What's the real reason
you're doing this?

578
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,800
I'm getting out of here before my father
can put me back in that petri dish.

579
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,552
The Q are omnipotent.
They'll find you.

580
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,472
I may not have my powers anymore,

581
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,809
but I know plenty of cosmic nooks
and crannies we can hide in.

582
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,646
<i>Voyager</i> has locked onto us
with a tractor beam.

583
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,689
They're so predictable.

584
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,528
They're opening some sort of
spatial rift off their port bow.

585
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,655
It's disrupting the tractor beam.

586
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,615
Compensate.

587
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,791
They're gone.

588
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,547
[sighs]

589
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,850
Welcome to the Clevari system.

590
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,727
What would you like to do first?

591
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,522
Take a dip with
the mermaids of Golos Prime?

592
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,692
Challenge the warrior goddess of Fekdar
to a grappling contest?

593
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,819
What I want is
to return to<i> Voyager.</i>

594
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,448
Forget that dreary ship,
with its rules and regulations.

595
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,575
We can do anything we want here.

596
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,243
Go back to<i> Voyager.</i>

597
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,120
Apologize to the Captain.
She'll help you.

598
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,873
It's too late.
She said one more violation,

599
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,625
I'll be thrown off her ship.
I'm pretty sure this qualifies.

600
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,378
[alarm beeping]

601
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,131
What's wrong?

602
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,091
There's a vessel approaching.

603
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,723
<i>You're trespassing</i>
<i>in Chokuzan space.</i>

604
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,057
We were just leaving.

605
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,435
<i>Our laws require</i>
<i>that you be incarcerated,</i>

606
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,729
<i>pending an investigation.</i>

607
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,355
How long will that take?

608
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,442
<i>Disengage your engines</i>
<i>and prepare to be boarded.</i>

609
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,612
We should do as he says.

610
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,865
Why, just because
he has a bigger ship?

611
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:16,161
Because Captain Janeway has taught us
to respect the laws of other cultures.

612
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,080
I should have known better
than to bring you along.

613
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,130
You're going to get us killed!

614
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,673
Did you expect me to surrender?

615
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,509
He might have
locked us up for years.

616
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,469
You don't know that.

617
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,597
There's no time for a debate.
I need you at Tactical.

618
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,146
Shields are down to 30 percent.

619
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,816
-Sixteen percent.
-I'm opening another flexure!

620
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,276
We'll go to the Zozek system.

621
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,780
The girls aren't as attractive,
but we have to make some compromises.

622
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,952
[grunting]

623
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,081
Icheb!

624
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,001
I'm detecting another rift forming...

625
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,547
approximately 5,000 kilometers
directly ahead.

626
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,131
A vessel is emerging.

627
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,634
-It's the Flyer.
-They're hailing.

628
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,594
-On screen.
<i>-Aunt Kathy...</i>

629
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,180
-Don't you "Aunt Kathy" me.
<i>-Yell at me later.</i>

630
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,015
<i>We need to get Icheb</i>
<i>to Sick Bay.</i>

631
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,940
His cells are being necrotized
by some form of omicron radiation,

632
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,609
but I can't treat his injuries
without knowing more

633
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,946
-about the weapon that caused them.
-[portal opening]

634
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,574
Is this a bad time?

635
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,866
Tell him.

636
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,162
Icheb stole a shuttle
from<i> Voyager.</i>

637
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,790
I tried to stop him,
but he kidnapped me,

638
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,250
and he started a fight
with another ship.

639
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,128
He stole the shuttle,
and he attacked the other vessel.

640
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,629
Is that true, son?

641
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,758
Please, Q, just save him.

642
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,135
Don't be absurd.

643
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,970
You're not going to help him?

644
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,723
Like Aunt Kathy said,
you're never going to learn anything

645
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,809
if you don't face the consequences
of your actions.

646
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:06,438
If your little playmate has to die
to teach you a lesson,

647
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,732
so be it.

648
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,572
I know you can hear me, Q.

649
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,492
-Come back! Q!
-You're wasting your time.

650
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,120
He's the only one
who can save Icheb.

651
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,747
No, he isn't.

652
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,585
You're going back
to that ship you attacked.

653
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,503
You're going to apologize
for what you did,

654
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,047
and you're going
to plead with them

655
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,549
for the information we need
to save Icheb.

656
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,967
Look at what they did to him.

657
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,969
If I go back,
they'll do the same to me.

658
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,304
[Doctor] What do you care?

659
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,431
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be an amoeba.

660
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,642
Well, I'd rather be an amoeba
than a corpse!

661
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,810
That would be easier,
wouldn't it?

662
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,064
No expectations to live up to.
No one to disappoint.

663
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,274
[sighs]

664
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,943
I'm a failure as a Q
and a human.

665
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,739
If I'm a single-celled organism,
at least I can't hurt anybody.

666
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,200
Why did you come back here?

667
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,911
To escape the Chokuzan.

668
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,456
You could've used your technology
to take you anywhere,

669
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,209
but you came back here to us.

670
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,543
Why?

671
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,755
I probably hit the wrong control.

672
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,800
[sighs]

673
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,386
Icheb is the only friend
I've ever had.

674
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,056
I brought him back here because
I thought you could save him.

675
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,599
Obviously, I was mistaken.

676
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,435
The only mistake you made
was running away.

677
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,397
You have a chance
to do the right thing now.

678
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,981
Don't waste it.

679
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,118
The attack on your vessel
was entirely my fault.

680
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:47,288
Icheb had nothing to do with it,
but he's the one who's dying.

681
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,291
I-I take full responsibility
for what happened.

682
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,544
I'll do anything you ask.

683
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,337
Just help my friend.

684
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:58,675
My crew and I will repair
any damage he did to your ship.

685
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,969
<i>Are you the adult</i>
<i>responsible for this child?</i>

686
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,474
I suppose I am.

687
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,726
<i>[sighs]</i>

688
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,769
<i>We'll accept his apology</i>

689
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:14,441
<i>and give you the information</i>
<i>you need to save his accomplice.</i>

690
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,946
<i>But you will be punished</i>
<i>for their crime.</i>

691
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,365
She didn't have anything
to do with it.

692
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,409
<i>In our culture,</i>
<i>adults are accountable</i>

693
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,244
<i>for the actions of their children.</i>

694
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,621
I attacked your ship.

695
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,166
I should be punished for it,
not her.

696
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,793
<i>You don't even know</i>
<i>what the punishment is.</i>

697
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,336
<i>It might be torture,</i>

698
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,796
<i>or even execution.</i>

699
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,298
I don't care,

700
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,842
if it means saving my friend.

701
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,473
<i>[laughs]</i>

702
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,725
<i>Well done, Junior.</i>

703
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,268
<i>[laughs]</i>

704
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,395
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

705
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,273
<i>Surprise!</i>

706
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,691
[laughs]

707
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,818
I wish you could see the look
on your faces.

708
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,237
Oh, wait. You can.

709
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,200
We don't have time
for your games.

710
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,035
We need to find
the real people I attacked.

711
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,495
You just did.

712
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,872
I was the Chokuzan you fired on.

713
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,541
What kind of horrible joke...?

714
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,668
Not a joke. A test.

715
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,755
I knew the pathetic little exercises
you had him performing

716
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,882
would not impress the Continuum.

717
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:25,345
So, when he escaped your clutches,
I devised a real test.

718
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,889
It was touch and go there
for a moment,

719
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,974
but you passed
with flying colors.

720
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,060
What about Icheb?

721
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,063
Your Doctor will discover
he's made a miraculous recovery.

722
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,857
Now then, if we're all
finished here,

723
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,235
it's Judgment Day for Junior.

724
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,578
We're ready, Your Honor.

725
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,541
In the case
of The Continuum vs. Q,

726
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,417
we, the Continuum, have found

727
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,795
that Q has not
made sufficient progress

728
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,714
to warrant the reinstatement
of his powers.

729
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,925
Objection.
What about my test?

730
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,969
What about it?

731
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,137
Q was willing to sacrifice himself
to save his friend.

732
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,640
Surely that counts for something.

733
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,518
It was Q who endangered
the boy's life in the first place.

734
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:19,232
However, in deference to
the aforementioned act of contrition,

735
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:23,444
the defendant will not be transformed
into an Oprelian amoeba.

736
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,779
Oh, good.

737
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,656
[Judge] Instead...

738
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,576
he will suffer
the next worst fate--

739
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,828
remaining human.

740
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,749
[booms]

741
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,294
Court is adjourned.

742
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,008
This is an outrage!
They can't do this to me!

743
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,900
-[door chimes]
-Come in.

744
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,028
Do you have a moment?

745
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,909
A few days ago, you offered
to let me remain on<i> Voyager.</i>

746
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,329
I know I've made
a few mistakes since then,

747
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,414
and you probably
don't want me around,

748
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,709
but if it's all right
with you...

749
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,337
I'd like to continue my training.

750
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,298
But you have nothing left
to prove to the Continuum.

751
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,718
But there's a lot
I still need to prove to you.

752
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,055
What about your father?

753
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,185
You don't honestly believe
we'll see him again, do you?

754
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,103
He obviously doesn't
want me around.

755
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,522
Why else would he have
left me here... twice?

756

[Q teleports]

757
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,861
The question you should be asking
is why I keep coming back.

758
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,697
Now, I'm sorry
I left so abruptly,

759
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,617
but the Continuum's verdict
demanded an immediate appeal.

760
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:57,413
I told them I refuse to belong
to any Continuum

761
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,374
that wouldn't accept my son
as a member.

762
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,292
We're a package deal.

763
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,544
You left the Continuum for me?

764
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,547
Oh, don't be ridiculous. I'm the only one
holding that place together.

765
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,008
And when they realized
they might lose me,

766
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:13,096
they crumbled like
a Gelbian sand sculpture.

767
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,056
They're going to return my powers?

768
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,474
They already have.

769
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,312
For you, Captain,

770
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,691
for all your help.

771
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,067
Thank you.

772
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,863
Now that you're a Q again,

773
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,074
I thought we might spend
some quality time together.

774
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:37,245
I want to show you the cosmos
the way it was meant to be seen.

775
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,579
We've tried that already.

776
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,082
Things will be different this time.

777
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,417
I promise.

778
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,462
Now run along.

779
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,008
I'll meet you on Golos Prime.

780
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,844
After I've had a few moments alone
with the Captain.

781
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,971
I'll see you soon,
Aunt Kathy.

782
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,931
I certainly hope so.

783
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:03,855
So, the Continuum "crumbled
like a Gelbian sand sculpture."

784
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,565
Yes.

785
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,109
Some of them even got on their knees
and begged me to stay.

786
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,779
-It was pathetic.
-[both laugh]

787
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:17,118
If you must know, I had to agree
to a few minor conditions.

788
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,953
Oh? Such as?

789
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,955
Eternal custody of the boy.

790
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,623
[clears throat]

791
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,500
Wherever the little brat goes,
I go with him.

792
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,378
I hope he won't spoil
too much of your fun.

793
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,631
[chuckles]
Oh, before I leave,

794
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,468
I did a little homework for you.

795
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:38,306
Consider it a thank you for everything
you did for Junior.

796
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,183
Not that I don't appreciate it,

797
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,478
but this will only take
a few years off our journey.

798
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,272
Why not send us all the way?

799
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:53,362
What sort of an example would I be setting
for my son if I did all the work for you?
