1
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,024
MALE:
Temporal incursion is complete.

2
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:30,113
All organisms and manmade
objects have been eradicated.

3
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,616
MALE 2:
Probe the continuum.

4
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,411
Has our target
event been achieved?

5
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,291
Negative.

6
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,669
Negative
target event.

7
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,379
I don't understand, sir.

8
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,590
We spent months making
these calculations.

9
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,011
Time is patient...

10
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,138
so we must be
patient with it.

11
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,684
Eradicating
a single Zahl colony

12
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,562
wasn't enough
for a total restoration.

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,734
We have to work
on a larger scale.

14
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,694
Take us to the Zahl homeworld.

15
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,488
Prepare a new set
of calculations.

16
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,783
We must erase
the entire species from time,

17
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,077
every life-form...

18
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,162
every molecule.

19
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,276
JANEWAY:
Space, the great unknown.

20
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,446
Only now we're going
to know it a little better.

21
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,323
Harry?

22
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,037
CHAKOTAY:
Before there were
maps and globes,

23
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,413
let alone radar
and subspace sensors,

24
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,000
mariners navigated
by the stars.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,085
We're returning to that
tried-and-true method,

26
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,795
but this time,
there's a difference.

27
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,548
Ensign Kim and
Seven of Nine

28
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,925
have merged Starfleet
and Borg ingenuity

29
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,136
to create this
new technology,

30
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,056
and I'm sure I speak
for the entire crew

31
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,808
when I say... thank you.

32
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,563
Now, how the hell
does it work?

33
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,356
( laughter )

34
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,901
SEVEN:
Astrometric sensors
measure the radiative flux

35
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,819
of up to three billion stars
simultaneously.

36
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,654
The computer
then calculates our position

37
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,740
relative to the center
of the galaxy.

38
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,826
This mapping technology
is ten times more accurate

39
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,536
than what
we've been using.

40
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,455
Seven, will you
do the honors?

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,044
We've plotted
a new course home.

42
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,337
By my estimates,
this trajectory will eliminate

43
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,090
five years from
your journey.

44
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,632
Our journey.

45
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,427
Nice work, Seven.

46
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,679
That region of space
we're about to enter,

47
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,932
it looks like it has
a lot of M-Class planets.

48
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,474
It does.

49
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:31,396
Spatial grid 005.
Primary species: the Zahl.

50
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,523
What do we know
about this species?

51
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,193
Technologically advanced
but nonconfrontational.

52
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,737
Their resistance quotient
is quite low.

53
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,114
Thank you all for coming.

54
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,949
We've got a lot
of work to do, so...

55
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,076
I'd like to say a
few words if I may.

56
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,411
I've prepared a speech
for this occasion.

57
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,789
When I was
first activated

58
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,376
on Stardate 48315,
and I found myself

59
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,963
<i>mano a mano</i>
with the Delta Quadrant,

60
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,839
I didn't think
we'd survive a week

61
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,758
let alone three years.

62
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,342
There was strife.

63
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,719
There was discord.

64
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,596
You were all at
each others' throats,

65
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,057
but over time, I've had the
pleasure and pride

66
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,392
of watching this crew
learn to work together

67
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,519
as colleagues,
even friends.

68
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,605
Here, here.
Who would have thought

69
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,983
that this eclectic group
of voyagers

70
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,944
could actually become a family?

71
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:23,364
Starfleet, Maquis, Klingon,
Talaxian, hologram, Borg,

72
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,908
even Mr. Paris.

73
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,077
Granted, we've had our share
of difficulties.

74
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,622
One might say, we've seen
the best of times

75
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,207
and the worst of times.

76
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,042
I'd now like to recount
some of those times

77
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,335
from my unique perspective.

78
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,004
Under the category
of "best of times,"

79
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,588
I invite you all to recall
the moment--

80
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,757
<i>Bridge to the Captain.</i> 
Janeway here.

81
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,135
<i>We're being hailed.</i>
<i>A vessel off the port bow.</i>

82
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,970
CHAKOTAY:
On our way.

83
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,514
Well, perhaps we could
all reconvene later.

84
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,148
They're firing
on us, Captain.

85
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,734
It's a small vessel,
15 life-forms aboard.

86
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,612
Low warp capacity,
limited armaments.

87
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,489
They pose no threat.

88
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,950
Open a channel.

89
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,702
Good day, sir.

90
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,662
Have we offended
you in some way?

91
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,290
<i>You will reverse course</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

92
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,916
<i>This region is in dispute.</i>

93
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,252
<i>You have no business</i>
<i>in Krenim space.</i>

94
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,672
I was under the impression
we were entering Zahl territory.

95
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,217
<i>The Zahl have</i>
<i>no legitimate claim here.</i>

96
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,302
<i>They have taken what is ours.</i>

97
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,597
<i>Reverse course...</i>
<i>or be destroyed.</i>

98
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,061
With all due respect,
unless you've got

99
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,230
something a little bigger
in your torpedo tubes,

100
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,065
I'm not
turning around,

101
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,649
but I'm certainly
willing to discuss

102
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,235
this issue with you.
<i>No discussion!</i>

103
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,610
<i>No compromise!</i>

104
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,156
They are in retreat.

105
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,033
His bark's obviously worse
than his bite.

106
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,451
He seems rather intent. Let's go
to Yellow Alert.

107
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,120
Maintain our course.

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,749
Maybe the Zahl
can give us some answers.

109
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,299
As long as you travel
in Zahl territory,

110
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,592
you travel among friends.

111
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,220
I apologize for your mishap
with the Krenim.

112
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,888
It was hardly traumatic.

113
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,639
But I am curious,

114
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,726
the Krenim claim this
region as their own.

115
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,729
The Krenim dominated
this space many years ago.

116
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,815
They possessed deadly weapons
based on temporal science,

117
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,984
and it kept them in power
for a long time,

118
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,819
but a generation ago,
we fought the Krenim.

119
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,155
We defeated them
and took back the planets

120
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,407
that they had annexed,

121
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,867
dismantled
their military forces.

122
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,953
Their ships still
wander our territory

123
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,495
making grandiose claims.

124
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,914
Don't let them
trouble you.

125
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,000
Now, tell me
about<i> Voyager--</i>

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,753
a single ship alone,
half a galaxy from home--

127
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,880
how exciting for you.
KIM:<i> Bridge to Captain.</i>

128
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,091
<i>Sorry to interrupt,</i>
<i>but the Krenim vessel is back.</i>

129
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,093
<i>They're demanding</i>
<i>to speak with you.</i>

130
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,600
Hello again.

131
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>You've ignored our warnings,</i>
<i>and now you</i>

132
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,521
<i>consort with our enemy.</i>

133
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,316
Leave this space or
I'll seize your vessel

134
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,900
and send you home
in a cargo container.

135
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,029
Gentlemen, please. Believe me,
we're not conspiring

136
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,031
against you.
( alarm bleeping )

137
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,617
Captain, there's a spatial
distortion heading toward us.

138
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,828
Whatever it is, it's huge.
Five light-years across

139
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,455
and it's expanding.

140
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,123
Tracking its origin.

141
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,125
A vessel near
the Zahl homeworld.

142
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,336
What?
It appears to be

143
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,046
a massive buildup
of temporal energy.

144
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,466
Some kind
of space-time shock wave.

145
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,176
Tom?

146
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,594
It's destabilizing
our warp field.

147
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,264
I've lost engines.
Shields to full.

148
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,849
Secure primary systems.

149
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,726
All hands brace for impact.

150
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,747
She's dead.

151
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,582
TUVOK:
Shields at 17 percent.

152
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,794
The Krenim are
firing again.

153
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,963
We're being hailed.
It's about time.

154
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,257
On screen.

155
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,260
We've done nothing
to provoke these attacks.

156
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,847
<i>Your presence in our space</i>
<i>is provocation enough.</i>

157
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,100
We've been trying to communicate
with your vessels,

158
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,020
but the only answer I get
is weapons fire.

159
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,730
<i>State your identity.</i>

160
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,108
Captain Janeway of the
Federation Starship--

161
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,904
<i>And your reason</i>
<i>for violating our borders.</i>

162
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,655
We're simply trying
to get home.

163
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,491
If you'd kindly allow us
to pass through--

164
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,537
<i>No. You will submit</i>
<i>to the Krenim Imperium.</i>

165
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,914
<i>I would prefer</i>
<i>to seize your vessel</i>

166
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,999
<i>before it is too badly damaged.</i>

167
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:48,213
<i>Surrender now and I will forego</i>
<i>the execution of your crew.</i>

168
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,550
I don't respond well
to threats.

169
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,803
<i>Then prepare to be boarded.</i>

170
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:04,271
All hands, battle stations.

171
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:09,276
This is turning into
the week of hell.

172
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,194
( sighing )

173
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,910
They're charging weapons.
Three seconds to impact.

174
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,329
Evasive maneuvers.

175
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,498
Direct hit to our
secondary hull.

176
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,459
I still don't understand
why these torpedoes

177
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,752
are ripping
right through our shields.

178
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,342
Their weapons are
chroniton-based.

179
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,760
They're penetrating our shields

180
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,012
because they're
in a state of temporal flux.

181
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,098
Then let's exercise
the better part of valor.

182
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,766
Get us out of here, warp 6.

183
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,143
Warp 6.

184
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,687
No sign of pursuit.
Damage report.

185
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,150
Fifteen wounded.
Main power is down.

186
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,320
We've lost environmental control
on Decks 7 and 8.

187
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,737
The computer
is off-line.

188
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,491
Mr. Kim, do we have
any sensors left?

189
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,159
Short-range only.

190
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,370
Commander...

191
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,956
put the ship
on 24-hour Tactical Alert.

192
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,375
Tuvok, analyze
whatever data we've got

193
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,210
on those
chroniton torpedoes.

194
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,921
See if you can
modify our shielding.

195
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,090
When those Krenim
attack again,

196
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,176
I want to be ready.

197
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,897
( door beeps )

198
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,650
Enter.

199
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,071
Sir, you were correct.

200
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,949
The Zahl homeworld
was the focal point.

201
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,993
It's erasure has produced
a complete

202
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,870
temporal restoration.

203
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,622
Complete?

204
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,332
Yes, sir.

205
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:53,505
If I told you to count
the stars in the cosmos,

206
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,090
would the task ever be complete?

207
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,384
Sir?

208
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,844
Our attempts may
be sufficient.

209
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,263
They may be even
relatively successful,

210
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,224
but they will
never be complete.

211
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,268
Choose your words
with more precision.

212
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,811
My apologies.

213
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,105
What were the exact results?

214
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,150
The Krenim Imperium
has been restored to power.

215
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,860
Our territory
now includes

216
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,157
849 inhabited worlds
spanning 5,000 parsecs.

217
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,617
Counter-indications?

218
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,285
Negligible.

219
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,995
No superior enemy forces.

220
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,582
No unexpected diseases.

221
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:32,293
Calculations indicate
a 98 percent restoration.

222
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,005
Our race
is thriving once again.

223
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,841
The, uh...

224
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,679
the colony at Kyana Prime...

225
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,306
that was restored as well?

226
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,768
No, sir.
In this timeline,

227
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,313
the Imperium does
not extend that far.

228
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,821
Then our mission has failed.

229
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,283
Begin calculations
for the next incursion.

230
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,745
Sir, we have just accomplished
the impossible--

231
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,372
a 98 percent restoration.

232
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,374
Another incursion,
even a minor one,

233
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,543
could undermine everything.

234
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,545
We should dismantle
this weapon

235
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,046
and rejoin our people.

236
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,591
No, not until
every colony...

237
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,841
every individual...

238
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,885
every blade of
grass is restored.

239
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,556
You said yourself,
our task will never be complete.

240
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,309
Please, we should
be satisfied

241
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,227
with what we have
accomplished.

242
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,230
For 200 years, we have
never come this close.

243
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,732
Not close enough.

244
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,401
If I may speak my thoughts.

245
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,902
Many among the crew
are convinced

246
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,113
that you have lost
your objectivity.

247
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,116
They think your quest
for... precision

248
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,744
is unrealistic.

249
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,245
Sir...

250
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,540
we will never restore
100 percent of what we had.

251
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,668
We can manipulate
the time continuum

252
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,003
for another ten centuries,

253
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,088
it will never happen.

254
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,467
Return to your station and begin

255
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,678
a new set of
calculations.

256
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,054
Is that clear?

257
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,390
Perfectly.

258
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,892
You surprise me, Obrist.

259
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,439
After so many years,

260
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:21,110
you still perceive time
through conventional eyes.

261
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,280
"Never" is a word that
has no meaning here.

262
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,450
As long as we stay
on this vessel,

263
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,286
protected from space-time,

264
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,290
we have all eternity to
accomplish our mission.

265
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,295
Of course, sir.

266
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,601
JANEWAY: Return fire.
TUVOK: Weapons are down.

267
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,770
My attempt to modify
the shielding was unsuccessful.

268
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,606
CHAKOTAY:
Captain, during that exchange
we did some damage.

269
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,734
Krenim's aft shields
are down. They're vulnerable.

270
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,152
We've got to hit them now!
KIM: With what?

271
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,696
Phaser banks are burned out.

272
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,030
Torpedo launchers are off-line.

273
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,574
<i>Doctor to Bridge.</i>

274
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,242
<i>We've got</i>
<i>a power overload in Sick Bay.</i>

275
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,244
<i>I need an engineer</i>
<i>down here right away.</i>

276
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,663
Stand by, Doctor. Harry, can you
handle it from here?

277
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,039
No, sir.

278
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,750
The overload's spreading.

279
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,126
Half that deck is going to blow
in less than five minutes.

280
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,961
Doctor, get your patients
out of there.

281
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,714
All hands,
this is the Bridge.

282
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,799
Emergency evacuation, Deck 5.

283
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,093
How many torpedoes
do we have left?

284
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,721
Eleven.
Arm four of them.

285
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,139
Stand by
to open the launch doors.

286
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,475
We're going to deploy them
like mines.

287
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,810
Aye, Captain.

288
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,896
Tom, I need
your finesse.

289
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:41,274
Let the Krenim get within
5,000 meters of us.

290
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,567
No problem.

291
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,110
DOCTOR:
Keep moving.

292
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,613
Quickly. Please,
move quickly.

293
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,491
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning. Structural collapse</i>
<i>in three minutes.</i>

294
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,035
Torpedoes armed and ready.

295
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,704
They're within range.

296
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,206
Tuvok...

297
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,626
do it.

298
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,429
Got 'em!

299
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,390
( alarm beeps )

300
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,434
The conduits
on Deck 5 are overloading.

301
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:20,313
Thirty seconds till they blow.
DOCTOR: Keep moving.

302
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,148
Please, hurry.

303
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,275
That's it.

304
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:28,529
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning. Structural collapse</i>
<i>in 20 seconds.</i>

305
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,827
Fifteen seconds!

306
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:38,205
<i>Warning. Structural collapse</i>
<i>in 10 seconds.</i>

307
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,501
<i>Warning. Structural collapse</i>

308
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,043
<i>four...</i>

309
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,963
<i>three... two...</i>

310
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,547
<i>one.</i>

311
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,973
( gasping )

312
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,766
Report!

313
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:02,104
Sections 10 through 53
on Deck 5...

314
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,397
are gone.

315
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,941
Casualties?

316
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,151
Reports are coming in.

317
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,779
Twelve wounded,
many of them critically.

318
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,990
The Doctor is setting up
a triage facility

319
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,533
in the Mess Hall.

320
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,576
Two crew members were killed
in the breach.

321
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,413
Stand down Red Alert.

322
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,541
Assemble a security team.

323
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,167
Survey the ship deck by deck.

324
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,629
I want a full
damage report.

325
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,259
I'll be in my ready room.

326
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,138
You have the Bridge...

327
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,224
what's left of it.

328
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,279
( buzzing static )

329
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,534
( door chimes )

330
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,703
Come in.

331
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,039
Sorry about the mess.

332
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,707
You should
see my place.

333
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,418
They haven't looked as bad
since my old Academy days.

334
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,169
Is there something
on your mind?

335
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,006
Yes, but you're not
going to like it.

336
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,384
That's never
stopped you before.

337
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,094
Broken.

338
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,472
I'll be blunt.

339
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,934
Our strategy's failing.

340
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,393
It was a good idea
to try and create

341
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,228
temporal shielding,
but it isn't working.

342
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,022
Not yet, but it will.

343
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,107
With every attack,
we gather more information

344
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,525
about their chroniton weapons.

345
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,151
How many more attacks
will it take?

346
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,154
Before long, there won't be
a ship left to protect.

347
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,824
We don't have a choice.

348
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,659
Maybe we do.

349
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,789
Here comes the part
I'm not going to like.

350
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,625
We should consider
leaving the ship behind,

351
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,045
breaking the crew into smaller
groups-- escape pods, shuttles--

352
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,880
each one with its own course.

353
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,215
If all goes well,
we'll rendezvous

354
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,635
on the other side
of Krenim space.

355
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,136
Then what?

356
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,931
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it,

357
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,516
but at least we'd be increasing
our chances of survival.

358
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,981
Abandon ship?

359
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,732
The answer's no.

360
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,610
I'm not breaking up
the family, Chakotay.

361
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,361
We're stronger as a team.

362
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,864
One crew, one ship.

363
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,240
The moment we split apart,

364
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,534
we lose the ability
to pool our talents.

365
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,953
We become vulnerable.

366
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,913
We'll get picked off one by one.

367
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,959
Now, I say we make
our stand together.

368
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,172
To be honest, I wasn't too fond
of the idea myself.

369
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,758
As long as<i> Voyager's</i> 
in one piece,

370
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,927
we stay.

371
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,097
( sighs )

372
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,933
We stay.

373
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,019
This looks like
it stayed in one piece.

374
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,436
Where does this go?

375
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,729
My lucky teacup.

376
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,190
Right over here.

377
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,526
PARIS:
<i>Red Alert.</i>
<i>We're under attack.</i>

378
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,154
<i>Two Krenim warships</i>
<i>off the port bow.</i>

379
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,532
( rattling )

380
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,128
TORRES:
When are they going
to get us out of here?

381
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,964
KIM:
Try to relax.
Let's get back to the game.

382
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:19,760
Grace Kelly...
cat burglars... the Riviera.

383
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,721
Name the title...

384
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,389
and the male lead.

385
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,808
<i>To Catch a Thief.</i> 
Right.

386
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,852
Clark Gable.
( imitates buzzer )

387
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,645
Wrong. Cary Grant.

388
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,480
I've seen
the holographic version twice.

389
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,815
It's Clark Gable.

390
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,567
I think you're getting them
confused

391
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,111
because they have the same
initials. It was Grant.

392
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,779
No more
20th-century entertainment.

393
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,781
I'm terrible at it.
My turn.

394
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,118
Category... athletics.

395
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,494
Fire away.

396
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,246
A notorious athlete...

397
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,208
parrises' squares,
championship finals...

398
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,835
uh... controversial decision.

399
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,130
M'Kota R'Cho, the first and only
Klingon to ever play the game.

400
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,133
During the finals of 2342,
one of the referees

401
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,843
called a penalty
against his team.

402
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,678
R'Cho strangled him.

403
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,222
Impressive.

404
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,225
You're looking at a true
sports aficionado.

405
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:10,310
Let's see... how about
interstellar history?

406
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,230
Oh, great. You pick
the one subject

407
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,108
I almost failed at the Academy.
Go ahead and ask--

408
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,026
( groans )
Hey, you all right?

409
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,194
Mm-hmm.

410
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,486
( gasping )

411
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,406
It just...
hurts a little.

412
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,742
( breathing rapidly )

413
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,788
It feels like we've
been here for days.

414
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,498
Actually, it's been
about six hours.

415
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,709
Try to hang on,
B'Elanna.

416
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,963
The emergency crews are
going to find us any minute.

417
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,635
Come on, hurry up!

418
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,304
Go ahead and ask
your stupid question,

419
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,722
before I pass out

420
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,558
and you don't have
anybody to play with.

421
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,269
Okay.

422
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:54,021
Um... it's a famous ship.

423
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,356
Uh... pre-warp civilization...

424
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,692
um... Montana...

425
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,780
uh... second stage
had chemical engines.

426
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,240
Another clue.

427
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,950
Vulcans, um...

428
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,660
Earth...
first contact.

429
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,453
Oh, right, right.

430
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,499
Um... uh... uh...
Zephram Cochrane's ship...

431
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,334
What was it called?

432
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,419
God, it's on the tip
of my tongue.

433
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,005
( groaning )
Okay, okay. Here,

434
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,048
you better lie down now.
Enough trivia for now.

435
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,382
No. No, I'm going
to get this one.

436
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,718
( thumping )

437
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,056
Lieutenant. Ensign.

438
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,184
It's about time.

439
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,019
What happened
to the turbolift?

440
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,645
During the last attack,

441
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,106
19 main power relays
were severed.

442
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,566
The entire turbolift system
is nonoperational.

443
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,112
Get me to the Jefferies tube
network on Deck 11.

444
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,614
The EPS manifold
must have taken a hit too.

445
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,158
Seven of Nine
can go take a look.

446
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,951
We have to get you
to the Doctor.

447
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,163
All right.
The<i> Phoenix.</i>

448
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,497
What?

449
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,373
The correct response
to your query.

450
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,126
The vessel Ensign Kim
was describing.

451
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,752
It was designated
the<i> Phoenix.</i>

452
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,838
Not bad.
I didn't realize

453
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,464
you knew so much
about Earth history.

454
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,466
I don't, but the Borg
were present

455
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,344
during those events.
Really?

456
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,928
It's a complicated
story.

457
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,180
Perhaps another time.

458
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,932
I think so.

459
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,351
Transverse bulkheads.

460
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,061
We've set up
emergency force fields

461
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,021
between all decks
and every section.

462
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,772
In the event
of a cataclysmic breach,

463
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,733
most of us
will be protected.

464
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,988
Ingenious.

465
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,781
Actually, you can
thank Mr. Paris.

466
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,283
He came up
with the idea.

467
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,535
I was inspired by
an ancient steamship,

468
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,079
the<i> Titanic.</i>

469
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,454
The engineers of the day

470
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,957
constructed a series
of special bulkheads--

471
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,751
sort of like
a honeycomb--

472
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,086
that would lower into place

473
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,628
if they suffered
a major hull breach.

474
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,421
In theory,
they could stay afloat

475
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,216
even with half the ship
filled with water.

476
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,717
The<i> Titanic?</i>

477
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,928
As I recall, it sank.

478
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,971
Well, let's just say,

479
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,391
I've made a few
improvements.

480
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,142
I knew your fixation
with history

481
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,311
would come in handy
someday. Good work.

482
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,730
<i>Doctor to Lieutenant Paris.</i> 
Go ahead, Doc.

483
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,565
<i>Report to the Mess Hall</i>
<i>at once.</i>

484
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,609
<i>More wounded are on the way.</i>

485
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,738
I'll be right there. I'm a
popular guy today.

486
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,123
( beeping denial )

487
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,945
Seven of Nine to Tuvok.

488
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,613
<i>Tuvok here.</i>

489
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,824
There is an undetonated
chroniton torpedo

490
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,617
lodged in the starboard
Jefferies tube

491
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,287
on Deck 11, Section 2.

492
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,372
The warhead is still active.

493
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,374
<i>Do not attempt to disarm it.</i>

494
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,336
<i>Hold your position</i>
<i>and wait for my arrival.</i>

495
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,628
<i>Is that clear?</i>

496
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,839
Arrive quickly.

497
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,845
( breathing heavily )

498
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,348
I've stopped the
internal bleeding.

499
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:18,267
You're going
to be okay.

500
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:22,146
Is that your expert opinion?

501
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,231
That's a promise.

502
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,861
I know.
It still hurts.

503
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,570
No, it's all right.

504
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,159
You've got
a ruptured vertebra.

505
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,410
I'll see if I can repair it.

506
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,037
Mr. Paris, your
assistance, please.

507
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,914
Give me a minute.
Now, Lieutenant.

508
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,126
I'll be right back.

509
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,712
Don't go anywhere.

510
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,839
In case
you hadn't noticed,

511
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,508
B'Elanna is not
the only patient here.

512
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:51,758
She's in pain.

513
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,302
But no longer
in danger of dying.

514
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,054
That is the first rule
of medical triage.

515
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,430
Make sure
the patient will live,

516
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,890
then move on
to the next one.

517
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,267
Emotional detachment
is essential.

518
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,602
Otherwise, you risk
impairing your judgment.

519
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,771
I understand.
You could be seeing more

520
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,648
of your friends
in here soon.

521
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,108
If you can't
handle it,

522
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,693
I'll find
another assistant.

523
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,320
You can leave.

524
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,367
"Physician,
heal thyself."

525
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,702
What's that
supposed to mean?

526
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,413
Well, it seems to me
that you're the one

527
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,915
who's getting emotional
around here.

528
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,213
Several weeks ago,

529
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,216
just before the conduits
on Deck 5 breached,

530
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,468
I saw Ensign Strickler
and Crewman Emmanuel

531
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,178
at the end
of a corridor.

532
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:41,100
They were... trying to reach the
Jefferies tube.

533
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,811
I kept
the hatch open,

534
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,565
waited for them
as long as I could,

535
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,400
but time ran out.

536
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:54,238
I had no choice
but to seal the hatch.

537
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,703
That must have been very hard
for you.

538
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,705
My point is, it
could have been worse.

539
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,208
Had I lost my objectivity, I
might have kept the hatch open

540
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,461
and everyone
would have perished.

541
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,046
This man has
damaged lung tissue.

542
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,090
Treat him with
inaprovaline.

543
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,761
If we attempt
to dislodge the torpedo

544
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,263
or move it
with the transporters,

545
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,847
it will
most likely detonate.

546
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,141
Can we disarm it?

547
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,893
No. The warhead
is already destabilizing.

548
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,313
I estimate it will explode
in less than two minutes.

549
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,524
If we reroute emergency
power to this junction,

550
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,067
and erect a level-10
force field,

551
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,069
it should be enough
to contain the explosion.

552
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,322
We must hurry.
If I can determine the exact

553
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,449
temporal variance of this
torpedo, it will help us

554
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,909
perfect the temporal shielding.
There is no time.

555
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,702
We may never have
this opportunity again.

556
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,623
I am giving you
an order. Now!

557
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,875
The temporal variance
is 1.47 microseconds.

558
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,043
Excellent work.

559
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,795
But if you disobey
my orders again,

560
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,465
I will be forced to--
( loud crackling )

561
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:06,519
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51268.4.</i>

562
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,687
<i>This morning's attack destroyed</i>
the power grid on Deck 11.

563
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,565
<i>No casualties this time,</i>

564
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:14,401
<i>but the replicator system</i>
<i>was badly damaged.</i>

565
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,945
<i>We've gone</i>
<i>to emergency rations.</i>

566
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,324
<i>As a result, the situation</i>
<i>has gotten a little worse.</i>

567
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,160
<i>Environmental controls</i>
<i>continue to fail.</i>

568
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,580
<i>Seven decks have been rendered</i>
<i>uninhabitable</i>

569
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,749
<i>and we've had</i>
<i>to relocate the crew.</i>

570
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,670
<i>Quarters are close,</i>
<i>nerves are frayed,</i>

571
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,339
<i>and I'm not sure what's</i>
<i>more difficult to maintain--</i>

572
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,300
Voyager's<i> systems</i>
<i>or the crew's morale.</i>

573
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,969
<i>What's important</i>
<i>is that we're together,</i>

574
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:45,765
<i>working towards</i>
<i>a single goal. Survival.</i>

575
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,143
CHAKOTAY:
Happy birthday.

576
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,603
Happy what?

577
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,314
Today is May 20.

578
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,277
Is it?

579
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,864
I thought
we were still in April.

580
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,158
Guess I've lost
track of the time.

581
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,662
Well, this should help.

582
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,210
It's beautiful.

583
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,754
Nineteenth century,
mechanical movement.

584
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,381
It's a replica
of the chronometer

585
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,717
worn by Captain Cray
of the British Navy.

586
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,761
His ship was hit
by a typhoon in the Pacific.

587
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,347
Everyone back in England
thought they were killed,

588
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,182
but eight months later,

589
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,976
Cray sailed his ship
into London harbor.

590
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,687
There wasn't much left of it,

591
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:35,982
a few planks, half a sail,
but he got his crew home.

592
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,780
I appreciate the sentiment,
but I can't keep this.

593
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,365
Recycle it.

594
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,577
We can't afford to waste energy
on nonessentials.

595
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,329
Kathryn, I replicated this
months ago.

596
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,707
I've been saving it.
I wanted you to have it.

597
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:55,877
That watch represents a meal,
a hypospray or a pair of boots.

598
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,838
It could mean the difference
between life and death one day.

599
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,746
( door chimes )

600
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,456
Enter.

601
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,460
Reporting for duty,
Lieutenant.

602
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,545
What is our agenda?

603
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,339
After we make
your customary rounds,

604
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,299
I'd like to take you
to Deflector Control.

605
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,636
I had an inspiration last night
about the temporal shielding.

606
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,346
Excellent.

607
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,309
You've been damaged.

608
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,893
A minor laceration.

609
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,438
I've offered to assist you
with your personal grooming.

610
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,107
There are some tasks I would
rather perform myself.

611
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,485
Unacceptable.
You're risking further injury.

612
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,446
Shaving is hardly a
life-threatening activity.

613
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,201
Tell me about
your inspiration.

614
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,328
We've been trying
to match our shields

615
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,747
to the temporal variance
of their torpedoes.

616
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,458
But I believe we must
also match the deflector array

617
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,001
to the inverse of that variance.

618
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,338
Fascinating. When will
the deflectors be ready?

619
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,299
They're ready now, but the
modifications are untested.

620
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,510
Then our rounds can wait.

621
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,928
Take me to Deflector Control.

622
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,853
Seven.
Ensign.

623
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,145
A friend of yours?

624
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,272
My... cabin mate.

625
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,483
As a Borg, I was accustomed
to cohabitating

626
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,026
with thousands
of other drones.

627
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,820
But I find it significantly
more difficult

628
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,363
to live with
a single human.

629
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,240
In what way?

630
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,283
Ensign Brooks
is negligent.

631
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,494
She leaves her equipment
lying around the quarters

632
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,246
and her clothing
on the floor.

633
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,082
Indeed. I have found that most
humans are less than meticulous

634
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,834
when it comes
to their domestic habits.

635
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,335
Indeed.

636
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,920
Mr. Vulcan, sir.

637
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,215
A tactical question if I may?
You may.

638
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,510
We're just about done rebuilding
the internal security sensors

639
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,221
and we're ready
to program the audio signal.

640
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,182
Do you want it to say,
"intruder alert"?

641
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,685
Or should we try something
a little more dramatic

642
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,186
like "warning,
intruder alert"?

643
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,564
Or... "intruders
among us, danger!

644
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,274
Danger! Intruders
among us"?

645
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,693
"Intruder alert"
will suffice.

646
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,820
Yeah, go with a classic.

647
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,280
Understood, sir.

648
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,742
And you believe
you have difficulties.

649
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:33,159
( alarm blares )

650
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,120
CHAKOTAY:
<i>All hands to battle stations.</i>

651
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,830
<i>Krenim vessels approaching.</i>

652
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,583
<i>Repeat: all hands</i>
<i>to battle stations!</i>

653
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:43,002
Go to Deflector Control and
bring the new shields on line.

654
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,838
We will test them in battle.

655
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,317
Computer, activate tactile
interface.

656
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,652
CHAKOTAY:
Weapons status?

657
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,069
( console beeping )

658
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,822
Phasers are still on line.

659
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,657
Torpedo launchers
are inoperative.

660
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,700
PARIS:
The Krenim are
within visual range.

661
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,786
On screen.

662
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,788
TUVOK:
Seven's modified
temporal shields

663
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,289
should be on line
in a moment.

664
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,540
It's a warship.

665
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,375
You know the routine.

666
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,043
Evasive maneuvers.

667
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,630
They're matching course.

668
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,214
Hold them off
as long as you can.

669
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,466
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

670
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,050
Where are those shields?

671
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,845
Stand by.

672
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:36,389
They're charging weapons.
Seven, we could use a little

673
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,433
<i>of that Borg efficiency</i>
<i>right about now.</i>

674
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,269
I can't shake them off!
They're targeting the Bridge!

675
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,481
Temporal shielding is on line.

676
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,732
They're firing!

677
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,150
Full port thrusters!

678
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,367
Temporal shields are holding.

679
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,660
No damage.

680
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,037
Hail them.

681
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,206
Channel open.

682
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:08,213
Krenim vessels,
this is the Captain of<i> Voyager.</i>

683
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,673
You may have noticed

684
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,801
we have a defense
against your torpedoes now.

685
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,345
I suggest you stand down.

686
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,684
No response.

687
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,107
Their mistake.
Bring the ship about.

688
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,444
We're going through their space
whether they like it or not.

689
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:46,793
We are within range
of the Garenor homeworld.

690
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,004
Set temporal coordinates.

691
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,465
Full power to the weapon.

692
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,679
Prepare for total erasure
of the species.

693
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,932
Targeting the focal point.

694
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,269
Ready.

695
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,356
Fire.

696
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,160
Temporal incursion in progress.

697
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,914
Trace elements?

698
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,249
Diminishing.

699
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,876
Counter-indications?

700
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,502
None so far.

701
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,547
Organisms and structures
are being eradicated.

702
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,050
Track the temporal wave front

703
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,885
as it passes
through their system.

704
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:41,473
I want to monitor every change
in the timeline as it occurs.

705
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,683
Yes, sir.

706
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,311
Captain, the Krenim warship
is in pursuit,

707
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,980
but their weapons
are not powered.

708
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,648
Hmm. They don't know
what to do with us

709
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,733
now that we're shielded
against their torpedoes.

710
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,402
( console beeps )
Captain, there's some kind

711
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,488
of spatial distortion
heading toward us.

712
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,281
Sensor readings
are erratic.

713
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,117
I can't identify
the phenomenon.

714
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,451
What's the source?

715
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,662
Unknown,
but it originated approximately

716
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,664
20 light-years
from our position.

717
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,416
It looks like a shock wave
in the fabric of space-time.

718
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,043
Tom, get us out of here.

719
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,253
We'll never outrun it, Captain.

720
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,715
Maybe our new shields will help.
All hands, brace for impact.

721
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,934
You were correct, Captain.

722
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,269
The temporal shielding
has protected us.

723
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,356
The wave front has passed.
Captain?

724
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,656
Report.
It's definitely a Krenim ship.

725
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,534
Identical hull markings,
same biospectral frequency...

726
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,662
but it's half the size. Limited
fire power.

727
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,205
What happened to the warship?

728
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,499
I'm not picking it up
on long-range sensors.

729
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:53,045
CHAKOTAY:
It looks like this entire part
of space has changed somehow.

730
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,254
The last time I checked,
this region was filled

731
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,049
with Krenim colonies
and vessels.

732
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,759
I just ran a scan and
sensors show no colonies

733
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,345
and just a handful
of Krenim ships.

734
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,682
Harry, transfer all your sensor
data about that shock wave

735
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,143
to the Astrometrics Lab.
Yes, ma'am.

736
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,728
Tell Seven of Nine
to meet me there.

737
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,270
Captain, Astrometrics

738
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,065
took heavy damage
a few days go.

739
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,859
It's off-line.
Well, let's get it back on line.

740
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,361
It appears that the Krenim
Imperium has vanished.

741
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,781
Our troubles could be over
and I'd like to find out why.

742
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,369
Something went wrong.

743
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,080
The entire Krenim Imperium,

744
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,498
it's reverted
to a pre-warp state.

745
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,835
Not possible.
Our calculations were perfect.

746
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,171
( console beeping )

747
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,048
I may have an explanation.

748
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,841
There's an anomalous
temporal reading

749
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,426
20 light-years from here.

750
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,345
It's coming
from a vessel.

751
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,223
What vessel?

752
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:51,144
Component 049-beta,
a ship called<i> Voyager.</i>

753
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,646
That ship was classified
as an inert component.

754
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,774
It shouldn't be generating
a temporal field.

755
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,275
But it is...

756
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,361
and it was enough to throw
off our calculations.

757
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,699
Take me to them.

758
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,126
Sensors are on line.

759
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,796
Power levels are stable.

760
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,132
Is the astrometric database
still intact?

761
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,217
( console beeping )
Yes.

762
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,177
Display the scans
we made of this region

763
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,721
before the temporal
shock wave hit.

764
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,309
Spatial grid 005.

765
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,563
The Krenim Imperium.
Over 200 star systems,

766
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,482
900 planets,

767
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:41,444
thousands of warp-capable
vessels and now...

768
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,322
after the shock wave,

769
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,199
everything seems
to have changed.

770
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,660
Run a new scan.

771
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,997
Spatial grid 005.

772
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,624
Same space,
different configuration.

773
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,751
Exactly as Chakotay said.

774
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,962
The Imperium
appears to have been reduced

775
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,423
to a few planets,
and a smattering of vessels.

776
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,219
It appears that someone...

777
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,514
or something
has altered history.

778
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,225
But why weren't we affected?

779
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,393
Perhaps we were protected
from the changes

780
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,728
by our temporal shielding.

781
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,480
Mmm.

782
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,440
So the question remains:

783
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,029
What caused that shock
wave in the first place?

784
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,865
See if you can track
it back to its origin.

785
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,952
The shock wave emanated from
a planet 20 light-years away.

786
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,872
The Garenor homeworld.
The Garenor?

787
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,374
We passed their planet
three weeks ago.

788
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,879
The planet
is no longer populated.

789
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,215
What?

790
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,175
Astrometric data
indicate

791
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,385
that the instant
the shock wave appeared,

792
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,263
the Garenor species
vanished.

793
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,810
( whispering ):
Erased from history.

794
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,562
Captain?

795
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,648
I'm no authority
on time travel.

796
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,735
In fact, I've made it my goal
in life to avoid it, but...

797
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,782
this sounds to me like
a causality paradox.

798
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,576
Think about it.

799
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:16,081
A temporal shock wave
eliminates a single species

800
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:20,585
and all of history
changes as a result.

801
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,546
An intriguing theory.

802
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,673
Perhaps the Krenim
are responsible.

803
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,342
They do possess
temporal technology.

804
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,053
But why would they alter history
to undermine themselves?

805
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,722
No, we're still missing
a big piece of the puzzle.

806
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,182
Run another scan of the--

807
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,142
( deep rumbling )

808
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,816
Scanning the vessel.
Their defensive shielding

809
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,152
is generating a level-9
temporal disruption.

810
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,653
Collect samples.

811
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,156
Two life-forms,
ten square meters of the hull.

812
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,490
Yes, sir.

813
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,118
Disable their shielding.

814
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:57,830
Prepare to initiate
a temporal incursion.

815
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,292
That entire vessel's
in a state of temporal flux.

816
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:03,628
It's like they exist
outside space-time.

817
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,713
They're scanning us.

818
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,716
Get a lock on them!

819
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,261
I'm trying, but I can't
isolate their signals.

820
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,721
We are being hailed.
JANEWAY: On screen.

821
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,309
<i>State your identity.</i>

822
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,437
I'm Captain Janeway of the
Federation Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

823
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,063
Who are you,
and where are my men?

824
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,232
<i>I am Annorax</i>
<i>of the Krenim Imperium.</i>

825
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,318
<i>We've transferred your crewmen</i>
<i>to my vessel</i>

826
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,069
<i>for further analysis.</i>

827
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,239
<i>Your ship does not come</i>
<i>from this Quadrant.</i>

828
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,865
We come from Earth.

829
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,952
A planet 65,000
light-years from here.

830
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,620
We're on our way home.

831
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,247
I see.

832
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,957
We've been observing
some rather...

833
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,876
unusual events in the region.

834
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:47,464
It seems your Imperium... never
existed.

835
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,715
Perhaps you could shed
some light on this.

836
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,801
<i>That doesn't concern you.</i>

837
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,804
<i>What is important</i>
<i>is that you understand</i>

838
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,432
<i>that I bear you no hostility...</i>

839
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,892
<i>but you have diverted me</i>
<i>from my mission.</i>

840
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,769
Your mission?

841
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,067
You're responsible for
the changes in the timeline.

842
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,987
<i>You're a long way</i>
<i>from your world.</i>

843
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,907
<i>In a manner of speaking,</i>
<i>so am I.</i>

844
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:18,077
<i>Unfortunately, only one of us</i>
<i>can go home again.</i>

845
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,997
<i>Your sacrifice will restore</i>
<i>the lives</i>

846
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,375
<i>of countless millions.</i>

847
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,961
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

848
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,088
KIM:
I'm reading a massive
energy buildup.

849
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,466
Some kind of weapon.
Shields.

850
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,516
Temporal shields are weakening.

851
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,309
Captain, that energy beam,

852
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,769
it's pushing<i> Voyager</i> out of
the space-time continuum.

853
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,605
He's trying to erase us
from history.

854
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,192
SEVEN:
I have scanned
their propulsion system.

855
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,986
Their vessel's mass prevents
them from exceeding warp 6.

856
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,697
We can escape.
Captain, I must remind you,

857
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,616
our structural integrity
is still impaired.

858
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,745
If we go to warp now, the damage
to<i> Voyager</i> will be extreme.

859
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,372
What about Tom and Chakotay?

860
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,249
We'll have to come back
for them.

861
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,042
All hands
clear the outer sections

862
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,169
and prepare
for wide-scale breaches.

863
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,548
Tuvok, activate
the transverse bulkheads.

864
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,843
Temporal shields are failing.

865
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,471
Engage warp 7.

866
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,474
They're not in pursuit.

867
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,808
We are losing the outer hull.

868
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,019
Transverse bulkheads
are holding.

869
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,823
JANEWAY:
Each of you has
done your best,

870
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,242
but determination alone

871
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,619
isn't going to hold
this ship together.

872
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,663
It's time we faced reality.

873
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,208
We've lost nine decks.

874
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:50,336
More than half the ship
has been destroyed.

875
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,172
Life support is nearly gone.

876
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:57,343
<i>Voyager</i> can no longer
sustain its crew.

877
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,096
I promised myself that I
would never give this order,

878
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,640
that I would never break up
this family,

879
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,684
but asking you to stay...

880
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,981
would be asking you to die.

881
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,358
You will proceed
to the escape pods,

882
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,068
and evacuate this vessel.

883
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,154
Set your course
for the Alpha Quadrant.

884
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,697
Along the way,
try to find allies.

885
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,575
Secure faster ships if you can.

886
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,453
Anything to get home.
The senior staff and I

887
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,330
will remain on board
as long as possible.

888
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,125
We will try, somehow,
to rescue Tom and Chakotay.

889
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,003
The escape pods are equipped
with subspace beacons.

890
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,422
That's how we'll
keep track of you.

891
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,049
When we find each other again,

892
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,302
and we will...

893
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:42,263
we will find
each other again--

894
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:46,058
I expect all of you
to be in one piece

895
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,103
with some interesting stories
to tell.

896
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,399
Good luck.
