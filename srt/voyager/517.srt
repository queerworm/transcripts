00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:36,996
(<i> chuckles</i> )

2
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,121
We shouldn't be here.

3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,456
Don't worry.

4
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,375
Nobody saw us leave.

5
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,835
(<i> both grunt</i> )

6
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,128
Hey, I need that.

7
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,964
What if somebody
tries to call?

8
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,340
Shh.

9
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,054
What was that?

10
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,305
Don't worry.

11
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,765
Come here.

12
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,644
(<i> chuckling</i> )

13
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,859
(<i> panting</i> )

14
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,973
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

15
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,307
<i>After two weeks, we're close</i>

16
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,101
<i>to repairing</i>
<i>the Varro's warp drive.</i>

17
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,311
<i>Then there's the Varro crew.</i>
<i>I'm starting to think</i>

18
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,396
<i>they'd rather give up</i>
<i>warp travel than accept</i>

19
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,065
<i>help from strangers.</i>

20
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,274
I thought we agreed

21
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,360
Central Control
would be off-limits.

22
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,445
We did, but I need to
access your warp assembly.

23
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,822
That technology's
classified.

24
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,406
We have to reconfigure
the assembly

25
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,950
if we're going
to finish this job.

26
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,076
Then consider it finished.

27
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,536
We've come this far...

28
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,705
You've turned our ship
upside down for two weeks.

29
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,581
I've yet to see
any results.

30
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,792
You might check
the antimatter injectors.

31
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,964
Back on line.

32
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,966
All you need now is
a jolt of antimatter

33
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,300
from<i> Voyager's</i> engines

34
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,760
and you'll be
back in business,

35
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,930
but I need access
to your warp assembly.

36
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,725
You know,
I can understand

37
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,894
why you're distrustful
of other species.

38
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,395
Frankly, we've had
a rough time

39
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,271
in the Delta
Quadrant ourselves,

40
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,733
but our two species have
made remarkable progress,

41
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,693
working together
to repair your engines.

42
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,903
We've come a long way

43
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,197
since you ignored
our opening hails.

44
00:03:58,197 --> 00:03:59,948
Let's not throw
all that away.

45
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:04,244
I'll admit we do share
some<i> things</i> in common.

46
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,122
We're both on long journeys,
looking for allies.

47
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,249
In many ways,
we're like cousins.

48
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,500
"Cousins"?

49
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,544
Well, distant cousins--
think about it.

50
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,422
400 years ago, you started
out the same way we did--

51
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,676
a single starship, a small crew,
facing the unknown

52
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,762
and now, centuries later,

53
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,056
you've grown into
a generational ship

54
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,349
with a history
and culture all your own.

55
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,769
When I look at your vessel,
I can't help but wonder

56
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,105
if I'm seeing
<i>Voyager's</i> future.

57
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:34,149
Our journey could easily
last several generations.

58
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,027
So, what do you say...
cousin?

59
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,572
You can access the warp
assembly from here.

60
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,656
Thank you.

61
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,033
Status?

62
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,119
TORRES:
Their plasma couplings
are on line.

63
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,787
We're ready for
the antimatter transfer.

64
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,663
Then let's get started.
Janeway to<i> Voyager.</i>

65
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,498
<i>Status?</i> 
Ready here, Captain.

66
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,251
<i>Initiate the transfer.</i>

67
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,548
Warp reactors 1 through 14
are coming on line.

68
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,549
It's working.

69
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,051
Keep your
fingers crossed.

70
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,386
For luck.

71
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,284
If you're planning on leaving

72
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:28,120
through the viewport,
you might want to get dressed.

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,790
The interstellar vacuum
might get a little chilly.

74
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,792
What?

75
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,712
Oh. Funny.

76
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,714
Come back to bed.

77
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,175
I can't sleep.

78
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,341
Cuddle.

79
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,718
I can't cuddle.

80
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,263
I told you we're not
going to get caught.

81
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,682
If someone had seen us, they
would've reported it by now.

82
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,642
I'm violating
about half a dozen regulations

83
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:54,813
by just being in this room,
and what we did earlier...

84
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,274
I don't know if Starfleet
even has a regulation for that.

85
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,733
What are you saying?

86
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,278
Making love is a crime
in your culture?

87
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:06,825
Yes! No. What I'm saying is
it's a breach of protocol.

88
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,119
How romantic.

89
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,912
The Captain instructed
all away teams--

90
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,665
no personal interaction
with the Varro crew.

91
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,958
I violated a direct order.

92
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,710
Come back to bed.

93
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,377
That's an order.

94
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,511
Are all humans
so jumpy?

95
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,512
No.

96
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,014
Only me.

97
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,767
(<i> rumbling</i> )

98
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,393
The warp engines.

99
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,689
They started
the plasma transfer.

100
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,482
We've got to get down there.

101
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,692
We're late.

102
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,985
(<i> chuckles</i> )

103
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,695
What are you waiting for?

104
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,572
To see what you look like
in my uniform.

105
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,866
(<i> rueful chuckling</i> )

106
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,534
(<i> chuckles</i> )

107
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,744
You don't understand.

108
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,746
If I'm not at my post...

109
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,997
You'll be executed.

110
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,540
Funny.

111
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,458
We better go in separately.

112
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,379
(<i> sighs</i> )

113
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,136
Impressive.

114
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,764
Just trying to orchestrate
the antimatter flow.

115
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,392
You should try some Chopin
when you're done.

116
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,977
Look who showed up
for the final movement.

117
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,062
Excuse me?

118
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,897
Just a little late
for the joke

119
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,357
as well as the job.

120
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,443
I was checking the manifolds
in Segment 22.

121
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,611
(<i> door opens</i> )

122
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,157
Warp reaction's
destabilizing.

123
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,617
Tal?

124
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,746
I can't find
the problem.

125
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:39,960
We're less than a minute away
from multiple core breaches.

126
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,461
Abort the transfer.

127
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,133
So much for
finger crossing.

128
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,592
B'Elanna.

129
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,719
I'm reading microfractures
all over the hull.

130
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,221
Why couldn't we detect
that before?

131
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,181
Good question. We'll
have to check the hulls

132
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,766
on each of your
vessel's segments.

133
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,101
But that'll take days.

134
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,061
The sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

135
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,111
Friendly people.

136
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,862
They've had a lot
of bad experiences

137
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,947
with other species.

138
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,531
Well, I don't know.

139
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,160
It seems like your first
contact went pretty well.

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,828
What's that supposed
to mean?

141
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,289
I'm just wondering where
you disappeared to today.

142
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,498
I told you.

143
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,167
I was checking the
plasma conduits in...

144
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,294
In Segment 22.
I know.

145
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,379
They must have sonic
showers over there.

146
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,174
You're a lot cleaner than
you were when you left.

147
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,260
You are such
a lousy liar.

148
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,928
Haven't you learned
anything from me

149
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,887
after five years?

150
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,597
She's cute.
Who?

151
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,933
That assistant
engineer, Tal.

152
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,893
Cute enough.

153
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,729
Oh, here we go again.

154
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,939
What?!

155
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,359
You. Going after
impossible women--

156
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:49,737
a hologram, an ex-Borg,
the wrong twin,

157
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,407
and now a girl from
a xenophobic species?

158
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,575
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

159
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,411
I'm putting her out
of my mind. I promise.

160
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,079
Good. Glad to hear it.

161
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,956
I'm due back
on the Bridge.

162
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,500
See you in the morning.

163
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,838
Computer, open a channel
to Varro ship,

164
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,965
Segment 16, Station 204.

165
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,676
Encode transmission with
security protocol Alpha-7.

166
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,094
COMPUTER:
<i>Channel open.</i>

167
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,637
<i>What took you so long?</i>

168
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,516
<i>I've been waiting 22 minutes</i>
<i>for you to call.</i>

169
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,600
I was testing myself,

170
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,853
seeing how long
I could resist calling you.

171
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,063
<i>And?</i>

172
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,107
I lasted 22 minutes.

173
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,651
<i>Should I feel complimented</i>
<i>or insulted?</i>

174
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,073
Since this is the first chance
I've had to open a com-link...

175
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,824
complimented.

176
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:39,037
<i>So... you liked what happened.</i>

177
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,207
<i>Yeah. A lot.</i>

178
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,501
Enough to try it again?

179
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,754
<i>Absolutely,</i>
<i>but I've got to be honest.</i>

180
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,841
<i>I wasn't expecting</i>
<i>something so... different.</i>

181
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,054
Neither was I.
Our species look so similar.

182
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,347
Well, at least on the surface.

183
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,723
<i>I would've never guessed</i>

184
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,308
<i>when it came down</i>
<i>to the basics...</i>

185
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,768
<i>well, let's just say,</i>

186
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,979
<i>the birds and bees</i>
<i>would be very confused.</i>

187
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,481
"Birds and bees"?

188
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,982
PARIS:
I'm telling you,

189
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,901
you should take a look
at their database.

190
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,737
They've got some pretty
amazing stuff on that ship.

191
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,364
Stuff.

192
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,574
Well, their environmental

193
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,325
control systems,
for instance--

194
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,993
it's completely
regenerative.

195
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,078
Zero waste.

196
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,246
Impressive.

197
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,206
It can be programmed
to create

198
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,583
almost any habitat.

199
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,168
If you wanted to,
you could recreate Vulcan

200
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,753
in your quarters
with that system.

201
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,505
Why would I want to?

202
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,882
A little taste of home
in the Delta Quadrant?

203
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,675
Think about it--

204
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,262
springtime on
the shores of Lake Yuron.

205
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,474
I require a desk
and a bed, nothing more.

206
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,100
You're missing
the point.

207
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,477
No doubt.

208
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,021
These people have been
traveling for 400 years.

209
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,440
They've learned
a thing or two

210
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,649
about living comfortably.

211
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,192
Our systems are
more than adequate.

212
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,235
(<i> frustrated groan</i> )

213
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,778
I give up.

214
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,197
After only two minutes?

215
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,657
Tuvok, how do you do it?

216
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,494
I wait until his own
illogic overwhelms him.

217
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,620
(<i> chuckles</i> )

218
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,163
(<i> beeping</i> )

219
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,373
I'm detecting
an unauthorized transmission.

220
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,416
Origin?

221
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,459
Unknown.

222
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,793
It's been encoded.

223
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,962
Find out where
it's going.

224
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,716
Where would you
most like to be right now?

225
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,552
<i>Besides your quarters?</i>

226
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,554
Besides my quarters.

227
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,181
<i>On a distant moon,</i>

228
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,643
<i>where the air is warm</i>
<i>and the gravity is light.</i>

229
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,227
<i>No bulkheads around me.</i>

230
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,064
<i>Where, if I walk too quickly,</i>
<i>I can almost fly.</i>

231
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,983
I like that.

232
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,527
<i>What about you?</i>

233
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,197
<i>Where would you most want</i>
<i>to be right now?</i>

234
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,156
Besides your cabin?

235
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,366
(<i> chuckles</i> )

236
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,159
Besides my cabin.

237
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,369
Sorry. I can't come up

238
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,162
with anything better
than your cabin.

239
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,874
<i>And what would you do</i>
<i>if you were here?</i>

240
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,042
Now?

241
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,919
<i>This very moment.</i>

242
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,215
I'd ask you
to dim the lights.

243
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,426
<i>And what if I said...</i>

244
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,636
<i>...no?</i>

245
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,306
Okay. So, we leave
the lights on.

246
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,560
The message has been sent
to the Varro ship.

247
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,561
Segment 16.

248
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,603
Living quarters.

249
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,022
Uh, Commander?

250
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,942
I think I can track
that down for you.

251
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,405
Hold on.
Something's wrong.

252
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,073
I'm losing the signal.

253
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,658
(<i> communications static</i> )

254
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,825
Tal?

255
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,703
The transmission has ended.

256
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,246
If it was
a transmission.

257
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,665
Could have just been
a glitch in the com system.

258
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,542
Run a diagnostic.

259
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,338
Finding the source
of these structural problems

260
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,631
isn't going to be easy.

261
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,508
They've already scanned
most of their ship

262
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,842
and come up empty.

263
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,386
I'm hoping we'll
do a better job.

264
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,389
We should form smaller teams
to maximize efficiency.

265
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,391
Agreed.
We'll work in pairs.

266
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,935
Now, what I'd like to do is
start with their reactor room

267
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,769
where we first
detected the problem...

268
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,439
You owe me.

269
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,398
What?

270
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,857
Eyes front.

271
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,652
Last night I had to
sabotage the com system

272
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,279
to cover your tracks.

273
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,572
You called her,
didn't you?

274
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,156
Guilty.

275
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,117
How long has
this been going on?

276
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,826
The truth.

277
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,162
From the moment
we first saw each other.

278
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,540
It was like touching
an open plasma relay.

279
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,959
Hmm. Sounds serious.

280
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,461
Maybe it is.

281
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,836
Has it occurred to you

282
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,922
that you're breaking
a few dozen protocols?

283
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,341
We know what
we're getting into.

284
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,136
Do you?

285
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,638
Our duty assignment.
We're to survey

286
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,640
the generational ship
from Astrometrics.

287
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,854
SEVEN:
Teams Alpha and Gamma
have finished scanning

288
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,398
Sections 1 through 64.

289
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,151
Kind of puts a Borg cube
to shame, doesn't it?

290
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,737
The vessel's technology
is impressive,

291
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,905
but its construction
is haphazard.

292
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,365
I guess they sort
of improvised

293
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,533
as they went along.

294
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,706
Seven, you've been around
humans for a while now.

295
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,209
What do you think
about love?

296
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,671
We're scanning for
microfractures.

297
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,380
I don't see
the relevance.

298
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,216
Just curious.

299
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,011
Parental love,
romantic love,

300
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,639
affection between
friends. Specify.

301
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,724
Romantic love.

302
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,435
An attraction based
on sexual desire,

303
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,895
one that facilitates
procreation.

304
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,981
I guess I'm asking
the wrong person.

305
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,150
Not at all.
The Borg have referenced

306
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,528
this condition in over 6,000
assimilated species.

307
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,156
"Condition"? You make it sound
like a disease.

308
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,158
Physiologically, it bears

309
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,868
a striking similarity
to disease.

310
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,662
A series
of biochemical responses

311
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,747
that trigger
an emotional cascade,

312
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,791
impairing normal
functioning.

313
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,083
Forget it.

314
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,256
Are you in love,
Ensign?

315
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,597
I guess that's what
I've been asking myself.

316
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,766
(<i> gasps</i> )

317
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,730
You're glowing.

318
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,523
I beg your pardon?

319
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,108
Your epidermis luminesced.

320
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,778
Huh...

321
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,238
Must be the lighting
in here.

322
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,490
No, it was you.

323
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,200
(<i> gasping</i> )

324
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,412
You should report
to Sick Bay.

325
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,080
It's nothing.

326
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,749
You must comply.

327
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,962
Lie still.
I feel fine.

328
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,506
No doubt you're
feeling wonderful.

329
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,133
Your beta endorphins
are abnormally elevated.

330
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,968
Really?
You've been spending

331
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,637
a lot of time
on the generational ship.

332
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,972
Do you recall coming into
contact with any toxins?

333
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,307
Antimatter radiation?

334
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,684
No.

335
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,728
Maybe something in one
of their medical bays--

336
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,312
a biological agent?

337
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,522
No.

338
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,190
Did you consume
any of their cuisine?

339
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,442
No.

340
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,861
Doctor, there is unusual
synaptic activity

341
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,446
in his cerebral cortex.

342
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,906
No kidding.

343
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,616
This could be the work
of an alien virus.

344
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,868
We'll have to initiate
full quarantine protocols.

345
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,245
Inform the Captain
and request a bio-alert.

346
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,329
Wait.

347
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,459
There's no need
for that.

348
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,543
I can explain.

349
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,044
I'm listening.

350
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,259
Could you give us
some privacy?

351
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,052
If there is the possibility
of an epidemic

352
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,012
the Doctor may require
my assistance.

353
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,015
There isn't and he won't.

354
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,059
Please.

355
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,612
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

356
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,576
Last night, I had an...

357
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,870
encounter with
one of the Varro.

358
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,664
Encounter?

359
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:42,001
A... personal encounter.

360
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,503
Specifically?

361
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,551
Sex. We had sex.

362
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,553
You had intimate contact
with an alien species

363
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,805
without
medical clearance?

364
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,264
It was in the heat
of the moment.

365
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,308
I didn't think anything
like this would happen.

366
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,519
Correction. If you'd been
thinking, you would have

367
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,896
considered the risks
and exercised restraint.

368
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,439
Sit down.

369
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,024
You'll need a full
biomedical workup,

370
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,985
and your "friend" will
have to come in as well.

371
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,487
Do we have to drag
her into this?

372
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,948
It is my medical
responsibility,

373
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,074
which, I'm sorry to say,
also requires me

374
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,409
to report this
to the Captain.

375
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,871
(<i> sighs</i> )

376
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,792
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

377
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,921
I expected
more from you.

378
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,048
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,133
I... don't know
what I was thinking.

380
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,552
Don't you?
I've seen Tal.

381
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,095
She's an impressive
young woman, beautiful,

382
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,639
but that's no excuse

383
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,392
to ignore your obligations
as a Starfleet officer.

384
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,601
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,562
There's a reason
you took a semester

386
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,772
of interspecies protocol
at the Academy.

387
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,315
There's also a reason

388
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,275
why the Handbook
on Personal Relationships

389
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,819
is three centimeters thick.

390
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,362
"All Starfleet
personnel must

391
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,072
"obtain authorization
from their CO

392
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,491
"as well as clearance from
their medical officer

393
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,577
"before initiating an
intimate relationship

394
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,870
with an alien species."

395
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,038
Bravo. Unfortunately,

396
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,999
your recitation
comes a little late.

397
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,877
According to the Doctor,

398
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,254
your condition isn't
life-threatening.

399
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,340
There's no reason to
confine you to Sick Bay,

400
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,801
but I do agree
with his recommendation

401
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,888
to run full bio-scans
on both you and Tal.

402
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,766
And her people need

403
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,975
to be told,

404
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,561
so they can evaluate
any bio-threat

405
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,647
you might've introduced
into their population.

406
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,566
We're trying to help
these people, Ensign,

407
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,192
earn their trust.

408
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,736
I was even hoping

409
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,321
they might return the favor,
share their technology,

410
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,866
their insights into
long-term space travel,

411
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,201
but your little escapade
put that in jeopardy.

412
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,246
Permission to speak freely.

413
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,582
With all due respect...

414
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,501
this wasn't a fling.

415
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,712
I've really gotten
to know Tal,

416
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,381
and I've developed
true feelings for her.

417
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,883
Noted.

418
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,177
But there are regulations,
and you've broken them.

419
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,181
I'm entering a formal
reprimand into your record

420
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,558
and I'm ordering
you to break off

421
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,061
this relationship.
Do you understand?

422
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:09,941
Yes, ma'am.

423
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,275
Dismissed.

424
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,869
Commander,
I wanted to share

425
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,329
a few security concerns.

426
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,081
A few days ago,
I noticed

427
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,750
some Mess Hall supplies
had disappeared--

428
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,377
liquid nutriments,
emergency rations,

429
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,630
nothing to warrant
a Red Alert, but...

430
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,466
I took the liberty of
investigating on my own.

431
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,593
Take a look at this.

432
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,972
Unauthorized use of
the Mess Hall replicator

433
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,389
is hardly a felony.

434
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,308
It wasn't just
unauthorized.

435
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,144
Someone accessed
the ship's

436
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,063
environmental controls
from that station.

437
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:53,317
Life support was routed
to Jefferies Tube G-33, Deck 15.

438
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,445
Isn't that section
normally uninhabited?

439
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,990
Whoever did this,
encoded the procedure

440
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,741
so it wouldn't be detected.

441
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,800
It appears we
have intruders.

442
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,636
It looks like
a Varro scanning device.

443
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,182
Breathable oxygen is
confined to this chamber

444
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:27,267
and the area immediately
behind this hatch.

445
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,769
Stand back.

446
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,691
(<i> gasps</i> )

447
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,320
(<i> door beeps</i> )

448
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,780
Come in.

449
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,618
Work?

450
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,537
No. I'm just
tormenting myself

451
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,747
with what-ifs.

452
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,165
What if I had the chance

453
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,167
to actually see
that pulsar field,

454
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,211
go there instead
of just squinting

455
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,088
at it through
long-range sensors?

456
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,380
Too far off
your course, huh?

457
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,925
Too close to an
inhabited planet.

458
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,052
"They might make
contact with us."

459
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,386
"It's too dangerous."

460
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,055
It's always
the same thing.

461
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,224
The mighty
generational ship.

462
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,059
All we do is run away

463
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,436
from anything
that's different.

464
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,149
But that's
going to change.

465
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,401
I'm afraid I've
got some bad news.

466
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,368
I, uh...

467
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,287
I can't see you anymore.

468
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,331
Captain's orders.

469
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,584
How did she find out?

470
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,586
Something happened
to me this morning.

471
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,255
I had a strange
sensation,

472
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,423
and then my skin luminesced,
just like last night.

473
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,468
That shouldn't
have happened.

474
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,179
Our species are
too dissimilar.

475
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,680
What shouldn't
have happened?

476
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,767
We call it<i> olan'vora...</i>

477
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,351
"the shared heart."

478
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,479
When two of us merge...

479
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,107
You know
the biological connection

480
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,858
we had last night?

481
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,569
It becomes stronger.

482
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,322
It won't hurt you, Harry,

483
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,241
but it<i> will</i> change you.

484
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,202
It'll change both of us...

485
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,370
bring us closer.

486
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,040
So, can this process
be reversed?

487
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,459
In time...

488
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,422
if we stay away
from each other,

489
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,842
but if we don't...

490
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,510
the more we're together,

491
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,054
the harder it will be
to stop it.

492
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,851
But then, you have
your orders.

493
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,602
Orders.

494
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,857
It's an old story.

495
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,235
Boy meets girl from
the wrong side of the galaxy.

496
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,444
Boy loses girl.

497
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,072
And girl loses boy.

498
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,158
It's not like
we didn't know

499
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,784
this was going to end.

500
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,205
At least we had
two weeks.

501
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,082
Two great weeks.

502
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,837
Good-bye, Harry.

503
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,090
Bye.

504
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,890
Are you really going
to let me leave?

505
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,476
If that's what you want.

506
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,520
It's not.

507
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,067
CHAKOTAY:
Welcome aboard.

508
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,819
Normally we like to know
something about our guests

509
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,654
before we invite them
to join us.

510
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,531
Care to tell us
how you got here?

511
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,908
Through a docking port.

512
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,492
Your entry would
have triggered

513
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,744
an intruder alert.

514
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,830
Your technology is
easy to circumvent.

515
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,000
It doesn't matter
how I got here.

516
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,586
I'm not going back.

517
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,712
That remains to be seen.

518
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,130
You haven't explained

519
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,174
your reasons for leaving
the generational ship.

520
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,593
I'm not a criminal,
if that's what you think.

521
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,970
If you leave me at
the next inhabited system,

522
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,264
I'll manage from there.

523
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,681
Your next stop
is the brig

524
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,767
unless you answer
my questions.

525
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,147
I came aboard four days ago

526
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,524
with one of the work details.

527
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,567
Why?

528
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,195
Our ship's not the paradise

529
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,197
our leaders make it out to be.

530
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,033
There are thousands of us
who feel like prisoners, and...

531
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,159
others who...

532
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,413
Continue.

533
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,707
There are...

534
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,336
rumors of a movement...

535
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,546
people who want
to leave the ship.

536
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,007
Some of them are willing
to take violent action.

537
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,051
Can you be
more specific?

538
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,179
This is a trick.

539
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,222
A trick?

540
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,723
You're trying
to get me

541
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,724
to expose the movement.

542
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,017
Our leaders put you up to this.

543
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,103
On the contrary.

544
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,813
We haven't even
told them we found you.

545
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,065
You're lying.

546
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,691
I don't have time
for a debate.

547
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,152
You asked for asylum, fine.

548
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,861
I'll consider it,

549
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,114
but only if you
answer my questions.

550
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,531
What movement?

551
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,121
Contact the Varro
authorities.

552
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,291
Let them know we've found
one of their people,

553
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,209
and take him to the brig.

554
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,631
You can tell
the authorities

555
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,342
that I'm not
the only one.

556
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,635
There are hundreds
more like me.

557
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,360
CHAKOTAY:
Learn anything about
this supposed uprising?

558
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,863
Jippeq said the rumors
are just that-- rumors--

559
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,949
but he's questioning our
stowaway just to be certain.

560
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,453
New protocols for
working with the Varro.

561
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,330
After the incident
with Ensign Kim,

562
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,790
they insisted we keep
our crews segregated.

563
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,083
That's pretty severe.

564
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,502
Harry violated protocol.

565
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,337
Frankly, I understand
their position.

566
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,340
Is that why you
came down so hard on him?

567
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,218
A formal reprimand for being
intimate with a young woman?

568
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,552
I know it seems
a little extreme...

569
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,555
but I wanted to leave
a lasting impression.

570
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,225
Chalk it up to growing pains.

571
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,768
Well, he looks pained,
all right.

572
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,645
Until now,
he's had a spotless record.

573
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,649
Maybe you should reconsider.

574
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,151
What are you implying?

575
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,071
Are you angry
because Harry disobeyed orders

576
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,447
or because he let you down?

577
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,408
I set the same standards
for all my officers.

578
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,701
If I object
to one of your decisions,

579
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,287
you'll hear me out...
even insist I speak up.

580
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,456
You're my First Officer.
He's an Ensign.

581
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,624
He hasn't earned the right
to question my orders

582
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,085
whatever his personal views.

583
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,545
I see.

584
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,380
TORRES:
<i>Engineering to the Captain.</i>

585
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,339
Yes?

586
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,465
<i>We found something.</i>

587
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,758
On my way.

588
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,303
Do your officers
make a habit

589
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,971
of seducing the species
they encounter?

590
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,182
Certainly not, but
it's my understanding

591
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,975
that this relationship
was consensual.

592
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,601
I find that difficult
to believe.

593
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,355
We don't share your cavalier
attitude toward intimacy.

594
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,148
Our attitude is
anything but cavalier.

595
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,942
Ensign Kim has already
been reprimanded.

596
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,278
What about Tal?
What happens to her?

597
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,321
In our society, mating
is taken very seriously.

598
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,907
When two people choose each
other, the bonding is permanent.

599
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,534
They become
biochemically linked.

600
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,453
Separation is rare.

601
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,246
It induces illness,
sometimes fatal.

602
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,914
What's to become of Tal

603
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,500
when your Ensign flies off in
search of his next conquest?

604
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,878
TORRES:
Captain.

605
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,171
JANEWAY:
You found something?

606
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,548
We've detected
microfractures

607
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,383
in one of<i> Voyager's</i>
docking ports.

608
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,052
Microfractures? That's the
same problem we've been having.

609
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,137
A coincidence?

610
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,930
I had suspicions
that it wasn't.

611
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,348
Seven confirmed them.

612
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,850
Observe. Silicon-
based parasites

613
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,311
which feed on
duranium alloys.

614
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,313
Apparently, they
began replicating

615
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,398
on the Varro ship's hull
several months ago

616
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,066
and then migrated
to<i> Voyager.</i>

617
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,612
We analyzed them and found
artificial gene sequences.

618
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,322
The parasites
are synthetic.

619
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,116
They may have been created
by someone aboard your vessel.

620
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,368
Sabotage?
I don't believe it.

621
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,120
Perhaps not everyone

622
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,913
is content to be
in your collective.

623
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,179
(<i> communications beep</i> )

624
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,514
KIM:
<i>Tal, are you there?</i>

625
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,931
Harry?

626
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,017
<i>I can't keep</i>
<i>this com-link open.</i>

627
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,143
<i>Where are you?</i>

628
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,478
By my computer.

629
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,771
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Get ready for a ride.</i>

630
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,814
<i>I'm locking on.</i>

631
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,857
A ride?

632
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,026
(<i> gasps</i> )

633
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,328
Where are we?

634
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,454
A shuttlecraft.

635
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,955
Shuttlecraft?

636
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,207
A short-range vessel.

637
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,667
We use it for away missions.

638
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,545
We can go
anywhere we want?

639
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,546
Anywhere.

640
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,963
For a while anyway.

641
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,342
I'm not due back on<i> Voyager</i>
until 1900 hours.

642
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,178
They think I'm still out
repairing a hull fracture.

643
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,596
I finished early.

644
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,307
(<i> both laughing</i> )

645
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,226
You're a fugitive now.

646
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,229
How many protocols
did you break this time?

647
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,689
Let's see...

648
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,857
unauthorized use
of a shuttlecraft...

649
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,275
kidnapping...

650
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,777
Direct violation of
the Captain's orders...

651
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,156
I must be crazy.

652
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,366
I like you crazy.

653
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,369
(<i> laughs softly</i> )

654
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,745
Navigation?

655
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,914
Oh, careful.
That's the weapons array.

656
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,290
You know,
you almost vaporized

657
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,458
your living quarters.

658
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,710
(<i> laughs</i> )

659
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,878
Well, they could use
a good cleaning.

660
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,297
Let's go somewhere.

661
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,798
Where?

662
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,510
There's a nebula about
300,000 kilometers from here.

663
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,136
I've been watching it
on the sensors

664
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,847
for the past few days.

665
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,684
Oh, I would love to
see it with my own eyes.

666
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,935
Have a seat.

667
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,657
TAL:
Look at this--
a subspace vacuole

668
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,367
near the center of the cloud.

669
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,746
It must act as a
gravitational anchor.

670
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,748
There's so much
data here,

671
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,500
it'll take weeks
to analyze.

672
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,628
Do you have a
storage device?

673
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,337
We need to download
these readings.

674
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,464
What?

675
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,132
I've just never seen

676
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,176
anyone so excited about
a class-3 nebula before.

677
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,845
Maybe you've been taking them
for granted.

678
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,889
Maybe I have.

679
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,976
Don't stop.

680
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,939
You're beautiful
when you're scanning.

681
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,651
Is that what you say to every
girl you take for a ride?

682
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,152
I bet you've
left a trail

683
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,238
of broken hearts
across the Delta Quadrant.

684
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,364
Actually...

685
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,033
(<i> console beeping</i> )

686
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,703
Problem?

687
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,581
Stray radiation
from the nebula.

688
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,625
I thought it was
the proximity alarm.

689
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,043
You said we had
a couple of hours.

690
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,464
No one's going
to come looking for us.

691
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,007
Oh, you don't know
Commander Tuvok.

692
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,967
If he sees one electron
out of place,

693
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,511
he calls for Red Alert.

694
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,763
(<i> laughing</i> )

695
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,640
(<i> frustrated sigh</i> )

696
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,224
Here we are alone,

697
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:55,354
and all I can think about
is duty and orders.

698
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,606
Those things are important.

699
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,025
I think about them, too.

700
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,152
But sometimes
you need to follow

701
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,071
a different kind
of protocol.

702
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,574
If you believe in something
strongly enough,

703
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,242
you can't ignore it...

704
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,705
even if it means
breaking a few rules.

705
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,790
That's why I took
this shuttle,

706
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,375
but every time
I break a rule,

707
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:20,295
I feel like my skull
is going to decompress.

708
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,048
I'm like some kind
of... Borg drone--

709
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,924
programmed--

710
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,011
except I was designed to be
the perfect Starfleet officer.

711
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,847
Top of his class...

712
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,850
captain of the velocity
team, interstellar honors.

713
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,476
First field assignment--

714
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,812
Bridge officer
on a starship.

715
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,271
Every cadet's
dream come true.

716
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,109
You're not a program.

717
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,279
In fact, I envy your freedom.

718
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,032
I mean, your crew's mission--
to seek out life...

719
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,702
what could be
more liberating?

720
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,662
You explore the unknown.

721
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,668
Don't be afraid to explore
what's happening between us.

722
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,045
(<i> console beeping</i> )

723
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,510
Oh, no.

724
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,303
The<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

725
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,471
Commander Tuvok?

726
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,306
We're being hailed.

727
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:21,356
Well, you better answer them
before they open fire.

728
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,066
(<i> sighs</i> )

729
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,569
Kim here.

730
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,112
TUVOK:
<i>Ensign, you are</i>

731
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,239
<i>in direct violation</i>
<i>of the Captain's orders.</i>

732
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:33,201
<i>Return to</i> Voyager<i> immediately</i>
<i>and bring Derran Tal with you.</i>

733
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,287
Yes, sir, but why bring Tal?

734
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,664
<i>She's wanted</i>
<i>by the Varro authorities</i>

735
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,208
<i>regarding an act of sabotage.</i>

736
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,259
There's no point in lying.

737
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,844
We found a schematic
for the parasite

738
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,054
on your personal
database.

739
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,642
You realize this could
destroy our ship, our home?

740
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,811
To some of us,
it's more like a prison.

741
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,229
So you've resorted
to sabotage,

742
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,815
no doubt involving him.

743
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,024
Mr. Kim's complicity
remains to be proven.

744
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,235
He had nothing to do
with our movement.

745
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,862
"Movement"?
Tell them.

746
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,489
JIPPEQ:
It's none
of their concern.

747
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,407
If you want our help,
you'll need to explain.

748
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,576
She's referring to a small
group of dissidents...

749
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,578
It's not a small group.
There are hundreds of us.

750
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,079
What are you trying
to achieve?

751
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,706
Our freedom!

752
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,250
The right to live as we choose,
to go where we choose.

753
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,211
TUVOK:
How will you accomplish that
if your vessel is destroyed?

754
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,171
We're not trying

755
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,213
to destroy it. 

756
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,090
We're trying to dismantle it.

757
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,134
The parasites
weren't placed randomly.

758
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,886
They're targeting
the linkages

759
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,304
between segments.

760
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,556
Each segment will
become its own ship.

761
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:40,018
People can decide
whether to go or stay.

762
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,436
You're destroying the work

763
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,356
of every generation
that came before you.

764
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,359
Our ship isn't just
a collection of modules.

765
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,778
It's an expression
of unity, tradition.

766
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,029
For the sake
of our history,

767
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,489
we must respect
the rights of...

768
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,491
Of the majority.
Yes!

769
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,159
What about the rights
of the minority?

770
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,705
Tal... if those segments
come apart,

771
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,957
there could be
decompressive explosions...

772
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,834
most likely casualties.

773
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,418
Is that what you want?

774
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,421
You know more about
the parasites than we do.

775
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,757
You could help us.
Captain, she's a criminal.

776
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,093
And maybe your only chance
of stopping a catastrophe.

777
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,555
Set up a datalink
with<i> Voyager.</i>

778
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,598
We'll do what we can
from our end.

779
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,266
Tal...

780
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,813
I'll help you
slow down the parasites,

781
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,148
so you can evacuate
the segments in danger...

782
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,984
nothing more.

783
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,235
Let's get started.

784
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,116
Captain...

785
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,243
Stow it, Ensign.

786
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,786
Right now,
the only thing standing

787
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,538
between you and the brig
is this report.

788
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,748
The Doctor's bio-scans

789
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,416
confirm that you and Tal
have developed

790
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,376
some sort
of biochemical bond.

791
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,127
Clearly, it's affected
your behavior,

792
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,923
so I have to assume that's
why you disobeyed my orders.

793
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,382
Report to Sick Bay.

794
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,426
You'll be confined there
until this is over.

795
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,013
Captain!

796
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,681
I told you to report
for treatment!

797
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,350
I don't want
treatment!

798
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,185
(<i> quietly</i> ):
In my ready room.

799
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,108
You've got 30 seconds

800
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,902
before I have Tuvok
drag you to Sick Bay.

801
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,152
Captain, I am not sick.

802
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,613
I didn't disobey your orders

803
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,740
because I'm under
some alien influence.

804
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,992
I disobeyed your orders
because Tal and I are in love,

805
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,911
and it's not right for
you to keep us apart.

806
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,370
Listen to yourself.

807
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,539
You don't sound anything
like the Harry Kim I know.

808
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,541
Good. I have served on
this ship for five years

809
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,001
and said, "yes, ma'am"

810
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,129
to every one of your
orders, but not this time.

811
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,672
You're willing to
risk your rank,

812
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,133
your career over this?

813
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,387
Have you ever been
in love, Captain?

814
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,680
Your point?

815
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,390
Did your skin ever flush

816
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,850
when you were near
another person?

817
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,895
Did your stomach
ever feel like someone

818
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,688
hollowed it out
with a knife

819
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,731
when you were apart?

820
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,357
Did your throat ever swell

821
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,776
when you realized
it was over?

822
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,736
Seven of Nine...

823
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,405
Seven of Nine told me
love's like a disease.

824
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,742
Well, maybe it is--
pheromones, endorphins,

825
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,913
chemicals in our blood
changing our responses,

826
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,372
physical discomfort,

827
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,249
but any way you look
at it, it's still love.

828
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,252
For the sake of argument,
let's say you're right.

829
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,379
Your feelings for
Tal are no different

830
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,673
than mine for-- what?

831
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,299
The man I was engaged
to marry?

832
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,552
Well, I lost him,
and you're going to lose Tal.

833
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,179
You know that.

834
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,349
What the Doctor is offering you
is a way to ease the pain.

835
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,561
That man you were
going to marry--

836
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,065
if you could have
just taken a hypospray

837
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,692
to make yourself
stop loving him

838
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,652
so that it didn't
hurt so much

839
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,487
when you were
away from him,

840
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,948
would you have
done that?

841
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,240
(<i> explosion</i> )

842
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,118
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Captain to the Bridge.</i>

843
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,207
We're detecting structural
breaches on the Varro ship.

844
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,251
Take your station.

845
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,630
Their shields are weakening.

846
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,008
One of the junctions
is about to decompress.

847
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,258
On screen.

848
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,930
Mr. Paris, release
the docking clamps.

849
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,264
Back us away.

850
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,850
Docking controls are off-line.

851
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,434
I can't break us free.

852
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,660
TUVOK:
Their shields
are continuing to weaken.

853
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,204
The superstructure
will collapse

854
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:28,914
in less than
three minutes.

855
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,791
If that happens while
we're still docked...

856
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,293
Keep trying to break free.
Janeway to Varro control room.

857
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,088
<i>What's your status?</i>

858
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:37,964
Tal was able
to slow the parasites' growth

859
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,298
with a polaron surge,

860
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,218
but the junctions
are still destabilizing.

861
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:45,180
<i>How much longer until you've</i>
<i>evacuated the affected areas?</i>

862
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,057
We need another two minutes
at least.

863
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,851
I've got the docking controls
back on line.

864
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,269
Initiate decompression sequence.

865
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,854
Wait. If we stay
where we are,

866
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,190
and extend<i> Voyager's</i>
structural integrity field

867
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,566
around the Varro ship,

868
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,276
we could buy them
another minute or two.

869
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,028
They could finish
the evacuation.

870
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,613
However,
if an explosion occurs

871
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,322
while both ships
are inside the field,

872
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,366
neither vessel will survive.

873
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,160
We can do it, Captain.

874
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,080
Keep us where we are.

875
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,248
Janeway to Engineering.

876
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,791
<i>Torres here.</i>

877
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,668
Divert all available power
to the integrity field

878
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,836
and extend it around

879
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,004
the Varro ship.

880
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,422
<i>Understood.</i>

881
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,635
<i>Voyager</i> is reinforcing
our shields.

882
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,178
Surprising,
isn't it?

883
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,345
A ship of outsiders

884
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,347
risking their lives
to save ours.

885
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,975
They're unusual people.

886
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,309
Or maybe the galaxy

887
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,103
isn't as hostile as you think.

888
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,647
All junctions are clear.

889
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,192
What are you
waiting for?

890
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,944
Tell<i> Voyager</i>
to move away.

891
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:43,280
I'm initiating
another polaron surge.

892
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,823
We can destroy
these parasites.

893
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,365
It's too late.

894
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,660
You'll only destroy<i> Voyager</i>
along with our ship.

895
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,082
Let them go.

896
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,959
Let us go.

897
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,632
Tal to<i> Voyager.</i>

898
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,592
<i>The evacuation's complete.</i>

899
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,680
<i>Disengage your structural field</i>
<i>and move to a safe distance.</i>

900
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,974
Releasing docking clamps.

901
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,588
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

902
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,424
<i>Most of the Varro</i>
<i>have opted to stay together</i>

903
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,844
<i>traveling in separate ships,</i>
<i>but the dissident group</i>

904
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,762
<i>has been granted permission</i>
<i>to break away</i>

905
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,181
<i>and find their own path.</i>

906
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,225
<i>We wish them luck.</i>

907
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,392
(<i> door beeps</i> )

908
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,144
Come in.

909
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,027
I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

910
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,404
The Captain gave me permission
to say good-bye.

911
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,657
How are you feeling?

912
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,826
Lovesick.

913
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,953
Me, too.

914
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,413
Will you manage?

915
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:19,209
We have medications.

916
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,878
I'll recover
eventually.

917
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,217
So, where
are you going?

918
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,223
The Natori system.

919
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,474
A pair of binary stars

920
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,394
caught in each
other's gravity.

921
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:40,355
We passed within
a parsec three months ago,

922
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,815
and now we're going
back for a real look.

923
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,650
Do me one favor.

924
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,363
Anything.

925
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,910
Next time you run across
a class-3 nebula,

926
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,661
think of me.

927
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,918
Chronic sleep loss,
acute gastroenteritis--

928
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,420
you must feel awful,

929
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,589
yet you're still
refusing treatment?

930
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,841
Captain, just the person
I wanted to see.

931
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,468
This nonsense has
gone on long enough.

932
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,220
Order Mr. Kim to
take his medicine.

933
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,721
Is his condition fatal?

934
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,223
That's hardly
the point.

935
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,183
Will he recover
without taking his medicine?

936
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,852
Yes, but it could take
weeks, even months.

937
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:24,357
Well, then, if Mr. Kim
wants to suffer...

938
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,067
Sometimes I think
everyone on this ship

939
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,445
has been possessed
by alien hormones.

940
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:29,904
Would you excuse us, please?

941
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,908
Thank you.

942
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,868
Oh, don't thank me.
I have no intention

943
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,496
of relieving you of your duties,
no matter how lousy you feel.

944
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,622
I understand.

945
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,874
And the reprimand
still stands.

946
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,797
I've been thinking
about how I reacted

947
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,882
to your relationship with Tal.

948
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:54,220
You reacted like
any Captain would.

949
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,265
Probably, but I
can't help wondering

950
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,893
if my response would
have been the same

951
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,939
if it had been, say,
Tom Paris instead of you.

952
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,649
Oh, don't get me wrong.

953
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:11,446
I still would have been
angry and disappointed, but...

954
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,948
I wouldn't have
been surprised.

955
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,702
Because Ensign Kim
doesn't break the rules.

956
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,541
The truth is, Harry...

957
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,377
I think about
you differently

958
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,919
than the rest
of the crew.

959
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,629
Which isn't to suggest
that I don't care

960
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,841
deeply about each
of them, but...

961
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,052
you came to me fresh
out of the Academy,

962
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,345
wide-eyed with excitement

963
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:38,973
about your first
deep space assignment.

964
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,393
From that first day,
I've always felt

965
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,895
more protective of
you than the others.

966
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,858
I appreciate that...

967
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,861
but that
was five years ago.

968
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,324
I've changed.

969
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,451
Yes, you have.

970
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:03,164
Maybe I'm not
the perfect officer anymore.

971
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,458
Maybe not...

972
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,796
but you're
a better man.

973
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,396
Last call.

974
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,315
There's a bowl of soup
in storage,

975
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,317
and I left
the replicator on line.

976
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,860
Thanks.

977
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,862
Good night.

978
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,079
Oh, I was just closing
up for the evening,

979
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,289
but if you
need anything...

980
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,498
I'm here
to see Ensign Kim.

981
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,959
Oh. Good luck.

982
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,340
Ensign.

983
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,383
Hmm?

984
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,511
Thank you.

985
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,554
For what?

986
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,763
You completed several

987
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,723
of my astrometric scans
this morning.

988
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,225
You're welcome.

989
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:07,853
I had some time
between duty shifts.

990
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,356
Besides, it kept me occupied.

991
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,858
You are attempting
to distract yourself

992
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,777
from your emotional damage.

993
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,238
I wish I could say
it was working.

994
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,949
A treatment to relieve
your condition was available

995
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,867
and yet you refused.

996
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,911
I've got a disease,

997
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,414
but I'm willing to
live with the symptoms.

998
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,999
Doesn't make much
sense does it?

999
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,173
I assumed that romantic love
was a human weakness,

1000
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,759
but clearly it can also be
a source of strength.

1001
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,472
Perhaps my analogy
was flawed.

1002
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:44,765
Love is not a disease.

1003
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,021
Get well soon.
