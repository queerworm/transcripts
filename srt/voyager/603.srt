1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,755
Torres to Voyager.

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,214
I could use a little help here.

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,633
CHAKOTAY:
What's your status?

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,426
I'm approaching your position,

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,762
but that ion storm
blew out my deflector field.

6
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,014
I've lost helm control,

7
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,809
and I'm venting plasma
from the port nacelle.

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,561
We're modifying a tractor pulse
to slow you down.

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,146
Acknowledged.

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,690
The arresting fields
are in place.

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,107
You're clear to land.

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,526
JANEWAY:
Hold on, B'Elanna.

13
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,152
This is going to be bumpy.

14
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,699
( grunts )

15
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,209
B'Elanna?

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,252
Oh.

17
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,630
Are you alive?

18
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,298
You tell me.

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,514
You've got
a mild concussion.

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,308
That's the best thing
that's happened
to me all day.

21
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,856
When I give you an order,
I expect you to follow it.

22
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,774
I told you to
return to Voyager,

23
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,527
not chase the probe
into the center
of an ion storm.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,572
We only have one
multispatial probe.
I didn't want to lose it.

25
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,448
We only have
one B'Elanna Torres.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,158
I don't want to lose her,
either.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,078
Understood.

28
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,247
Lanna.

29
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,584
I'm glad you made it back
in one piece.

30
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,335
Did you just call me "Lanna"?

31
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,796
I suppose I did.

32
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:31,132
That's what my mother
used to call me.

33
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,053
Well, then, I'm in good company.

34
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,813
( door chimes )

35
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,147
Come in.

36
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,736
Feeling better?

37
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,446
I've felt worse.

38
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,698
I found something you might
be interested in.

39
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,492
It's what my ancestors called
a "monkey wrench."

40
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,453
It was lodged
in your port nacelle.

41
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,121
How did it get there?

42
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,748
Judging by your sensor logs,

43
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,291
it looks like you ran into it

44
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,543
after your deflector field
collapsed.

45
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,922
But the big question is:
How did it get in this quadrant?

46
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,506
What do you mean?

47
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,969
What?

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,553
It's Klingon.

49
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,098
And it's old.
That's about all we know.

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,309
Looks like the Klingons beat
Starfleet to the Delta Quadrant

51
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,770
by a few hundred years.

52
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,857
You may be holding the most
important archaeological find
in Klingon history.

53
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,902
Remind me to plant a flag
on behalf of the Empire.

54
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:35,155
You know,
the simplest explanation

55
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,616
is that the Borg assimilated
a bird-of-prey

56
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,451
somewhere in
the Alpha Quadrant,

57
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,745
and they blew it out an
airlock on their way home.

58
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,955
Maybe so.

59
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,836
In any case, it makes
a nice souvenir.

60
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,447
( distant yelling )

61
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,325
( cacophony of
Klingon voices)

62
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,042
( voices stop )

63
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,781
Harry, it bled, it screamed.

64
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,866
There's got to be
some explanation.

65
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,534
Hey, I've got
one for you.

66
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,995
You hit your head harder
than you thought.

67
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,830
I wasn't hallucinating.

68
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,915
Now, run a submolecular scan.

69
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,168
How many more scans
are we going to run?

70
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,086
There is nothing there.

71
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,421
No fluid or vapor residue.

72
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,549
We may find some irregularities
at the atomic level.

73
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,802
It's a hunk of metal.

74
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,264
What you heard
may have had nothing to do
with this artifact.

75
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,309
Maybe the com system
picked up some stray signal
from a pulsar--

76
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,145
I don't know.
A pulsar that speaks Klingon.

77
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,565
( chuckles ):
Okay, B'Elanna, there
probably is some explanation

78
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,485
for what happened,
but it's 0300 hours.

79
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,279
I'm tired, you're tired.

80
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,572
Let's just stick
this thing in a
containment field

81
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,365
and deal with it
in the morning.

82
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,909
NEELIX:
Ah! Just the daughter

83
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,329
of the Empire
I've been looking for.

84
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,747
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you

85
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,167
on your discovery
of the Klingon artifact.

86
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,127
Neelix, I ran into it
with a shuttle.

87
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,921
Some of the greatest discoveries
in Klingon history

88
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,422
were accidents.

89
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,799
When Sarpek the Fearless

90
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,551
unearthed the Knife of Kiromm

91
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,678
he was searching
for his lost targ.

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,722
( laughing ):
Isn't that amazing?

93
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,058
I've been doing
some research.
Why?

94
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,642
Well, I'm planning
a celebration.

95
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,435
This... must be
the treasure.

96
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,022
Neelix, look, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

97
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,150
but since I'm the only Klingon
onboard, there's really no point
in throwing a party.

98
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,737
Oh, nonsense.
This artifact isn't just
a testament to Klingon spirit.

99
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,073
It's a piece
of the Alpha Quadrant--

100
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,449
a symbol
of Voyager's home,

101
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,618
and that's just as worthy
of celebration and song

102
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,246
as finding some old knife.

103
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,413
Man's got
a point.

104
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,583
Besides, I've already
replicated five barrels
of bloodwine.

105
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,168
I'm not going to let them
go to waste.

106
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,879
Festivities begin
at 1900 hours.

107
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,923
Oh! Uh, I
almost forgot.

108
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,716
As guest of honor,
you're gonna be expected

109
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,011
to say a few words
on behalf of your people.

110
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,722
Sounds like you got
a big day ahead of you.

111
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,183
You should probably
get some rest.

112
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,562
All right, all right,
let's call it a night.

113
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,189
Thank you.

114
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,778
TUVOK:
Do not underestimate
the power of the mind.

115
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:29,283
The artifact was a catalyst for
your already active imagination.

116
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,619
It served as an unwelcome
reminder of your ancestry--

117
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,955
the self-loathing you experience

118
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,498
when you look in the mirror
and see a Klingon.

119
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,751
Who said anything
about self-loathing?

120
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,628
You despise being Klingon.

121
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,213
It's no secret.

122
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,799
What you experienced
in your quarters

123
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,803
was a subconscious manifestation
of that hatred.

124
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,597
The blood in your veins,

125
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,975
the voices
of your ancestors--

126
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,978
all symbols of
your Klingon heritage.

127
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,230
And when the blood
disappeared,

128
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:04,901
that was, what?
Me trying to vaporize
that part of myself?

129
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:11,283
Yes. But the essence of
who you are-- the artifact
itself-- remained.

130
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,285
And the moral
of the story is...?

131
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,662
Quite simple.
That despite your efforts

132
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,414
to become something else,

133
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,334
whether it be Starfleet
or Maquis,

134
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,253
your Klingon nature
continues to assert itself.

135
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,464
That's an intriguing theory.

136
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,383
Perhaps we should forego
your meditation

137
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,469
in favor of
a different exercise.

138
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,720
Fine by me.

139
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,684
This should be
interesting.

140
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,687
Feel the weight of
the bat'leth in your hands.

141
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,609
Describe the first thought
that enters your mind.

142
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,490
It's a clumsy weapon,
overstated,

143
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
like everything
else Klingon.

144
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,205
You can't see the elegance
of its design,

145
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,081
because of your hatred.

146
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,250
I don't hate Klingons.

147
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,919
It's a warrior's blade...

148
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,796
crafted for precision

149
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,257
and balance.
Observe.

150
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,819
Is this your idea of therapy?!

151
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,239
Listen to yourself whine
like a Ferengi.

152
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,616
pahtk!
You're not worthy of
the blood in your veins.

153
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,537
A true Klingon would try
to kill me where I stand.

154
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,163
What the hell has
gotten into you?

155
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,166
This exercise is over.

156
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,085
You are dismissed,
Lieutenant,

157
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:49,130
and take your dishonor
with you.

158
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,057
DOCTOR:

I fail to see the merit
of learning a Klingon
drinking song.

164
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,866
It's not about
drinking, Seven.

165
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,161
It's about saluting the noble
deeds of our ancestors

166
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,540
and honoring those
who fell in battle.

167
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:28,420
Think "Qapla'!"
Think "Long live
the Empire!"

168
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,004
SEVEN:
Think again.

169
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,839

overdoing it a bit,

170
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,384

179
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,871
He said, "Eat this
or he'll force it down
the gullet of your corpse."

180
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,791
No offense.
Oh, none taken.

181
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,794
So this is replicated,
right?

182
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,630
Unfortunately.

183
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,175
And how do you get it to...
move?

184
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,719
I used a kinesthetic agent
to give it a little oomph.

185
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,058
Is it just me,

186
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,561
or has everyone
gone Klingon-happy?

187
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,356
Oh, come on, B'Elanna.
They're all doing this
for you.

188
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,066
Well, then they don't
know me very well.

189
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,027
And if you even think
of joining in

190
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,987
on this "embrace your heritage"
nonsense,

191
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,032
I swear I'll rip out your tongue
and wear it as a belt.

192
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,827
Oh, no... there's not
a lot of Klingon in you.

193
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,914
I inherited the forehead and
the bad attitude-- that's it.

194
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,791
( laughter )

195
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,131
She would have
loved all this.

196
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,633
Your mother?

197
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,177
She was so obsessed

198
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,846
with Klingon ritual, myths.

199
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,058
It used to drive
my father and me crazy.

200
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,895
Did I ever tell you that she
put me in a Klingon monastery?

201
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,690
Ah. You're kidding.
It was after their
marriage ended.

202
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,900
She pulled me out of
the Federation school

203
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,904
in order to teach me...
honor and discipline.

204
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,990
Hmm... out of the plasma cooker
into the fire.

205
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:25,119
She prayed to Kahless every day
to guide me in the ways
of the warrior.

206
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,996
I guess he wasn't listening.

207
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,415
( tapping )

208
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

209
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,710
could I have
your attention, please?

210
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,752
I hate to interrupt
the festivities,

211
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,131
but before I turn the floor
over to our resident Klingon,

212
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,217
I'd like to say
a few words.

213
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,512
This is a great day
for the Klingon Empire--

214
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,432
a day when we honor
their ancestors.

215
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:50,186
( slowing and echoing ):
Those warriors whose deeds
of valor and glory...

216
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:55,358
( echoing and fading ):
led them to the Delta Quadrant.

217
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:01,615
( slow and distorted ):
May they live on
in song and story.

218
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,366
( heartbeat thumping )

219
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,910
( Janeway continues
indistinctly )

220
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,843
( heartbeat thumping )

221
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,388
( indistinct )

222
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,564
Captain!

223
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,399
( yelling and grunting )

224
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,569
( groans )

225
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,624
legh soH va Gre'thor!

226
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,167
( growls )

227
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,878
( yelling )

228
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,507
( thunder cracks )

229
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,642
Where am I?

230
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,393
Silence.

231
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,772
The dead ask no questions.

232
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,072
( thunder rumbles )

233
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,158
( grunting )

234
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,369
Computer, end program!

235
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,371
Qem nuH meq!

236
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,247
Let go of me!

237
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,002
( thunder cracks )

238
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,086
( gasps )

239
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,714
Wait... wait...

240
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,881
'uch ghaH.

241
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,591
Uh, wait...

242
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,176
( grunts )

243
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,470
( yelling in pain )

244
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,805
( growling )

245
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,682
( gasping )

246
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,269
She won't take the mark.

247
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,606
What the hell is going on?

248
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,608
Qusdaq. ba'daH.

249
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,860
( grunts )

250
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,070
mag hoshonaH nes'a.

251
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,239
Where am I?

252
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,617
You should know;
you're half Klingon.

253
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,953
Enlighten me.

254
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,334
This is the Barge
of the Dead.

255
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,462
Our dishonored souls are
being taken to Gre'thor.

256
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,506
Klingon hell is a myth.

257
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,759
That's what I thought--

258
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,762
just a foolish superstition.

259
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,097
Imagine my surprise.

260
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,352
But I was on Voyager
with my crew.

261
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,438
That was the naj--

262
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,775
the dream before dying.

263
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,193
When we can't accept
that we've died,

264
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,739
we create the illusion of life
to hold on to.

265
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,449
( Klingon voices )

266
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,622
He slaughtered my friends.

267
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,626
No. He slaughtered
the dream.

268
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:05,005
He dragged you
from the illusion of life.

269
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,009
This is where you belong.

270
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,598
( distant clamoring voices )

271
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,646
What is that?

272
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,731
It's the kos'kari.

273
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,693
They'll try to lure you to them.
Don't listen.

274
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,821
( clamoring voices
continue )

275
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,823
CHAKOTAY ( distantly):
B'Elanna, are you there?

276
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,324
JANEWAY:
Lieutenant, can you hear me?

277
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,951
PARIS:
Help us find you!

278
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,286
TORRES:
Tom? Chakotay?

279
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,246
It's not
your friends!

280
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,291
jiH qoy soH!

281
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,876
( splashing )

282
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,712
( screaming )

283
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,093
( screaming )

284
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,722
( creatures squealing )

285
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,434
There are things here
worse than death.

286
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,187
You.

287
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,325
Is this the mongrel
child you spoke of?

288
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,495
Yes. The one whose face
would not bear the mark.

289
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:26,504
B'Elanna, daughter of Miral...

290
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,422
it's not your time.

291
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,383
How do you know my name?

292
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,345
You've come close
to boarding this ship
many times.

293
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,015
I remember the first.

294
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,017
You were a child.

295
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,020
Your mother took you
to the Sea of Gatan.

296
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,523
Your curiosity was
as deep as the water.

297
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,485
I fell in.
I almost drowned.

298
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,739
When your mother breathed life
back into your lungs

299
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,240
she told you about me.

300
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,076
So you're supposed to be Kortar.

301
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,496
Ah... you remember me.

302
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:05,292
I remember
the myth of Kortar,
the first Klingon.

303
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,795
He destroyed the gods
who created him.

304
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,423
And as punishment,
I was condemned to ferry

305
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:14,010
the souls of the dishonored
to Gre'thor.

306
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:23,477
I may have believed in you
as a child, but not anymore.

307
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,563
If you didn't
still believe,

308
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,815
you wouldn't be here.

309
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,820
( chuckling )

310
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,238
Foolish girl.

311
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,783
( grunts )

312
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,952
You cannot harm me.

313
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,037
I'm already dead.

314
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,663
( grunts )

315
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,427
What's happening?

316
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,473
The soul of another
dishonored warrior
is being delivered.

317
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,812
kot'mah soH
Gre'thor!

318
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,063
Qapla.

319
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:13,987
Mother.

320
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,696
( chuckling )

321
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,491
( grunts )

322
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,743
It's all right.

323
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,286
You're safe.

324
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,753
Your shuttle was drifting
on the trailing edge
of an ion storm.

325
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,048
You lost life support.
We found you just in time.

326
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,387
But I got
through the storm.

327
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,975
I remember crashing
into the Shuttle Bay.

328
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,936
When we tractored
your shuttle
back to Voyager,

329
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,521
you were in a coma.

330
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,481
We almost lost you.

331
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,695
The Klingon artifact...

332
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,237
Artifact?

333
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,910
My hand...

334
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,875
You took quite
a beating out there--

335
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,461
more than your fair share
of cuts and bruises.

336
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,437
( door chimes )

337
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,356
Come in.

338
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,654
How are you feeling?

339
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,699
Um... a little out of place.

340
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,117
Would you like to talk about it?

341
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,827
Yes...

342
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,038
and no.

343
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,458
Let me know when you decide.

344
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,128
I don't know
how to say this
without sounding crazy.

345
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,220
Try.

346
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,227
Do you believe
in an afterlife?

347
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,896
I accept there are
things in the universe

348
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,481
than can't be scanned
with a tricorder.

349
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,777
What happened
to you out there?

350
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,073
I think...

351
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,908
I died.

352
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,953
I died, and I was on
the Barge of the Dead,

353
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,413
in the Klingon afterlife.

354
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,666
Klingon mythology has
been ingrained in you
since you were a child.

355
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,335
It's not surprising
you experienced
some of those images

356
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,004
while you were unconscious.

357
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,298
I saw my mother, Chakotay.

358
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,220
If it was real, then she's dead.

359
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,763
B'Elanna...

360
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,849
your mother...
the Barge of the Dead...

361
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,393
these are just symbols.

362
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,520
It's your subconscious mind
trying to tell you something.

363
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,857
Tell me what?
That my mother is going to hell?

364
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,318
You need time
to digest what you experienced.

365
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,403
You have to interpret
the symbols

366
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,281
and search
for their meaning.

367
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,492
What if there is no symbolism
to interpret?

368
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,619
What if the afterlife is real?

369
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,913
I'm an engineer.

370
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,665
My whole life,
I've immersed myself

371
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,293
in science and...
and schematics.

372
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,588
But what if it's time
to start looking beyond that?

373
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,885
My grandfather used to...

374
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,847
think he could transform himself
into a wolf,

375
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,517
so that he could venture out
to explore the spirit realm.

376
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,477
It was real to him.

377
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,689
As real as what you experienced
was to you,

378
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,900
but that doesn't mean
he grew hair all over his body

379
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,320
and walked around
on all fours.

380
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:54,081
My mother has been
on my mind a lot lately.

381
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,917
We just had a big anniversary.

382
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,212
It's been ten years...

383
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,672
since we talked.

384
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,177
But it was so real.

385
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,557
I could taste the blood
in the air.

386
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,309
I could feel the wind.

387
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,563
I was seasick
from the rocking of the boat.

388
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,280
( sighs )

389
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,327
Hi.

390
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,620
Hi.

391
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,206
What are you reading?

392
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,999
The paq'batlh.

393
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,793
It's a sacred
Klingon scroll.

394
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,088
Find anything?

395
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,340
You don't want to know.

396
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,759
Oh, come on.
It can't be that bad.

397
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,261
You want to bet?

398
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,930
I found out
why my mother

399
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,099
is on her way
to Gre'thor.

400
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,310
It's because
I sent her there.

401
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,686
What do you mean?

402
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,564
The sins of the child.

403
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,318
She's being punished
for my dishonor.

404
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,029
I turned my back
on everything Klingon,

405
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,615
and now she has
to pay the price.

406
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,784
B'Elanna, you
can't even be sure

407
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,494
your mother is dead,
much less blame yourself

408
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,623
for what happens to her
in some afterlife.

409
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,666
Look at this.

410
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,961
The Eleventh Tome of Klavek.

411
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,504
It's a story about
Kahless returning
from the dead...

412
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,174
"still bearing a wound
from the afterlife"--

413
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,802
a warning that what
he experienced wasn't a dream.

414
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,679
The same thing
happened to me.
B'Elanna, this...

415
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,099
And the only reason
Kahless was in the afterlife
to begin with

416
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,310
was to rescue his brother
from the Barge of the Dead

417
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,936
and deliver him
to Sto-Vo-Kor.

418
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,397
Okay.
Don't you see?

419
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,191
I have a chance
to rescue my mother

420
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,403
if I can accept responsibility
for her dishonor

421
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,989
before she passes through
the gates of Gre'thor.

422
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,243
I have to go back.

423
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,913
Whoa. Wait a minute.
What do you mean,
"go back"?

424
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,540
I can't let her suffer
for what I've done.

425
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,837
It's the only way.

426
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:09,467
B'Elanna, I respect
what you believe in,

427
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,552
but you're starting
to scare me.

428
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,638
I'm scaring myself.

429
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,310
TORRES:
It's a controlled
procedure.

430
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,354
I'll be under
constant supervision.

431
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,148
The Doctor can simulate
the conditions of the ion storm.

432
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,442
He's agreed to help me,
but only with your permission.

433
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,487
I'm still not inclined
to grant your request.

434
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,615
Are you telling me
that I can't pursue
my spiritual beliefs?

435
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,826
B'Elanna, I'm not
going to let you
turn this into a debate

436
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,372
about freedom of worship.
But that's what it is.

437
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:43,709
There's a limit to how far
I'll let religious practices go
aboard this ship.

438
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,629
If your belief system
required you to sacrifice
a child to your gods,

439
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,256
I wouldn't
allow that, either.

440
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,175
That's an absurd example.

441
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,593
You want to simulate
a near-death experience,

442
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,929
so you can revisit
the Barge of Death,

443
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,098
and you're telling me
what's absurd?

444
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,892
Bottom line, B'Elanna--

445
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,186
I'm not going to let you
risk your life for this.

446
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,189
Captain, please.
Request denied.

447
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,109
What I do with my own life
is one thing,

448
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,611
but to know that I have
condemned my mother...

449
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,447
that because of what I've done,
she's...

450
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,366
I appreciate what you're
trying to say, B'Elanna,

451
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,202
but whatever you experienced,
it wasn't real.

452
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:21,788
It doesn't matter
if you think it was real.
It was real to me.

453
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,797
Whatever it was, it changed me.

454
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,550
I can't ignore that.

455
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,261
I need to confront
what's happened.

456
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,680
I'm sorry.

457
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,018
You know, you're just like her.

458
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,186
Lieutenant?

459
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,355
My mother.

460
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,524
You're as dedicated
to Starfleet principles

461
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,401
as she was to
Klingon honor.

462
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,948
I know that we haven't
always seen eye to eye,

463
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,575
but despite our differences,

464
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,535
you helped me
become a good officer

465
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,787
and I'd like to think
that you're proud of me for it.

466
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,497
I am.

467
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,252
My mother never had the chance
to be proud of me.

468
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,923
I'd like her to know me
the way you do.

469
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:23,976
I don't want her to die
thinking of me as a disgrace.

470
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,354
You have
to let me do this.

471
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,361
I can't believe
the Captain
is allowing this.

472
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,029
One minute,
you're in a coma.

473
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,781
The next, you're
a born-again Klingon?

474
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,116
I-I just don't get it.

475
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,909
I'm not sure
I get it, either.

476
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,786
I just know this is something
I have to do.

477
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,413
There's got to be
an easier way

478
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,039
for you to explore
your spirituality.

479
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,083
Go to church, or something?

480
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,460
It wouldn't be enough.

481
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,253
Look, I'll read
the scrolls.

482
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,712
I'll learn Klingon.

483
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,424
We'll figure this out...
together.

484
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,926
Next time.

485
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,348
I just hope
there is a next time.

486
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,475
There will be.

487
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,605
Report.

488
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:12,232
I've examined
the sensor logs from
the shuttle mission.

489
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,234
I should be able to re-create
the exact conditions

490
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,195
that triggered
her near-death experience.

491
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,572
Good. B'Elanna?

492
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,574
I'm ready.

493
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,954
Be careful.

494
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,633
You'll have an hour to do
whatever it is you need to do.

495
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,843
At the first sign of trouble,
we're bringing you out.

496
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,094
Understood?

497
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:55,359
Computer...
erect an isolation field
around the Surgical Bay.

498
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,319
Decrease oxygen concentration

499
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,573
within the force field
by 27 percent.

500
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,200
Begin ionizing
the enclosed atmosphere

501
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,327
to 5,000 particles
per cubic meter.

502
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,875
She's unconscious.
PARIS: Neural activity

503
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,753
is decreasing to 87 percent...

504
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,714
62 percent...

505
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,717
( alarm beeping )

506
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,176
Synaptic function
is failing.

507
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,095
Compensating.

508
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,681
( console beeping )
Neural activity
is nominal.

509
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,015
She's not breathing.

510
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,642
She's still alive.

511
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,227
Her lungs are taking in
just enough oxygen

512
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,187
to keep her brain
from necrotizing.

513
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,195
Qapla', B'Elanna.

514
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,742
(thunder cracks )

515
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,325
KLINGON:
suS'ag Gre'thor qay.

516
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,160
( thunder cracks )

517
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:01,985
Mother.

518
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,199
Stay away.
You are an illusion.

519
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,243
You're a kos'kari
trying to lure me away.

520
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,121
Mother, it's me.

521
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,123
It's me.

522
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,125
B'Elanna?

523
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,752
No.

524
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,215
Then you died as well?

525
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,967
I've come to lift
your dishonor.

526
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,846
But you don't believe
in Sto-Vo-Kor.

527
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,265
A lot's happened since
the last time I saw you.

528
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,059
I've changed.

529
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,062
Not enough.

530
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:42,025
It was you who brought
this damnation upon me.

531
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:47,740
If you hadn't
tried to, to force me
to become a warrior...

532
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,950
I tried to guide you
in the ways of a Klingon.

533
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,661
You tried a
little too hard.

534
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,246
If you had listened to me

535
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,748
when you were younger,

536
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,624
we wouldn't be on
the Barge of the Dead.

537
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,836
You were always running away.

538
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,672
You drove me away...

539
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:07,008
the same way you
drove away my father.

540
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,596
He abandoned us.

541
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,723
You pushed him to the point
where he couldn't bear

542
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:17,102
to be around anything
Klingon... including me.

543
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,230
I wanted to give you honor.

544
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,276
And if you had
understood that,

545
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,613
I would not be
on my way to Gre'thor.

546
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,202
We're on the Barge
of the Dead...

547
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,246
and we're still having
the same argument

548
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,373
we were having
ten years ago.

549
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,041
( scoffs )

550
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:44,129
Look, if I have
dishonored you,

551
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,717
I am truly sorry.
Are you?

552
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:52,304
You have too much anger
in your heart to be sorry.

553
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,180
Oh, we don't have
time for this

554
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,182
if we're going
to perform the
transference.

555
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,477
Is that how you intend
to lift my dishonor?

556
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,186
By taking my place?

557
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,689
Oh, don't worry.
I have no intention

558
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,233
of being on this barge
when it gets
to Gre'thor.

559
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,569
We've got just enough time
to perform the ritual

560
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,613
before my crew
resuscitates me.

561
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,573
Oh.

562
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:15,535
I should have known
you'd choose the easy way.

563
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,622
What are you talking about?

564
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,625
Do you know the risks
I've taken to save you?

565
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,420
You still understand nothing
about being a Klingon.

566
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,673
I would rather face damnation

567
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,300
with what little honor
you have left me

568
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,595
than cheat my way
into Sto-Vo-Kor.

569
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,931
( footsteps approaching )

570
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,273
There she is.
Bring them.

571
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,655
The mongrel child
has returned.

572
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,907
I'm here to take
my mother's place.

573
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,659
B'Elanna!

574
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:59,078
You wish to claim
her dishonor as your own?
Yes.

575
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,831
You're willing
to die for her?

576
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,791
Yes. Release her
to Sto-Vo-Kor.

577
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,626
No!
Keep her quiet!

578
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,170
Silence!
It's not your decision.

579
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,382
She has the right
to reclaim your honor.

580
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,009
Once we have
reached Gre'thor

581
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,969
and you are
within its gates,

582
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,512
I will release her.

583
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,389
No. Now.

584
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,766
( chuckles )

585
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,394
You're very impatient.

586
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,814
Time must be slipping away
in the living world.

587
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,983
You're concerned that
your friends will revive you

588
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,193
before you complete
your deception.

589
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,321
Did you really think
I could be fooled so easily?

590
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,741
( muffled protest )

591
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,828
I will die for her.

592
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,830
No tricks,

593
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,916
no games.

594
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,543
I will take her place honorably.

595
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,963
Like a Klingon.

596
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,716
KORTAR:
If you choose this path,

597
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,052
your friends
will not be able to save you.

598
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,721
No! I forbid it!

599
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,139
I understand.

600
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,278
Your dishonor has been lifted.

601
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,696
Sto-Vo-Kor awaits you.

602
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,699
I will not abandon my daughter.

603
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,619
She has made the choice. Go!

604
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,090
Daughter of Miral,

605
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,926
embrace your fate.

606
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,189
Vih.

607
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,958
Her neural patterns
are breaking down.

608
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,709
I'm initiating
emergency resuscitation.

609
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,253
Vent the ionized
particles.

610
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,941
20 milligrams
cordrazine now!

611
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,901
I'm deactivating
the force field.

612
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,653
( alarm beeping )

613
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,414
( grunts )

614
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,807
Welcome to Gre'thor.

615
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,108
This isn't Gre'thor.

616
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,028
Oh, I assure you it is.
You've taken your mark.

617
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,448
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

618
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,743
This is no laughing matter.

619
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,081
You've met Mr. Neelix,
our Ambassador to
the recently deceased.

620
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,584
Questions, comments,
suggestions... he's your man.

621
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,211
If you'll follow me.

622
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,674
By the way,
I'll be performing an aria
from Berlioz's Faust

623
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:43,011
tomorrow night in Holodeck 2.
Feel free to stop by.

624
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:45,346
15 decks.

625
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,433
Computers augmented
with bio-neural circuitry.

626
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,061
Top cruising speed:
warp 9.975.

627
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,771
Not that you'll
be going anywhere.

628
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,440
No Fek'lhr?
No Cavern of Despair?

629
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,401
Don't need them.
I don't consider
Voyager hell!

630
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,028
Are you sure?

631
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,363
Have you ever been
truly happy here?

632
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,490
If you thought 50 years
aboard this ship

633
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,659
would be difficult,
try eternity.

634
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,580

637

( tapping )

638
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,298
This is a great day
for B'Elanna Torres,

639
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,843
a day when we pay tribute
to her dishonor.

640
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,304
DOCTOR:
She's not responding
to the cordrazine.

641
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:31,350
Neural activity
at 48 percent... 37.
We're losing her.

642
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,603
We have to stabilize
her synaptic functions.

643
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,106
I'm attempting
a direct neural resequencing.

644
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:39,109
B'Elanna's misdeeds
have led her to Gre'thor.

645
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,653
She comes with no valor,
no glory...

646
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,823
nothing to celebrate
in song and story.

647
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,284
You really have no one
to blame but yourself.

648
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,119
You've kept us all
at arm's length,

649
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,247
even Tom,
who you claim to love.
Hear, hear.

650
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:55,125
I tried to assist you
in making Engineering
more efficient,

651
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,210
but you resisted.
You're stubborn.

652
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,005
She inherited that from her
mother along with the forehead.

653
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,007
CHAKOTAY:
What do you think
of the afterlife so far?

654
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,509
It's not exactly
what I had in mind.

655
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,552
Are you interpreting
all the symbols?

656
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,888
Searching your subconscious
for their meaning?

657
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,682
TUVOK:
Lieutenant Torres...

658
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,558
defend yourself.

659
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,687
( thunder cracks )

660
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,693
Captain?

661
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,573
What are you still doing here?

662
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,993
I've released you
to Sto-Vo-Kor.

663
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,578
You can't free me
until you free yourself.

664
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,874
I don't understand.
You never did.

665
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,126
I did everything
that the ritual told me to do.

666
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,585
I came back for you...

667
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,672
Forget the ritual.
It's meaningless.

668
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,423
Meaningless?

669
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,176
I died for you.

670
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,929
No, you didn't.
It's not your time.

671
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,183
You still
don't understand this journey.

672
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,767
Then tell me.

673
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,312
Request denied.

674
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,105
What do you want?

675
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,940
Who are you asking?

676
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,442
You, Kahless, the tooth fairy!

677
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,487
Anybody who will tell me
what I am supposed to do!

678
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,491
You are the only one
who can answer that question.

679
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,830
Choose to live, B'Elanna.

680
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,922
PARIS:
Neural activity's at 23 percent.

681
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,715
Initiate cortical stimulation.

682
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,051
Pulses at 50 millijoules.

683
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,468
No effect.

684
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,388
Increase to
70 millijoules.

685
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,057
Come on, B'Elanna.

686
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,152
Defend yourself.

687
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:50,198
You want me to fight?

688
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,118
You want me to be
a good little Klingon?

689
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,327
( grunts )

690
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,287
( thunder cracks )

691
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,829
Is that it?

692
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,497
You've let your anger
consume you.

693
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,916
Now it's consuming us.

694
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,334
She has condemned us all.

695
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,044
Misery loves company.

696
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,545
Get away from me!

697
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,838
Or what?

698
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,257
You'll kill us
where we stand?

699
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:11,136
Tell me what you want me to be!

700
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,763
A good Starfleet
officer?

701
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,348
A good Maquis?

702
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,309
Lover?

703
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,102
Daughter?

704
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,897
Just tell me
what you want from me!

705
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,775
We don't want anything
from you, B'Elanna.

706
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,360
We only want you.

707
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,861
We're not your enemies.

708
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,529
Defend yourself.

709
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,575
I don't know how.

710
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,496
I am so tired of fighting.

711
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,705
We know.

712
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,542
( yells )

713
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:04,772
You've taken the first
step of your journey.

714
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,817
And what about you?

715
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,196
We will see
each other again.

716
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,656
In Sto-Vo-Kor?

717
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,826
Yes,
in Sto-Vo-Kor.

718
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:22,123
Or maybe... when
you get home.

719
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,796
Mother?

720
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,687
Oh, God, I'm alive.

721
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,279
Welcome back.
