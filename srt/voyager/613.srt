00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,641
Stay away.

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,768
If you don't cooperate,
I can't treat you.

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,561
When we agreed
to be examined

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,104
by this ship's
Medical Officer,

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,523
we didn't know
that you were

11
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,441
a primitive
computer matrix.

12
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,152
I assure you there is
nothing primitive about me.
Hmm.

13
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,904
I am programmed
to perform

14
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,698
more than five million
medical procedures.

15
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,700
Does that include
bloodletting?

16
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,537
No, but I'll be happy to
add it to my repertoire.

17
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:42,459
(<i> over-articulating</i> ):
We are ready to
return to our ship.

18
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:48,215
Could you contact one
of your superiors?

19
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,133
Doctor to the Captain.
Please report to Sick Bay.

20
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,093
JANEWAY:
Already on my way.

21
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:56,431
(<i> over-articulating</i> ):
The Captain is
coming here now.

22
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,686
If you want to talk to her,

23
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,814
you can have a seat.

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,905
It is a very
irritating program.

25
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:15,075
Maybe we can disable
its speech subroutines.

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,538
You're not
authorized
to do that.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,832
How are our
guests?
(<i> sighs</i> )

28
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,542
Their injuries
are minor.

29
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,293
Unfortunately, I
can't say the same

30
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,879
for their lack
of manners.

31
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,213
Doctor.

32
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,340
What is the status
of our ship?

33
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,509
To be honest, we're having
a little trouble

34
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,386
understanding
your technology.

35
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,764
The problem is
<i>your</i> technology.

36
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,767
Interference from your
antiquated scanning devices

37
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,227
shut down
our propulsion system.

FEMALE:
Forgive us, Captain.

39
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,105
We live
in a closed system.

40
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,902
We are not accustomed
to interacting
with other species,

41
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,987
especially inferior ones.

42
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,155
Well, then...

43
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:58,786
I guess we'll leave the repairs
in your<i> superior</i> hands.

44
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,121
Our injuries will have
to be treated first.

45
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,666
Is there someone other
than this hologram
who could help us?

46
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,168
No one who's better qualified.

47
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,129
Hmm.

48
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,131
Very well.

49
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,468

with our deficiencies
just a little longer.

Maybe it's a fractal.
Or wave-form calculus.

78
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,385
Do you mean to say a culture
as<i> superior</i> as yours

79
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,055
has never heard music
of any kind?

80
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,724
There are other
kinds of music?

81
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,227
Of course.
The little ditty I just sang

82
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,895
is an early American folk song,

83
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,939
but countless cultures
have produced

84
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,732
thousands
of types of...

85
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,358
music--

86
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,321
instrumental,
choral, orchestral.

87
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,199
What is the purpose
of this "music"?

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,618
Is it an encryption
code of some kind?

89
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,997
There is a mathematical
component to music,

90
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,542
but primarily it's a form
of artistic expression.

91
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,377
"Artistic expression"?

92
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,755
Using sounds
and images

93
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,382
to convey ideas
and emotions.

94
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,219
Why would
anyone do that?

95
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,015
Well... to... communicate
their feelings.

96
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,018
Can't they do that
through speech?

97
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,063
Yes, but music
is much more...

98
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,773
expressive and
entertaining.

99
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:43,987
You mean to say
that this "music" is...
recreational?

100
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,656
(<i> sighs</i> )

101
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,700
It does have
other applications.

102
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,911
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I've recently been doing

103
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:55,040
some research into
its therapeutic properties,

104
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,958
but... yes, primarily,

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,836
we use it for...
enjoyment.

106
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,840
"We"?

107
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,550
You mean to say
others aboard your ship

108
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,969
are capable
of producing this phenomenon?

109
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,931
Well, maybe not
with my level of expertise,

110
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,058
but there are
quite a few members of this crew

111
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,809
who possess
musical skills.

112
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,855
Maybe we judged this
culture too quickly.
Hmm.

Mathematically, you'll find

quite interesting, particularly
the use of syncopation,

164

to make the music<i> swing.</i>

Yes, the Doctor.

177
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,001
MALE:
Bring back
the Doctor.

178
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,628
FEMALE:
We want the
Doctor to sing.

179
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,005
Doc, they're dying
up there.

180
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,923
You've got
to do something.

181
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,676
Pick up the tempo.

182
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,720

Well, if you like jazz,
you're going to love
rock 'n' roll.

193
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,220
It was one of the 20th century's
greatest inventions.

194
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,306
Does the Doctor sing
rock 'n' roll?

195
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,392
I wouldn't say it's
his favorite genre.

196
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,687
No, he's more
of an opera man.

197
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,897
As am I.

198
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,732
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

199
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,528
Aren't you one
of the musicians?

200
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,030
Harry Kim.
Vinka.

201
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,074
Welcome aboard
<i>Voyager.</i>

202
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,826
Um, if you'd like to see
the rest of the ship,

203
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,621
I'd be happy to
give you a tour.
Maybe later.

204
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,998
I was wondering if you could
introduce me to the Doctor.

205
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

206
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,712
Congratulations, Doctor,
you stole the show.

207
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,881
Thank you, Captain,
but I can't take all the credit.

208
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,842
There was something in the air,
a certain magic.

209
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,720
It was one of those
rare moments

210
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,890
when audience and performer
become one.

211
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,100
Doctor.

212
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,686
Prelate. Tincoo.

213
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,897
I will introduce your singing
to more of our people.

214
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,774
I'm flattered.
You will perform
on<i> our</i> planet.

215
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,444
I'd consider
it an honor,

216
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,070
but you'll have to negotiate
the terms

217
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,072
with my... representative.

218
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,950
I don't understand.

219
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,953
I believe the Doctor
is referring to me, Prelate.

220
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,581
Another concert would mean
extending our stay.

221
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,625
When would you want
to schedule the performance?

222
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,252
As soon as possible.
The Doctor could perform

223
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,837
at one of the lecture halls
at the university.

224
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,132
I'm not sure a lecture hall

225
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,217
would meet
the acoustic requirements.

226
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,969
TINCOO:
I'll help you make

227
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,639
whatever modifications
you think are necessary.

228
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,309
Sounds like you've
got yourself a
booking, Doctor.

229
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,271
DOCTOR:
I'd like to reproduce a backdrop

230
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,565
which was used in
a production of<i> Pagliacci</i>

231
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,525
at Teatro de la Scala--

232
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,653
Earth's most famous
opera house.

233
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,154
It's beautiful.

234
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,072
Your taste in design
is as refined

235
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,449
as your taste in music.

236
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,159
We'll replicate
it for you.

237
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,162
Excellent,
but we still have the problem

238
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,622
with the sight lines.

239
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,791
What's wrong
with the sight lines?

240
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,042
If you consider the height
of the average Qomar,

241
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,337
it's obvious that anyone
seated in the back five rows

242
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,422
will have an obstructed view.

243
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,299
You're right.
They won't be able
to see anything

244
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,761
but the top of your head.
The glare could blind them.

245
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,931
You'll have to excuse
Lieutenant Torres.

246
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,767
Her appreciation
of music is limited

247
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,395
to a smattering
of Klingon drinking songs.

248
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:18,316
We'll have to increase
the rake of the floor
by five degrees.

249
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,109
You really think
they're going to redesign

250
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,028
an entire building just
to appeal to your vanity?

251
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,698
Vanity has nothing
to do with it, Lieutenant.

252
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,825
I'm concerned
about my audience.

253
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,536
We are prepared to make
whatever changes

254
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,746
the Doctor thinks
are necessary.

255
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,665
DOCTOR:
Thank you, Tincoo.

256
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,249
While we're at it,
Lieutenant,

257
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,835
I'll need some help
with my wardrobe.

258
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,961
I'm an Engineer,
not a costume designer.

259
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,422
I'd like you to make
an adjustment
to my mobile emitter

260
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,966
that would allow me
to make quick changes
between songs.

261
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,593
That sounds exciting.

262
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,261
Oh, it will be.

263
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,349
I plan to segue from
Don Juan to Rigoletto

264
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,394
in the blink of an eye.
It will be a triumph of...

265
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,479
Arrogance
and self-absorption?

266
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,734
Just trying to help.

267
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,865
Your crewmates don't seem
to appreciate your abilities.

268
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,700
You've noticed that, too.

269
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,578
That must be very
frustrating for you.

270
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,163
You have no idea.

271
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,003
(<i> whispering</i> ):
We'll be starting
in two minutes.

272
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,381
I'd better get
into costume.

273
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,051
How do I look?

274
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,637
You look perfect.

275
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,023
I wish I had a subroutine
to eliminate pre-show jitters.

276
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,859
I could help you
add one to your program.

277
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,569
You're very sweet.

278
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,239
I'm just a little...
nervous.
Why?

279
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,659
I'm about to expose your
entire culture to music
for the first time.

280
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,495
The responsibility
is... enormous.

281
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,873
Your performance tonight
will be transmitted

282
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,166
to hundreds of millions
of people.

283
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,211
Is that supposed
to help me relax?

284
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,133
It's time.

285
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,529
(<i> light applause</i> )

286
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,950
(<i> loud applause</i> )

287
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,385
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

288
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,887
Report.

289
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,305
I didn't order a
Red Alert, Captain.

290
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,098
Well, someone did.

291
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,601
The command
originated in...

292
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,478
Astrometrics.

293
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,313
Seven of Nine to the Captain.

294
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,106
I've found evidence
that the Qomar are attempting

295
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,985
to sabotage<i> Voyager.</i>

296
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,528
On my way.

297
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,867
JANEWAY:
What have you got?

298
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,577
I believe the Qomar
are attempting to disable
our com system.

299
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,496
How?
By overloading it

300
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,790
with millions
of teraquads of
irrelevant data.

301
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,376
What do you mean
by "irrelevant"?

302
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,591
They're transmissions...

303
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,928
all addressed to the Doctor.

304
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,472
Precisely.
I've only been able
to decipher

305
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,808
a small fraction
of them so far,

306
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,351
but they include invitations

307
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,311
to social
and scientific functions,

308
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,522
requests
for personal encounters,

309
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,734
and cloying tributes
to the Doctor's talents.

310
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,945
Computer, stand
down Red Alert.

311
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,989
This isn't
sabotage, Seven.

312
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,241
This is fan mail.

313
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,951
Fan mail?

314
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,745
People who admire
performers

315
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,329
are called "fans".

316
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,623
The word, I believe,
derives from "fanatic".

317
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,458
Exactly.

318
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,004
Why would the Doctor inspire
fanaticism among the Qomar?

319
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,672
Music is new to them.

320
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,675
Clearly, they're
very excited about it.

321
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,012
This glorification
of the individual
is irrational.

322
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,806
The Doctor is merely reproducing
the work of others.

323
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,934
Why do his fans fixate
solely on him?

324
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,144
I suppose he's
the embodiment of
what they admire.

325
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,813
He can do something
they can't,

326
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,107
and that makes
him special.

327
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,401
Perhaps, but that doesn't
explain their interest

328
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,695
in the minutiae
of the Doctor's life.

329
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,364
"What does he do
in his spare time?"

330
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:39,660
"To how many decimal places
can he calculate pi?"

331
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,830
This one wants to know his
favorite quadratic equation.

332
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,083
People have
always fantasized

333
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,961
about knowing
celebrities personally.

334
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,589
I suppose it's a way of making
themselves feel more important.

335
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,216
Tuvok to Janeway.
Go ahead.

336
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,970
We have a security problem
on Deck 2.

337
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,679
On my way.

338
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,891
Just think, Seven.

339
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,184
As personal friends
of the Doctor,

340
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,271
we're the envy of
millions of Qomar.

341
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,484
(<i> sighs</i> )

342
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,069
Our efforts to
accommodate them

343
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,528
have gotten out of hand.

344
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,322
I guess their interest
in the Doctor

345
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,616
is greater
than we expected.

346
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,493
(<i> excited chatter and laughter)</i>

347
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,161
Much greater.

348
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,288
I recommend we refuse
all further requests

349
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,499
for transport
from the surface.
Agreed.

350
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,251
And we should evacuate
these visitors
immediately.

351
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,587
They are interfering with
normal ship's functions.

352
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,008
Tuvok, when have functions
aboard this ship
ever been normal?

353
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,385
(<i> Doctor singing</i>
<i>Italian opera)</i>

354
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,937
(<i> singing in harmony</i> )

355
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,128
Thank you for coming.
Please accept this
eight-by-ten-by-four

356
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,463
singing replica of me.

357
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,175
One at a time,
one at a time, now.

358
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,845
Please, now, do not touch
the Doctor's mobile emitter.

359
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,973
Captain.
Isn't this exciting?

360
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,142
I'm not sure that's
the word I'd use for it.

361
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,854
Excuse me.
Sorry, excuse me.

362
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,856
I'm sorry, Captain,
but you'll have
to wait your turn

363
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,232
like everybody else.

364
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,817
I'm not here
for an autograph.

365
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,443
We need to talk.

366
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,908
I'm glad you're enjoying
yourself, Doctor,

367
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,868
but this is getting
a little excessive.

368
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,079
I'm only doing what
I can to ensure

369
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,998
that first contact with
the Qomar goes smoothly.

370
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,834
Does that include using
our replicator reserves

371
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,170
to create miniaturized
versions of yourself?

372
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,922
I would never
do such a thing.

373
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,757
As a matter of fact,
the Qomar have devoted

374
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,425
an entire holo
processing plant

375
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,219
to manufacturing
them for me.

376
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,679
I see.
Well, in any case,

377
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,099
you've been neglecting
your Sick Bay duties.

378
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,101
I haven't received
a report in three days.

379
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,269
Oh, come now, Kathryn.
It's not as though

380
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,856
there's been a flood
of medical emergencies.

381
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,110
I wasn't aware we were
on a first name basis.

382
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,987
I-I meant "Captain".
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,449
Oh, that's perfectly
all right, Doctor,
or do you prefer "Maestro"?

384
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,951
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Please.

385
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,660
Either is acceptable.

386
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,413
Well, then, let me make
it clear to both of you:

387
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,291
Maestro, you're finished
for today.

388
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:36,087
Doctor, report
to Sick Bay,<i> now.</i>

389
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:47,932
Well, well, well.
If it isn't
the wandering minstrel.

390
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,392
What's the nature of their
medical emergencies?

391
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,937
Apparently,
these two young ladies

392
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:57,566
became dizzy and disoriented
while waiting in line
to see you.

393
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,401
I'll take over
from here.

394
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,028
Be careful, Doc.

395
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,906
You seem to be hazardous
to the Qomars' health.

396
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,492
I'm Vinka.
I'm Azen.

397
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,786
Hmm. Neither of you
appears to be ill.

398
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,622
We wanted to meet you
in a more intimate setting.

399
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,667
So we told your security
officer we were sick.

400
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,585
Sick Bay is for medical
treatment only.

401
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,337
I'm afraid you'll
have to leave.

402
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,131
But there's so much
about you we want to know.

403
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,883
Yes, you're a very
stimulating hologram.

404
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,136
I-if you're here for a replica,
they're available
in the Mess Hall.

405
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,595
We don't want a replica.

406
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,597
We want
the full-sized version.

407
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,933
I-I-I'm flattered,
really, but if you
don't leave now,

408
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,310
I'll have to call Security.

409
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,020
I'll bet you can calculate pi

410
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,479
to over a thousand digits.

411
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,231
Security to Sick Bay.

412
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,984
Have you ever balanced
simultaneous equations?

413
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,321
Computer, deactivate
Emergency Medical Hologram.

414
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,415
Here you are.

415
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,710
I needed to find
some peace and quiet.

416
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,962
I want to show
you something.

417
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,548
What's this?

418
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,050
You inspired me
to create

419
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,093
my own musical
composition.

420
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,596
It's based on
the intersection
of two fractals.

421
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,640
Tincoo, this is extraordinary.

422
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,893
I created it for you.

423
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,521
I don't know what to say.

424
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,981
Will you sing it?

425
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,941
I'm not sure I can.

426
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,693
It's very complex.

427
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,781
(<i> singing</i> )

428
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,784
(<i> singing high notes</i> )

429
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,037
The melody's lovely,
but some of these notes

430
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,955
are well beyond
the human vocal range.

431
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,333
You are not human.
No, but...

432
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,211
I can help you reconfigure
your vocal processors.

433
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,089
I don't think there's time.
My last concert's tomorrow.

434
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,383
Why does it have to be
your last concert?

435
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,052
Because<i> Voyager</i> is
scheduled to depart.

436
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,636
Stay here with us.

437
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,056
I have responsibilities
on<i> Voyager.</i>

438
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,640
They're a resourceful crew.

439
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,601
I am certain they
will find a way

440
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,104
to compensate
for your absence.

441
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,814
I'm not so sure about that...

442
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,858
but even if they could...

443
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,238
<i>Voyager's</i> the only
life I've ever known.

444
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,864
The crew are my friends.

445
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,325
But they don't appreciate you
the way we do--

446
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:16,330
you know that.
You could have a new
life here as a performer,

447
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:20,500
surrounded by people
who admire and respect
your talent.

448
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,128
It's very tempting, but...

449
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,963
By any mathematical standard,

450
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,966
the medical care of 150 people

451
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:31,345
cannot compare to the cultural
enrichment of millions.

452
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,807
You can't always explain things
with an equation, Tincoo.

453
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,769
What about the simplest equation
of them all?

454
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,938
One plus one.

455
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,566
I don't understand.

456
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,361
The time you have been here

457
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,488
has been the most stimulating
of my life.

458
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,121
I feel the same way
about my time with you.

459
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,123
Then stay here...

460
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,041
with me.

461
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,095
You're resigning
your commission?

462
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,182
I've been asked to stay.

463
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:22,646
When this all started,
I thought you might have
a little harmless fun,

464
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,107
and that
you'd be responsible enough

465
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,608
to keep it in perspective.

466
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,986
I can see now
that I was mistaken.

467
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,365
This isn't "harmless fun"
for me, Captain.

468
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,993
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to realize a dream.

469
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,995
What about your duty
to<i> Voyager?</i>

470
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,455
I take that
very seriously, but...

471
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,539
You're a part of this ship.

472
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,043
You sound as if you're talking
about a piece of equipment.

473
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,585
That's not what I meant.

474
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,296
Then shouldn't I be
given the same respect

475
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,465
as any flesh and blood
member of this crew?

476
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,091
Every member of this crew

477
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,386
is expected to fulfill
his obligations.

478
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,389
If Harry Kim met an alien woman
on an away mission,

479
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,393
fell in love and decided
to spend the rest
of his life with her,

480
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,270
raise a family, instead
of continuing on this journey,

481
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,439
you wouldn't stand in his way.

482
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,358
You're not Harry Kim.

483
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,027
You're an Emergency
Medical Hologram.

484
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,654
Then you<i> do</i> see me
as a piece of technology.

485
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,658
I have given you
extraordinary freedom--

486
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,662
to explore your creativity,
to go on away missions,

487
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,540
to pursue personal
relationships--

488
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,958
but enough is enough.
Why?!

489
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,712
Because you don't
see me as an equal,
and you never have. Admit it.

490
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,382
I am responsible
for the medical needs
of this crew.

491
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,468
If I let you leave,
what kind of Captain would I be?

492
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,137
Every other Starfleet officer
chose to be here,

493
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,099
but I never had a choice--
until now.

494
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,060
I've given this crew everything
for five years.

495
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:47,273
Isn't it worth anything?
Haven't I earned the right
to self-determination?

496
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,446
You've lost other systems before

497
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,906
and always managed
to find a solution.

498
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,075
You'll manage without me.

499
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,535
What about you?

500
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,579
Will you manage without us?

501
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,415
The Qomar are a technologically
advanced species.

502
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,084
I have no doubt that
my maintenance requirements
will be met.

503
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,337
Now which one of us
is looking at you as
a piece of technology?

504
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,048
I'm not talking about
your maintenance needs.

505
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,384
I'm talking about
your emotional needs.

506
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,095
You've got people on this
ship who care about you.

507
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,931
The Qomar certainly seem
to care about me.

508
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,309
And when their tastes change?

509
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,603
What makes you think
that's going to happen?

510
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,854
Fame is often temporary.

511
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,940
This isn't just about fame.

512
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,109
Oh, really?

513
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,487
If you must know...

514
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,947
there's a woman involved,

515
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:43,078
one who appreciates me in a way
no one on this crew ever has.

516
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,922
Well, it sounds like
you'll have everything you need.

517
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,676
I believe I will.
I hope so, Doctor,

518
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,513
because once<i> Voyager's</i> gone,

519
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,390
you won't be able
to change your mind.

520
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,393
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

521
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,270
As your Captain,

522
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,856
I should refuse
this resignation,

523
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,401
but as your friend,

524
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,736
it wouldn't be right
to stand in your way.

525
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,124
And you can't let the
Captain ignore her health.

526
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,251
She's notorious for
finding any excuse

527
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,670
to miss her appointments.

528
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,338
I'll send her
weekly reminders.

529
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,173
And when Mr. Neelix
becomes convinced

530
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,050
that he's suffering
from the Toluncan Ague--

531
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,801
which he does
every flu season--

532
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,845
don't argue with him,
just give him a placebo.

533
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,264
Doc, I've been assisting
you for three years.

534
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,141
I know the drill.

535
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,519
Yes, I suppose you do.

536
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:52,022
Remember, I'll be within
com range for at least
another month,

537
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,233
so if any problems
should arise...
Doc...

538
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,486
you're not really going
to do this, are you?

539
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,239
I would have thought
you of all people

540
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,032
would be glad to see me go.

541
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,701
Are you kidding?

542
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,412
Who am I going to torment
after you're gone?

543
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,000
Well...

544
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,461
I've got some more good-byes.

545
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,256
I'll check in with you
before I leave.

546
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,925
I'll be here...

547
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,596
redecorating your office.

548
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,693
Hello, Seven.

549
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,739
I wanted to see
you before I left.

550
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,951
I've downloaded
some social lessons

551
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,786
we haven't
covered yet.

552
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,871
There are 17
new chapters.

553
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,041
Does one of them
include instructions
for ending a friendship?

554
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,086
Our friendship's
not over, Seven.

555
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,713
It will be difficult to maintain

556
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,965
if we never see
each other again.

557
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,553
I know it'll be hard
for you when I'm gone.

558
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,430
I will adapt.

559
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,184
Yes, I suppose
you will,

560
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,020
but it'll be
hard for me.

561
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:18,108
Why? You're getting everything
you've ever wanted.

562
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,068
I thought you'd
be the first one

563
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,071
to understand my desire
to grow as an individual.

564
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:29,077
What I don't understand
is why you can't do that
aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

565
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,498
I feel I've accomplished
all I can here.

566
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,833
Oh, there's the occasional
medical mystery

567
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,710
that challenges
my programming,

568
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,629
but mostly it's
become routine,

569
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,380
and frankly,
I feel my talents

570
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,049
are often taken
for granted.

571
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,303
But when I'm standing
on that stage performing,

572
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:50,098
and I see those rapt
faces in the audience...

573
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,935
I feel I finally
know what it's like

574
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,562
to be made of
flesh and blood.

575
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,816
You simply crave attention,
applause,

576
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,317
fan mail.

577
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,278
What if I do?

578
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,071
Those things
are irrelevant.

579
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,157
To you, maybe,

580
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:11,328
but to me, it makes me
feel appreciated,

581
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,081
even loved...

582
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,836
Not for what
I've been programmed to do,

583
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,213
but for who I've become.

584
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,007
KIM:
Doctor, you're receiving
a transmission.

585
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,468
Route it to Cargo Bay 2.

586
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,178
Doctor, this is Tincoo.

587
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,096
I want to see you immediately.

588
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,807
I have something to show you.

589
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,974
What is it?

590
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,351
A surprise.

591
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,228
I think you'll be very pleased.

592
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,355
I'll beam down
as soon as I can.

593
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,024
Seven...

594
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,360
You shouldn't keep
your fans waiting.

595
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,350
Thank you
for being so prompt.

596
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:19,354
Of course.
What's the surprise?

597
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,980
I had an inspiration.

598
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,941
Another musical
composition?

599
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,401
Better.

600
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,198
What's this?

601
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,534
I've solved
all our problems.

602
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,288
I wasn't aware
that we had any.

603
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,457
Well, you were reluctant
to leave your ship,

604
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,250
and you also doubted
your ability

605
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,502
to sing my composition,
so I created

606
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,046
a superior holo-matrix.

607
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,507
I-I don't understand.

608
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,509
It's simple.

609
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:54,431
Now you can
stay aboard<i> Voyager,</i>
and <i> he</i>  can
sing for us.

610
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,933
Listen.

611
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:02,773
(<i> singing</i> )

612
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,484
(<i> singing extremely</i>
<i>high notes)</i>

613
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,326
(<i> singing loud,</i>
<i>sustained high note</i> )

614
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,457
You can't make
a superior singer

615
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,835
simply by creating
a new matrix.

616
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,503
I beg to differ.

617
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,797
My vocal processors
are enhanced

618
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,423
with polyphonic sequencers.

619
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,216
I am not only capable

620
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,678
of singing notes
well beyond<i> your</i> limited range,

621
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,513
I can produce
multiharmonic overtones

622
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,307
through the use
of amplitude vacillat...

623
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,769
Why did you do that?

624
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,480
Tincoo, music is more
than mathematics,

625
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,482
and<i> I</i> am much more

626
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,485
than a program
with musical subroutines.

627
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,698
All of my experience,
all of my passion

628
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,701
goes into every note
that I sing.

629
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:59,204
When you listen to me,
when my singing moves you,

630
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,790
you're not just hearing notes.

631
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,625
You're hearing my artistry...

632
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,044
my... soul.

633
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,505
I've duplicated that, too.

634
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,132
I thought you wanted<i> me.</i>

635
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,052
I did,
but now, I've developed

636
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:18,056
a far more sophisticated
piece of technology.

637
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,393
Technology...

638
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,812
I thought you would be pleased.

639
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,314
You seemed reluctant
to leave your ship.

640
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,192
You told me that the time
you had spent with me

641
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,237
was the most stimulating
of your life.

642
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:36,742
It was. You inspired me
to do my greatest work.

643
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,117
But I thought...

644
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,580
Yes?

645
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,582
That you and I...

646
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,545
What?

647
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:58,263
Well, I suppose I'm no longer
on the bill tomorrow.

648
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,806
Of course you are.

649
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,976
It will be
your farewell performance.

650
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,271
Of course.

651
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,654
(<i> singing strained high note)</i>

652
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,367
You wanted to see me?

653
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,953
I need your clearance code

654
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,871
to delete my medical database.

655
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,040
You sure you want
to do that?

656
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,000
If you give one of your fans
a heart attack,

657
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,544
you won't be able
to resuscitate him.

658
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:33,381
I need more space
in my matrix.
For what?

659
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,592
To expand
my musical subroutines,

660
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:39,345
so that I can sing
this composition.

661
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,515
Well, I'm surprised
you're asking me for help.

662
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,060
I recall your saying that
my appreciation for music

663
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:49,439
was limited to "a smattering
of Klingon drinking songs."

664
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,441
Please, B'Elanna.

665
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,318
I'm asking you
as a friend.

666
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,237
Everything depends
on this.

667
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,824
What's so important
about this composition?

668
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,408
Tincoo wrote it for me.

669
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,868
Your girlfriend?

670
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,579
I wouldn't
call her that.

671
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,498
Don't tell me you
two had a fight.

672
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,583
Let's just say,

673
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:12,337
she doesn't appreciate me quite
as much as I thought she did.

674
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,422
But that will all change.
Once I perform this,

675
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,591
she will see me for
the artist I truly am.

676
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,261
Look, Doc, I don't know
anything about this woman,

677
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,597
or why she doesn't
appreciate you,

678
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,808
and I may not be
an expert on music,

679
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,019
but I'm
a pretty good engineer.

680
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,729
I can expand your musical
subroutines all you like.

681
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,065
I can even reprogram you
to be a whistling teapot,

682
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:37,029
but, if I do that,
you won't be you anymore.

683
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,540
Tonight, I was planning
to perform a song

684
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,043
composed by one
of your own people.

685
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,212
When you consider she heard
music for the first time

686
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,173
only a few days ago,

687
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,675
it's an extraordinary
accomplishment.

688
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,720
But although it's
a very beautiful composition,

689
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,974
I'm afraid
it's beyond my abilities.

690
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,351
(<i> murmuring</i> )

691
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:16,275
So instead, I'm going to sing
an old Neapolitan ballad.

692
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,571
It's a song about lost love.

693
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,742
(<i> singing in Italian)</i>

694
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,462
(<i> singing continues</i> )

695
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,367
(<i> moderate applause</i> )

696
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,589
Thank you, Doctor.
That was fascinating.

697
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:06,761
It is because of
your inspiration that I can
now present to you

698
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:10,182
a new and exciting
musical program--

699
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:14,019
a singing
holographic matrix...
(<i> audience murmuring</i> )

700
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,562
designed specifically
to extend the range

701
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,774
of humanoid vocal capabilities,

702
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:23,444
singing
my own musical composition.

703
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,791
(<i> singing sustained note</i> )

704
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,714
(<i> singing scales</i>
<i>in tenor and bass tones</i> )

705
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,231
(<i> singing notes in mixed</i>
<i>male and female voices)</i>

706
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,107
(<i> wild applause</i> )

707
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,157
(<i> singing continues</i> )

708
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,586
(<i> door chimes</i> )

709
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,088
Come in.

710
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,509
Good morning, Captain.

711
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,720
What's this?

712
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,100
A formal request
to be reinstated.

713
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,273
So you've taken off your tails
and put them between your legs.

714
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,192
Yes, ma'am.

715
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,944
You offended a lot of people

716
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,445
who care about you.

717
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,947
I know.

718
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,990
I was a fool, I'm sorry,

719
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,202
and I'm willing to do whatever
I can to rectify the situation,

720
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,330
starting with the deletion
of all my musical subroutines.

721
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,540
Permission denied.
But, Captain...

722
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,460
No "buts", Doctor.
You're expected to
follow orders,

723
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,214
just like every other
flesh and blood
member of this crew.

724
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:11,052
Resume your normal activities--
all of them.

725
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,179
Yes, ma'am.

726
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,098
Dismissed.

727
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,859
(<i> singing in Italian)</i>

728
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:30,947
(<i> singing stops abruptly</i> )

729
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,076
Oh, Seven,
I didn't see you.

730
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,371
I suppose
you've come to gloat.

731
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,290
I have something
for you.

732
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,540
What is it?

733
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,876
Fan mail.

734
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,378
Delete it.

735
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,797
I don't want
to read another word.

736
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,216
Then I'll read
it for you.

737
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,510
Seven...
"Dear Doctor,

738
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,429
I regret that your
last performance

739
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,973
was not as successful
as you'd hoped.

740
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,017
There are still
those who appreciate

741
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,979
your unique talents
and admire you as an individual.

742
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,441
I'll always consider myself
your loyal fan."

743
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,153
Who's it from?

744
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,781
It's signed, "Seven of Nine,

745
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,575
