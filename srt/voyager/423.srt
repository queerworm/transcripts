1
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,382
When diplomacy fails,

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,635
there's only one alternative--

3
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,553
violence.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:15,307
Force must be applied
without apology.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,313
It's the Starfleet way.

6
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,149
Then our philosophies
are in agreement.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,025
Will you help us?

8
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:29,321
You're asking me
to fight your war,

9
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,824
destroy your enemy.

10
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,951
I'm asking you
to intimidate the Kyrians

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,160
with your technology...

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,913
help me capture their leader.

13
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,499
This ship
has superior firepower.

14
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,835
He won't risk a conflict
with you.

15
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:46,881
We risk life and limb

16
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:51,218
so your people
can annex Kyrian land.

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,804
Sounds like a
good deal for<i> you.</i>

18
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,639
What do we get?

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:59,601
A way home.

20
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,897
You know more about<i> Voyager</i>
than you've let on.

21
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,941
Your reputation in this
Quadrant precedes you.

22
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,651
That's why we
sought you out.

23
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,319
I'm listening.

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,448
There's a cyclic wormhole
five days' journey from here.

25
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,075
We know where it is

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,452
and we can help you
stabilize it.

27
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,542
If you are lying...

28
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,212
How far do you have to go?

29
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,215
60,000 light-years?

30
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:34,845
I want all tactical data
regarding your little war:

31
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,221
Kyrian defenses,

32
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,015
the position of
your own forces,

33
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,182
everything.

34
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,185
You'll have it
within the hour.

35
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,606
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

36
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,149
Eight Kyrian fighter-ships
approaching.

37
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,277
Arm the assault probes.

38
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,653
Fire at will.

39
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,821
Hail them.

40
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,949
Channel open.

41
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,786
This is Captain Janeway
of the warship<i> Voyager.</i>

42
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,496
Break off your attack,
or I'll destroy you.

43
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,707
TUVOK:
They are
not responding.

44
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,208
(<i> rumbling</i> )

45
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,586
They're returning fire.

46
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,046
Shields are holding.

47
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,007
Chako-tay, any luck
tracking down their leader?

48
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,300
Not yet.

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,927
We think Tedran has
gone into hiding.

50
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,261
JANEWAY:
I thought he might.

51
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,179
We'll have to flush him out.

52
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,932
What do you suggest?

53
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,184
Biogenic weapons.

54
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,770
We'll infect

55
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,231
the most populated
Kyrian territories.

56
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,901
The Doctor's nearly done
working on the weapon.

57
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,030
Our conflict is with Tedran
himself, not with his people.

58
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,281
They're innocent.

59
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,908
The best way
to bring down a ruler

60
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,076
is to make his people suffer.

61
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,452
Captain...
This is no time

62
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,453
for half-measures.

63
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,205
You wanted victory.

64
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,415
You're going to get it.

65
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,417
Bridge to Sick Bay.

66
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,418
Status?

67
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,629
We have established
a datalink

68
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,923
between my neural net
and the phaser array.

69
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,549
I am reconfiguring the beam

70
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,719
to carry a bio-agent
into the planet's atmosphere.

71
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,347
JANEWAY:
<i>When will it be ready?</i>

72
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,017
It is ready now, Captain.

73
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,477
Phasers are on line.

74
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,395
Target the first city.

75
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,524
And fire.

76
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,744
MALE:
The Warship<i> Voyager--</i>

77
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,831
one of the most powerful vessels
of its time.

78
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,710
Armed with photonic torpedoes
and particle weapons,

79
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,170
this ship of destruction

80
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,255
could wipe out an entire
civilization within hours.

81
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,884
On this particular day
in history, we were lucky.

82
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,094
The death toll
could've been much worse.

83
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,471
By the time<i> Voyager</i> 
targeted our major cities,

84
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,183
Tedran had already begun
an evacuation.

85
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,600
Thousands of lives
were saved.

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,477
Unfortunately, it was
only the beginning

87
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,271
of Captain Janeway's onslaught.

88
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,773
As you'll see,

89
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,443
her actions would have a
lasting effect on our world.

90
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,279
Even today, 700 years later,

91
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:03,911
we are still feeling the impact
of the<i> Voyager</i> encounter.

92
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,231
Before we continue
the simulation,

93
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,942
I'd like to answer
any questions you might have.

94
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,569
I'm curious about
<i>Voyager</i> itself.

95
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,280
How many people
were on board?

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,948
We believe
they had a complement

97
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,492
of over 300 soldiers.

98
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,577
Did they attack
other worlds, as well?

99
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,830
Well, we aren't certain.

100
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,041
Records of<i> Voyager's</i> travels
through our Quadrant

101
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,335
are incomplete,
but it's safe to assume

102
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,546
that they interfered
with many other cultures, yes.

103
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,048
Tell us more about
the Borg drones

104
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,465
they kept on the ship.

105
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,219
<i>Voyager</i> had many weapons
at their disposal,

106
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,055
including species they'd
assimilated along the way:

107
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,891
Borg, Talaxian, Kazon.

108
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,309
They were captured
and made to work

109
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,061
as part of<i> Voyager's</i>
fighting force.

110
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,645
Let's resume the simulation,

111
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,480
and you can see
for yourself.

112
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,277
It's a few hours after
the initial bombardment.

113
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,154
Janeway and her squadron
are on the Bridge,

114
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,697
mounting their assault.

115
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,615
Now, what you
are about to see

116
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,785
is graphic and unsettling.

117
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,621
Status.

118
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,707
Status!

119
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,458
Approximately
3,000 Kyrians dead.

120
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,459
JANEWAY:
That's it?

121
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,502
TUVOK:
The bio-agent

122
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,587
is still dispersing

123
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,671
through the atmosphere.

124
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,756
The fatality rate

125
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,300
will be 300,000
soon enough.

126
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,509
How soon?

127
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,802
Best guess--

128
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,137
one hour.

129
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,140
Why do you always
keep me waiting, Tuvok?

130
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,352
My apologies.

131
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,520
Preparing to fire again.

132
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,148
Double the yield.

133
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,026
Captain, don't you think
that's excessive?

134
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,527
You picked a bad time

135
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,905
to have second thoughts,
Ambassador.

136
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,199
I want them defeated,

137
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,369
but... but this is genocide.

138
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,037
Defeat? Genocide?

139
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,248
Why quibble with semantics?

140
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,959
This wasn't our agreement.

141
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,630
We're going to defeat
the Kyrians

142
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,134
and you're going to keep up
your end of the bargain.

143
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,763
(<i> rumbling</i> )

144
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,390
Ensign,

145
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,101
confine this gentleman
to the brig.

146
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,769
I'll let you know
when it's over.

147
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,025
Three more

148
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,111
Kyrian vessels approaching.

149
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,528
Evade them.

150
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,780
Aye, aye, sir.

151
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,040
The location?

152
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,962
Look... I can keep
this up all day.

153
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,007
Tell the Commander
what he wants to know.

154
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,351
Maybe I can't keep
this up all day.

155
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,853
I'm a man of peace.

156
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,772
My native people
are enlightened...

157
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,232
nonviolent...

158
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,817
much like your own.

159
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm saddened that this
has happened to you.

160
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,991
If we can work together,

161
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,827
maybe we can end
this conflict.

162
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,371
Stand aside, Chako-tay.

163
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,705
Let me hit him.

164
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,623
That hyperspanner
would cause

165
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,667
an unacceptable
level of damage.

166
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,002
I remind you--

167
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,087
he must still
be able to speak.

168
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,967
What do you have in mind?

169
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,677
This neural solvent--

170
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,430
a clean and efficient
inducer of pain--

171
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,764
far more effective

172
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,476
than your crude
attempts at persuasion.

173
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,773
No doubt you are experiencing
a tingling sensation

174
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,442
behind your eyes.

175
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,237
The chemical is dissolving
your optic nerves.

176
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,280
I'll ask you again.

177
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,865
Where is Tedran?

178
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:38,161
DOCTOR:
The pain will increase
exponentially

179
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,663
until your cerebral
cortex begins to liquefy.

180
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,749
I can reverse
the process...

181
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,084
if ordered to do so.

182
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,961
And I want to give
that order.

183
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,548
But you have
to tell me...

184
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,842
where is Tedran?

185
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,179
CHAKOTAY:
He's here, at
these coordinates.

186
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,432
Assuming our prisoner
told you the truth.

187
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,768
Oh, believe me, he was
very cooperative at the end.

188
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,936
Neelix?

189
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,812
I'm reading
a fortified compound

190
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,399
1.6 kilometers
beneath the surface.

191
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,858
Chako-tay,

192
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,860
you and Tuvok
take an assault team

193
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,404
and find Tedran.

194
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,156
Make sure he's escorted
safely to<i> Voyager.</i>

195
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,157
Yes, sir.

196
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,325
(<i> rumbling</i> )

197
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,993
What now?

198
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,205
Intruders. Four Kyrians just
beamed into the Engine Room.

199
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,998
JANEWAY:
Bridge to Engineering.

200
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,667
Respond.

201
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,587
They've erected
force fields.

202
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,130
Our soldiers can't get in.

203
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,468
They've left me no choice.

204
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,802
Computer...

205
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,055
initiate the Borg
activation sequence.

206
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,890
COMPUTER:
<i>Sequence in progress.</i>

207
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,352
JANEWAY:
<i>Bridge to Seven of Nine.</i>

208
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,686
State your instructions.

209
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,813
<i>A group of Kyrians</i>

210
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,316
is in the Engine Room. 

211
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,691
Stop them.

212
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,069
We understand.

213
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,225
Resistance is futile.

214
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,436
<i>Seven of Nine to the Bridge.</i>

215
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,523
<i>The Kyrian threat</i>
<i>has been neutralized.</i>

216
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,773
Acknowledged.

217
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,109
<i>Two of the Kyrians</i>
<i>are still alive.</i>

218
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,195
<i>What shall we do with them?</i>

219
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,948
Well, you've been wanting
to expand your fighting force.

220
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,200
Assimilate them.

221
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,453
We understand.

222
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,956
I just received word
from the attack team.

223
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,999
Good news, Lieutenant?

224
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,376
Very.

225
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,711
They've captured Tedran
and one of his aides.

226
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,755
They're heading back
to<i> Voyager.</i>

227
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,592
Take them to Chamber 19

228
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,512
and get the
Vaskan Ambassador.

229
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,224
This is one negotiation
he won't want to miss.

230
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,195
Welcome aboard.

231
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,114
I appreciate
your hospitality.

232
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,116
Are all your guests
treated so well?

233
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,451
Well, it's not every day

234
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,912
that we receive
such an important visitor--

235
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,247
the great Tedran...

236
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,625
a man of wisdom and peace...

237
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,252
a servant of his people.

238
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,754
Well, your people need you,
now more than ever.

239
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,883
State your demands.

240
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:43,555
Tell your forces to stand down,
and I'll call off my attack.

241
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,100
I understand
what the Vaskans want--

242
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,768
more of our territory...

243
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,229
more resources.

244
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,981
But what do you want,
Captain?

245
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,735
Why are you
doing this to us?

246
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,362
He's offered my crew a way home.

247
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,990
To reach your home,
you would destroy ours?

248
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,534
That's right.

249
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,120
And you'd do the same
in my position.

250
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,039
No, I would not.

251
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,335
Spoken like a true martyr.

252
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,671
You're very enlightened.

253
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,094
But are you so proud...

254
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:28,308
that you'd let your people die
before you'd humble yourself?

255
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,397
Tell them to surrender.

256
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,234
You have shamed us all.

257
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,612
We could've
ended this on our own...

258
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,196
peacefully...

259
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,782
without her.

260
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,659
Surrender.

261
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,454
No.

262
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,389
We will prevail.

263
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,276
JANEWAY:
Don't look so shocked,
Ambassador.

264
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,446
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

265
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,042
The ensuing conflict
was brief but brutal--

266
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,713
two million Kyrians
slaughtered within days.

267
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,467
The Warship<i> Voyager</i>
continued on its way,

268
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,636
leaving the Kyrian
dynasty in ruins.

269
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,971
The Vaskan leaders proceeded
to occupy our lands,

270
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,932
forcing my people
into subservience.

271
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,602
It took centuries for us
to undo the damage

272
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,396
that Captain Janeway
had done.

273
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,482
And the Kyrian struggle
for equality is far from over.

274
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,609
This simulation
and this museum

275
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,070
are a testament
to that struggle.

276
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,614
I hope you found
your experience here worthwhile.

277
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,533
If you'd like to learn
more about<i> Voyager</i>

278
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,744
and its role
in the history of our planet,

279
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,953
I suggest you explore
the rest of this exhibit.

280
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,831
Thank you for your time.

281
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,313
MALE:
Please, feel free
to try the simulation.

282
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,065
MALE 2:
Oh, thank you
very much.

283
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,363
I wouldn't touch
that if I were you.

284
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,031
One of the<i> Voyager's</i>
torpedoes--

285
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,700
25-isoton yield.

286
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,494
It could destroy an entire
city within seconds.

287
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,413
It's been inactive
for centuries,

288
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,831
but you never know.

289
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,709
No, I'm only teasing,
but, please, be careful.

290
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,544
If we damage any
of these relics,

291
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,337
they can never
be replaced.

292
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,048
The history of our people
should be respected.

293
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,050
I have a question
about that history.

294
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,176
Please.

295
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,638
How can you prove
that it's true?

296
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,932
Take a closer look.

297
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,725
The evidence is
all around you.

298
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,936
Some musty fossils
and a re-creation?

299
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,520
That doesn't
prove anything.

300
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,815
I disagree.

301
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,316
You're trying to
blame the Vaskans

302
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,819
for all your troubles,
the way you always do.

303
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,446
I don't have a problem
with your species.

304
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,699
I have Kyrian friends,
but I don't appreciate

305
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,034
seeing<i> my</i> people
being portrayed as villains

306
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,163
in your little simulation,
and I certainly don't want

307
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,039
your history taught
to my children.

308
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,835
Well, you'd better
get used to the idea,

309
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,170
because we've just uncovered
an artifact that's going

310
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,088
to confirm everything
you've seen here.

311
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,507
Three weeks ago,

312
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,843
our research team
found a data-storage device

313
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,303
buried nine meters
beneath the ruins at Kesef.

314
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,722
I've confirmed
that it came from<i> Voyager.</i>

315
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,390
Another fossil?

316
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,643
The device contains
active data...

317
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,936
possibly crew logs--

318
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,855
even Captain Janeway's
personal almanac.

319
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,564
In the next few days,
we could be hearing

320
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,191
<i>Voyager's</i> version
of these events,

321
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,609
in their own words!

322
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,611
And what if those words
tell a different story?

323
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,904
What then?

324
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,867
We will change our views
accordingly.

325
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm sure you will.

326
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,875
I apologize.

327
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,001
Please, enjoy

328
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,460
the rest of your visit.

329
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,275
Activate re-creation:
"The Voyager Encounter."

330
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,903
Display Engine Room.

331
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,461
Begin dictation.

332
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,508
I'm resuming work
on artifact 271:

333
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,928
the<i> Voyager</i>
data-storage device.

334
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,265
I've decided to try
using period tools

335
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,684
from the simulation itself.

336
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,145
With any luck,
they'll be more compatible.

337
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,074
Hmm...

338
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,077
there's far more data here
than I expected.

339
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,583
Seems more like a program
of some sort.

340
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,502
Yes.

341
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,963
Yes!

342
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,924
It's an optronic datastream...

343
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,300
a hologram.

344
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,273
(<i> staticky</i> ):
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

345
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,946
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

346
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,991
I recognize you.

347
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,366
You're<i> Voyager's</i> Doctor.

348
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,201
What am I doing in Engineering?

349
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,371
Where's my mobile emitter?

350
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,748
You're not an android.

351
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,668
Of course not.
What are you talking about?

352
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,252
A Kyrian.

353
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,546
Doctor to the Bridge.
Intruder alert!

354
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,714
Security to Engineering!

355
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,508
You won't have
much luck with that.

356
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,759
Nothing in here is real.

357
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,469
It's a simulation.

358
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,554
A holodeck?

359
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,889
No.

360
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,142
You're in the Museum
of Kyrian Heritage.

361
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,519
You've stolen my program.

362
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,520
How?

363
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,813
Please...

364
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,439
let me try to explain.

365
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,983
Try quickly.

366
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,567
You...

367
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,778
are a hologram.

368
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,321
That I know.

369
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,907
Uh... I just discovered
your program

370
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,659
inside this data-storage device.

371
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,369
That's the EMH backup module.

372
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,330
One of your attack parties must
have taken it from Sick Bay.

373
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,457
Actually, we found it
at the ruins at Kesef.

374
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,212
I know this will be difficult
for you to accept,

375
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,506
but a great deal
of time has passed

376
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,217
since<i> Voyager</i>
encountered the Kyrians.

377
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,302
How much time?

378
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,597
700 years, give
or take a decade.

379
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,016
We're not certain.

380
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,433
I don't believe you.

381
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,560
Think about it.

382
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,395
When your program
is inactive,

383
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,065
a moment or a millennium
are the same to you.

384
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,487
700 years?

385
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,575
What about my ship?

386
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,827
What happened to my crew?

387
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,037
No one knows.

388
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,288
It's safe to say
they're long dead.

389
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,544
And I'm some sort of...
fossil?

390
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,129
No, not a fossil--

391
00:20:55,129 --> 00:21:00,218
a witness, a living
witness to history.

392
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,595
There's so much we don't
know about what happened,

393
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,055
but you saw it.

394
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,807
You lived through
those times.

395
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,727
You helped to shape them.

396
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,021
Doctor, you could be the
most important discovery

397
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,022
of all time.

398
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,232
No, this isn't possible.

399
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,482
Doctor...

400
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,650
I don't believe you.

401
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,735
Doctor!

402
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,846
What's going to happen
to me now?

403
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,932
Will you put me on display?

404
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,517
The holographic
Rip van Winkle?

405
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,852
I'm not sure.

406
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,896
I want to try
to contact Starfleet...

407
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,898
if there still
is a Starfleet.

408
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,399
That will have to wait.

409
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,776
Wait for what?

410
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,112
There are other...
issues to be resolved.

411
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,529
What kind of issues?

412
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,948
You're the<i> Voyager</i> Doctor.

413
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,284
A lot of people are going
to have questions.

414
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,743
On our world,

415
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,412
artificial life-forms
are considered sentient

416
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,123
and responsible
for their actions.

417
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,374
You might have
to face charges.

418
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,584
Charges?

419
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,877
For your crimes.

420
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,712
You designed
the bio-weapons that

421
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,131
killed eight million
Kyrians.

422
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,175
I did nothing of the sort.

423
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,718
All of our evidence shows
that you were a war criminal.

424
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,137
Evidence? What evidence?

425
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,430
Like this, for example?
Triple-armored hull?

426
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,141
30 torpedo tubes?
25 phaser banks?

427
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,185
This isn't what our ship
looked like.

428
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,728
We reconstructed it
from a partial schematic

429
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,230
found in the Cyrik Ocean...

430
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,982
which was badly damaged
by corrosion.

431
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,733
We were bound to get
a few details wrong.

432
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,735
<i>Voyager</i> wasn't a warship.

433
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,196
We were explorers!

434
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,865
Yes, I know--
trying to get home, to Mars.

435
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,742
Earth! You see, you couldn't
even get that right!

436
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,286
This is a nightmare.

437
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,038
What if I'm
found guilty?

438
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,248
What's going
to happen to me?

439
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,125
That's up to the Arbiters.

440
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,085
But I imagine
the penalty would be severe.

441
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,172
Your program
could be decompiled.

442
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,381
You've got
to believe me.

443
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,885
To you, this may
be ancient history.

444
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,887
To me, it's yesterday.

445
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,763
You called me a living witness.

446
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,265
Well, at least
give me the chance

447
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,725
to set the record straight.

448
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,769
I want to see your version
of what happened.

449
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,771
We've already drained
two phaser banks,

450
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,232
and he hasn't hit anything.

451
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,608
If you looked at your
console once in awhile,

452
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,694
instead of chasing
the female ensigns,

453
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,737
you'd see otherwise.

454
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,905
KIM:
Tom's right.

455
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:26,906
This war was supposed

456
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,115
to be over in five minutes.

457
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,992
You have a better idea,
Lieutenant?

458
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,618
As a matter
of fact, I do.

459
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,080
Fighter shuttles--
a direct assault.

460
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,456
Led by you? Good luck.

461
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,251
Watch your mouth, hedgehog.

462
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,919
I haven't heard
a single good idea.

463
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,922
Well, then propose something,
First Officer.

464
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,506
Earn your rank for once.

465
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,635
CHAKOTAY:
Get away from us...

466
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,265
Gentlemen...

467
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,058
Gentlemen!

468
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,273
Save it for the holodeck.

469
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:03,525
We've got a war to fight.

470
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,652
We've only been attacking

471
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,740
the Kyrian military
installations-- a mistake.

472
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,450
We should target
the general population.

473
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,120
Excellent idea, Captain.

474
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,663
I've examined the Kyrian genome,
and they would be vulnerable

475
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,291
to any number of
biological weapons.

476
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,626
JANEWAY:
How soon could you
have one ready?

477
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,753
Within the hour.

478
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,507
Dismissed.

479
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,968
Pure fiction.

480
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,761
This is absurd.

481
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,554
QUARREN:
Halt re-creation.

482
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,848
This is a reasonable
extrapolation

483
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,100
from historic record.

484
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,310
But if you'd like

485
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,019
to point out any
inconsistencies...

486
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,438
Inconsistencies?!

487
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,398
I don't know
where to begin.

488
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,025
Granted, this looks
like the briefing room,

489
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,986
but these aren't
the people I knew.

490
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,322
No one behaved like this.

491
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,158
Well... aside from Mr. Paris.

492
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,076
We weren't
at each other's throats.

493
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,036
We didn't talk about
how to destroy planets.

494
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,037
We helped people.

495
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,081
We were an enlightened crew.

496
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,958
Are you denying these
events took place?

497
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,084
Yes.

498
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,585
Are you saying you
never got involved

499
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,087
in the conflict
between my people

500
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,298
and the Vaskans?
Yes!

501
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,008
Well, no, we did get involved,

502
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,468
but it was nothing
like this.

503
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:11,509
Elaborate.

504
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,889
There was a meeting
in this room,

505
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,476
but it wasn't
about battle tactics,

506
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,228
it was about a dilemma
we were facing.

507
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,858
We had negotiated a trade
agreement with the Vaskans.

508
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,111
We were dealing with
a representative, Ambassador...

509
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,488
Ambassador Daleth.

510
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,156
Daleth. Exactly.

511
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,828
Everything was going
according to plan...

512
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,997
until...

513
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,625
...we were attacked...

514
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,337
by your people, the Kyrians.

515
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,381
They'd picked that moment
to start a war

516
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,882
and we were caught
in the middle.

517
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,258
The Kyrians were the aggressors?

518
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,759
No, no, that can't be right.

519
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,970
Captain Janeway called
this meeting to figure out

520
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,139
how we could extricate ourselves
from the conflict

521
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,683
and still maintain the trade
agreement with the Vaskans.

522
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,227
But we weren't on their side,

523
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,479
and we certainly
never attacked you.

524
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:07,483
Save your objections until
you see the entire re-creation.

525
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,942
Let's continue.

526
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,946
We will prevail.

527
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,124
JANEWAY:
Don't look so shocked,
Ambassador.

528
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,419
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

529
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:39,973
Somewhere-- halfway
across the galaxy, I hope--

530
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,018
Captain Janeway
is spinning in her grave.

531
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,104
You've portrayed us
as monsters.

532
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,064
The Captain's
a cold-blooded killer;

533
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,983
the crew's a gang of thugs;
and I'm a mass murderer.

534
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,902
Calm yourself.
Why should I?

535
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,238
I'm about to be hanged
for crimes I didn't commit.

536
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,614
Tell me your
version of events.

537
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,497
I remember this man.

538
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,831
Tedran.

539
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,209
He was a martyr
to our people.

540
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,461
Some martyr.

541
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,004
He led the Kyrian attack
against<i> Voyager.</i>

542
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,881
You're lying.
I was there.

543
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,592
You're trying to
protect yourself.

544
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,717
And so are you!

545
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,177
From the truth.

546
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,012
Isn't it a coincidence
that the Kyrians are

547
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,306
being portrayed
in the best

548
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,265
possible light?

549
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:25,144
Martyrs, heroes, saviors.

550
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,020
Obviously, events
have been reinterpreted

551
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,523
to make your people
feel better about themselves.

552
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,649
Revisionist history...

553
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,068
it's such a comfort.

554
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,237
We were not the aggressors
in the Great War.

555
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,654
We were the victims.

556
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,366
The proof can be found
anywhere on this world.

557
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,952
The Kyrian people are
being oppressed to this day.

558
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,288
The problems in your society
are none of my business.

559
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:47,707
I'm just telling you
what I saw 700 years ago.

560
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,877
I don't believe you,
and neither will anyone else.

561
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,962
What are you doing?

562
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,589
Shutting down your program.

563
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,965
Wait. Please. I...

564
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,258
I can prove
to you I'm right.

565
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,384
The medical tricorder--

566
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,927
the artifact
you have on display.

567
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,095
If you just let me...

568
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,019
Lies.

569
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,533
Begin dictation.

570
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,742
I've reexamined the data module

571
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:26,330
and from what I can tell, the
Doctor was telling the truth--

572
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,166
at least about one thing.

573
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:34,463
He is a hologram,
a backup program.

574
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,132
We always knew he was
an artificial life-form,

575
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,259
but we thought
he was an android.

576
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,099
If we were mistaken
about that...

577
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,144
I wonder if we might also
be wrong about<i> Voyager</i> itself.

578
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,526
Another question,

579
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,696
Why would a hologram
designed for medical purposes

580
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,948
be programmed to lie so readily?

581
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,367
From the moment I activated him,

582
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,620
this Doctor has insisted
that he's innocent.

583
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,789
At first, I...
didn't believe him.

584
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,629
End dictation.

585
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:41,821
Activate re-creation:
"The<i> Voyager</i> Encounter."

586
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,823
Display Medical Chamber.

587
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,586
(<i> beeping</i> )

588
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,255
Please state the nature
of the medical...

589
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,133
Oh. It's you.

590
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,304
You've given me a lot
to think about.

591
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,597
Really?

592
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:10,058
I thought you'd heard enough
of my... lies.

593
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,644
I judged you too quickly.

594
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,645
I'm sorry.

595
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,438
What changed your mind?

596
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,274
Time to think.

597
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,901
For your information,
I don't appreciate

598
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,529
being deactivated
in the middle of a sentence.

599
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,573
It brings back...

600
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,907
unpleasant memories.

601
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,992
It won't happen again.

602
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,243
Good.

603
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,911
Because if you don't stop
treating me

604
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,246
like a second-class hologram,

605
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,123
I won't cooperate
with your investigation.

606
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,750
I'm perfectly happy
to lie dormant

607
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,376
in that data module
for a few eons.

608
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,628
I didn't come here to argue.

609
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,171
Then what<i> do</i> you want?

610
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,424
I don't know.

611
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,385
To talk, I guess,

612
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,097
about what really happened
700 years ago.

613
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,724
Are you sure
you're willing to listen

614
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,769
to a mass-murderer like me?

615
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,854
I'm willing to keep
an open mind.

616
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,690
That's the most I can promise.

617
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,694
Try to understand
my point of view.

618
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,488
All my life, I thought
I knew the truth.

619
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,114
There was never any doubt.

620
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,534
I never meant to throw
your beliefs into doubt,

621
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,495
but I can't deny
what I know to be true.

622
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,413
I realize that now...

623
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,208
and I want to
know the truth.

624
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,378
And I want the Arbiters
to know it, too.

625
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,005
Well...

626
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,843
the stage is certainly set,

627
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:28,011
but I'll have to
rewrite the characters

628
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,222
and revise
the plot a little.

629
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,683
I'm quite adept in the art
of holographic programming.

630
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,768
If you'll give me access
to your technology,

631
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,813
maybe I can create a
simulation of my own...

632
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,523
show you what happened.

633
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,152
Don't worry, Ambassador.

634
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,904
We've got plenty
of medical supplies,

635
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,031
and we'd be more than happy
to share them with you.

636
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,157
Then we agree.

637
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,535
In exchange,
we'll provide you

638
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,119
with as much dilithium
as you need.

639
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,954
That's very generous,
Ambassador.

640
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,875
I'll transport
the canisters immediately.

641
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,918
It would be in
your best interest

642
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,587
to make this
exchange quickly.

643
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,588
Oh? Why is that?

644
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,839
We've been in conflict

645
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,174
with a neighboring species,
the Kyrians.

646
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,385
They've been threatening
to attack us.

647
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,888
War could break out
any day.

648
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,223
We've tried
every diplomatic option,

649
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,975
but the Kyrians are
a violent, stubborn people.

650
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:20,188
No problem. I understand
what you're going through.

651
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,733
I wish I could make you
one of our diplomats.

652
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:23,983
You might
have better luck

653
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,569
resolving this situation.

654
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,404
Under different
circumstances...

655
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,614
Janeway to Sick Bay.

656
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,198
This is the Doctor.

657
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,743
<i>Ambassador Daleth and I</i>
<i>have reached an agreement.</i>

658
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,912
Assemble the medical supplies.

659
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,748
<i>Done, Captain. The supplies</i>
<i>are in Cargo Bay 1.</i>

660
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,375
Once we transport the supplies
to the surface, there may be...

661
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,418
(<i> rumbling</i> )

662
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,669
TUVOK:
<i>Red Alert.</i>

663
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,129
<i>Captain Janeway to the Bridge.</i>

664
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,009
TUVOK:
We're being fired on
by three ships.

665
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,261
The Kyrians.
Hail them.

666
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,763
TUVOK:
Channel open.

667
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,932
This is Captain Janeway
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

668
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:55,933
We are not your enemies.

669
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:59,227
Please break
off your attack.

670
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,438
They're not responding.

671
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,900
I'd advise you
to retreat, Captain.

672
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,777
Shields down
to 86 percent.

673
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,028
Break out of orbit.
Put some distance between us.

674
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,864
Yes, ma'am.

675
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,031
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

676
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,283
Four intruders.

677
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,367
They are in Engineering.

678
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,328
Janeway to Engineering.

679
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,454
B'Elanna, respond.

680
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,206
Tuvok.

681
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,005
Take as much of their
technology as you can.

682
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,256
You will fail.

683
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,219
Drop your weapons.

684
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,638
Back away.

685
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,067
<i>Tuvok to Janeway.</i>
Go ahead.

686
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,402
<i>The Kyrians have killed three</i>

687
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,570
of the Engineering crew.

688
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,989
They've taken Seven of Nine

689
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,991
and one of the injured
crew members hostage.

690
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,159
<i>They're now on Deck 2,</i>
<i>Section 32.</i>

691
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,744
Acknowledged.

692
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,163
Remember your offer
to make me a diplomat?

693
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,165
Well, it looks like I don't
have much of a choice.

694
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,709
Tell the Doctor
we have casualties.

695
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,293
Have him meet
us on Deck 2.

696
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,216
Janeway to Tuvok.

697
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,801
We're approaching
Section 31.

698
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,428
TUVOK:
<i>The evacuation of Deck 2</i>
<i>is complete.</i>

699
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,806
Send three security
teams to this deck,

700
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,474
then seal all
the access points.

701
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,684
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

702
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,894
How typical of the Kyrians.

703
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,269
What do you mean?

704
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,398
They fight the same way
they live-- deviously.

705
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,941
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

706
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,905
Janeway to Tuvok.
<i>Tuvok here.</i>

707
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,032
The Kyrians are in
the Mess Hall. We're going in.

708
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,616
<i>Security is on the way.</i>

709
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,869
I'll go first, Captain,
and draw any fire, if need be.

710
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,412
Your crew is
heroic, Captain.

711
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,539
I just happen to be
invulnerable to phaser fire,

712
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,416
but I appreciate
the compliment. Captain?

713
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,458
Go.

714
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,379
DALETH:
Tedran...

715
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,463
this is between us.

716
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,840
Leave these people
out of it.

717
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,717
I know what
you're doing--

718
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,719
an alliance
with these aliens.

719
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,554
We were trading with them,
nothing more.

720
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,514
You expect me to believe that?

721
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,933
You plan to use this ship

722
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,475
to destroy<i> us.</i>

723
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,979
We wouldn't need help
if we wanted to destroy you.

724
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,356
We didn't realize you were
fighting with the Vaskans.

725
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,067
Now, lay down your weapons,

726
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,277
and I promise
you won't be harmed.

727
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,653
(<i> door opens</i> )

728
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,491
No!

729
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,659
(<i> groans</i> )

730
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,959
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

731
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,752
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )

732
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:29,836
He's dead.

733
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,093
DOCTOR:
Computer, freeze program.

734
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,677
A tragic, needless death,

735
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,014
but, as you can see,
<i>Voyager</i> was not responsible.

736
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,599
After Tedran was killed,

737
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,477
<i>Voyager</i> was attacked
by nine Kyrian ships.

738
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,186
My program was disabled,

739
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,773
most likely when they
stole my backup module.

740
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,108
The next thing I knew,

741
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,859
I was standing next
to this gentleman,

742
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,235
seven centuries later.

743
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,612
Very entertaining.

744
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,572
I'll admit your holo-technology
is new to me.

745
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,198
I had to extrapolate
in a few places,

746
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,326
but I assure you, this is
an accurate re-creation.

747
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,954
Perhaps. Or perhaps
it's the fabrication

748
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,873
of a war criminal
who's afraid for his life.

749
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,208
VASKAN:
Do you have any
evidence to support

750
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,585
your explanation?

751
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,629
In fact, I do.

752
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:16,299
I've confirmed that
this is the same tricorder

753
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,011
I used to scan Tedran
at the moment of his death.

754
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,179
If I can access
the bio-readings inside,

755
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,556
I can prove that he was killed
by a Vaskan weapon,

756
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,433
not by Captain Janeway.

757
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,977
Can this be done?

758
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,855
I've been trying to decipher
the instrument for years,

759
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,106
but with the Doctor's help...

760
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,732
I fail to see what
this would prove.

761
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,526
Tedran died on<i> Voyager,</i>

762
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,195
a victim of a conspiracy
to oppress my people.

763
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,989
The weapon used,
who fired it--

764
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,657
this is all
beside the point.

765
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,200
Was there a conspiracy?

766
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,619
Did<i> Voyager</i> really help
my ancestors

767
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,871
to start the Great War,

768
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,789
or were Kyrians
the aggressors,

769
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,374
as my people
have always believed?

770
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,625
No, this casts

771
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,251
doubt on everything.

772
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,587
But it doesn't change
the fact that my children

773
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,381
can't attend the same
academies as yours,

774
00:36:56,381 --> 00:37:00,301
or that we are forced to live
outside of the city center.

775
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,971
Today's problems
are not at issue here.

776
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,263
This is about history.

777
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,683
Look, I don't know
who started your war.

778
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,019
All I'm saying is that
<i>Voyager</i> wasn't responsible.

779
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,980
I can't believe
that you would cooperate

780
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,858
with this murderer--
you, of all people.

781
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:15,984
You built this museum.

782
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,736
The facts are
turning out to be

783
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,404
more complex
than I expected.

784
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,032
We shouldn't be listening
to this hologram.

785
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,034
I want him arrested
and charged

786
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,078
for the crimes
we know he committed.

787
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,996
That's not your decision
to make.

788
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,581
No, it's not, is it?

789
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,290
I'm only on
this commission

790
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,085
because you needed
a token Kyrian.

791
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,878
Please.
This isn't about race.

792
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,129
It's always about race.

793
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,549
You seize every
opportunity

794
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,467
to keep yourselves
in power.

795
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,136
I'm sorry you see it that way.

796
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,679
I think we are obligated

797
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,223
to hear what the Doctor
has to say.

798
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:47,640
Proceed with your investigation.

799
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,935
Yes, Arbiter.

800
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,607
You'll pay for your crimes.

801
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,822
700 years,
and I'm still caught

802
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,741
in the middle
of your little dispute.

803
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,076
One might have hoped

804
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,036
for a bit of social progress
in the interim.

805
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,205
Change never comes
easily for us.

806
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,706
Humph. That's
an understatement.

807
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,208
I've entered the
specifications

808
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,960
that you gave me.

809
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,962
Let's give it a try.

810
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,715
Close enough.

811
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,051
This diagnostic tool
should help me get past

812
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,178
the initial
encryption sequences.

813
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,931
Too bad we can't re-create
B'Elanna Torres.

814
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,475
Torres... the Chief
Transporter Operator.

815
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,102
Chief Engineer.

816
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,352
You might want to make

817
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,148
the correction
in your history books.

818
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,776
What was she like-- Torres?

819
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,779
I suppose we've gotten
her personality wrong, too.

820
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,031
Starting to believe
me, are you?

821
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:49,869
Well, let's just say I'm
trying to keep an open mind.

822
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,080
B'Elanna Torres...

823
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,832
intelligent, beautiful,

824
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,875
and with a chip
on her shoulder

825
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,460
the size of
the Horsehead Nebula.

826
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,757
She also had
a kind of vulnerability

827
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,717
that made her...

828
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,469
quite endearing.

829
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,471
You miss her...

830
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,514
and the others.

831
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,099
From my perspective,

832
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,311
I saw them all
only a few days ago.

833
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,189
But in fact,
it's been centuries.

834
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:20,025
And I'll never see them again.

835
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,404
Did they ever reach home?

836
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,991
I wonder.

837
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,826
I've always wondered that, too.

838
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,077
From as far back

839
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,038
as I can remember.

840
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,622
Really?

841
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,501
Ever since
I was a small child,

842
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,420
the first time I heard
the name<i> Voyager,</i>

843
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,466
it conjured up
my imagination.

844
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,635
Even though we were
the bad guys?

845
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,096
That didn't matter.
I was too young

846
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,515
to understand
the implications.

847
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,185
The fact that you were
so far from home,

848
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,603
traveling across the stars.

849
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,982
Oh, I found it all very heroic.

850
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,775
I suppose<i> Voyager</i>

851
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,862
is what made me fall in love
with history.

852
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:09,324
If it means anything to you,

853
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:12,660
you would have made
a fine member of our crew.

854
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,705
(<i> rumbling</i> )

855
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,336
I hope that's part
of the simulation.

856
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,380
No, it isn't.

857
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,465
(<i> glass shattering</i> )

858
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,467
(<i> people shouting</i> )

859
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,553
(<i> glass shattering,</i>
<i>shouting continues</i> )

860
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:40,313
(<i> all shouting</i> )

861
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,955
(<i> screaming</i> )

862
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,131
No! Stop this!

863
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,590
We know about the hologram!

864
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,134
This museum's
filled with lies!

865
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,302
Stop! Listen to me!

866
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,011
We've listened long enough!

867
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,765
They're using photon grenades.

868
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,183
We've got to take cover.

869
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,393
This way.

870
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,119
(<i> distant weapons fire</i>
<i>and explosions</i> )

871
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,623
What's happening?
I've been hearing weapons.

872
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,125
It's getting worse.

873
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,461
Protests, vandalism...
two people have been killed.

874
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,504
Don't worry. They've
cordoned off the museum.

875
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,589
We're safe for now.

876
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,216
That's not
what I'm concerned about.

877
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,677
Two deaths, a race riot,
all because of me?

878
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,972
You were only the catalyst.

879
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,807
The pressure's been
building for years.

880
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,143
It was only a matter of time
before something set it off.

881
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,478
Have you found
the tricorder?

882
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,728
Not yet.

883
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,314
It's crucial that we do.

884
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:07,275
The Kyrians are demanding you
be punished for your crimes,

885
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,777
but the Vaskans want to hear
your version of events again.

886
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,779
They want to continue
the investigation.

887
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,281
What's going to happen?

888
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,283
I don't know.

889
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,495
The Vaskans are more powerful,
but the Kyrians are very angry.

890
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,288
They're talking
about another war.

891
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,208
Then there's only one solution.

892
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,127
Delete my program.

893
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,921
I've become a kind of symbol
for this conflict.

894
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,423
As long as I'm around,

895
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,800
your people are going
to keep on fighting.

896
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,719
I'll show you
how to decompile my program.

897
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,888
You can say I was damaged
in the attack last night.

898
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,390
No one will hold
you responsible.

899
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,640
I can't do that to you.

900
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,808
Then I'll do it myself.

901
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,767
No!

902
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,520
I'm a medical hologram...

903
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,188
programmed to do no harm,

904
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,690
but I'm doing harm
on a global scale.

905
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,901
Ever since you reactivated
me, I've been concerned

906
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,070
with clearing
<i>Voyager's</i> good name.

907
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,321
But that's not important now.

908
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,739
There's more at stake.

909
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,535
A few days ago, I might
have agreed with you.

910
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:00,245
But what about the facts?

911
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,787
Facts be damned!

912
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:05,250
Names, dates, places--
it's all open to interpretation.

913
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,668
Who's to say
what really happened?

914
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:11,005
And ultimately,
what difference does it make?

915
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,800
What matters is today and
the future of your people.

916
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,803
Doctor, you were there.
You can't deny what happened.

917
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,266
I can... and I will.

918
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:24,143
Tedran was a martyr
for your people, a hero,

919
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,354
a symbol of your struggle
for freedom.

920
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,981
Who am I to wander in
700 years later

921
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,525
and take that away from you?

922
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,777
History has been abused!

923
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,406
We keep blaming each other
for what happened in the past.

924
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:42,412
If you don't help us now,
it could be another 700 years.

925
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,002
Let's find that tricorder.

926
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,851
It was a pivotal moment
in our history.

927
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,232
As a result
of the Doctor's testimony,

928
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,527
a dialogue was opened
between our peoples.

929
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,613
Eventually, we found
a new respect

930
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,865
for our divergent cultures
and traditions.

931
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,785
The efforts of people
like Quarren and the Doctor

932
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,663
paved the way for unity.

933
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,499
Quarren died six years later,

934
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:31,961
but he lived long enough
to witness the Dawn of Harmony.

935
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,630
And the Doctor...

936
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:38,759
well, he served as our Surgical
Chancellor for many years,

937
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,595
until he decided to leave.

938
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,930
He took a small craft
and set a course

939
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,057
for the Alpha Quadrant,

940
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,060
attempting to trace
the path of<i> Voyager.</i>

941
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,189
He said he had a longing...

942
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,107
for home.

943
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,401
This way.
