1
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,135
(<i> energy crackling</i> )

2
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,775
Commander Chakotay.

3
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,527
I understand you wanted
to see me.

4
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,488
I'm told you are the officer
in charge of personnel

5
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,825
that you prepare
the duty assignments.

6
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:33,826
Is that the correct phrase?

7
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,410
That's right.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,707
I'm finding it... difficult
to spend so much time alone.

9
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,710
I am unaccustomed to it.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,086
The hours do not pass quickly.

11
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,087
I can understand that.

12
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,840
How can we help?

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,217
I've been considering
the matter carefully.

14
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,178
I would like to request
a duty assignment.

15
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,890
Did you have something
specific in mind?

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,140
Yes.

17
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:02,396
Now what?

18
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,314
There's been a rupture
in the coolant injector.

19
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,483
I can see that.
Why haven't you sealed it off?

20
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,569
I'm attempting to do so.

21
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,324
That's better.

22
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,535
Lieutenant, I have an idea.
Perhaps it would be advisable 

23
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,037
to reconfigure
the coolant assembly.

24
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,371
That would give us
greater control

25
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,873
over the pressure
valve emissions.

26
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,499
You are probably right.

27
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,585
And tomorrow we can do it
first thing, but not today.

28
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,879
I don't understand. Why wait
until tomorrow when today...?

29
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,047
TORRES:
Not today, Vorik.

30
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,761
PARIS:
Good morning.

31
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,346
Here's the helm control
evaluation you wanted.

32
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,515
Thank you.

33
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,434
We still on for dinner tonight?

34
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,562
I may have to work.
I'll let you know.

35
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,440
Aha. Okay.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,485
Have you decided if you're...
if you're going through with it?

37
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:54,197
I have, and I'm not.

38
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,657
Today hasn't started out
very well

39
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,242
and the last thing I need

40
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,495
is to get involved with
some obscure Klingon ritual.

41
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,872
You were the one
who suggested it.

42
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,041
I know. And for one
sentimental minute

43
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,085
I thought that I might
actually go through with it

44
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,628
but not anymore.

45
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,963
Of course not.

46
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:13,675
Wouldn't want to get
too sentimental.

47
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,176
I overslept this morning

48
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,263
because I forgot to tell
the computer to wake me

49
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,058
and then the acoustic inverter
in my sonic shower blew out.

50
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,768
That'll make your hair
stand on end.

51
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,227
So I didn't have
time for breakfast.

52
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,896
And when I got here,
two people were out sick

53
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,065
so I had to cancel
the fuel cell overhaul.

54
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,191
And then an injector
burst for no apparent reason

55
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,944
and started spewing
plasma coolant.

56
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,821
That's a run of
bad luck, alright.

57
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,280
So, I'm in a bad mood,

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,241
and I know that I'm being
a little bit testy.

59
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,369
No. That's okay.

60
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,412
Think about that dinner.

61
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,208
Be careful.

62
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,713
Something interesting
just happened.

63
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,007
What's that?

64
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,383
Seven of Nine requested
a duty assignment.

65
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,551
Fascinating.

66
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,470
She wants to work
in Engineering.

67
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,596
What?

68
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,180
The Borg use
transwarp conduits

69
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,433
to travel through space
faster than warp speed.

70
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,060
If we could create
one of them...

71
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,646
we don't know anything
about transwarp technology.

72
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,314
Playing around with it
could be dangerous.

73
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,858
That's where
Seven of Nine comes in.

74
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,734
She's offered
to work with you.

75
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,903
What do you think
her real motives are?

76
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,279
She's having a tough time

77
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,197
making the transition
from the collective.

78
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,408
She wants something to do.

79
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,079
I never thought of you
as naive, Chakotay.

80
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,706
Bottom line is,

81
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,291
I don't want her working
in Engineering.

82
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,085
The bottom line is,
I'm giving you an order

83
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,671
and you're going to
follow it, Lieutenant.

84
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,299
Whatever you say, sir.

85
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,055
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

86
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,791
JANEWAY:
Seven of Nine,
you told me you wouldn't

87
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,543
make any more attempts
to contact the Borg.

88
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,420
I want to believe
that's true.

89
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,713
I assure you it is.

90
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,257
I've decided
not to post

91
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,092
a security detail while
you're in Engineering

92
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,385
but you have to realize
there are rules.

93
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,638
You'll be expected
to follow our protocols.

94
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,598
You'll report directly
to Lieutenant Torres

95
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,475
and obey any order
she gives you.

96
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
I understand.

97
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,561
One more thing--

98
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,482
your designation,
"Seven of Nine"

99
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,234
is a little cumbersome.

100
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,485
Wouldn't you prefer

101
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,239
to be called
by your given name, Annika?

102
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,868
I have been Seven of Nine
for as long as I can remember.

103
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,744
All right.

104
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,040
But maybe we could
streamline it a little.

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,249
How would you feel about...

106
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,292
"Seven"?

107
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,130
Imprecise...

108
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,007
but acceptable.

109
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,091
<i>Tuvok to Captain Janeway.</i>

110
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,259
Yes, Tuvok?

111
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,802
Please come to the Bridge.

112
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,137
A ship is approaching.

113
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,939
It's damaged,
but functional.

114
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,067
Energy emissions
are so low

115
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,777
it's probably not
capable of warp speed.

116
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,988
Several dozen
life signs aboard.

117
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,240
We are being
hailed, captain.

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,783
Open a channel.

119
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,910
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway

120
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,080
of the Federation
starship<i> Voyager.</i>

121
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,207
<i>I am Rahmin.</i>

122
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,416
<i>My people are the Caatati.</i>

123
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,754
<i>I apologize</i>
<i>for our appearance</i>

124
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:05,884
<i>and the condition of our ship.</i>

125
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,263
<i>Most of our people</i>
<i>were assimilated by the Borg</i>

126
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,306
<i>over a year ago.</i>

127
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,641
<i>We lost everything.</i>

128
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,981
How many of you escaped?

129
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,443
<i>A few thousand, on 30 ships--</i>

130
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,322
<i>all that's left</i>
<i>from a planet of millions.</i>

131
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,823
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,286
<i>Captain,</i>
<i>I want to assure you</i>

133
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,747
<i>my people were once</i>
<i>proud and accomplished.</i>

134
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,165
I understand.

135
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,211
<i>It pains me</i>
<i>to have to ask this</i>

136
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:48,635
<i>but I have 88 people</i>
<i>to care for on this vessel.</i>

137
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:53,473
<i>Is there any way</i>
<i>you could help us?</i> 

138
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,767
Of course.
Send us a list of your needs

139
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,977
and we'll see what we can do. 

140
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:01,106
<i>I'm deeply grateful.</i>

141
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,608
<i>If it's not too much to ask</i>

142
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,402
<i>is there any way</i>
<i>you might also spare</i>

143
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:09,323
<i>a small quantity</i>
<i>of thorium isotopes?</i>

144
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:13,493
<i>Without them,</i>
<i>our systems can't function.</i>

145
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,162
I think we can arrange that.

146
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,830
I'll speak to my engineer.

147
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,167
<i>You can't imagine</i>

148
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:25,005
<i>what this means to us,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

149
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,089
<i>Thank you.</i>

150
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,146
How are those thorium isotopes
coming, Vorik?

151
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,439
I'll admit I'm
having trouble

152
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,192
controlling the
neutron absorption.

153
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,694
Try increasing
the temperature of the plasma.

154
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,779
Get the thorium to the captain
as soon as it's ready.

155
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,614
Of course.

156
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,951
Tell me something...

157
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,745
when you hear about people
like the Caatati

158
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,873
do you have any feelings
of remorse?

159
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,380
No.

160
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,881
That's it?

161
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,674
Just "no"?

162
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,093
What further answer
do you require?

163
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,137
Oh, maybe some kind
of acknowledgment

164
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,973
of the billions of lives
you helped destroy.

165
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,184
A justification
for what you did.

166
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,644
Maybe... a little
sense of guilt.

167
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,730
Guilt is irrelevant.

168
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,316
Heartwarming.

169
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,235
I've set the parameters
for the tachyon burst

170
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,613
we'll need to create
a transwarp conduit.

171
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,615
It will be several hours
before the main deflector

172
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,284
can be modified.

173
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,246
I think it would be best
if I waited in my alcove.

174
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,914
I think you're right.

175
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,839
(<i> sighing</i> )

176
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,234
If I ever saw a job

177
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,611
for the morale officer,
it's sitting right here.

178
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,654
I'll bet I can help.

179
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,907
You're facing
a big challenge, Neelix.

180
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,367
I enjoy a challenge.

181
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,163
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

182
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,792
Blood pie,
for the day of honor.

183
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,127
How did you know about that?

184
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,712
Has Tom been talking to you?
Not at all.

185
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,840
No, I-I make it a point
to know these things.

186
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,217
And if I'm correct,

187
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,636
many Klingon families
traditionally serve

188
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,764
blood pie on the day of honor.

189
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,016
I appreciate
the gesture, Neelix,

190
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,646
but I've decided to ignore
this particular tradition.

191
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,524
No blood pie, no examining
my behavior over the last year

192
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,360
to see if I measure up
to Klingon standards.

193
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,445
Understood.

194
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,826
Lieutenant...

195
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,414
without knowing why

196
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,459
there's a black cloud
hanging over your head,

197
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,336
may I suggest something?

198
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,546
Go right ahead.

199
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,300
You have a...
bit of a temper...

200
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,594
that you keep reined in,

201
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,138
and sometimes,
it builds up inside you

202
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,475
until you explode
at someone.

203
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,893
I'd say that about sums it up.

204
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,272
I'm offering to be
a pressure valve.

205
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,440
A what?

206
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,650
You may use me

207
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,277
to blow off steam.

208
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,903
When you're angry,
come see me.

209
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,157
Call me names, insult me,
question my parentage.

210
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,617
I won't take it personally

211
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,160
and you won't need
to keep things

212
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,373
bottled up inside anymore.

213
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,043
That may be the nicest offer
I've had in a long time.

214
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,838
Thank you, Neelix.

215
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,342
You're sweet, but I'm not sure
I could do that to you.

216
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm here if you need me.

217
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,349
Neelix...

218
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,604
about this day of honor.

219
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,816
Do you think
I should go through with it?

220
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,028
I've always thought traditions
were good things...

221
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,489
worth preserving.

222
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,866
I've been thinking
a lot about...

223
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,537
the rituals
that my mother taught me, and...

224
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:30,625
they don't seem quite so hateful
as they did when I was a child.

225
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,588
Maybe being so far away from
anything Klingon has changed me.

226
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,005
It certainly can't hurt

227
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:40,176
to go through
with the ceremony.

228
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,723
I don't know
what effect it'll have on me.

229
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,182
That's what's frightening.

230
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,440
(<i> sighing</i> )

231
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,361
All right.

232
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,904
Bring on the blood pie.

233
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,661
(<i> sighing</i> )

234
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,538
I can do this.

235
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,351
<i>Qu'pla!</i>

236
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,104
What warrior goes there?

237
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,315
My name's B'elanna.

238
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,568
Have you come
to have your honor challenged?

239
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,861
I guess so. Yes.

240
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,741
Are you willing to see
the ceremony through to the end?

241
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,368
That's the idea, isn't it?

242
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,120
What do I do?

243
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,706
It will be a lengthy ordeal.

244
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,916
First, you must eat

245
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,796
from the heart
of a sanctified targ.

246
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,429
<i>Pak lohr!</i>

247
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,433
Yes... the heart of a targ

248
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,103
brings courage
to one who eats it.

249
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,691
Next you will drink mot'loch

250
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,777
from the Grail of Kahless.

251
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,199
Drink to the
glory of Kahless,

252
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,618
the greatest warrior
of all time.

253
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,833
(<i> choking</i> )

254
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,838
Kahless defeated his enemies
on the field of battle,

255
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,965
and built a mighty empire.

256
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,220
How have you proven
yourself worthy?

257
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,389
Um, I haven't built any empires,
and I can't say

258
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,475
that I've personally defeated
any enemies in battle

259
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,602
but you have to realize,
I'm not living among warriors.

260
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,648
Then how do you expect
to distinguish yourself?

261
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,692
I don't know. I guess
I'm doing the best I can.

262
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,821
Huh! A pitiful reply.

263
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,781
Let us proceed.

264
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,491
A warrior must endure

265
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,411
great hardship.

266
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,621
To test your mettle

267
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,834
you will endure the
ritual of 20 painsticks.

268
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,837
After that, you will
engage in combat

269
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,673
with a master
of the<i> bat'leth.</i>

270
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:30,179
Finally, you will traverse
the sulfur lagoons of Gorath.

271
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,682
You know, I don't think so.

272
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,642
I didn't want to do this
before you described it.

273
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,728
Certainly not now.

274
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,312
I'm leaving.

275
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,400
Not until you have
completed the ceremony,<i> p'tahk.</i>

276
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,402
(<i> yells in pain</i> )

277
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,112
(<i> gasping</i> )

278
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,408
(<i> yells in pain</i> )

279
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,077
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

280
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,590
(<i> panting</i> )

281
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,216
Thanks so much.

282
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,009
It's been lovely.

283
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,520
(<i> door beeping</i> )

284
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,563
Come in.

285
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,362
I tried to find you before,
but you were on the holodeck.

286
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,949
That's right.

287
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,285
You know, you left it running.

288
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,663
There was a Klingon in there
who didn't look too happy.

289
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,289
Really.

290
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,834
Yeah, and he was nursing
a whale of a black eye.

291
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,126
Looks like he had a run-in

292
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,463
with someone having
a really bad day.

293
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:49,175
That's very funny.

294
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:53,805
So, how'd it go?

295
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,766
It didn't.

296
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,394
Do you mind if we
talk about something else?

297
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,648
As a matter of fact, I do.

298
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,650
You have been like
a spitting cobra all day

299
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,193
and it's getting boring.

300
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,403
You know, we designed that
holodeck program together,

301
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,697
and I think you owe me

302
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,323
the courtesy of telling me
what happened.

303
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,118
It was ridiculous,
meaningless posturing.

304
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,245
Honor, dishonor--
what does it matter?

305
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,999
It matters because
it's part of who you are.

306
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,084
You've been running away
from that your whole life.

307
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,338
Who are you to
tell me that?

308
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,382
I care about you.

309
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,384
But if you're going
to keep pushing me away

310
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,469
then there's no point
in my staying around, is there?

311
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,763
Fine.
Just leave me alone.

312
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,265
Oh, don't worry. If this
is the way you treat people

313
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,894
who try to be your friend,
you'll be alone, all right.

314
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,080
There are over 200 people
on our three ships alone.

315
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,376
Every one of them
suffers from malnourishment

316
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,046
but it's been hardest
on the children.

317
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,924
Every parent
sacrifices for their child

318
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,677
but even so,
there's not enough food.

319
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,096
If you could hear
the crying of the babies

320
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,724
you would have as much trouble
sleeping at night as I do.

321
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,392
Have you considered relocation

322
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,228
to a planet where you
could grow your own food?

323
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,105
Of course...

324
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,816
but we haven't
been welcomed anywhere.

325
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,360
Because we have
no resources,

326
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,862
everyone treats us
like vagrants,

327
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,740
even criminals.

328
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,324
We're not
unsympathetic

329
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,159
but we have
limited supplies.

330
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,662
We can't possibly provide
enough for all your people

331
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,582
Forgive me,
but from my perspective,

332
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,917
you live in luxury.

333
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,002
You don't suffer from
debilitating diseases.

334
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:52,673
You have many sources
of energy-- replicators.

335
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,970
Your crew is very well fed.

336
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,806
Apparently,
keeping your bellies full

337
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,099
is more important to you

338
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,434
than helping those
less fortunate.

339
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,227
NEELIX:
That's unfair.

340
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,648
These are the most generous
people you could hope to meet.

341
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,817
But if we gave supplies
to everyone who asked

342
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,276
we wouldn't have anything left.

343
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,155
Neelix, how much food
can we spare?

344
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,533
We could provide each ship
with several hundred kilograms.

345
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,035
Do it. And check with
the doctor

346
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,413
to see if he can spare
any medical supplies.

347
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,414
Aye, Captain.

348
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,791
LUMAS:
Thank you.

349
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:33,255
May the gods smile
on you and your crew.

350
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,966
Tuvok, please escort
our guest

351
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,968
to the transporter room.

352
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,648
I've never navigated
a transwarp conduit.

353
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,566
Any problems I
should be aware of?

354
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,694
You'll have no idea
what you're doing.

355
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,820
If we attempt
to enter one,

356
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,989
I'll have to take
helm control.

357
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,116
I am a quick study.

358
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,492
What species is that?

359
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,619
A human who lived as a Borg.
Borg!

360
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,287
She is disconnected
from the collective.

361
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,580
She won't harm you.

362
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,207
Where's my wife?!
Where are my children?!

363
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,084
What did you do with them
after you took them?!

364
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,711
What did you do
with my family?!

365
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,547
Mr. Paris,
please proceed.

366
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,009
I lost everything--
my family, my home...!

367
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,635
Sorry about that.

368
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,887
About what?

369
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,097
Well, the way
he reacted to you.

370
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,640
He didn't injure me.

371
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,933
Good.

372
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,728
There are many
people on this ship

373
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,980
who have similar
feelings toward me.

374
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,025
I'm afraid you're right.

375
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,152
Does that bother you?

376
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,362
No.

377
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,824
Well, I'm not
one of those people.

378
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,242
We all have a past.

379
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,661
What matters is now.

380
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,330
I'm uncertain what
you're trying to say.

381
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,917
That...

382
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,543
if there's any way
that I can help you

383
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,879
adjust to your life
here on<i> Voyager,</i>

384
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,798
please ask me.

385
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,675
I will remember your offer.

386
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,400
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

387
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,985
All systems are ready.

388
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,653
We're only going
to take a peek.

389
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,698
We open a conduit, get as
much sensor data as we can

390
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,450
and then close it up.

391
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,993
I want to take this
one step at a time.

392
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,954
VORIK:
I've set up a temporary
tachyon matrix

393
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,538
within the main deflector.

394
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,623
It's on line.

395
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,458
Engineering to the Bridge.

396
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,876
<i>We're ready to start, Captain.</i> 

397
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,336
Go ahead. We'll monitor
your progress from here.

398
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,880
We'll need to be at warp speed

399
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,340
to create a large enough
subspace field.

400
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,342
I'd like to re-route
helm control to Engineering.

401
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,761
<i>Agreed. Janeway out.</i>

402
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,720
Take us past...

403
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,223
Past warp two. I know.

404
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,785
We're at warp 2.3.

405
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,036
All right.

406
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,455
Vorik, start emitting
the tachyons.

407
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,207
Energizing the matrix.

408
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,795
There's no indication
of a subspace field.

409
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,381
I'd recommend switching
to a higher energy band.

410
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,717
(<i> electronic humming</i> )

411
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,803
That did something.

412
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,139
The subspace
field is forming.

413
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,229
Tachyon particles are leaking
into the propulsion system!

414
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,397
Shut down the deflector.

415
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,566
Done, but the leak
is continuing.

416
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,154
<i>Janeway to Engineering.</i>

417
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,865
Tachyons are flooding
the warp core, captain!

418
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,741
If you can't stabilize
the core immediately,

419
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,327
evacuate Engineering.

420
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,369
Aye, Captain.
I'll get back to you.

421
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,706
I've cut all power relays,
but the tachyon levels

422
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,333
are still rising.

423
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,543
All right. Everybody out!

424
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,003
Now!

425
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,420
That means you as well.

426
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,630
I could be of help.

427
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,007
That's an order!

428
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,679
You can't order me.
I outrank you.

429
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,388
We've got to neutralize
the core.

430
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,935
I'll try decoupling
the dilithium matrix.

431
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,771
No effect!
Try it again.

432
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,107
It's not working!

433
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,317
The core's
about to breach!

434
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,319
I've got to try
one more thing.

435
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,112
B'elanna,
there's no time!

436
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,614
We've got to
get out of here!

437
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,450
Come on.

438
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,954
Computer, prepare
to eject the warp core

439
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,665
Authorization:
Torres Omega 5-9-3.

440
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,755
Computer, eject
the warp core.

441
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,431
Torres to Janeway.

442
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,975
<i>Go ahead.</i>

443
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,643
We've dumped the core.

444
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,777
Welcome to the worst day
of my life.

445
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,742
TORRES:
Vorik, we have to get

446
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,119
those impulse engines
back on line.

447
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,412
You and Nicoletti
get started.

448
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,329
Yes, Lieutenant.

449
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,830
JANEWAY:
Report.

450
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,374
We're stopped dead.

451
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,751
The warp core is millions
of kilometers away by now.

452
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,753
And the impulse engines
are seriously damaged.

453
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,713
I can give you a few thrusters,
but that's about it.

454
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,590
How long before I can
have impulse power?

455
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,008
I can't give you
an estimate on that.

456
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,719
We're still assessing
the damage.

457
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,807
So much for opening
a transwarp conduit.

458
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,893
I sent the Borg
back to her alcove.

459
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,521
We won't be needing her
in here anymore.

460
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,316
At least
the core's still intact.

461
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,276
Tom, take a shuttle and find it.

462
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,944
See if you can tractor
it back to<i> Voyager.</i>

463
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,237
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,863
It'll be unstable.
It should be repaired

465
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,449
before he tries to put
a tractor beam on it.

466
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,409
Well then, you go with him.
Do whatever you have to.

467
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,577
Just get it back here
in one piece.

468
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,723
TORRES:
We're getting near
some random ion turbulence.

469
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,809
I'll change course
to avoid it.

470
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,732
I wonder what else
can go wrong today?

471
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,693
If we get this core back,
I'm going right to bed

472
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,862
and sleeping straight through
till tomorrow.

473
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,613
Get this day over with.

474
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,991
Well, look at it this way--
how much worse could it get?

475
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:38,204
Having to dump the warp core has
to be the low point of any day.

476
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,247
Maybe it's me.

477
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:44,918
Maybe I'm asking
for this trouble somehow.

478
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,921
Or maybe it's just
a string of bad luck.

479
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,343
Sensors have picked up
a polymetallic object...

480
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,886
could be the core.

481
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,222
That's the warp signature,
all right

482
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,392
but there's something else
out there... a ship.

483
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,977
According to sensors,
it has the same energy signature

484
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,812
as the Caatati ships.

485
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,773
Maybe they're guarding
it for us.

486
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,816
Right.

487
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,156
I see it.

488
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,825
PARIS:
What do they think
they're doing?

489
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,245
They're trying to put
a tractor beam on it.

490
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,372
This is the shuttle<i> Cochrane</i>
to the Caatati vessel.

491
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,541
Please respond.

492
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,917
CAATATI:
<i>Don't come any closer.</i>

493
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,211
<i>We're performing</i>
<i>a salvage operation.</i>

494
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,213
Oh, what a coincidence--
so are we.

495
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,006
<i>I'm afraid we got here first.</i>

496
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,093
<i>Don't interfere</i>
<i>or we'll open fire.</i>

497
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,012
Don't you realize
that core is highly unstable?

498
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,472
If you try to tractor it
like that

499
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:42,935
you could cause
an antimatter explosion.

500
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:43,977
They're not answering.

501
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,396
Idiots!

502
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,398
We have to stop them
from destroying the core.

503
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,025
I'm going to try to disrupt
their tractor beam.

504
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,865
It's working.

505
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,827
What was that?

506
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,995
They sent
an antimatter pulse

507
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,663
back through
our particle beam.

508
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,874

Computer, respond.

Transporters are still on-line.

525
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,262
Stand by to energize.

526
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,810
Energize.

527
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,379
Paris to<i> Voyager.</i>

528
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,088

It's no use.

00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:45,098
The com system in these suits
won't carry that far.

533
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,145
When they get
the impulse engines repaired

534
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,980
they'll come
looking for us.

535
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,692
Well, I don't plan
on just drifting here

536
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:58,404
hoping somebody will come along
and rescue us.

537
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,280
There must be something
we can do.

538
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,781
Agreed.

539
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:08,747
If we could interplex
the com systems in both suits

540
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:13,919
we might be able to create
a phased carrier wave.

541
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,837
<i>Voyager</i> would read
the signature

542
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,464
and know it's from us.

543
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,592
Good idea.

544
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,967
Let me access
your controls.

545
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,013
I thought you'd never ask.

546
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,608
TORRES:
That's it.

547
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:52,625
This would be a lot easier
if I had a hyper-spanner.

548
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,334
Hold still.

549
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,716
PARIS:
Why is it we have
to get beamed into space

550
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,343
in environmental suits

551
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:07,347
before I can initiate
first contact procedures?

552
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:11,059
TORRES:
Why is it that if we're alone
for more than 30 seconds

553
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,354
you start thinking
about contact?

554
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,650
PARIS:
That is not fair.

555
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,820
The other day in Engineering,
I must have gone four minutes

556
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,239
before I started thinking
about it.

557
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,618
Okay...

558
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,704
I'm ready to initiate
the carrier wave.

559
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,539
(<i> loud whine</i> )
Ah!

560
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,207
Sorry.

561
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,421
Better?

562
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,214
Yeah.

563
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,383
Let's hope
it's still that strong

564
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,844
by the time
it gets to<i> Voyager.</i>

565
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,193
(<i> door beeping</i> )

566
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,486
Come in.

567
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,949
Would you like tea
or coffee?

568
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,035
I have no need
to ingest liquids.

569
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,870
I still receive energy
from the Borg alcove.

570
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,747
My understanding is
that you're almost ready

571
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:17,042
to begin eating food.

572
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,795
That is what
the doctor says.

573
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,548
Why have you
asked me here?

574
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,174
Whenever there's
an accident on the ship--

575
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,885
even a minor one--
we investigate it

576
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,722
in order to minimize the chances
of its happening again.

577
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,473
A prudent course
of action.

578
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,517
I didn't have a chance
to talk to Lieutenant Torres

579
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,685
before she left the ship

580
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,771
so, I wanted to ask you
some questions

581
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,607
about what happened
in Engineering.

582
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,275
Sensor logs indicate
that tachyons

583
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,862
were leaking
into the warp core.

584
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,321
Do you have any idea
how it started?

585
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,823
No.

586
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,533
We had reconfigured the
deflector shield

587
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,117
to emit tachyon bursts.

588
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,994
The procedure
must've triggered the leak.

589
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,121
Who was controlling
the tachyon bursts?

590
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,915
Ensign Vorik.

591
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,417
What were you doing?

592
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,627
Monitoring
the transwarp frequencies.

593
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,756
And did you at any time
access deflector control?

594
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,802
You believe I'm responsible
for the accident?

595
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,304
That I deliberately
sabotaged the ship?

596
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:15,392
You're like the others.
You see me as a threat.

597
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,064
I won't lie to you.
Part of me is suspicious.

598
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,691
We've dealt
with tachyon fields before

599
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,150
and never had
this kind of problem.

600
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,238
Captain, I am unaccustomed
to deception.

601
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,656
Among the Borg,
it was impossible.

602
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,949
There were no lies,

603
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,992
no secrets,
and I assure you

604
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,703
I had nothing to do
with the accident

605
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,329
in Engineering.

606
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,674
I believe you. Thank you.

607
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,930
I am finding it
a difficult challenge

608
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,933
to integrate into this group.

609
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,726
It is full
of complex social structures

610
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,478
that are unfamiliar to me.

611
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,438
Compared with the Borg,
this crew is inefficient

612
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,232
and contentious,

613
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:09,738
but it is capable of...
surprising acts of compassion.

614
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,450
Unexpected acts of kindness
are common among our group.

615
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,786
That's one of the ways
we define ourselves.

616
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,499
Is there anything more?

617
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,167
Yes.

618
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,296
We still have to find out
what caused the tachyon leak.

619
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,507
Tell me what you remember
about the power fluctuations

620
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,217
in the propulsion system.

621
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,566
TORRES:
This isn't anything
like the simulations

622
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,443
we had at the academy.

623
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,866
They felt peaceful...

624
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,617
like floating
in the womb...

625
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,873
but right now,

626
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:04,001
I'm feeling a little sick
to my stomach.

627
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,005
You dropped out too soon.

628
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,506
In the third year,

629
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:14,011
there's a six-week course
of actual space walks

630
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:16,972
so you can get
used to them.

631
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,141
I never would've lasted
till the third year.

632
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,810
If I hadn't dropped out

633
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,937
they would've
asked me to leave.

634
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,440
I wish I'd known you then.

635
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,943
You'd have hated me.

636
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,528
I can't imagine a time

637
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,031
I wouldn't have
found you fascinating.

638
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,495
What the hell was that?

639
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,833
More ion turbulence.

640
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:50,213
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning. Oxygen level</i>
<i>at 114 millibars.</i>

641
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,674
My oxygen supply is leaking.

642
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,133
(<i> gasping</i> )

643
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,470
Warning. Oxygen level
at 93 millibars.

644
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,598
We'll have to share mine.

645
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,189
Are you getting air now?

646
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:12,151
(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

647
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,612
Yes.

648
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,365
Much better.

649
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,368
Thanks.

650
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,037
What's wrong?

651
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:26,249
The turbulence must
have damaged my suit, too.

652
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,753
I should have at least
24 hours worth of oxygen

653
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,672
but there's only about
a half hour left.

654
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,390
VORIK:
<i>Engineering to Captain Janeway.</i>

655
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,475
Yes, Ensign?

656
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,851
I am pleased to inform you that

657
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,853
impulse power should be restored
within the hour.

658
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,147
Good news. Let me know as soon
as the engines are on line.

659
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,274
<i>Yes, Ma'am.</i>

660
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,444
Captain, I believe I've found
the cause of the accident--

661
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,322
erratic fluctuations
in the ship's warp power.

662
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,658
When tachyon levels rose
to a resonant frequency

663
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,493
core pressure increased.

664
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,953
Then it<i> was</i> an accident.

665
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,621
(<i> door beeping</i> )

666
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,832
Come in.

667
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,583
Captain, we've picked up
a carrier wave

668
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,961
with a Starfleet signature.
I'd guess it's Tom and B'elanna,

669
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,587
but they're not
answering our hail.

670
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,506
They may be in trouble.
Soon as we get impulse power...

671
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,843
<i>Tuvok to the Captain.</i>
<i>Can you come to the Bridge?</i>

672
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,594
On my way.

673
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,185
We're being approached
by an armada of Caatati ships.

674
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,186
They're hailing us.

675
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,563
On screen.

676
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,691
<i>Hello, Captain.</i>

677
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,192
You've brought some friends.

678
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,902
<i>Needy friends.</i>

679
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:39,072
<i>We're hoping</i>
<i>you'll offer us more supplies.</i>

680
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,281
I made it clear last time

681
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,867
that we couldn't possibly
provide you

682
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,743
with enough for all your ships.

683
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,244
<i>And I had to accept that</i>

684
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,790
<i>because your ship</i>
<i>is more powerful than ours</i>

685
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,126
<i>but the situation has changed,</i>
<i>hasn't it?</i>

686
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,252
<i>You seem to be</i>
<i>at a disadvantage now.</i>

687
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,629
<i>We have your warp core.</i>

688
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,215
<i>You can't escape.</i>

689
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,051
<i>I'm hoping that will</i>
<i>make you more generous.</i>

690
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:02,179
We've given you
everything we can spare.

691
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,015
Return the core,
and we'll be on our way.

692
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,517
<i>One of our ships might not seem</i>
<i>threatening to you,</i>

693
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:12,647
<i>but I assure you, 27 can</i>
<i>inflict considerable damage.</i>

694
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,940
<i>We are desperate.</i>

695
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,693
<i>Prepare to send us</i>
<i>food, weapons,</i>

696
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,112
<i>and your entire supply</i>
<i>of thorium.</i>

697
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,614
<i>And that Borg</i>
<i>you're protecting--</i>

698
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,824
<i>we want her, too.</i>

699
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,617
<i>There are many who would enjoy</i>

700
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,869
<i>a chance to repay one of them</i>

701
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,874
<i>for what they did to us.</i>

702
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,884
PARIS:
I'm lowering
the oxygen ratio.

703
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:45,013
That should give us
a few more minutes.

704
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,640
(<i> weakly</i> ):
I'm feeling...

705
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,768
kind of groggy.

706
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,230
Oxygen deprivation.

707
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,523
And you're lowering it?

708
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,402
We have to try to make it
last as long as possible.

709
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,447
It's ironic, isn't it?

710
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,785
What?

711
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,955
Today...

712
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:13,666
the day of honor...

713
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,878
is the day that
I'm going to die.

714
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,422
We are not going to die.

715
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,967
Would you stop
talking like that?

716
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,719
We have to face up to it, Tom.

717
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:30,475
There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

718
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,769
Well, now's the time.

719
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,483
When we first met...

720
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,402
you didn't have
a very high opinion of me.

721
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,865
That's putting it mildly.

722
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:51,454
I thought you were an arrogant,
self-absorbed pig.

723
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,914
(<i> chuckles</i> )

724
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,168
Flattery won't get you
any more oxygen.

725
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,965
Do you think I've changed?

726
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,175
A lot.

727
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,221
Now you're a stubborn,
domineering pig.

728
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:12,184
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

729
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,768
I'm just kidding.

730
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,733
There I go again...

731
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,986
just pushing you away.

732
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,870
You were right about me.

733
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,788
It's what I do...

734
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:40,086
push people away.

735
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,631
Well, it's a surefire way
of not getting hurt.

736
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,969
What a coward I am.

737
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,971
Shh...

738
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,826
Our weapons are more
powerful than theirs.

739
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,078
I say we fight.

740
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,412
Maybe if we give
them something.

741
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,830
JANEWAY:
Like what?

742
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,583
I can't imagine what
would satisfy them now.

743
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,459
SEVEN:
I will go.

744
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,087
They asked for me.

745
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,923
If I surrender myself,
perhaps they'll let you leave.

746
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,216
That's very generous,

747
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,467
but I will not turn
you over to them.

748
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,802
I was only offering

749
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,097
to do what would be best
for this group.

750
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,640
You're part of this group now,
and we're going to protect you.

751
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,393
It's time
to stop talking about this.

752
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,561
Tom and B'elanna are in trouble,
and we have to find them.

753
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,606
Tuvok, what's the status
of our weapons array?

754
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,150
Weapons are at the ready,
captain, but our shield strength

755
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,860
is extremely low.

756
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,820
We'll have to shut down
non-essential systems.

757
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,697
Reroute power
to the shields.

758
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,743
We're going to fight.
That might not be necessary.

759
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,537
Caatati technology is dependent
on thorium isotopes.

760
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,706
If they had enough, they could
become self-sustaining.

761
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,792
But we don't have that much
thorium to give them.

762
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,543
When the Borg
assimilated the Caatati

763
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,463
the survivors lost their ability
to replicate the isotopes.

764
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,757
But I have retained
that knowledge.

765
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,509
I could design an energy matrix
that would produce thorium

766
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,429
in large quantities.

767
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:16,141
If you've had this knowledge all
along, why didn't you say so?

768
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:19,227
I am not accustomed
to thinking that way.

769
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,104
Borg do not consider
giving technology away,

770
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,648
only assimilating it.

771
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,984
And what do you suppose
made you consider it now?

772
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:31,030
I am not certain.

773
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,618
Maybe... it was just
an unexpected act of kindness.

774
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,705
Work with Vorik
to build the energy matrix

775
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,166
while I convince the Caatati

776
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,960
there's a better way
out of this.

777
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,884
This matrix will produce
944 grams of thorium per day.

778
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,304
Now you can power
all your systems

779
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:57,098
and begin to rebuild
your replication technology.

780
00:41:57,098 --> 00:42:01,186
Will you allow us
to leave?

781
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,396
One device isn't enough
for all our ships.

782
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,106
SEVEN:
Using this matrix
as a template,

783
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,317
you can construct
as many as you like.

784
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:13,906
We can provide you with
components and specifications.

785
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,116
You're free to go.

786
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:18,619
And thank you.

787
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,831
You're welcome.

788
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:43,561
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning: Oxygen level</i>
<i>at 104 millibars.</i>

789
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,563
Tom...

790
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,941
Hmm?

791
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,651
Come on.

792
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,028
Open your eyes.

794
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,453
I was having a dream.

795
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,497
There's something I have to say.

796
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,789
Me, too.

797
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,666
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

798
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:10,880
I'm glad
the last thing I'll see is you.

799
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,093
I've been a coward
about everything...

800
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:19,305
everything that really matters.

801
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,558
No. You're being
a little hard on yourself.

802
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:23,017
No.

803
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,438
I'm going to die...

804
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:29,941
without a shred of honor,

805
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,276
and for the first time
in my life,

806
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,694
that really bothers me.

807
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:40,285
So I have to tell you something.

808
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:47,417
<i>Warning:</i>
<i>Oxygen level at 71 millibars.</i>

809
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,668
I have to tell you the truth.

00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,256
The truth about what?

811
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:02,181
I love you.

812
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,605
Say something.

813
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:14,486
You picked a great time
to tell me.

814
