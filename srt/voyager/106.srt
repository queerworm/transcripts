JANEWAY:
<i>Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48546.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,382
<i>Our journey home</i>
<i>is several weeks old now,</i>

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:11,386
<i>and I have begun to notice</i>
<i>in my crew, and in myself,</i>

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,807
<i>a subtle change as the reality</i>
<i>of our situation settles in.</i>

5
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,684
<i>Here in the Delta Quadrant,</i>

6
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,645
<i>we are virtually</i>
<i>the entire family of man.</i>

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>We are more than a crew,</i>
<i>and I must find a way</i>

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,065
<i>to be more than a Captain</i>
<i>to these people...</i>

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,862
<i>but it's not clear to me</i>
<i>exactly how to begin.</i>

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,407
<i>At the Academy, we're taught</i>
<i>that a Captain is expected</i>

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,117
<i>to maintain a certain distance.</i>

12
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,578
<i>Until now, I have</i>
<i>always been comfortable</i>

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,955
<i>with that distance.</i>

14
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,417
TORRES:
Captain, I...

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,378
I didn't realize there was
an inspection scheduled.

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,880
Not an inspection,
Lieutenant.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,631
A stroll.

18
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,759
We should have the warp drive
up and running by 0900 hours.

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,636
Recalibrating
the reactant injectors

20
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,429
is the only thing
we have left to do.

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,848
Carry on.

22
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,642
<i>Maybe this is</i>
<i>just the way it works.</i>

23
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,853
<i>Maybe the distance</i>
is<i> necessary.</i>

24
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,312
<i>Maybe more than ever now,</i>

25
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,189
<i>they need me</i>
<i>to be larger than life.</i>

26
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,276
<i>I only wish</i>
<i>I felt larger than life.</i>

27
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,320
<i>Computer, delete last sentence.</i>

28
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,575
Gentlemen.

29
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,994
As you were.

30
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,996
So has Neelix concocted

31
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,831
anything interesting
this morning?

32
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,292
There's an ancient
Chinese curse, Captain--

33
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,545
"May you live
in interesting times."

34
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,171
Mealtime
is always interesting

35
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,049
now that Neelix
is in the kitchen.

36
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,884
We shouldn't judge him
too harshly.

37
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,011
He is helping us
conserve replicator energy.

38
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,345
And I'm sure

39
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,180
the gastrointestinal
problems will go away,

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,016
as soon as our systems
get used to his, uh...

41
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,602
gourmet touch.

42
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,353
(<i> chuckling</i> )

43
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,024
Well, see you at duty call.

44
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,196
We should have
asked her to join us.

45
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,032
Ensigns don't invite
Captains to sit down.

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,660
Why not?

47
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,372
Because they don't.

48
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,416
Well, what's wrong with
showing a little courtesy?

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,167
Captains don't want courtesy.

50
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,003
They want respect.

51
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,922
That's why they don't get chummy
with the lower ranks.

52
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,801
Well, who else
is she supposed

53
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,260
to get chummy with out here?

54
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,887
There aren't many other
Captains and Admirals

55
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,555
for her to talk to.

56
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,308
If she wants to sit with us,
she'll ask us to join her.

57
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,310
That's the way
it's done.

58
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,815
I think you're working
from an old rule book, Paris.

59
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,404
Neelix?

60
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,379
(<i> liquid bubbling</i> )

61
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,265
NEELIX:
Captain!

62
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:07,021
May I say,
you look beautiful this morning.

63
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,981
Is that a new color lipstick?

64
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,275
No, no, it's the same
color I always wear.

65
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,986
Well, perhaps it's
just the way the glow

66
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,113
of the food heater lamps
hits you,

67
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,364
but you look wonderful.

68
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,991
Not to suggest

69
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,283
you don't always
look wonderful.

70
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,244
Neelix, do we have
any coffee left?

71
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,956
No, but we have
something even better.

72
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,458
I don't want something
even better, I want coffee.

73
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,169
It's made from
a proteinaceous seed

74
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,461
I discovered
on an expedition...

75
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,088
Never mind.

76
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,049
I'll use one of my
replicator rations
for coffee.

77
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,759
That would not
be appropriate, Captain.

78
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,599
I beg your pardon?

79
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,477
You need to set
an example for the crew.

80
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,481
Well, thank you
for reminding me.

81
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,733
You're welcome.

82
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,776
I mean, after all,
if you want the crew

83
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,653
to begin to accept
natural food alternatives

84
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,447
instead of further depleting
our energy reserves,

85
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,911
you need to encourage them
by your own choices, don't you?

86
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:08,749
Fine. Give me your
even-better-than-coffee
substitute.

87
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,001
And how about some
Takar loggerhead eggs

88
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,211
with that this morning?

89
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,171
Just... coffee.

90
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,632
It's a tiny bit richer blend
than you're used to,

91
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,134
but you'll learn
to love it.

92
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,719
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Bridge to Janeway.</i>

93
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,470
On my way. Janeway out.

94
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,224
Tomorrow maybe.

95
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,649
Ah.

96
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,110
Yes, Commander?

97
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,360
There was no need

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,653
for you to come to
the Bridge, Captain.

99
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,863
Yes, there was.

100
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,322
I just wanted to alert you
to a nebula

101
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,950
we've picked up on
long-range sensors.

102
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,285
Put it on screen.

103
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,122
Magnify.

104
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,124
TUVOK:
There are unusually high levels

105
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,584
of omicron particles
within this nebula, Captain.

106
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,336
Are you thinking we could
collect these omicron particles

107
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,381
to provide an additional
antimatter reserve, Lieutenant?

108
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,134
Precisely.

109
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,053
Senior Bridge Officers,
report for duty.

110
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,806
Commander, set a new course.

111
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,767
There's coffee in that nebula.

112
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,547
Exploring this nebula
should raise some spirits

113
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,549
around here,
don't you think, Commander?

114
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,218
No way to go but up.

115
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,346
You're closer
to the crew than I am.

116
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,766
How bad is it?

117
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,685
There's a<i> nuanka--</i>
A period of mourning

118
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,104
that everyone's
going through.

119
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,355
It's a natural reaction.

120
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,523
I'm worried about them.

121
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,984
I wish we had
a Counselor on board,

122
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,195
but the nature of our mission
didn't require one.

123
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,116
We talk to animals.

124
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,077
It's a Native
American tradition.

125
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,328
Animals?

126
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,788
Our own counselors.

127
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,331
We're taught that
an animal guide

128
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,083
accompanies us
through life.

129
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,710
Basically, it's what Carl
Jung thought he invented

130
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,003
when he came up with

131
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,423
his "active imagination"
technique in 1932,

132
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,673
but we'd been doing

133
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,634
pretty much the same
thing for centuries.

134
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,178
Is there a different
animal guide for everyone?

135
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,430
Actually, yes.

136
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,682
Let me guess.
Yours is a bear.

137
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,476
(<i> chuckling</i> )

138
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,685
Why do you say that?

139
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,647
You strike me
as the bear type.

140
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,898
Thank you.

141
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,275
The bear is a very
powerful animal.

142
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,943
It has great<i> pokattah,</i>

143
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,321
but he's not
my animal guide.

144
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,324
The creature that guides us
doesn't define who we are.

145
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,159
It merely chooses
to be with us.

146
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,245
Okay. If not a bear,
then what?

147
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,331
I can't tell you that.

148
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,915
It would offend
my animal guide

149
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,167
if I spoke its name.

150
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,419
But he guides you well?

151
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,129
Actually, it's female.

152
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,299
But, yes, she usually
guides me very well.

153
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,926
Can one just choose
her own animal guide?

154
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,178
It's not quite that simple.

155
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,637
PARIS:
Captain,

156
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,973
we are approaching
the perimeter of the nebula.

157
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,599
Slow to one-third impulse.

158
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,894
If you're interested,
I'll be glad to teach you

159
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,729
how to contact
your animal guide.

160
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,523
You've got a date.

161
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,525
Analysis, Mr. Kim.

162
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,152
KIM:
Seven AU's in diameter.

163
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,488
Sensors are picking up
intermittent gamma

164
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,780
and thermal emissions.

165
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,782
Nothing our shields
can't handle.

166
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,285
Mr. Paris, any problems
for navigation?

167
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,079
I'm showing
mostly hydrogen, helium,

168
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,539
and hydroxyl radicals.

169
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,375
Some local dust nodules.

170
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,293
I don't see them
giving us any trouble.

171
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,379
Mr. Tuvok, can you find us

172
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,215
a rich deposit of omicron
particles in there?

173
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,675
A significant concentration
appears to exist

174
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,593
approximately
64 million kilometers

175
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,845
inside the perimeter.

176
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,096
Set coordinates.

177
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,306
Aye, Captain.

178
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,849
Engines at one-
quarter impulse.

179
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,600
Engage.

180
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,277
I've never seen
anything like it.

181
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,113
Tuvok to Kim.

182
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,741
Mr. Kim, that is a comment

183
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,950
we would prefer not to hear

184
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,869
from a Senior Officer
on the Bridge.

185
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,705
It makes the Junior
Officers nervous.

186
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,207
Yes, sir.

187
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,460
PARIS:
Density has increased

188
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,669
to 42 percent.

189
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,755
Cause?
Not sure.

190
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,006
We seem to be drawing

191
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,342
some interstellar dust
toward us.

192
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,302
Engineering, could
the magnetic field

193
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,888
from our impulse engines
be attracting this dust?

194
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,639
It's a good possibility,
Captain.

195
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,978
I'm showing the dust with
a return force ratio of 4.1.

196
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,939
Recommend we shut down impulse
and go to thrusters.

197
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,149
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Engage thrusters.</i>

198
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,817
Ahead slow.

199
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,320
Density still increasing.

200
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,821
Up by 70 percent now.

201
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,031
Mr. Tuvok?

202
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,491
The level
of resistance

203
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,243
poses no danger to the hull
at this time, Captain.

204
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,912
How far to your omicron
particle deposits?

205
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,872
12,400 kilometers.

206
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,165
Maintain
course and...

207
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,000
Report!

208
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,003
We're at a
dead stop now.

209
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,422
Shutting down thrusters.

210
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,006
We seem to have
encountered

211
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,174
an energy barrier.

212
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,926
Is it natural
or artificial?

213
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,886
We're not reading
any directed energy source

214
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,305
down here, Captain.

215
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,307
My guess is
it's a natural phenomenon.

216
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,267
How far are we
from the particles, Lieutenant?

217
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,352
Just over
7,000 kilometers.

218
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,313
It's conceivable
this energy barrier

219
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,982
is related to those particles.

220
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,401
Mr. Kim, if you could get
a transporter beam

221
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,027
through the barrier...
Can't do it, Captain.

222
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,446
The thoron emissions
of the barrier

223
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,114
would interfere with
the transporter signal.

224
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,365
Ms. Torres,
do we have enough power

225
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,866
to take the ship
through the barrier?

226
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,370
The barrier appears
to be only 50 meters deep.

227
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,622
A four-second burst

228
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,165
at maximum thrusters
ought to do it.

229
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,667
All right.
Maximum shields.

230
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,419
Engage full thrusters
for four seconds

231
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,670
and then drop to one-quarter.

232
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,964
Acknowledged.
Engaging thrusters.

233
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,805
What do you make of it,
Mr. Tuvok?

234
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,309
I am unable to offer
an identification, Captain.

235
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,854
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Kim to Tuvok.

236
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,897
In other words,

237
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,816
you've never seen
anything like it?

238
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,152
Oh, I promise
not to tell the Junior Officers.

239
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,865
PARIS:
Captain,

240
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,660
the breach we just made,
where we penetrated the field--

241
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,953
It just closed behind us.

242
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,917
Kes! Oh! Now look

243
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,878
what she's
gotten us into!

244
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,797
Do all nebulas look like that?

245
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,049
I wouldn't know.

246
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,758
I'm smart enough
to go around nebulas

247
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,177
when I encounter them.

248
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,930
These people are
natural-born explorers, Neelix.

249
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,809
These people are natural-born
idiots if you ask me.

250
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,728
They don't appreciate
what they have here.

251
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,565
This ship
is the match of any vessel

252
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,108
within a hundred light years,
and what do they do with it?

253
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,818
"Well, let's see
if we can't find

254
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,322
"some space anomaly today
that might rip it apart!"

255
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,866
I don't think
the Captain is an idiot.

256
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,202
She cares a great deal
about her crew.

257
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,745
You don't care a great deal
about your crew

258
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,373
and introduce them to
the specter of death

259
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,748
at every opportunity.

260
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,293
And I speak as a member
of that crew now.

261
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,087
I'm not sure I would have
wanted you to come along

262
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,589
had I known that
this is what we...

263
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,257
I think it's wonderful.

264
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,757
Wonderful?

265
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,218
If I were Captain,
I'd open every crack

266
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,053
in the universe
and peek inside,

267
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,013
just like
Captain Janeway does.

268
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,350
I don't deny the romantic...

269
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,852
quality of this sort
of... casting about.

270
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,230
I wouldn't exactly
call it wonderful.

271
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,782
Although...

272
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,412
it's getting more
wonderful by the minute.

273
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:11,124
I've never kissed anyone
inside a nebula before.

274
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,212
What did I tell you?

275
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,505
Red Alert.

276
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,965
Whatever they are,

277
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,341
they're passing right
through our shields.

278
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,800
Try reversing
the shield polarity.

279
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,678
Mr. Tuvok?
They appear to be made up

280
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,430
of a non-reactive
material that our sensors

281
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,723
do not recognize,
Captain.

282
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,849
Clarify. Are we under attack?
Uncertain.

283
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,393
There is no indication
of directed fire.

284
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,437
<i>Torres to Bridge.</i>
Go ahead.

285
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,355
These things
are sticking to the hull.

286
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,608
And I'm showing a drain
on our energy reserves.

287
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,152
A drain?
Why would we be losing energy?

288
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,571
<i>I'm not sure, Captain.</i>
<i>They seem to be drawing it</i>

289
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,197
<i>right through the shield grid</i>
<i>along the hull.</i>

290
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,865
We've lost five percent
of our energy reserves.

291
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,785
Recommend we shut down
all non-essential systems.

292
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,369
Do it.

293
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,622
Reversing shield polarity
hasn't had any effect.

294
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,290
Energy reserves
are down eight percent.

295
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,292
This is not
what I had in mind.

296
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,919
Mr. Paris, take us back
through the energy barrier

297
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,837
and out of here.
Reversing course.

298
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,047
Full thrusters.

299
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,216
Thrusters firing.

300
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,354
We're not penetrating
the energy barrier this time.

301
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,815
Sensors show a buildup
of magneside dust

302
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,107
along the outer rim
of the barrier.

303
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,609
Engineering,
I need more power.

304
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,653
We can't go back to impulse,
Captain.

305
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,987
That's how our problems started.

306
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,031
Our best chance
is to burn the aft thrusters

307
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,491
beyond the recommended limits.

308
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,117
Proceed.

309
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,453
Acknowledged. Accelerating
deuterium to rear thrusters.

310
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,789
We have a complement
of 38 photon torpedoes

311
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,248
at our disposal, Captain.

312
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,750
And no way to replace them
after they're gone.

313
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,126
Aft thrusters

314
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,670
at 105 percent.

315
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,089
115 percent.

316
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,217
Barrier still holding.

317
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,802
We need something else.

318
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,012
Give me a two-second blast
from the forward phaser bank.

319
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,681
Firing phasers.

320
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,561
The barrier
is undamaged, Captain.

321
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,980
Ready a photon.
Mr. Paris,

322
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,024
assuming we can breach
the energy barrier,

323
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,276
it's likely to close as
fast as the first time.

324
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,070
I'll be riding the tail
of our torpedo, Captain.

325
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,572
TUVOK:
Torpedo is loaded.

326
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,615
Align coordinates
along ship's heading.

327
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,908
Coordinates set.

328
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,828
Fire.

329
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,506
50,000 kilometers
to the perimeter.

330
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,049
I'm having trouble
navigating

331
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,676
through
the energy currents.

332
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,262
It's as thick as
a Toarian ice storm out there.

333
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,890
35,000 kilometers to perimeter.

334
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,933
Energy reserves
are still falling.

335
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,935
15,000 kilometers.

336
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,650
We've cleared the central mass.

337
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,360
Stand down Red Alert.

338
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,696
Take us to 2,000 kilometers
off the perimeter

339
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,988
and hold position.

340
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,199
Get a sample of that matter
off the hull

341
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,951
for Lieutenant Torres
to analyze.

342
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,411
I'd like to know
what it was

343
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,496
that humbled every
defense system on this ship.

344
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,957
How much of our energy reserves
did we lose, Ensign?

345
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,918
11 percent, Captain.

346
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,297
I'm just going to have
to give up coffee.

347
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,090
That's all there is to it.

348
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,533
Dark enough for you?

349
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,118
What?

350
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,203
Get up, Harry. There's
something you got to see.

351
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,999
See?
How'd you get in here?

352
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,670
You'd be surprised
the things you learn in prison.

353
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,802
MacAllister--
James Mooney MacAllister.

354
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,261
The guy never slept.

355
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,764
He'd be studying
his algorithms until dawn,

356
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,056
and the only way
I could get any sleep

357
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,224
was to wear a mask.

358
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,768
You could've
changed roommates.

359
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,978
Are you kidding?

360
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,228
MacAllister
got me through

361
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,730
fourth year
quantum chemistry.

362
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,774
Besides, I got used
to wearing it.

363
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,359
Something about it

364
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,110
that reminds me
of being in the womb.

365
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,905
Harry, in order to be
reminded of something,

366
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,156
you have to first...

367
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,116
I remember being
in my mother's womb.

368
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,368
Right.

369
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,703
I do.

370
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,621
So what is it
you have to show me?

371
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,206
Nothing that's
going to compare

372
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,082
to that memory
of your mother's womb.

373
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:27,129
Computer, activate
holodeck program Paris-3.

374
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,393
(<i> male guffawing</i> )

375
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,276
MALE:
Hey, it's Tom.

376
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,029
Welcome, Tom, welcome.

377
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,573
Hey, Tom,
how you doing?

378
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,991
PARIS:
What do you think, Harry?

379
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,450
What is it,
a French bistro?

380
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,744
This is where I spent

381
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,662
most of my second
semester at the Academy.

382
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,164
I chose the Starfleet base
outside of Marseilles

383
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,541
for my physical training.

384
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,210
I always had a thing
about the French.

385
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,129
And the French
always had a thing

386
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,965
about you,
Monsieur Thomas.

387
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,009
And with a name
like Paris,

388
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,761
and a face like that,

389
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,055
how could anyone
resist, huh?

390
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,557
Sandrine, this is my friend,
Harry Kim.

391
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,100
<i>Enchanté.</i>

392
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,393
Sandrine owns the place.

393
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,144
It's been in her family
over 600 years.

394
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,897
WOMAN:
Tommy.

395
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,815
It's about time.

396
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,776
I've been waiting for you.

397
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,320
This is Ricky.

398
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,156
I include her in all
my holo-programs.

399
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,491
RICKY:
Hi.

400
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,826
Hi.

401
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,956
Mmm...

402
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,584
Your friend the gigolo
wouldn't leave me alone.

403
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,795
It's what I do, Tom.

404
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,254
Nothing personal.

405
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,173
French father, Daliwakan mother.

406
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,552
She just sits there
and waits for you, huh?

407
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,929
Like a little
puppy dog.

408
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,889
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

409
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,307
Oh, really?

410
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,558
I thought you
liked your women

411
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,060
with a little bite.

412
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,229
Everyone knows
about your bite, Sandrine.

413
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,274
It's when you start
sucking blood they get scared.

414
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,239
Monsieur, can I get you
something to drink?

415
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,951
Just a cup of tea.

416
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,579
Harry, this is France.

417
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,582
Uh, break open a bottle
of that '46 Saint Emilion

418
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,334
you save behind the bar for me.

419
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,170
I don't like to drink
this late at night.

420
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,880
I get an acid heartburn.

421
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,591
Harry, it's holographic wine.

422
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,051
It doesn't
give you acid.

423
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,594
Try to get in
the mood, huh?

424
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,138
Sorry.

425
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,182
I learned a great deal
that semester at the Academy.

426
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,600
Most of it
right here.

427
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,146
<i>Oui--</i> And most of it
from me.

428
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,355
I found this place

429
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,857
just after my
pocket was picked

430
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,108
walking by the harbor.

431
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,527
Somebody picked
your pocket on Earth?

432
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,445
Oh, they just do
it for tourists.

433
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,738
They give it back.

434
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,032
Most of the time.

435
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,950
MAN:
Nine ball
in the corner pocket.

436
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,578
You see that pool
table, Harry?

437
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,539
The table at Sandrine's
at Marseilles

438
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,833
has attracted the world's
greatest hustlers

439
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,417
throughout the centuries.

440
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,961
I thought it might
be fun to program in

441
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,587
some of the great
players to shoot with.

442
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,589
Eight ball in the cross side.

443
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,016
Gaunt Gary,
Ames Pool Hall,

444
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,893
New York City, 1953.

445
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,103
They say that
he hustled

446
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,604
the great Willie
Moscone himself.

447
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,899
Moscone?

448
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,692
Was he some famous
billiard player?

449
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:38,196
Game is pool, kid. Pool.

450
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,199
I don't suppose you'd care
to wager a fin on a game or two?

451
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:44,202
Oh, he's not ready
for you yet, Gary.

452
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,120
Let me teach him
a few tricks first.

453
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,416
Watch out
for him, kid.

454
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,252
He can swallow your wallet
without ever losing his smile.

455
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,922
I'll keep it in mind.

456
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,297
What's a fin?

457
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,217
I'm not sure.

458
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:02,386
Some old kind of
Scandinavian currency.

459
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,721
Come on.

460
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,972
I'll rack them up.

461
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,766
You pick out a cue.

462
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,313
Harry, this is my idea of home.

463
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,817
My little piece of Earth
out here in the Delta Quadrant.

464
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,030
You shrug it off--

465
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,199
Or you like to make
the rest of us think

466
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,159
you're shrugging it off--

467
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,286
But you miss it
too, don't you?

468
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,998
What?

469
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,251
Home.

470
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,922
Your shot, Harry.

471
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,705
Computer, activate emergency
medical holographic program.

472
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,041
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

473
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,086
Why do you always
have to say that?

474
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,588
I can only speculate about
my programmer's motives.

475
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,590
Perhaps he thought
I might be summoned

476
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,009
for... important reasons.

477
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,510
Under the circumstances,
don't you think

478
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,012
you really ought to
change your program?

479
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,763
Now, there's
an interesting concept--

480
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,099
A hologram
that programs himself.

481
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,518
What would I do
with that ability?

482
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,352
Create a family,
raise an army...

483
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,147
I know a little about
holographic programming.

484
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,691
I could probably
reprogram you.

485
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,027
That makes me feel
particularly confident.

486
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,945
Has anyone ever told you,
you have a lousy attitude?

487
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,446
If you don't like
the doctor's attitude,

488
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,948
there's a man sitting
at a console

489
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,491
in the Jupiter Station
Holo-programming Center

490
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,742
you can write to.

491
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,952
His name is Zimmerman.

492
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,996
He looks a lot
like me, actually.

493
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,957
Now, not that I don't
enjoy the repartee,

494
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,417
but was there a reason
you stopped in?

495
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,212
I need a second opinion on this.

496
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,671
Who gave you
the first opinion?

497
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,215
I gave it to myself.

498
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,508
It's a sample of residue
we picked up in a nebula.

499
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,843
A nebula?

500
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,636
What were we doing in a nebula?

501
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,138
No, wait, don't tell me.

502
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,349
We were investigating.

503
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,100
That's all we do around here.

504
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,601
Why pretend
we're going home at all?

505
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,354
All we're going to do
is investigate

506
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,438
every cubic millimeter
of this Quadrant, aren't we?

507
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,733
The molecules are isolinear.

508
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,609
No polycyclic
structures, but...

509
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,864
But this is what brought
you to me, isn't it?

510
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,949
The nucleogenic
peptide bonds.

511
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,161
Is it some kind
of phospholipid fiber?

512
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,706
And you were doing so well.

513
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,458
Now... I suspect
it's something

514
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,128
far more interesting than that.

515
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,591
(<i> door chimes</i> )

516
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,926
Come in.

517
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,720
Repair crews have degaussed
the hull, Captain.

518
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,472
Good. Let's plan
an 0700 departure.

519
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,225
What's this?

520
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:57,144
My medicine bundle.

521
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,939
I've never shown it
to anyone before.

522
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,190
After what you said
this morning,

523
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,482
I thought
it was important

524
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,984
to let you see.

525
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,486
Will it help me find
my animal guide?

526
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,197
Eventually, you'll
have to assemble

527
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,407
your own medicine bundle,

528
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,117
but this will allow me
to assist you

529
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,576
in your quest for a guide.

530
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,121
Now?

531
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,167
Now.

532
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,239
A blackbird's wing...

533
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,117
a stone from
the river...

534
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,202
an<i> akoonah.</i>

535
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,912
<i>"Akoonah"?</i>

536
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,206
My ancestors used
psychoactive herbs

537
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,833
to assist their
vision quests.

538
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,461
Now they're no longer necessary.

539
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,671
Our scientists have found
more modern ways

540
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,756
to facilitate the search
for animal guides.

541
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,843
Place your
hand on it.

542
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,929
And concentrate
on the stone.

543
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,642
<i>A-koo-chee-moya.</i>

544
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,771
We are far from the sacred
places of our grandfathers.

545
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,899
We are far from the
bones of our people,

546
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,777
but perhaps there is
one powerful being

547
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,779
who will embrace
this woman

548
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,615
and give her the
answers she seeks.

549
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,742
Allow your eyes to close.

550
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:40,580
Breathe to feel the
light in your belly

551
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,334
and let it expand

552
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,543
until the light
is everywhere.

553
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,882
Prepare yourself
to leave this room

554
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:54,387
and this ship,
and return to a place

555
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:58,807
where you were the most content
and peaceful you have ever been.

556
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,602
<i>You can see all around you</i>

557
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,938
<i>and hear the sounds</i>
<i>of this place.</i>

558
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,484
(<i> bird squawking</i> )

559
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,364
I know this place.

560
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,907
It's...

561
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,825
<i>You must not discuss with me</i>
<i>what you see,</i>

562
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,537
<i>or you will offend</i>
<i>your animal guide.</i>

563
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,999
<i>As you continue to look around,</i>

564
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,709
<i>you will become aware</i>
<i>of other life</i>

565
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,711
<i>that shares</i>
<i>this place with you.</i>

566
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,881
<i>It will be the first animal</i>
<i>you see.</i>

567
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,008
<i>That is the one</i>
<i>you will speak to.</i>

568
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,052
<i>Do you see an animal?</i>

569
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,437
Yes.

570
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,064
<i>Speak to it.</i>

571
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:50,025
What do I say?

572
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,445
<i>You know what you want to ask.</i>

573
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,031
(<i> door chimes</i> )

574
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,576
I'm sorry.

575
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,994
I should've asked the computer
for no interruptions.

576
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,662
Come in.

577
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,960
The Commander was introducing me
to my animal guide.

578
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,211
I hope

579
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,546
that you have
better luck with yours

580
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,880
than I had with mine.

581
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,715
B'Elanna's the
only one I know

582
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,802
who tried to kill
her animal guide.

583
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,262
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but the Doctor and I

584
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,888
have come up with a rather
surprising analysis

585
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,390
of the matter
left on the hull.

586
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,018
It's organic.

587
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,937
Microscopic life-forms
from the nebula.

588
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,022
That's not what I mean.
The samples are clearly

589
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,900
organic elements
of a much larger life-form.

590
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,027
It appears, Captain,
that this nebula

591
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,446
is not a nebula at all.

592
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,872
DOCTOR:
<i>I'm curious, Captain.</i>

593
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,958
<i>Exactly what</i>
<i>are you looking for?</i>

594
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,253
I need to know if we did serious
harm to this life-form.

595
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,089
<i>Let's see--</i>
<i>You ran your ship through it,</i>

596
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,633
<i>fired phasers at it,</i>

597
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,510
<i>and blew a hole in it</i>
<i>with a photon torpedo.</i>

598
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,345
<i>I'd say it's a pretty good</i>
<i>chance that you...</i>

599
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,639
Computer, mute audio.

600
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,807
Isolate that concentration
of omicron particles

601
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,058
we were trying to get to.

602
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,352
That would be
right here.

603
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,894
JANEWAY:
Mr. Tuvok?

604
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,063
I'm afraid the
concentration
of particles

605
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,607
is far lower than I
originally observed.

606
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,984
Furthermore, it appears
that many of the particles

607
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,195
have now moved outside
the energy barrier.

608
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,114
Is it possible they're leaking
out through the breach we made?

609
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,241
That would be a
logical conclusion.

610
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,742
It's also a logical conclusion

611
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,828
that all of the phenomena
we've encountered

612
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,081
were actually this life-form's
natural defense systems.

613
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,043
The way the barrier was
protecting the omicron particles

614
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,253
almost suggests we were
entering a vital organ.

615
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,088
So, it seems very clear

616
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,174
that we've severely hurt
an innocent life-form.

617
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,134
How do we repair
the harm we've done?

618
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,053
PARIS:
Uh, Captain?

619
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,683
Computer, resume audio.<i> </i>
<i>How kind of you.</i>

620
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:48,352
<i>You may be interested to know</i>
<i>that the analysis</i>

621
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,020
of the organic sample

622
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,065
<i>suggested this life-form</i>
<i>has the capacity to regenerate.</i>

623
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,026
<i>The process may simply</i>
<i>need a helping hand.</i>

624
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,112
Any ideas how we could
stimulate regeneration?

625
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,156
<i>Lieutenant Torres</i>
<i>has the answer.</i>

626
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,701
I do?<i> </i>
<i>You were the one</i>

627
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,119
<i>who first observed</i>
<i>that this life-form has</i>

628
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,038
a<i> nucleogenic structure.</i>

629
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,834
If the life-form has
a nucleogenic structure...

630
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,795
nucleonic radiation

631
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,590
ought to assist
its healing process.

632
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:21,760
A nucleonic beam along
the edges of the breach

633
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,263
should theoretically
promote regeneration.

634
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,806
<i>Bravo.</i>

635
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,101
Commander, take us
to Yellow Alert

636
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,436
and advise the crew

637
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,938
that we're going to reenter
the life-form.

638
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,275
Mr. Kim, review all systems
in light of our first experience

639
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,526
and see if you can

640
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,319
provide
new safeguards.

641
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,864
Tuvok, your job is to find
some modification of the shields

642
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,241
that will hold off

643
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,619
this life-form's
natural defense systems.

644
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,037
We begin at 1300 hours.

645
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,914
Dismissed.

646
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,918
The bantan is a little
on the spicy side.

647
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,046
Kes grows them herself
in the hydroponic garden.

648
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,633
Don't eat any of the little pink
things and you'll be fine.

649
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,051
CHAKOTAY:
<i>All personnel</i>
<i>report to stations.</i>

650
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,303
<i>Yellow Alert.</i>

651
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,347
Now what?
Neelix to Chakotay.

652
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,016
We're very busy up here, Neelix.
What do you need?

653
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,310
This Yellow Alert business--

654
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,061
I was just starting...

655
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,439
Sorry. We found out that the
nebula is actually a life-form

656
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,733
and we've got to go back in to
repair some damage we did to it.

657
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,984
Chakotay out.

658
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,819
Go back in? Hello?

659
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,488
Well, that's it!
I've had it!

660
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,989
Neelix...
No!

661
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,158
I'm going to
the Captain about this.

662
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,745
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

663
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,372
Captain, I understand

664
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,166
that this nebula
we've discovered

665
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,793
is some kind of monster?

666
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,712
Not a monster, Neelix,
but it is a life-form.

667
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,422
Excuse me if I sound crazy,

668
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,466
because someone may have been
playing a joke on me,

669
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,050
but you aren't planning

670
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,262
to take us back into the belly
of this beast, are you?

671
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,723
No joke.
Why?

672
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,308
Because we hurt it

673
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,811
and we have to help it recover.

674
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,562
I did not come on board

675
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,147
this ship to be
a veterinarian, Captain.

676
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,650
And I thought you were
a man of unlimited talents.

677
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,695
I just reached my limit.

678
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,154
So if you don't mind,

679
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,781
Kes and I will wait on board
my little vessel

680
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,366
for you to return.

681
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,951
All our crews are busy
preparing for this mission.

682
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,829
I'm not pulling them
off their duties

683
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,580
to prepare your ship for launch,

684
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,332
and I'm not going to drop you
off on the side of the road

685
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,792
every time we hit a bump.

686
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,960
When we're finished,
if you want to leave,

687
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,838
that's your business,
but for the moment,

688
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,548
find yourself
a seat with a good view

689
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:26,677
because, just like Jonah
and the whale, you're going in.

690
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,805
Is that final?

691
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,515
Dismissed.

692
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:38,856
That's a Starfleet expression
for "get out."

693
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,904
Jonah?

694
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,781
Whale?

695
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,876
Approaching the perimeter.

696
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,919
Disengage impulse engines.

697
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,715
Impulse engines off-line.

698
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,092
Engage thrusters, one-third.

699
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,594
Thrusters engaged.

700
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,011
Red Alert.

701
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,305
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

702
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,808
TUVOK:
Shields are up.

703
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,727
Adaptive harmonics
are operational.

704
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:17,977
Density is already
more than double

705
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,688
what we encountered
last time.

706
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,774
EM hull pressure is approaching
dangerous levels, Captain.

707
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,901
Mr. Kim?
If my research is right,

708
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,903
releasing positive ions
through the nacelles

709
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,738
should repel
some of the dust out there.

710
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,989
Without causing further harm
to the creature?

711
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,366
I believe so, Captain.

712
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,034
Very well.

713
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,996
Ion release confirmed.

714
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,876
Ambient density is dropping.

715
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:44,045
Hull pressure
is decreasing also.

716
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,048
Hold your course.

717
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,885
TUVOK:
14,000 kilometers
to the breach.

718
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,888
I can see it.

719
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,180
Magnify.

720
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,646
Engineering,
ready your nucleonic beam.

721
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,689
Ready and awaiting your orders,
Captain.

722
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,442
Mr. Paris,
bring us into position.

723
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,861
Coming about 40 degrees.

724
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,158
Report!

725
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:17,412
We're being hit by some
kind of multi-polar charges.

726
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,205
They're not like anything
we saw the first time.

727
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,625
Shields at 87 percent.
Will they hold?

728
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,502
The polarity of each charge
is rotating so quickly,

729
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,962
the shields cannot compensate.

730
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,923
We've lost
the rear driver coil assembly.

731
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,591
Inertial dampers are off-line.

732
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,884
I'm losing control.

733
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,052
Hold on!

734
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:45,148
Engineering, initiate emergency
shutdown of all thrusters.

735
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,066
TORRES:
Captain, the only way

736
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,318
we can shut down all thrusters

737
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,028
is to vent the deuterium
into space.

738
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,322
We can't afford
to lose all that fuel.

739
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,782
We have no choice.
Do it!

740
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,869
Acknowledged.
Cutting thrusters.

741
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,496
Inertial dampers
are still off-line.

742
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:04,125
Reset IDF baseline at 3-0-0
and reinitialize.

743
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,085
Field processors
coming back on line.

744
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,255
Inertial damping restored.

745
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,257
All stop.
Damage report.

746
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,802
KIM:
Electro-plasma leaks
reported on Deck 14.

747
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,637
Repair crews are
being dispatched.

748
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,056
Otherwise, we seem
to be in one piece.

749
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,642
I believe the optical data
network is down, Ensign.

750
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:24,187
Yes, sir.
I'll get right on it.

751
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,692
14 injuries reported, Captain.
None serious.

752
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,110
Have any idea where we are,
Mr. Paris?

753
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,781
Approximately 70,000 kilometers
from our former position.

754
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,492
Deeper inside the creature
than before.

755
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,413
Let's hope it has
a slow digestive process.

756
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,915
Yes, ma'am.

757
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,165
We need to get back

758
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,084
to the wound
without causing a response

759
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,837
from its defense systems.
Suggestions?

760
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,338
It seems to be leaving us alone

761
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,799
now that we've cut off
all propulsion systems.

762
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,968
Maybe that's what cues it
to respond.

763
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,929
If I'm right, we might
be able to get back

764
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,848
without engaging any engines.
No engines?

765
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,350
We've been reading these
swirling energy currents

766
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,476
since we first got here.

767
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,811
When we thought
it was a nebula,

768
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,438
we weren't looking
for any pattern.

769
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,023
We thought they were
just random eddies.

770
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,650
But now I'm wondering
if these currents

771
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,319
might be some kind of
a circulatory system.

772
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,907
Mr. Kim, are you showing omicron
particles in these currents?

773
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,120
Affirmative, Captain.

774
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,624
If the currents are distributing
omicron energy

775
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,208
throughout the life-form,

776
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,253
the circulatory system
might pass right by that wound.

777
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,547
We could get in one
of those currents

778
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,091
and surf back.

779
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,259
Use the reaction
control thrusters

780
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,720
in drift mode only, Mr. Paris.

781
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,138
Aye, Captain.

782
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,891
We're on our way.

783
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:47,896
Speed-- All of 200 k.p.h.

784
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,564
NEELIX:
Time for refreshment.

785
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:54,193
Ailis pâté,
Felada onion crisps,

786
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,571
stuffed Cardaway leaves.

787
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,698
I appreciate the thought,
Neelix,

788
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,241
but this is hardly the time.

789
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,410
As the morale officer
on this ship,

790
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,954
I insist that a break
in the workload

791
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,538
is both healthy
and necessary.

792
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,540
Go on, Mr. Vulcan.

793
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,751
It might even
help you loosen up.

794
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,088
Or not.

795
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,882
May I ask when you
became morale officer?

796
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,550
Oh, just a few minutes ago,

797
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,178
when I sensed crew morale
might be especially low.

798
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,554
Mine certainly was.

799
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,222
We were in a free fall
at the time.

800
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,433
Cooking always helps
Neelix to unwind.

801
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,686
Yes, and after
we stabilized

802
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,354
I certainly needed to unwind.

803
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,772
So it seemed to me,

804
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,732
I had a choice to either
come up here and say,

805
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,942
"I told you so"...

806
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,568
No.

807
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,863
or to try to do
something constructive

808
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:41,158
to help out
in my own humble manner.

809
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:43,160
Try the stuffed
Cardaway leaves.

810
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,619
They're irresistible.

811
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,250
Now, as your new
morale officer,

812
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,544
I thought it might be fun

813
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,171
for us all to sing
a few songs together.

814
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,463
Don't push it, Neelix.

815
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,923
Captain?

816
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,466
Well done,

817
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,676
Mr. Paris.

818
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,594
Take us gently out
of the current.

819
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,055
Stay in RCS drift mode.

820
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,514
Aye, Captain.

821
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:08,810
Ms. Torres, prepare
your nucleonic beam.

822
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,562
We're ready down here, Captain.
<i>Let's give the wound</i>

823
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,022
two doses to start.

824
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,273
Five bursts
at a two-second interval.

825
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,525
Now.

826
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,113
Analysis.

827
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,447
Scanners are showing

828
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,035
the regeneration rate up
only .04 percent.

829
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,912
I don't know
what we can hope to accomplish

830
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,246
if this is the best we can do.

831
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,957
The breach may simply be
too large to seal.

832
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,667
<i>This is the Doctor speaking.</i>

833
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,169
<i>Please activate your monitor</i>

834
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,921
<i>to the emergency medical</i>
<i>holographic channel.</i>

835
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,381
<i>I believe I may have</i>
<i>a suggestion that will help.</i>

836
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,429
<i>Since no one had the courtesy</i>
<i>to turn me off</i>

837
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,890
<i>after my last consultation,</i>
<i>I've had the opportunity</i>

838
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,893
<i>to observe your progress--</i>
<i>Or lack of same.</i>

839
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,520
<i>A slight alteration of your</i>
<i>treatment plan is necessary.</i>

840
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,231
<i>As inspiration, I've drawn</i>

841
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,234
<i>on an ancient medical technique</i>
<i>known as a suture.</i>

842
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,568
"Suture"?

843
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,319
<i>Before the advent</i>
<i>of laser technology,</i>

844
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,615
<i>surgical fiber was used</i>
<i>to stitch together a wound</i>

845
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,033
<i>to allow it to heal naturally.</i>

846
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,492
How does that help us?

847
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,037
<i>Your ship's energy systems</i>
<i>are compatible</i>

848
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,082
<i>with this life-form's omicron</i>
<i>particles, are they not?</i>

849
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,126
That's right.<i> </i>
<i>Then it is very likely</i>

850
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,835
<i>that this vessel could</i>
<i>serve the life-form's needs</i>

851
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,921
<i>in much the same manner</i>
<i>as a suture.</i>

852
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,380
<i>By allowing the ship to serve</i>

853
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,966
<i>as an energy conduit</i>
<i>across the wound,</i>

854
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,300
<i>the life-form should be able</i>

855
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,177
<i>to regenerate itself</i>
<i>more rapidly.</i>

856
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,263
And how are we supposed
to get the ship into the wound

857
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,056
without getting the hell
beat out of us again?

858
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,724
<i>That's your problem, not mine.</i>

859
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,143
<i>Doctor out.</i>

860
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,772
That's sort of like
asking a hurt dog

861
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,857
not to bite you
while you tend to its wounds.

862
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,153
You like dogs, Mr. Paris?

863
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,362
Yes, ma'am.
I always had a dog.

864
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,364
I like dogs, too.

865
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,534
When I had to clean out a cut
on my dog's leg,

866
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,412
I needed to create
a little diversion first

867
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,957
to take her mind off it.

868
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:57,836
Mr. Kim, prepare
a class-4 microprobe.

869
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,754
Aye, Captain.

870
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,882
Lieutenant, if I gave you a
short burst from our thrusters,

871
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,425
would it be enough
for you to maneuver

872
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,802
into the breach in ten seconds?

873
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,096
I'd feel better
if I had 20.

874
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,764
Once we launch that probe
as a diversion,

875
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,642
you might have ten,
maybe even less than that.

876
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,270
Ten sounds good.

877
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,813
Mr. Kim, status?

878
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,773
Microprobe is loaded
and ready.

879
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,985
Set coordinates for launch
at 160 mark 70.

880
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,196
Cut power after 500 meters.

881
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,989
I don't want to hurt
this life-form again.

882
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,365
Acknowledged.

883
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,868
Engineering, I'll need
a one-second burst

884
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,577
<i>from our aft thrusters</i>
<i>on my order.</i>

885
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,996
Standing by.

886
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,373
Launch microprobe.

887
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,837
Thrusters.

888
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,130
Firing!

889
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,514
Reading mono-polar charges,
high frequency.

890
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,059
Shields at 75 percent
and holding.

891
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,393
Maintain position.

892
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,645
Engineering, direct
two nucleonic beams

893
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,565
fore and aft-- Parallel
to the central axis of the ship.

894
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,525
Acknowledged.
Beam engaged.

895
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:12,369
Captain, I'm showing a rapid
growth pattern along the wound.

896
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,996
Regenerative matter approaching
from both directions

897
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,664
at just under 500 kilometers
per hour.

898
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,250
Hold position.

899
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,168
Captain, the shields are only
designed to withstand...

900
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,920
I'm aware of that, Mr. Tuvok.
Hold position!

901
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,297
Regenerative matter approaching.
Range...?

902
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,091
30 kilometers--
Fore and aft.

903
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,800
Engineering,
ready full thrusters.

904
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,052
Mr. Paris?

905
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,345
Just tell me when.

906
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,139
Regenerative matter
at 20 kilometers.

907
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,725
Fifteen... ten...

908
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,685
Disengage nucleonic beam.

909
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,895
Fire thrusters.

910
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,521
Thrusters engaged.

911
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,898
Now, Mr. Paris.

912
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,034
40,000 kilometers
to the perimeter.

913
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,660
30,000.

914
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,079
The life-form's
regeneration rate

915
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,747
is up 40 percent, Captain.

916
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,540
Looks like it's well on the way
to closing that wound.

917
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,880
We've cleared the central mass.

918
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,761
(<i> sighs</i> )

919
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,763
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

920
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,515
<i>We set out</i>
<i>to augment our energy reserves</i>

921
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,394
<i>and wound up depleting them</i>
<i>by over 20 percent.</i>

922
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,646
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>we've set a new course</i>

923
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,190
<i>for a planet</i>
<i>14 light-years away</i>

924
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,691
<i>that Neelix says might have</i>

925
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,526
<i>compatible energy sources</i>
<i>to offer us.</i>

926
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,528
<i>It is out of our way,</i>

927
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,157
<i>but circumstances offer</i>
<i>few alternatives.</i>

928
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,451
<i>So much for raising spirits.</i>

929
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,288
Turning in
for the night, Captain?

930
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,290
Actually, I'm going
to talk to an animal

931
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,707
and then turn in.

932
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,502
Something Commander
Chakotay taught me.

933
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,212
Supposed to be
quite therapeutic.

934
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,381
You might want
to ask him about it.

935
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,757
I will.

936
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,095
Captain...

937
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,513
What is it, Ensign?

938
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,974
Well, I don't mean
to be out of place,

939
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,309
but if you'd care
to join us,

940
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:00,601
you'd be welcome.

941
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,021
Join you where?

942
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,820
Come on, Tommy.
Let's get out of here.

943
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,322
Easy, honey.

944
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,324
I'm setting the Indian up
for the big hustle.

945
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,992
But he's beating you.

946
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:21,080
Yeah, that's exactly what
he's supposed to think too.

947
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,667
As you were.

948
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:29,255
Well... this is remarkable.

949
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:33,592
Mr. Kim tells me this is
your doing, Mr. Paris.

950
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,011
Ah... yeah.

951
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:38,348
It's just a little
diversion, Captain.

952
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,891
One always knows

953
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,852
when a woman of good breeding
enters the room.

954
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,188
<i>Ma chérie...</i>

955
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,982
may I request
your favorite song

956
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,902
so that we may dance,
before I take you

957
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,071
to my private felucca
on the wharf

958
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,157
and make
passionate love to you?

959
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,909
Uh... I'm sorry.

960
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,828
If I had some kind of warning
that you were coming...

961
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,498
You would have changed it, and
I would have missed all the fun.

962
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,209
(<i> chuckling</i> )

963
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,253
I just don't know
what the dolls see

964
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,670
in a gigolo, do you?

965
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,215
Now me, I got a whole
different approach to women.

966
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,009
Treat a lady like a tramp
and a tramp like a lady.

967
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,677
Never fails.

968
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,806
Paris, did you program
this guy?

969
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,225
Yeah. Why?

970
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,602
He's a pig
and so are you.

971
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,645
(<i> clears throat</i> )

972
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,985
Almost never.

973
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,237
Is this pool or billiards?

974
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,489
Uh, pool.

975
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,865
Right.

976
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,200
Pool's the one
with the pockets.

977
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,702
Would you mind
if I gave it a try?

978
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,913
<i>Reculez-vous!</i>

979
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,332
Give the handsome
young woman some room.

980
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,211
Tell me, does she have,
uh, money?

981
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,797
Commander Chakotay, your stick?

982
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,049
It's called a cue, Captain.

983
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,259
Cue.

984
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:59,220
All right.
So what do we do?

985
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,097
Do I go first?

986
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,854
(<i> astonished exclamations</i> )

987
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,110
Solids.

988
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:18,364
I saw that coming
a mile away, didn't you?

989
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,702
Ah, you've got a lot
to learn,<i> jeune homme.</i>

990
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,165
But then... I've got
a lot to teach.

991
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,209
Eight ball in the side pocket.

992
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,379
JANEWAY:
A-koo-chee-moya.

993
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,298
<i>We are far</i>
<i>from the sacred places</i>

994
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,301
<i>of our grandfathers and from</i>
<i>the bones of our people,</i>

995
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,595
<i>but perhaps there is</i>
<i>one powerful being</i>

996
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,096
<i>who will embrace this good crew</i>

997
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,474
<i>and give them</i>
<i>the answer they seek.</i>
