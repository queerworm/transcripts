00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,592
Rust?

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,218
That's right, Captain.

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:13,472
High levels of ferric oxide--
corroded iron particles.

5
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,557
Would you mind telling me

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,519
how iron could rust in space
without oxygen?

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,770
I wish I could.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,939
Mr. Paris,

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,441
alter our course to follow
that trail of rust.

10
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,651
One-quarter impulse.

11
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,194
Aye, Captain.

(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,037
Captain, look at this.

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,707
I'm picking up traces
of complex hydrocarbons

15
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:43,210
in the rust--
benzene, ethylene,

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,503
acetylene...

17
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,045
That sounds like gasoline.

18
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,589
Gasoline?

19
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,133
It's a liquid fuel that was used
centuries ago on Earth.

20
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,220
They burned it to drive
internal combustion engines.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,638
How did it get out here?

22
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,516
I'm detecting a small object.
It appears to be

23
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,267
the source of the rust
and hydrocarbons.

24
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,228

a ground vehicle

from mid-20th-century

29
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,435
Whew!
It's a 1936 Ford, actually.

30
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,854
Mr. Paris?

31
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,273
That was the manufacturing
date: 1936.

32
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,901
Ford was the name of
the company that built it.

33
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,570

Internal combustion engine,

37
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,165
a reciprocating
piston cylinder design.

38
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,834
Fuel source was
a refined petroleum.

39
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,460
Gasoline.

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,337
So, is this an early hover car?

41
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,423
No, you're about a century
too early for that.

42
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,594
This is about one step ahead
of the horse-drawn carriage.

43
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,180
Traces of
potassium nitrate,

44

ammonium and
methane back here.

45
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,351
I think you'll find
that's manure.

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,647
Horse manure,
if I'm not mistaken.

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,026
Judging from the mud
on the wheels

49
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,028
and the alfalfa
seedlings

50
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,946
stuck in the metal frame,

51
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,781
I'd say this vehicle
belonged to a farmer,

52
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,450
or, at least, someone who
lived in a rural area.

53
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,954
But the question is:
How did it get here?

54
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,706
I doubt there are many
20th-century farmers

55
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,708
driving around
the Delta Quadrant.

56
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,418
There are no signs
of any wormholes

or temporal anomalies
in this region of space.

58
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,673
Let's run a metallurgical
analysis of the vehicle.

59
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,219
There's still oil
in the crankcase,

60
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,303
water in the radiator.

61
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,723
I wonder if the battery's
still charged.

62
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,226
Now, let's see.

63
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,270
This is before
voice-command activation,

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,399
so there should be something
in here called a key.

65

Key...

Aha! Here they are.

70

Okay, choke out,

00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,790
clutch in,

72
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,792
give her a little gas,

73
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,669
turn the key,

74
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,046
and step on the starter.

Sorry.

80
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,606
Next time...

81
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:18,401
you might give us
a little warning, Mr. Paris.

82
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,071
Aye, Captain.

83
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,574
I suggest we increase the
ventilation in the cargo bay

84
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,534
before we are asphyxiated.

85
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,245
What's that?

86
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:32,291
That is an amplitude modulation
receiving device.

87
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,793
AM radio.

88
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,045
I'm not sure we'll
pick up much out here.

00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,010
Whoa. What was that?

( short and long beeps )

93
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,056
What is that?

94
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,225
It's too regular
to be random interference.

95

I'm running the signal
through the ship's database.

96
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,109
It's an ancient Earth
distress call known as an SOS.

97
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,198
I've located the source
of the SOS signal.

98
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,949
It's coming from a planet
in a star system

99
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,367
bearing 310 mark 215.

100
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,287
Mr. Paris, lay in a course.

101
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,621
Aye, Captain.

102
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,456
Why didn't we pick up
this signal earlier?

103
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,876
This isn't one of the standard
frequencies we monitor.

104
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,962
Messages on this channel only
travel at the speed of light--

105
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,131
too slow for interstellar
communications.

106

108
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,969

Bring us out of warp.
Full scan, Mr. Kim.

113
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,401
The SOS signal is coming
from the third planet.

114
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,072
It's Class-L--
oxygen-argon atmosphere.

115
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,740
Any life signs?

116
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,034
There's a great deal
of trinimbic interference

117
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,369
in the upper atmosphere.

118
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,287
I can't get a clear reading
of the surface.

119
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,748
Can you pinpoint the coordinates
of the distress call?

120
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,375
Yes, here it is.

121
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,710
It's coming from a continent
in the northern hemisphere.

122
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,920
We won't be able to transport

123

through this kind
of interference.

124
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,798
I might be able to take
an away team in a shuttlecraft.

125
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,508
That would not be wise,
Commander,

126
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,802
as the atmosphere is charged
with trinimbic turbulence.

127
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,054
A shuttlecraft

128
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,848
could not safely
navigate the currents.

129
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,393
We could land the ship.

130
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,813
Are you sure that's necessary?

131
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,733
Someone on this planet
is sending out a distress call.

132
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,236
If that someone is as old
as the truck in the cargo bay,

133
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,612
they're long-dead by now.

134
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,739
This might be
an automated distress call.

135
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,408
Possibly.

136
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,660
But something brought that truck
halfway across the galaxy,

137
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,330
and that something
might be down on that planet.

138
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,998
And if it brought
the truck here,

139
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,833
it might be able
to take us home, too.

140
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,878
I'd say
it's worth a look.

141

for landing.

157
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,539
No closer than

00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,162
Here we go.

182
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,759
Disengaging engines,
securing thruster exhaust.

183
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,888
We're down.

184
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,766
Not bad...for a beginner.

185
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,193
JANEWAY:
Nice day.

186
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,028
KIM:
I've locked on
to the distress signal.

187
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,905
It's 1.5 kilometers

188
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,532
on a bearing of 246.

189
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,534
Wait a second.
I've got something else.

190
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,495
There's a high concentration
of trianium particles,

191
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,081
bearing 225-- a little
over a kilometer away.

192
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,541
Looks like
some kind of power source.

193
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,000
Two teams.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,795
Chakotay, yours investigates
the power source.

195
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,131
Tuvok, Kim,
you're with me.

196
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,476
My God.

197
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,623
TUVOK:
The metal
is an aluminum alloy.

198
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,250
It appears to be
an ancient Earth aircraft.

199
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,295
KIM:
The SOS call is
coming from inside.

200
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,312
I've found
the AM transmitter.

201
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,687
From what I can tell,

202
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,565
it's sending out
an automated SOS.

203
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,816
What about
the power source?

204
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,485
Somehow I find it
hard to believe

205
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,279
the battery on this aircraft
has been running for 400 years.

206
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,490
I don't recognize
the power signature.

207
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,037
Hold on, Captain.

208
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,039
I found
what appears to be

209
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,875
an alien fusion-based
generator.

210
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,710
It's hooked up to
the AM transmitter.

211
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,796
( on communicator ):
<i>Chakotay to Janeway.</i>

212
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,924
Go ahead, Commander.

213
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,176
<i>We've located the source</i>

214
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,718
of the trianium readings.

215
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,471
It appears to be some
sort of mine shaft.

216
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,598
I'd like to bring out
another security detachment

217
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,849
before we go inside.

218
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,726
Good idea. I'll join you.
Janeway out.

219
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,063
I want the two of you to
analyze the alien generator,

220
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,940
then see what you can find
out about this SOS call.

221
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,913
TORRES:
I'm picking up something
directly ahead.

222
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,998
Some kind of power signature.

223
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,417
Fusion-based.

224
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,442
TORRES:
This looks like
some kind of

225
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,151
cryostasis chamber.

226
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,237
How many bodies
are there?

227
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,530
Eight.

228
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,824
And the equipment
is still functioning.

229
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,839
He's human.

230
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,761
And from the clothes,

231
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,929
I'd say he's
from the same era

232
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,640
as the vehicle we found.

233
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,807
TORRES:
His life sign readings
are minimal,

234
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,770
but...he's alive.

235
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,734
Captain, according
to these readings,

236
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,279
there are five other
cryostasis chambers nearby.

237
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,406
No life signs in any of them.

238
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,949
This appears to be
the only one

239
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,576
with people inside.

240
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,788
There's another male over here.

241
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,377
This one's a female.

242
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,630
She's wearing

243
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,132
some sort of leather jacket.

244
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,011
And a pair of gold wings.

245
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,304
Wait.

246
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,264
There's a name tag here.

247
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,849
I think it's "A, period...

248
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,102
"E-a...

249
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:18,191
r-h-a-r-t."

250
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,942
"Earhart."

251
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,740
( whispering ):
A.... Earhart.

252
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,326
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

253
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,620
Amelia Earhart.

254
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,000
Who's Amelia Earhart?

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,504
She was one of the first
female pilots in Earth history.

256
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,589
In the mid-20th century,
she became quite famous

257
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,675
for flying across
the Atlantic Ocean.

258
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:48,555
In 1937, she attempted to fly
around the world.

259
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,306
According to the records
of the time,

260
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,767
on July 2, 1937,

261
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,102
Earhart and her navigator,
Fred Noonan,

262
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,689
took off from New Guinea,
and they were headed east

263
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,940
around the equator.

264
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,902
But somewhere in
the South Seas, they vanished,

265
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,821
and their disappearance
became one of the most

266
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,989
celebrated mysteries
of the 20th century.

267
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,825
Why didn't they think
she'd just crashed?

268
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,077
That was the most
commonly held theory.

269
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,329
However, numerous
searches of the area

270
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,206
failed to produce the wreckage
of an aircraft,

271
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,375
so people began to speculate.

272
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,293
Some thought she'd been
shot down and captured

273
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,003
by the Japanese navy.

274
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,214
Others thought that she and
Noonan had flown off together

275
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,049
on some sort
of romantic adventure.

276
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,720
Of course,
the most ridiculed notion was

277
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,847
that she had been...

278
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,849
abducted by aliens.

279
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,184
Well, it certainly looks
like that's what happened.

280
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,603
From what we can tell,

281
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,521
all eight of the people
in that stasis chamber

282
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,357
were taken from Earth
in the 1930s and brought here.

283
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,817
The question is: Why?

284
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,736
And where are the aliens
who did this?

285
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,405
Scans of the region
show no alien life signs.

286
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,823
Continue the scans.

287
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,366
They may not be here now,

288
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,994
but once they detect
our presence, they might return.

289
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,497
In the meantime, we'll have
to get some answers on our own.

290
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,916
Have you had any luck
tapping into

291
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,709
the computer system
in the cryo-chamber?

292
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,294
Not as of yet.

293
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,338
We are having difficulty
decoding the operating system.

294
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,674
There's one way
we could find out what happened.

295
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,469
We could wake those people up
and ask them.

296
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,721
I've had
the same thought myself.

297
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,055
Is that wise?

298
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,307
We don't know how these people

299
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,725
are going to react
when they wake up

300
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,519
in an alien world
in the 24th century.

301
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,104
JANEWAY:
True, but I'm not willing

302
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,149
to just leave them in stasis
for another 400 years.

303
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,526
And if we can find out
how they were brought here,

304
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,613
we might be able
to use that method to get home.

305
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,950
We'll just have to be very
careful how we handle this.

306
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,576
I suggest that only
human crew members

307
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,286
be present when we revive them.

308
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,537
Agreed.

309
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,205
Mr. Kim,
I want a complete analysis

310
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,874
of those cryostasis tubes.

311
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,542
Find a way
to deactivate them safely.

312
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,127
Aye, Captain.

313
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,631
Commander, apprise the Doctor
of our situation.

314
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,842
Tell him to instruct Kes
in the proper procedure

315
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,302
for reviving someone
from cryostasis.

316
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,263
She could be made
to look human easily enough.

317
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,640
In the meantime,

318
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,977
I suggest we all brush up
on ancient Earth.

319
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,312
We're about to meet
a bit of our history.

320
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,364
We're ready, Captain.

321
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,408
All the cryo-tubes
are linked

322
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,910
by a common
power source

323
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,705
so we've decided to revive
everyone simultaneously.

324
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,541
Proceed.

325
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,172
The power's off-line.

326
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,842
Deactivate locking mechanisms.

327
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:35,805
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

328
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,908
Captain, this one's armed
with some kind of weapon.

329
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,410
Disarm him,
just to be on the safe side.

330
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,420
(<i> gentle theme playing</i> )

331
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,677
I know this must be
very strange for you.

332
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,262
No...who are you?

333
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,472
What is going on here?

334
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,932
I demand you release me
immediately.

335
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,892
Please, if you'll just
listen for a moment,

336
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,018
I'll try to explain.

337
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,312
You are all
speaking Japanese.

338
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,230
Sounds to me like you're
speaking English.

339
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,565
It's because
of a device

340
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,526
we have--
a universal translator.

341
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,028
It allows us
to talk to each other,

342
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,114
even though our languages
aren't the same.

343
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,531
Who are you people?

344
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,784
Look, just let us go home.
We won't tell anybody.

345
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,077
The hell
we won't!

346
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,787
I'm going to let the world know

347
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,122
what you people have done.

348
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,248
Do you know who
you've kidnapped here?

349
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,875
Amelia Earhart.

350
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,127
I'm her navigator.

351
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,796
This is going
to be headline news.

352
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,172
You people are in trouble.

353
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,426
Fred...let her talk.

354
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,304
What I have to tell you is
going to sound hard to believe,

355
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,222
even preposterous.

356
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:47,145
We think you were abducted
from Earth...in the 1930s,

357
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,605
and brought millions
of miles through space

358
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,817
to a planet on the other
side of the galaxy.

359
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,987
You were put into a...
a kind of deep sleep

360
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,822
for a very long time.

361
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,449
It's not
the 1930s anymore.

362
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,077
The year is 2371--

363
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,455
over 400 years from
the time you were abducted.

364
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,666
You must think
we are awfully gullible.

365
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,917
JANEWAY:
Tell me,

366
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,627
what's the last thing
you remember

367
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,546
before waking up here?

368
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,175
We were over the Pacific,

369
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,259
running low on gas.

370
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,303
We were looking for an atoll
to set down.

371
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,471
We...

372
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,973
tried to send
out an SOS

373
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,433
and...

374
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,980
suddenly there was this...
huge light in back of us,

375
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,815
and the plane...

376
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,777
stopped dead...

377
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,655
and then it started moving
backward toward the light.

378
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,994
I must've blacked out, I...

379
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,080
and I w-woke up here,
just now.

380
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,372
That's just the way
it was with me.

381
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,832
I was in my truck,
heading into town.

382
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,834
I was just about
to get onto the blacktop

383
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,754
when this big light
come down from the sky--

384
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,505
just about blinded me.

385
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,924
Next thing I know,

386
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,218
the whole truck
was lifted up off the ground.

387
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,012
I believe what happened

388
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,224
was that you
were abducted by aliens.

389
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,642
And if we can find out
how they got you here,

390
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,937
we might all be able
to get back to Earth.

391
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,356
I want some real answers now.

392
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,234
I assure you,
I am telling the truth.

393
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,111
You-- come on down here

394
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,404
and get those, uh,
funny-looking guns of theirs.

395
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,202
You--

396
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,411
get over there
with the others.

397
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,081
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

398
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,208
What is this?
It's a medical device.

399
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,459
I'm just trying
to make sure

400
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,877
that everyone
is all right.

401
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,257
Now, how do we get out of here?

402
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,175
( on communicator ):<i> </i>
<i>Chakotay to away team.</i>

403
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,760
Janeway here.

404
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,929
<i>Captain, I'm picking up</i>
<i>some energy displacements</i>

405
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,097
on the surface.

406
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,514
I think it may be
alien humanoids.

407
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,100
It looks like they're using

408
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,185
some kind of deflection system
to trick our sensors.

409
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,770
I think you'd better get up
here.

410
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,980
Who's that talking?

411
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,899
That's Commander Chakotay,
on our ship.

412
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,109
Commander, huh?

413
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,359
Okay.

414
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,861
Now hear this, Commander.

415
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,113
There's a gun pointed

416
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,739
at the lady's head right now,

417
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,283
so you call Washington

418
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,660
and you tell them we're holding
your people prisoner

419
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,036
and they're not going anywhere

420
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,789
until I personally talk
to J. Edgar Hoover.

421
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,457
You've got one hour.

422
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,375
Captain?

423
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,337
It seems we're being
held hostage, Commander.

424
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,048
I suggest you pay attention
to what the gentleman says.

425
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,508
<i>I understand.</i>

426
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,884
Chakotay out.

427
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,094
All security personnel

428
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,804
report to the cargo bay
immediately.

429
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,686
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

430
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,232
The compass isn't working.

431
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,067
I know what we've told you
sounds hard to believe,

432
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,028
but there was a time
when no one believed

433
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,530
that a woman could fly
across the Atlantic.

434
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,158
Now, people are
able to travel

435
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,575
between the stars.

436
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,453
The galaxy is full
of many different species.

437
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,122
For instance,

438
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,500
this young woman
isn't human.

439
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,880
She's an Ocampa.

440
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,425
I've been on expeditions
all over the world,

441
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,844
and I've seen people

442
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,555
do all kinds of strange things
to their bodies.

443
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,183
That doesn't mean that Martians
have invaded Earth.

444
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,934
Actually,
it was the other way around.

445
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,355
Mars was colonized
by people from Earth in 2103.

446
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,065
NOONAN:
That's enough!

447
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,984
All of you just go over there
and sit down and keep quiet!

448
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,783
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

449
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,462
The trinimbic interference
has affected

450
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,673
the transporter's
targeting scanners.

451
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,302
We can't beam into the chamber,
so we'll have to go on foot.

452
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,803
We will deploy throughout
the caves,

453
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,597
sealing off any exit
from the chamber.

454
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,182
Let's go.

455
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:57,186
Now is probably not the
best time for that, Fred.

456
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,896
Just a little pick-me-up.

457
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,568
He's had a few nips
from that flask, Captain.

458
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,320
We could probably
rush him, get the gun.

459
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,488
Let me try to talk
to Earhart first.

460
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,199
She seems reasonable.

461
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,951
Maybe I can get
through to her.

462
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,373
Miss Earhart?

463
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,466
I want you to know

464
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,720
you've always been
an inspiration to me.

465
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,598
Because of you,
generations of women

466
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,642
have become pilots.

467
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,144
Generations?

468
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,479
What's your name?

469
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,065
Kathryn Janeway.

470
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,735
I heard the Commander
call you Captain.

471
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,779
What exactly do you captain?

472
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,573
The Federation Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

473
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,117
Starship?

474
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,329
Ha, ha. That supposed to mean
it flies through space?

475
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,704
That's right.

476
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,956
That isn't possible.

477
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,498
Only in books--
H.G. Wells, Jules Verne.

478
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,419
Maybe if you saw it, you'd think
otherwise.

479
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,712
Saw it?

480
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,006
Where is it?

481
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,382
On the surface.

482
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,260
We're actually about 100 meters
underground now.

483
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,637
If you'd come with me
to see<i> Voyager,</i>

484
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,514
you'd realize that what
we're telling you is true.

485
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,142
And risk a trap.

486
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,311
No, you could have hundreds
of reinforcements up there.

487
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,980
I assure you, we have
no interest in harming you.

488
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,483
We took you out of stasis
to help you.

489
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,902
Put yourself in my shoes,
Captain.

490
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,365
If you were me,
would you believe your story?

491
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,573
Maybe not.

492
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,993
Let me tell you some
of what happened

493
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,330
after you disappeared
over the Pacific.

494
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,706
No trace of you or your plane

495
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,666
was ever found, in spite
of a massive search.

496
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,084
Over the years,
there was

497
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,544
a lot of speculation
about your flight,

498
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,089
including the rumor that it was
financed by the government,

499
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,966
and may have been
part of an operation

500
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,469
to gather information
about the Japanese.

501
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,013
Where did you hear that?

502
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,474
It's somewhat common knowledge.

503
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:02,353
You see, Japan attacked
Pearl Harbor in 1941,

504
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,898
drawing the United States
into a massive world war.

505
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,692
In retrospect, your journey

506
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,610
was seen in a different light--

507
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,321
perhaps as part of
an intelligence mission

508
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,198
devised by a government
deeply concerned

509
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,449
about Japanese war plans.

510
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,160
No one was supposed
to know about that.

511
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,413
Maybe not in 1937.

512
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,957
Now, it's part of history.

513
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,834
NOONAN:
Hey, I got

514
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,878
an idea.

515
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,838
Why don't we stick them
in these things--

516
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,341
put them to sleep like we were?

517
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,843
No fuss, no trouble.

518
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,888
Mr. Noonan, that
will accomplish nothing.

519
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,183
Please, let us take you
to our ship.

520
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,478
You'll see that everything
we've told you is true.

521
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,813
Show me how to
operate this thing.

522
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,025
Hey, last time I looked,
you were working for me...

523
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,818
and I think we should listen
to these people.

524
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,779
They just may
be telling the truth.

525
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,075
What's the harm in seeing

526
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,994
if maybe they do have
this starship?

527
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,455
It beats being cooped up
in here

528
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,081
trying to figure out
what happened.

529
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,374
( sighs heavily )

530
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,126
How about it?

531
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,835
Anyone want to come along?

532
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,674
Hey, I wouldn't

00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,634
Anyone else?

00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,011
You're not
leaving me behind.

535
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,306
Kes and I will stay with
the others, Captain.

536
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,808
It'll take about ten minutes
to get to the surface.

537
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,184
Stay close to us.

The targeting scanners

I can't risk laying down

Turn around slowly.

You're not Briori.

No, I'm human.

00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,152
Human?

583
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,787
We're human.

584
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,417
You're working
for the Briori.

585
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,752
They have ships

586
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,211
I'll answer any questions
you have,

587
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,921
but first, we must take care
of our wounded.

588
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,298
Can we agree to end this?

589
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,924
Yes.

I'm Kathryn Janeway

of the Federation Starship
<i>Voyager.</i>

593
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,266
John Evansville.

594
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,685
This is my colleague,
Karyn Berlin.

595
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,152
Severe trauma
to the thoracic cavity,

596
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,238

597
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,490
He's not
going to make it.

598
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,865
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

599
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,451
Vascular regenerator.

600
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,125
Hmm...

601
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,877
he's not responding
to the treatment.

602
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,424
The alcohol level in his blood
is so high, it's inhibiting

603
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,469
the repair to his
circulatory system.

604
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,221
Attempting to compensate.

605
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,851
I told you your drinking'd
kill you one day.

606
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,397
She's right, Doc.

607
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,983
Just let me die in peace.

608
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,366
There's just one thing
I want to say to you first...

609
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,119
...even though
it's 400 years late.

610
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,415
Amelia...

611
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,000
I love you.

612
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,755
Fred...

613
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,717
you never said anything.

614
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,426
You're married--

615
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,428
or you were.

616
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,888
I guess he's dead now.

617
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,394
I just wanted you to know
before...

618
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,688
before I met my Maker.

619
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,357
There. That should do it.

620
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,567
Do what?

621
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,151
You're healed.

622
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,032
You mean, I'm not going to die?

623
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,535
Aside from a hangover,
you're going to be fine.

624
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,288
Oh, Amelia, you, uh...

625
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,585
...you got to forget
what I just told you.

626
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,337
Promise me.

627
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:06,592
Fred, I already have.

628
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,135
Oh...

629
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,470
You've taken the 37's.

630
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,055
Why?

631
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,724
I'm afraid
I don't understand.

632
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,059
You went
into the shrine.

633
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,228
You stole the 37's
from the sacred altars

634
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,564
and you disturbed
the radio signal

635
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,483
that we have been so careful
to preserve.

636
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,527
Captain, I think he's talking
about Earhart

637
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,779
and the others.

638
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,572
Tell me more about the 37's.

639
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,323
Are you one of them?

640
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,909
I'm one of their descendants.

641
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,161
The 37's were brought here
over 15 generations ago

642
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:38,081
by the Briori.

643
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,416
Who are the Briori?

644
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,126
They're an alien race.

645
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,171
They abducted over 300 people
from Earth in the year 1937.

646
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,842
Brought them over here,
turned them into slaves.

647
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,636
But those slaves revolted,

648
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,179
killed the Briori,
took their weapons

649
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,848
and their technology

650
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,976
and survived.

651
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,146
And now,
there are over 100,000 of us.

652
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,439
( wry laugh )

653
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,942
The Briori never came back.

654
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,610
Now, you answer me.

655
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,946
Why did you steal
the remaining 37's

656
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,322
from the shrine?

657
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,158
We didn't steal them,
we simply revived them.

658
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,160
Revived them?
They're dead.

659
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,995
No, they were simply

660
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,165
in a state of what
we call "cryostasis."

661
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,374
That's a form of sleep

662
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,002
that appears very
much like death.

663
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,715
Do you mean they're alive?

664
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,551
Yes.

665
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,639
My people have come to regard
the 37's as monuments

666
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,140
to our ancestors.

667
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,519
Nobody has even entered
their shrine for generations.

668
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,271
Mr. Evansville,
we were hoping

669
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,608
to find the ship that brought
your ancestors here--

670
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,654
possibly use it to get back
to Earth a little faster.

671
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,531
I'm sorry.

672
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,908
The Briori ship was destroyed

673
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,493
in the slave revolt.

674
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,162
There's nothing left.

00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,373

676
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,041
Captain...

677
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,169
I'm sorry to hear
about your long journey home.

678
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,340
But you should know that life
on this planet is good.

679
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,593
We live in three
beautiful cities

680
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,428
only 50 miles from here.

681
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,890
Oh, I'd like to see your cities.

682
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,350
And I'd like
to show them to you.

683
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,521
<i>How</i> fast?

684
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,272
Warp 9.9.

685
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,149
In your terms, that's about

686
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,861
four billion miles
a second.

687
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,993
Think I could take her out
for a spin?

688
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,746
Well, uh...ha.

689
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,040
Mr. Evansville has offered
to take us on a tour

690
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,457
of the settlements.

691
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,836
He's extended the invitation
to the entire crew.

692
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,963
And the 37's, of course.

693
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,342
You...?

694
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,969
You're a 37?

(<i> gentle theme playing</i> ) 

696
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,934
I guess you could call me that.

697
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,148
It would be

698
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:12,069
an honor to show you our cities.

Is something wrong, Captain?

709

You've seemed
a little

710
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,604
distracted ever since
we came back from the cities.

711
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,564
Weren't you impressed?

712
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,025
A little too impressed.

00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,945
JANEWAY:
There's a thriving

715
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:58,657
sophisticated culture on
this planet-- of human beings.

716
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,786
In some ways,
walking around those cities

717
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,331
was...almost like being
back on Earth.

718
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,336
It was a little eerie.

719
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,880
It reminded me of home, too.

720
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,925
Evansville has offered to
let any of our crew stay.

721
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,802
What will you do about that?

722
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,347
Maybe this is
one of those decisions

723
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,850
that the Captain has to make
for the entire ship.

724
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,643
You may have a problem
if a lot of people want to stay.

725
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:30,313
I know that. But at the same
time, I can't take a vote

726
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,357
every time there's
a major decision to be made.

727
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,777
And yet...

728
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,404
we're a long way from Starfleet.

729
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,573
And a lot of the rules
and regulations

730
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,994
I've learned to uphold
seem distant, as well.

731
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:50,750
Am I the only one who is
so intent on getting home?

732
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,669
Is it just me?

733
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,796
Am I leading the crew
on a forlorn mission,

734
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:59,551
with...no real hope of success?

735
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,927
You're not alone.

736
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,513
I want to get home, too.

737
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,098
And there's not a day
that goes by

738
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,642
when I don't hear someone
mention Earth.

739
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,937
The people here have built
a new Earth.

740
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,564
We could stay,

741
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,149
help them build
a human civilization

742
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,985
in the Delta Quadrant.

743
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,319
Isn't that an exciting prospect?

744
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,781
Shouldn't we be grateful
for the opportunity

745
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,116
they're giving us?

746
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,534
It is a tempting prospect.

747
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,496
But when I hold it up
against the prospect

748
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,249
of seeing the sunrise
over the Arizona desert

749
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:36,254
or swimming in the Gulf
of Mexico on a summer's day,

750
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,007
there's just no comparison.

751
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,259
I want to go home.

752
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,304
We have 152 men and women
on this ship.

753
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:49,392
What happens if half of them
decide to stay on the planet?

754
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,104
Could we operate<i> Voyager</i>
with 75 crew members?

755
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:55,023
I doubt it.
In fact, I don't think

756
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,192
we could operate the ship
with fewer than 100.

757
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,319
If too many of the crew
choose to stay behind...

758
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,655
we could all be stranded here.

759
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,076
( sighs )

760
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:09,328
Tell all hands to prepare for
an announcement from the Captain

761
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,747
at 1400 hours.

762
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:16,128
They deserve to make the choice
for themselves.

763
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,587
Aye, Captain.

764
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:21,007
<i>( majestic theme builds</i>
<i>and swells )</i>

765
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,969
( door opens and closes )

766
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:35,230
<i>( gentle theme playing )</i>

767
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,440
Here we are.

768
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,194
My research on 20th century
Earth is a little thin,

769
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,862
but I've done what I can.

770
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,781
Pot roast, green beans

771
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,952
and something called...
Jell...O.

772
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,870
<i>You</i> know how to make Jell-O?

773
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,205
I even put in fruit cocktail.

774
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,415
NOONAN:
You don't say.

775
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,459
MAN:
I don't know
about the rest of you,

776
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,877
but I've made up my mind.

777
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,631
There is land here
that goes begging,

778
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,091
and I could have a big farm,
just like

779
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,342
I always dreamed.

780
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,637
And for you, rice,
with a little fish.

781
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:12,517
I even replicated some
ginger for seasoning.

782
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,103
Very nice. Thank you.

783
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,647
Yeah, I have to admit--

784
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,483
life here looks a lot better
than what we left on Earth.

785
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,068
It's a paradise by comparison.

786
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,612
And there are
many Japanese here.

787
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,866
I could be very happy.

788
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,117
We all could.

789
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,077
Right?

790
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,371
( sighs )

791
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,041
I'm just not sure, I...

792
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,584
What about you, Mr. Neelix?

793
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,338
Have you made your decision?

794
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,755
Oh, yes, indeed.

795
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,342
I'm staying right here
with Captain Janeway.

796
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,302
She'd be lost without me.

797
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,596
She's come to depend on me
a great deal.

798
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,806
What about the rest of the crew?

799
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,766
You think many of them
will stay here?

800
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,311
Oh, I don't think so.

801
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,729
At least, not many.

802
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,649
Uh, well, that is,
there's a good chance...

803
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,694
Well, now that you ask,
I honestly don't know.

804
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,906
You? You'd stay here
on the planet?

805
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,448
I didn't say
I was going to.

806
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,284
I just said
I could understand

807
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,036
why people would want to.

808
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,289
The people here
remind me of home.

809
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,209
I haven't felt like that
since I left Earth.

810
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:22,045
But-- But you're Starfleet.

811
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,339
You've always wanted
a life in space.

812
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,924
I know,

813
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,467
but...my whole life?

814
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,222
On a starship, day after day,
with no end in sight?

815
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,766
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

816
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,769
You're not the first person
I've heard talk like this.

817
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,272
A lot of people
are thinking about staying.

818
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,857
What about you?

819
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,235
Don't you have
some of those feelings?

820
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,529
I'd be lying if I said I didn't.

821
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,201
(<i> gentle theme playing</i> )

822
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,039
Captain.

823
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,332
I was told
I'd find you here.

824
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,541
Am I intruding?

825
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,253
Not at all. Please join me.

826
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,964
I wanted you
to know that

827
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,800
the group you brought
out of stasis--

828
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,219
we've all decided to stay here
on the planet.

829
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,431
( sighs )

830
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,182
I understand.

831
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:20,019
I must admit, the thought
of traveling through space--

832
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,398
maybe even learning
to fly this ship--

833
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,524
was very appealing to me.

834
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,985
And I'd looked forward

835
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,320
to getting to
know you better.

836
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,281
I suspect we have
a lot in common.

837
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,453
At first,
I didn't know what to do.

838
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,747
We talked about it
for quite some time.

839
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:44,002
Finally, I realized
the people here on this planet

840
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,920
are part of us.

841
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,465
We're their ancestors,
in a way.

842
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:52,510
Well, it made us
feel close to them.

843
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,138
The remarkable thing about
the humans on this planet

844
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,766
is that they evolved very much
like the people on Earth.

845
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,602
Tens of thousands
of light-years apart,

846
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,481
both civilizations
managed to create a world

847
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,107
they could be proud of--

848
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,610
one where war and poverty
simply don't exist.

849
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:14,032
I certainly can't blame you
for wanting to be part of it,

850
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,868
any more than I can blame
members of my crew

851
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,037
if they make the same decision.

852
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,955
When will you find out?

853
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,540
In half an hour.

854
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,501
Anyone who wants
to stay behind

855
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:28,171
is to report to the
cargo bay at 1500 hours.

856
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,425
I expect Jarvin will
stay on the planet.

857
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,718
In fact, I'd bet on it.

858
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,178
Why Jarvin?

859
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,513
He's been more
uncomfortable

860
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:37,847
about being on
a Starfleet ship

861
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,224
than most of the Maquis.

862
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,517
And he's gotten involved

863
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,394
with a young woman
in Quantum Mechanics.

864
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:45,522
I think they'd like to
settle down, raise a family.

865
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,524
The person I expect
to see is Baxter.

866
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,484
Baxter?
Walter Baxter?

867
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,528
He's adventurous,
a risk-taker.

868
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,238
I can see him wanting
to take on the challenge

869
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,614
of building a new life
on this planet.

870
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,534
I'd hate to lose Baxter.

871
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,784
He's a good man.

872
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,203
I'd hate to lose Jarvin.

873
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,249
I don't want to lose anyone.

874
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,042
We've all been through
so much together,

875
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,419
it just wouldn't
seem right.

876
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,339
But I couldn't
blame anyone--

877
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,967
anyone-- for staying behind.

878
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:20,348
I'm not sure
I want to go in.

879
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,645
No matter what happens,
we'll make it.

880
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,064
Remember that.

881
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,568

882
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:43,037

883
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,882
TUVOK:
Captain on the Bridge.

884
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,659
All stations,
prepare for departure.

Condition Blue, Mr. Tuvok.

886
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,788
Ms. Torres,
antigrav thrusters on line.

887
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,373
Thrusters enabled.

888
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,502
Mr. Paris, inertial dampers
