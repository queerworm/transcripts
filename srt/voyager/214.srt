1
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,389
CAPTAIN.

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,350
REPORT.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,686
IT LOOKS LIKE THE KAZON
HAVE RETREATED, CAPTAIN.

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,228
WE MUST HAVE HURT THEM.

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,105
NOT AS BAD
AS THEY HURT US.

6
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,065
ALL ENGINES ARE OFF LINE.

7
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,820
CAPTAIN, SHIELDS ARE DOWN,
AS ARE ALL WEAPONS ARRAYS.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,237
WE'D BETTER HOPE
THEY DON'T COME BACK.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,572
WE'RE SITTING DUCKS.

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,824
JANEWAY TO ENGINEERING.

11
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,325
WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?

12
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,202
WE'RE IN BAD SHAPE, CAPTAIN.

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,788
WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN THE WARP
ENGINES TO AVOID A BREACH.

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,665
THE IMPULSE ENGINES
ARE GONE TOO.

15
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,083
I THINK
I CAN GIVE YOU THRUSTERS

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,711
BUT I'VE GOT
A LOT OF CASUALTIES DOWN HERE

17
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,546
I'VE GOT TO TEND TO FIRST.

18
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,506
LIEUTENANT, IT'S
KURT BENDERA.

19
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,299
HE'S HURT PRETTY BAD.

20
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,509
NO.

21
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,760
HIS CONSOLE
EXPLODED

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,178
CAUGHT HIM RIGHT
IN THE FACE.

23
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,889
WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM
TO SICK BAY RIGHT AWAY.

24
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,140
TORRES TO SICK BAY.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,934
I hope this is urgent,
Lieutenant.

26
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,602
WE HAVE OUR HANDS FULL
AT THE MOMENT.

27
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,396
I'm sending up
an emergency transport.

28
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,314
One of my people
is severely burned.

29
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,984
VERY WELL.
WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN.

30
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,986
MORE DAMAGE REPORTS
COMING IN, CAPTAIN.

31
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,779
THERE'S A HULL BREACH
ON DECK FOUR.

32
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,031
FORCE FIELD'S
IN PLACE.

33
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,448
REPAIR CREW'S
ON THE WAY.

34
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,783
THERE'VE BEEN CASUALTIES
ON ALL DECKS.

35
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,660
NO FATALITIES
SO FAR.

36
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,870
CAPTAIN, REQUEST PERMISSION

37
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,830
TO GIVE TORRES A HAND
IN ENGINEERING.

38
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,540
MAYBE I CAN HELP
GET PROPULSION UP AND RUNNING.

39
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,791
GOOD IDEA. GO AHEAD.

40
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,793
CAPTAIN, MY
READINGS INDICATE

41
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,045
THE NAVIGATIONAL
DEFLECTOR

42
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,504
HAS SUSTAINED
MASSIVE DAMAGE.

43
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,048
IT WILL BE NECESSARY
TO REPAIR IT

44
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,841
BEFORE WE CAN ACHIEVE
MORE THAN THRUSTER POWER.

45
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,091
GET REPAIR CREWS ON IT.

46
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,761
MR. KIM, I WANT
A COMPLETE ANALYSIS

47
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,220
OF ALL THE DAMAGE
WE'VE SUSTAINED.

48
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,430
YES, MA'AM.

49
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,806
HE'S NOT RESPONDING.

50
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,767
75 MILLIGRAMS OF IMPEDREZENE.

51
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,602
THAT MIGHT HELP STIMULATE
HIS CARDIAC FUNCTIONS

52
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,604
BUT HE'S SUSTAINED SO MUCH
INJURY IT MAY BE TOO LATE.

53
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,773
IT HAD NO EFFECT.
CORTICAL STIMULATOR.

54
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,030
I'M SORRY.

55
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,531
HE WAS TOO BADLY INJURED.

56
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,662
HE SAVED MY LIFE ONCE...

57
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,706
NEAR THE CARDASSIAN BORDER.

58
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,252
(<i> door beeping</i> )

59
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,587
COME IN.

60
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,469
CREWMAN BENDERA IS DEAD.

61
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,554
THE DOCTOR
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

62
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,264
I'M SORRY, CHAKOTAY.

63
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,849
I KNOW YOU WERE FRIENDS.

64
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,185
WILL YOU ARRANGE
A MEMORIAL SERVICE?

65
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,438
I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

66
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,400
WAS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE?

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,652
YES.

68
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,361
LIKE IT OR NOT

69
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,448
IT SEEMS WE'RE IN A SITUATION
WHERE THE RULES HAVE CHANGED

70
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:40,744
AND MAYBE, IF WE'RE GOING
TO SURVIVE OUT HERE

71
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,037
WE HAVE TO START CHANGING TOO.

72
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,705
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

73
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,708
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED
OUR TRIP HOME

74
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,293
YOU MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION

75
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,169
TO TREAT<i> VOYAGER</i>
AS A STARFLEET SHIP

76
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,840
WITH A STARFLEET CREW
FOLLOWING STARFLEET RULES.

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,341
THAT'S RIGHT.

78
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,512
STARFLEET WORKS WELL
IN THE ALPHA QUADRANT.

79
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,016
BUT OUT HERE...

80
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,685
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE THINKING
MORE LIKE THE MAQUIS.

81
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,229
THE MAQUIS HAD TO SURVIVE
ON THEIR OWN.

82
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,149
WE WERE UP AGAINST
INSURMOUNTABLE ODDS.

83
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,317
WE HAD TO CREATE OUR OWN
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS

84
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,737
BECAUSE NOBODY WAS WILLING
TO HELP US.

85
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,531
SOUND LIKE ANYBODY YOU KNOW?

86
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,367
IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING
WE ABANDON OUR PRINCIPLES

87
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,243
JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE OUT OF HAILING RANGE...

88
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,040
CAPTAIN, THIS WAS THE FOURTH
ATTACK IN TWO WEEKS.

89
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,125
WE'VE LOST THREE CREW MEMBERS
TO THE KAZON.

90
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,585
A DOZEN MORE HAVE SUSTAINED
SERIOUS INJURIES.

91
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,379
THIS SHIP HAS TAKEN
SO MUCH DAMAGE

92
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,672
WE'LL BE LUCKY TO GET WARP DRIVE

93
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,549
ON LINE AGAIN.

94
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,967
AND WE CAN
COUNT ON THE FACT

95
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,094
THAT THE KAZON WILL BE BACK.

96
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,352
I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD
TO KEEP DOING BUSINESS AS USUAL.

97
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,805
A LOT OF US CAN SAY
WE'RE ALIVE TODAY

98
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,598
BECAUSE OF KURT BENDERA.

99
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,477
THERE WAS NEVER A BETTER MAN
TO HAVE AT YOUR SIDE

100
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:57,274
NEVER ANYONE MORE WILLING
TO TAKE ON THE TOUGH JOBS.

101
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,068
THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM
WAS IN A MINING COMMUNITY

102
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,695
ON TELFAS PRIME.

103
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,864
SOME OF THE MINERS OBJECTED
TO MY SENSE OF HUMOR

104
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,117
AND DECIDED THEY SHOULD BREAK
A FEW OF MY BONES.

105
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,452
THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM
AND ONE OF ME

106
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,663
AND I WAS TAKING A BEATING.

107
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,791
SUDDENLY, THIS MAN I'D NEVER
SEEN BEFORE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE

108
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,918
AND EVENED THINGS UP.

109
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,879
WE STOOD BACK TO BACK

110
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,297
AND PRETTY SOON
THE OTHERS DECIDED

111
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,176
MY SENSE OF HUMOR
WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL.

112
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,511
I THANKED THE MAN,
AND HE JUST GRINNED

113
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:31,432
AND SAID,
"I LIKE A GOOD FIGHT."

114
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,895
HE WAS MY FRIEND
FROM THAT MOMENT ON.

115
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,438
AND HE KEPT FIGHTING
THE GOOD FIGHT

116
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,648
RIGHT UP TO THE END.

117
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,363
I'LL MISS HIM.

118
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,576
ENSIGN.

119
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,468
CAPTAIN, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

120
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,054
OF COURSE.

121
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,056
NOW THAT THE KAZON
HAVE STEPPED UP THEIR ATTACKS

122
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,433
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT WE
ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT OUT OF
HERE ALIVE.

123
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,229
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU HAVE
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

124
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,856
IS THERE ANYTHING<i> YOU</i>
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

125
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,151
I ASSURE YOU, YOU
CAN SPEAK FREELY.

126
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,362
I'D GIVE THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.

127
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,239
I'LL GIVE THEM THE REPLICATORS
AND THE TRANSPORTERS

128
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,157
AND WHATEVER ELSE
IT IS THEY'RE AFTER.

129
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,910
I'M SURE YOU REALIZE THAT
WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF...

130
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,413
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE

131
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,998
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE FEDERATION IS 70,000
LIGHT YEARS AWAY.

132
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,499
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO

133
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,668
TO EACH OTHER
WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY?

134
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,046
I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERNS, CREWMAN

135
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,632
BUT LET ME MAKE IT
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR--

136
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,301
I'LL DESTROY THIS SHIP

137
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,137
BEFORE I TURN ANY PART OF IT
OVER TO THE KAZON.

138
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,061
SO THAT'S HOW THE MAQUIS
WOULD DO IT, HMM?

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,653
IT'S ALL RIGHT, COMMANDER.

140
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,904
I KNOW HOGAN'S UPSET.

141
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,114
HE AND BENDERA WERE CLOSE.

142
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,449
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY HE THINKS

143
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,908
WE SHOULD GIVE THE KAZON
WHAT THEY WANT.

144
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,119
I THINK I'VE MADE MY
POSITION CLEAR ON THAT.

145
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,163
YOU HAVE, BUT A LOT
OF THE CREW FEEL

146
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,165
THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE
TO VOICE THEIR OPINIONS.

147
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,041
THIS ISN'T A DEMOCRACY,
CHAKOTAY.

148
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,002
I CAN'T RUN THIS
SHIP BY CONSENSUS.

149
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,253
A LOT OF THE MAQUIS FEEL

150
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,713
THE FEDERATION
ABANDONED THEM YEARS AGO.

151
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,425
YOU MAY BE WILLING TO DIE
FOR FEDERATION PRINCIPLES

152
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,093
BUT THEY'RE NOT.

153
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,095
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D
SUPPORT THAT MAN'S POSITION.

154
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,389
I DON'T,
BUT ISN'T THERE SOMETHING

155
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,475
IN BETWEEN
YOUR POSITION AND HIS?

156
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,063
DECK THREE.
ALL I'M SAYING, CAPTAIN,

157
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,399
IS THAT MAYBE THERE'S
A LITTLE ROOM FOR FLEXIBILITY

158
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,776
IN INTERPRETING
STARFLEET'S PROTOCOLS.

159
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,363
FRANKLY, I'M NOT SURE
THEY WERE EVER INTENDED
FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

160
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,281
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EVIDENCE
THAT THEY'VE LET US DOWN.

161
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:55,076
MAYBE THIS SITUATION WITH
THE KAZON IS THE FIRST EXAMPLE.

162
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,744
MAYBE WE HAVE TO EXAMINE
STARFLEET'S PRINCIPLES

163
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,621
WITH A COLD EYE
AND ASK OURSELVES

164
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,790
IF THEY'RE REALLY
APPLICABLE HERE.

165
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,085
COMPUTER, HOLD TURBOLIFT.

166
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,130
COMMANDER, IF YOU HAVE
A SPECIFIC SUGGESTION

167
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,965
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO MAKE IT.

168
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,010
MAKE A DEAL--

169
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,054
AN ALLIANCE.

170
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,514
WITH THE KAZON?

171
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,432
WITH ONE OF THEIR FACTIONS,
OR TWO.

172
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,810
IF WE HAD THE OGLA
AND THE RELORA AS OUR ALLIES

173
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,479
THE OTHERS WOULD BE AFRAID
TO TOUCH US.

174
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,272
NOTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
WITH THE KAZON

175
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,773
WOULD LEAD ME TO BELIEVE
THEY'RE TRUSTWORTHY.

176
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,901
I CAN'T IMAGINE MAKING
A DEAL WITH THEM.

177
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,486
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

178
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,612
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
YOUR IMAGINATION IS LIMITED

179
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,990
BY STARFLEET PROTOCOLS.

180
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,951
AS CAPTAIN, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR MAKING DECISIONS

181
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,204
IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF YOUR CREW

182
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,082
AND I THINK YOU HAVE
TO ASK YOURSELF...

183
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,958
IF YOU'RE DOING THAT.

184
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,972
(<i> door beeps</i> )

185
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,266
COME IN.

186
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,604
CAPTAIN.

187
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,106
THIS IS UNEXPECTED.

188
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,400
I'VE BEEN IN YOUR
QUARTERS BEFORE.

189
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,402
INDEED, BUT SO RARELY

190
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,946
THAT I CAN REMEMBER
EACH INSTANCE.

191
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,073
VULCAN SPICE TEA-- HOT.

192
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,910
AND IT WAS ALWAYS AT
A TIME WHEN YOU WERE

193
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,620
PARTICULARLY TROUBLED.

194
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,038
RIGHT, AS USUAL.

195
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,749
THANK YOU.

196
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,585
COMMANDER CHAKOTAY
HAS PROPOSED

197
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,963
THAT WE MAKE AN ALLIANCE
WITH ONE OF THE KAZON FACTIONS.

198
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,174
WE WOULDN'T GIVE THEM
WEAPONS OR TECHNOLOGY

199
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,926
BUT WE WOULD PLEDGE
TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THEM

200
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,886
IF THEY'RE ATTACKED.

201
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,264
I AM SURE THAT MADE
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.

202
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,557
HOW CAN I CONSIDER IT?

203
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,976
I CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY
FROM THE PRECEPTS

204
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,769
STARFLEET HAS LAID OUT
FOR US--

205
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,064
YOU DON'T DEAL WITH OUTLAWS;
YOU DON'T INVOLVE YOURSELF

206
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,358
IN THE POLITICAL MACHINATIONS
OF OTHER CULTURES.

207
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,568
IT GOES AGAINST
EVERYTHING I BELIEVE,

208
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,860
EVERYTHING I'VE TRAINED FOR,

209
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,780
EVERYTHING EXPERIENCE
HAS TAUGHT ME.

210
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,031
QUITE RIGHT.

211
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,200
DO I HEAR
A "HOWEVER" COMING?

212
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,662
YOU ARE PERCEPTIVE, CAPTAIN.

213
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,791
I BELIEVE COMMANDER
CHAKOTAY'S SUGGESTION
DOES HAVE MERIT.

214
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,127
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT.

215
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,129
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN,
A GREAT VISIONARY

216
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,257
NAMED SPOCK RECOMMENDED AN
ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE FEDERATION

217
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,176
AND THE KLINGON EMPIRE.

218
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,303
THIS PRODUCED A MAJOR DISPUTE.

219
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,222
THE KLINGONS, AFTER ALL,
WERE OUTLAWS

220
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,352
EMPLOYING VIOLENCE AND BRUTALITY
IN ORDER TO BUILD THEIR EMPIRE.

221
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,396
I MYSELF SPOKE OUT
AGAINST SUCH A COALITION.

222
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,315
BUT THE ALLIANCE WAS FORGED,

223
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,150
AND IT BROUGHT A STABILITY
TO THE QUADRANT

224
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,402
THAT HAD NOT BEEN THERE
FOR 200 YEARS.

225
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,281
SPOCK'S SUGGESTION,
SO CONTROVERSIAL AT FIRST,

226
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,659
PROVED TO BE THE CORNERSTONE
OF PEACE.

227
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,286
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES HERE.

228
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,372
BY ALLYING OURSELVES
TO ONE FACTION.

229
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,706
WE'D BE GIVING THAT FACTION
MORE POWER THAN THE OTHERS.

230
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:52,253
THAT WOULD CLEARLY AFFECT
THE INTERNAL POLITICS
OF ALL THE KAZON.

231
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,005
I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN.

232
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,217
BUT REMEMBER, IT WOULD ONLY BE
A TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENT,

233
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,468
SINCE WE ARE ON OUR WAY

234
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,053
OUT OF THIS QUADRANT.

235
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,262
IN THE MEANTIME,

236
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,682
IT MIGHT BRING STABILITY
TO THE REGION

237
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,225
AND SECURITY FOR US.

238
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,352
ONCE WE'RE GONE,

239
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,270
THEY'LL PROBABLY GO BACK
TO THEIR INFIGHTING.

240
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,190
PERHAPS.

241
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,234
BUT EVEN TEMPORARY STABILITY

242
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,403
CAN BRING AN APPRECIATION
FOR PEACE.

243
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,950
THIS FLOWER
IS A RARE HYBRID.

244
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,663
AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT EXISTS
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE GALAXY.

245
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,956
I CREATED IT BY
GRAFTING A CUTTING

246
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:33,378
FROM A SOUTH AMERICAN ORCHID
ONTO A VULCAN<i> FAVANIT</i> PLANT.

247
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,171
I DOUBTED THE GRAFT
WOULD TAKE.

248
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,425
AND INDEED, THE PLANT
WAS SICKLY AT FIRST.

249
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,219
HOWEVER, AFTER
A FEW WEEKS,

250
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,222
BOTH PLANTS ADAPTED
TO THEIR NEW CONDITION

251
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,474
AND, IN FACT,
BECAME STRONGER

252
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,560
THAN EITHER
HAD BEEN ALONE.

253
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:56,359
CONSEQUENTLY,
AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION,

254
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:00,779
I'VE DECIDED TO SEEK AN ALLIANCE
WITH ONE OF THE KAZON FACTIONS.

255
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,657
CAPTAIN, YOU
CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

256
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,158
THIS GOES AGAINST...
ENSIGN...

257
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,369
I'LL BE GLAD TO DISCUSS
MY REASONING WITH YOU

258
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,246
AT A MORE APPROPRIATE TIME.

259
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,624
HOWEVER, THIS MEETING IS
NOT TO DEBATE THE DECISION,

260
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,709
BUT TO DECIDE
HOW TO PURSUE IT.

261
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,961
CAPTAIN... IF I MAY.

262
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,421
YES, MR. NEELIX.

263
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,258
WE'RE NOT FAR FROM A
PLANET KNOWN AS SOBRAS,

264
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,469
WHERE THERE'S A
KAZON SETTLEMENT

265
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,013
INHABITED BY A FACTION
KNOWN AS THE POMMAR.

266
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,307
I HAVE AN ACQUAINTANCE
THERE--

267
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,767
SOMEONE WHO OWES
ME SOME FAVORS.

268
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,311
SOME RATHER LARGE FAVORS,
ACTUALLY.

269
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,771
PERHAPS I COULD
MEET WITH HIM

270
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,105
AND SOUND HIM OUT.

271
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,441
IS HE AUTHORIZED TO
SPEAK FOR HIS MAJE?

272
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,651
NOT EXACTLY,

273
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,320
BUT HE DOES HAVE
THE MAJE'S EAR.

274
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,988
THIS WOULD BE
STRICTLY INFORMAL,

275
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,408
BUT IT MIGHT
GIVE US A READING
ON THE POSSIBILITY

276
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,452
WITHOUT THE RISK OF
ACTUAL CONFRONTATION.

277
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,953
GOOD IDEA.

278
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,205
PROCEED, MR. NEELIX.

279
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,958
WHY DON'T WE JUST
CONTACT SESKA AND
FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH HER?

280
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,461
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

281
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,087
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING.

282
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,381
NOT AT ALL.
SESKA HAS BEEN TRYING

283
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,342
TO FORGE AN ALLIANCE
AMONG THE KAZON.

284
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,968
SHE WOULD JUMP AT THE CHANCE
TO GET OUR SUPPORT.

285
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,304
SHE'S RIGHT.
IF WE WENT THROUGH SESKA

286
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,389
AT LEAST WE COULD ALLY OURSELVES
WITH THE NISTRIM.

287
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,932
I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA.

288
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,644
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS, COMMANDER.

289
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,437
IF YOU WANT TO GET IN
THE MUD WITH THE KAZON

290
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,773
YOU CAN'T START COMPLAINING
THAT YOU MIGHT GET DIRTY.

291
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,984
FINE. I'LL TALK WITH SESKA.

292
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,277
NO.

293
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,946
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
TOO MUCH WITH HER.

294
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,866
MR. NEELIX, PREPARE TO TAKE
YOUR SHUTTLE TO SOBRAS.

295
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,829
IN THE MEANTIME, I'LL
MAKE CONTACT WITH SESKA.

296
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,289
DISMISSED.

297
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,672
(<i> sighs</i> )

298
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,180
CAPTAIN'S LOG, STARDATE 49337.4.

299
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,765
AFTER SENDING A SUBSPACE MESSAGE

300
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,017
TO SESKA
AND THE NISTRIM MAJE CULLAH,

301
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,228
WE HAVE A RECEIVED
A QUICK RESPONSE.

302
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,605
Captain Janeway.

303
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,400
Commander Chakotay.

304
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,569
I must say we were surprised
to hear from you.

305
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,696
ARE YOU WILLING
TO MEET WITH US?

306
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,364
You've made
an interesting proposal.

307
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,075
I've discussed it with Seska,

308
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,368
and she assures me
that you would not make

309
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,954
this gesture
unless you were sincere.

310
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,248
I will talk with you.

311
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,083
I SUGGEST WE RENDEZVOUS.

312
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,752
WE'LL TRANSMIT COORDINATES
TO YOU.

313
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,420
If you don't mind, Captain,

314
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,088
we'd prefer
to choose the coordinates.

315
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,758
FINE. TRANSMIT THEM TO US.

316
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,844
We'll meet in approximately
20 hours.

317
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,429
I must say, Captain,

318
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,767
I look forward
to this opportunity.

319
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:49,073
(<i> sultry jazz playing</i> )

320
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,006
HELLO, MY FRIENDS.

321
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,551
PLEASE, DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT.

322
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,725
I WAS HOPING TO FIND
MY GOOD FRIEND JAL TERSA HERE.

323
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,561
HAS HE BEEN IN TONIGHT?

324
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,940
THANK YOU.

325
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,078
TERSA, MY FRIEND.

326
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,288
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS

327
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,581
SNEAKING UP
ON A MAN LIKE THAT.

328
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,541
I'D NEVER DREAM
OF SNEAKING UP ON YOU

329
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,627
BUT YOU WERE
SO ENGROSSED IN...

330
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,086
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE DOING...

331
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,881
A PUZZLE.

332
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,716
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE,
TALAXIAN?

333
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,343
I'M GOOD AT PUZZLES.

334
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,845
PERHAPS I COULD HELP.

335
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,721
THE DANCER SHOWED IT TO ME.

336
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,055
BY MOVING ONLY TWO RODS,

337
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,976
THIS DODECAHEDRON
CAN BECOME AN ICOSAHEDRON.

338
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,312
SHE SAID SHE'D SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH THE MAN WHO COULD SOLVE IT.

339
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,772
(<i> growls</i> )

340
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:07,735
A SPLENDID MOTIVATION,
TO BE SURE.

341
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,279
I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE

342
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,114
TO MAKE YOUR NIGHT
A MEMORABLE ONE.

343
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,741
YOU KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THIS?

344
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,702
I MIGHT...

345
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,037
IF YOU'LL HEAR ME OUT FIRST.

346
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:25,670
MY FORTUNE'S HAVE CHANGED
SINCE WE LAST MET, TERSA.

347
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,757
I'VE BECOME A PERSON OF
SOME INFLUENCE ABOARD A
STARSHIP KNOWN AS<i> VOYAGER.</i>

348
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,133
(<i> sighs</i> )

349
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,511
YOU MUST THINK US VERY ISOLATED.

350
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,137
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

351
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,724
IT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY REASON
YOU WERE ALLOWED IN HERE,

352
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,726
ESPECIALLY AFTER LAST TIME.

353
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,978
OUCH.

354
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,731
A SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDING.

355
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:49,819
UH... TERSA, I KNOW YOU HAVE
THE EAR OF YOUR FIRST MAJE,

356
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,612
AS I DO OF OUR CAPTAIN.

357
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,907
WE COULD BE QUITE USEFUL
TO BOTH OF THEM.

358
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,658
GO ON.

359
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,203
MY CAPTAIN IS INTERESTED IN
TALKING TO YOUR MAJE

360
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,956
TO DISCUSS A POSSIBLE ALLIANCE.

361
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,918
DO YOU THINK HE'D HAVE
ANY INTEREST IN SUCH A MEETING?

362
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,753
AN ALLIANCE?

363
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,546
BETWEEN THE KAZON-POMMAR
AND THE FEDERATIONS?

364
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,716
AN INTERESTING THOUGHT,
ISN'T IT?

365
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,467
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

366
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,135
TERSA, EXPLAIN TO THEM.

367
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,055
WE'RE FRIENDS.
I HAVE NO IDEA

368
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,305
WHO THIS PERSON IS.

369
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,099
SOME LUNATIC WHO SAT DOWN

370
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,851
AND STARTED BABBLING.

371
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,479
I GUESS YOU'LL BE SPENDING
THE NIGHT ALONE.

372
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,198
YOU'VE MADE A GOOD CHOICE.

373
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,993
THE NISTRIM WILL BE
A POTENT ALLY.

374
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,622
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE NISTRIM
WILL ALSO BE AN HONORABLE ALLY,

375
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,375
THAT YOU'LL ADHERE
TO THE CONDITIONS
WE ESTABLISH.

376
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,628
YOU CAN LET
ALL THE KAZON FACTIONS KNOW

377
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,130
THAT<i> VOYAGER</i> HAS FORMED
A COALITION WITH YOU

378
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,506
AND WILL BE AN ALLY

379
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,009
TO ANY NISTRIM SHIP
OR OUTPOST WE ENCOUNTER.

380
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,137
IN ADDITION, WE'RE PREPARED
TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SUPPLIES

381
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,556
WHEN NEEDED--
FOOD, MEDICINE, CLOTHING.

382
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,808
WHAT WE WILL NOT PROVIDE

383
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,226
IS ANY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY
OR WEAPONRY.

384
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,562
UNDERSTOOD.

385
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,274
JUST ONE OTHER DETAIL...

386
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,610
AN EXCHANGE OF CREW MEMBERS.

387
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,528
AN EXCHANGE?

388
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,947
YES.

389
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,698
I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE
THAT OUR ALLIANCE

390
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,327
SHOULD REPRESENT
A GENUINE PARTNERSHIP.

391
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,454
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
DEFINE THAT.

392
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,789
IT'S OBVIOUS.

393
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,333
FEDERATION CREW ON MY SHIP.

394
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,419
NISTRIM CREW ON YOURS.

395
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,007
MAJE, I THINK THAT'S A DETAIL
WE COULD WORK OUT LATER.

396
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,215
I CAN ASSURE YOU

397
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,551
THAT I WOULD NEVER AGREE
TO THAT.

398
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,930
IT SEEMS A NATURAL EXTENSION
OF YOUR OWN PROPOSAL.

399
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,431
WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE
EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.

400
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,226
<i>I</i> WILL DETERMINE
WHAT WE DECIDE AND WHEN.

401
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,647
YES, MAJE.

402
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:54,276
I WON'T HAVE A WOMAN
DICTATE TERMS TO ME.

403
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,030
CULLAH...

404
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,324
I FOUND THE IDEA OF
AN ALLIANCE WITH
YOU DISTASTEFUL.

405
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,202
I WAS WILLING TO EXPLORE
THE POSSIBILITY

406
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,831
BUT NOW I SEE MY INSTINCTS
WERE DEAD ON.

407
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,958
TALK TO HER.

408
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,751
TELL HER
TO BE REASONABLE.

409
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,795
THIS MEETING IS OVER.

410
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,681
AS SOON AS YOUR MAJE LEARNS
I'M BEING IMPRISONED

411
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,932
HE'LL BE OUTRAGED!

412
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,475
HURRY UP.
HE WON'T LOOK KINDLY

413
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,602
ON ANYONE WHO'S MADE
SUCH AN EGREGIOUS ERROR.

414
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,439
WHAT ARE YOU CHARGING ME WITH?!

415
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,150
HOW LONG WILL I BE HELD?

416
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,693
MOVE.

417
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:39,113
I ASSUME YOU'LL AT LEAST LET ME
CONFER WITH COUNSEL.

418
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,449
I HAVE THE ABILITY
TO REWARD HANDSOMELY ANYONE

419
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,244
WHO SHOWS ME
A BIT OF UNDERSTANDING.

420
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,579
(<i> crying</i> )

421
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,497
IS THAT A BABY?

422
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,352
MY NAME IS NEELIX.

423
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,147
I-I'M TALAXIAN.

424
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,233
I'M MABUS.

425
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,777
MY FRIENDS AND I ARE TRABE.

426
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,281
THEY HURT YOU.

427
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,119
I WASN'T WALKING
QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR THEM.

428
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,494
LET'S GET
THE BLEEDING STOPPED.

429
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,748
THEN I'LL CLEAN IT.

430
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,750
WHY ARE THEY
HOLDING YOU?

431
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,128
THEY SEEM TO BE DETAINING
ANYONE WHO ISN'T KAZON.

432
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,797
SEVERAL OF OUR GROUP
HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR QUESTIONING,

433
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,174
BUT SO FAR, NONE OF THEM
HAVE COME BACK.

434
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,218
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

435
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,469
FIVE DAYS.

436
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,889
THEY ATTACKED US IN SPACE.

437
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,225
20 OF OUR GROUP DIED.

438
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,102
WE'VE LOST NINE MORE
SINCE THEY PUT US IN PRISON

439
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,937
INCLUDING MOST OF
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL.

440
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,647
I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

441
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,565
THE KAZON WON'T BE SATISFIED

442
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,651
UNTIL YOU'VE ALL
BEEN ANNIHILATED.

443
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,404
IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING,
IT'S HOW TO SURVIVE.

444
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,740
DID YOU NOTICE
HOW MANY GUARDS THEY HAVE POSTED

445
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,284
AT THE ENTRANCE
TO THE PRISON?

446
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,828
ONLY TWO.
I GUESS THEY ASSUME

447
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,081
THIS PLACE IS SO SECURE
THEY DON'T NEED ANY MORE.

448
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,291
WHY DO YOU ASK?

449
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,541
WE DON'T PLAN TO SIT HERE

450
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,795
WHILE THEY KILL US ONE BY ONE.

451
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,297
WE WERE ABLE
TO GET A MESSAGE THROUGH

452
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:22,216
TO ANOTHER TRABE VESSEL
BEFORE WE WERE BOARDED.

453
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:26,179
HELP IS ON THE WAY.

454
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,181
CAN WE COUNT ON YOU?

455
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,227
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG, SUPPLEMENTAL.</i>

456
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,813
<i>WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO RENDEZVOUS</i>
<i>WITH MR. NEELIX.</i>

457
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,773
<i>I CAN ONLY HOPE</i>
<i>THAT HE HAD MORE LUCK</i>

458
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,608
<i>WITH THE KAZON THAN WE DID.</i>

459
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,986
CAPTAIN, WE'RE APPROACHING
THE COORDINATES.

460
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,697
ALL STOP.

461
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,406
I DON'T SEE ANY TRACE OF HIM.

462
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,327
LONG-RANGE SENSORS INDICATE
NO SIGN OF MR. NEELIX'S SHUTTLE

463
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,578
WITHIN A RADIUS
OF TWO LIGHT YEARS.

464
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,248
THE KAZON HAVE HIM.

465
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,791
WE CANNOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

466
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,211
HE MAY SIMPLY HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

467
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,048
WE'LL HOLD POSITION HERE
FOR TWO HOURS.

468
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:07,011
IF HE HASN'T SHOWN UP BY THEN,
WE'LL GO TO SOBRAS.

469
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,484
LIEUTENANT, COULD YOU
FILL US IN A LITTLE?

470
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,362
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF RUMORS
FLYING AROUND

471
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,113
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE KAZON.

472
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,865
NOTHING'S GOING ON YET.

473
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,951
THE CAPTAIN'S TALK
WITH SESKA FELL APART
PRETTY QUICKLY.

474
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,913
NOTHING'S GOING
TO COME OF ALL THIS.

475
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,581
B'ELANNA,
YOU WERE SESKA'S FRIEND.

476
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,708
COULDN'T YOU GET WORD TO HER?
TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT.

477
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,252
NO, I COULDN'T.

478
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,754
I DON'T UNDERSTAND...
HOGAN, IT'S GONE TOO FAR.

479
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,341
SESKA ISN'T THE PERSON
WE THOUGHT SHE WAS.

480
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,385
I DON'T TRUST HER ANYMORE.

481
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:51,347
EVEN IF IT MEANS
US GETTING HOME IN ONE PIECE.

482
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,807
OR DO YOU AGREE
WITH OUR CAPTAIN

483
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,185
THAT HOLDING ON TO OUR
TECHNOLOGY IS WORTH DYING FOR?

484
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,478
WHO ARE YOU TO BE
SECOND-GUESSING
CAPTAIN JANEWAY?

485
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,022
THE HARDEST THING YOU
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

486
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,774
IS KEEPING THAT
DILITHIUM CHAMBER FILLED.

487
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,525
SHE IS DOING THE BEST
SHE CAN TO GET US HOME.

488
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,985
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE
THE WAY SHE'S DOING IT

489
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,904
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

490
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,824
IS THAT CLEAR?

491
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,286
PERFECTLY.

492
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,420
SOME OF THE CHILDREN
ARE TOO WEAK TO RUN.

493
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,921
WE'LL HAVE
TO CARRY THEM.

494
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,839
WE COULD USE ANOTHER
PAIR OF STRONG ARMS.

495
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,425
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

496
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,219
I CAN'T PROMISE
WE'LL GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE,

497
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,388
BUT IF WE STAY HERE,
WE'LL DIE ANYWAY.

498
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,974
I'D RATHER GO OUT
FIGHTING, MYSELF.

499
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,728
THAT ONE
MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.

500
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,440
HE'S THE KIND
THAT'LL START SHOOTING

501
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,732
AT THE FIRST SIGN
OF TROUBLE.

502
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,776
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

503
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,778
(<i> distant shouting</i> )

504
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,117
THIS MAY BE IT.
BE READY.

505
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,746
STAY BACK.

506
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,261
GET BACK!

507
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,305
AGAINST THE WALLS.

508
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,733
NOW! LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
COME ON. COME ON, EVERYONE.

509
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,068
LET'S GO. COME ON.

510
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,700
COME ON.

511
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,494
NICE WORK, MY FRIENDS.
LET'S GO.

512
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,998
LET'S GO.

513
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,506
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
WE'RE GOING AFTER HIM.

514
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,883
MR. PARIS, SET A COURSE
FOR SOBRAS, FULL IMPULSE.

515
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,385
TUVOK, ARM THE PHASER BANKS

516
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,969
AND LOAD THE FORWARD
TORPEDO BAYS.

517
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,514
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE KAZON
HAVE IN STORE FOR US.

518
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,890
SHIELDS AT FULL POWER.

519
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,934
YELLOW ALERT.
ALL HANDS AT THE READY.

520
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,228
CAPTAIN.

521
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,896
WHAT IS IT?
SHIPS.

522
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,981
KAZON SHIPS
ON LONG-RANGE SENSORS.

523
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,233
CLOSING FAST.

524
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,984
CONFIRMED, CAPTAIN.

525
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,486
ON SCREEN.

526
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,781
Tuvok:
IT APPEARS TO BE AN ARMADA,
AND THEIR WEAPONS

527
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,200
ARE POWERED.

528
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,784
RED ALERT.

529
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,005
POWER ALL WEAPONS SYSTEMS
AND STAND READY.

530
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,340
MR. KIM,

531
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,674
HAIL THE LEAD SHIP.

532
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,093
THEY'RE HAILING US, CAPTAIN.

533
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,429
I'LL PUT IT ON SCREEN.

534
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,180
Hello, Captain.

535
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,558
I'd like you to meet
my good friend Mabus.

536
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,643
We've just escaped
from the Kazon Pommar.

537
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,354
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON A KAZON SHIP?

538
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,231
They're Trabe vessels actually.

539
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:50,192
Everything the Kazon have,
they stole from the Trabe.

540
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,944
Mabus will tell you
all about it

541
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,653
over a sumptuous dinner.

542
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,155
The food hasn't been
very good

543
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,574
where we've been.

544
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,201
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

545
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,916
I WAS 8 YEARS OLD
WHEN IT STARTED.

546
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:10,379
I WASN'T EVEN
PARTICULARLY AWARE OF THE KAZON.

547
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,089
THEY LIVED
IN RESTRICTED AREAS

548
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,842
THAT CHILDREN
WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO NEAR.

549
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:21,974
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY
IN LIVED POVERTY, THE FILTH...

550
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:28,397
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE
PERSECUTED BY THE TRABE POLICE.

551
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,443
I WAS TOLD THEY WERE VIOLENT
AND DANGEROUS,

552
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,236
AND HAD TO BE KEPT ISOLATED

553
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,072
SO THEY WOULDN'T GET LOOSE
AND KILL US,

554
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,907
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT THEY DID.

555
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,118
BUT WE BROUGHT IT
ON OURSELVES.

556
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,036
THE TRABE TREATED THEM
LIKE ANIMALS--

557
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,499
FENCED THEM IN, ENCOURAGED THEM
TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES

558
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,376
SO THEY WOULDN'T TURN ON US

559
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:54,089
AND SAT BY WHILE THEY TURNED
INTO A VIOLENT, ANGRY ARMY.

560
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,966
WHEN THEY FINALLY REALIZED
WE WERE THEIR TRUE ENEMY

561
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,427
WE DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

562
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,137
I WAS LUCKIER THAN MOST.

563
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,763
A FRIEND'S FATHER GRABBED ME
AND TOOK ME AND HIS FAMILY

564
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,057
TO ONE OF THE STARSHIPS
THAT MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

565
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,476
I CAN STILL REMEMBER...

566
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,645
IT HAPPENED SO FAST.

567
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,606
ONE MINUTE...

568
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,733
I WAS A HAPPY CHILD
PLAYING IN A FIELD;

569
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,488
THE NEXT, AN ORPHAN,
EXILED IN SPACE.

570
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,324
IT STRIKES ME

571
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,952
THAT IN MANY WAYS, WE'RE
IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT--

572
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,622
SEPARATED FROM THE LIVES
THAT WE KNEW,

573
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,457
SEARCHING FOR HOME.

574
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,671
A GOAL YOU MAY WELL ACHIEVE,
CAPTAIN

575
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,548
BUT THE KAZON HAVE REFUSED
TO ALLOW US TO FIND

576
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,923
A NEW HOME WORLD.

577
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,592
EVERY TIME WE TRY
TO SETTLE SOMEWHERE,

578
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,511
THEY ATTACK AND DRIVE US AWAY.

579
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:45,349
WE'RE SCATTERED, LIKE NOMADS,
WITH NO HOME AND LITTLE HOPE.

580
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,647
IT HAPPENED
OVER 30 YEARS AGO

581
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,649
AND THE KAZON ARE STILL
TRYING TO PUNISH YOU?

582
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,110
REMARKABLE, ISN'T IT?

583
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,279
MOST OF THE TRABE
WHO PERSECUTED THE KAZON

584
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,616
ARE EITHER DEAD
OR OLD MEN BY NOW.

585
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:06,286
MOST OF US WERE CHILDREN
WHEN THE UPRISING OCCURRED,

586
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,581
AND OUR CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT.

587
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:13,669
BUT THE KAZON'S DESIRE FOR
REVENGE IS AS STRONG AS EVER.

588
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,678
How are you able to transmit to
us without your crew knowing it?

589
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,597
THAT'S FOR ME TO WORRY ABOUT.

590
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:28,808
LET'S JUST SAY I'M VERY FAMILIAR
WITH COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS.

591
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,937
NOW, WILL YOU LET ME
TALK TO SESKA?

592
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,856
Not without some proof
you can be trusted.

593
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,109
SHE AND I KNEW EACH OTHER
FOR A LONG TIME.

594
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,818
SHE KNOWS THAT I CAN BE TRUSTED.

595
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,613
JUST LET ME TALK TO HER.

596
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,406
I will convey your message.

597
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,949
Contact me tomorrow,
and I'll let you know

598
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,660
if she's willing to talk to you.

599
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,164
(<i> sighs</i> )

600
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,254
Neelix:
BEFORE THE UPRISING

601
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,132
THE TRABE WERE KNOWN
AS A HIGHLY-EVOLVED SPECIES.

602
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,343
THEY PRODUCED SCHOLARS
AND ARTISTS WHO WERE
WIDELY ADMIRED

603
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,472
AND THEIR TECHNOLOGY WAS AMONG
THE FINEST IN THE QUADRANT.

604
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,267
NO ONE REALLY KNEW
ABOUT THE KAZON

605
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,394
AND HOW THEY WERE BEING TREATED.
WHY NOT?

606
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,480
HOLDING ANOTHER CULTURE
IN VIRTUAL SLAVERY

607
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,523
ISN'T THE KIND OF THING
THAT WOULD GO UNNOTICED.

608
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,024
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

609
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,152
THE TRABE WERE RICH
AND POWERFUL.

610
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,695
THEY MANIPULATED INFORMATION

611
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,530
ABOUT THE CONDITIONS
ON THEIR PLANET,

612
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,782
AND NO ONE WANTED TO RISK
OFFENDING THEM

613
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,618
AND LOSING OPPORTUNITIES
FOR TRADE.

614
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,703
IT SEEMS TO ME THEY'VE
LEARNED THEIR LESSON.

615
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,913
MABUS AND HIS PEOPLE
HAVE FREELY ACKNOWLEDGED

616
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,124
THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.

617
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,209
Tuvok:
STILL, I DO NOT SEE THAT

618
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,587
IT IS A PARTICULARLY GOOD
IDEA TO FORM AN ALLIANCE

619
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,046
WITH THE BLOOD ENEMIES
OF THE KAZON.

620
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,716
WE RISK UNITING
ALL THE FACTIONS AGAINST US.

621
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,843
THE ONLY THING
THE KAZON AGREE ON NOW

622
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,304
IS THAT WE
ARE THEIR COMMON ENEMY.

623
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,389
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
IT GETTING MUCH WORSE.

624
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,641
THE TRABE HAVE A
LOT OF SHIPS

625
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,476
AND A LOT OF WEAPONS
IN THAT CONVOY.

626
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,145
I THINK THIS ALLIANCE WOULD BE
BETTER THAN NONE AT ALL.

627
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,522
I'D RATHER NOT BE
IN THE POSITION

628
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,023
OF MAKING AN ALLIANCE AT ALL,

629
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,735
BUT THAT MAY BE A LUXURY
WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE.

630
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:06,865
MY GUT TELLS ME WE DON'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS AMONG THE KAZON.

631
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,660
AS FOR THE TRABE, I BELIEVE

632
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,620
THAT PEOPLE HAVE
A CAPACITY TO CHANGE.

633
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,288
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
STARFLEET'S POLICY

634
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,456
TO DEAL WITH NEW SPECIES

635
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,417
ON A BASIS OF OPENNESS
AND TRUST...

636
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,711
UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE.

637
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:27,344
CAPTAIN,
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

638
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,180
I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE
USE OF YOUR MEDICAL FACILITIES.

639
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,807
WE HAVE
VERY FEW DOCTORS.

640
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,685
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE
IN GENERALLY GOOD CONDITION.

641
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,520
MALNUTRITION
IS THE MOST COMMON PROBLEM

642
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,731
BUT IT'S EASILY ALLEVIATED
WITH BIO-NUTRIENT SUPPLEMENTS.

643
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,107
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU NEED?

644
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,402
I'D SAY LESS THAN AN HOUR.

645
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,778
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME?

646
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,488
OF COURSE.

647
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,077
I'VE BEEN THINKING...

648
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,787
ABOUT OUR CONVERSATION
AT DINNER.

649
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,331
MM-HMM.
ABOUT THE THINGS WE SHARE,

650
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,708
AND IT SEEMS TO ME

651
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,752
WE COULD BE OF MUTUAL
BENEFIT TO EACH OTHER.

652
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,961
GO ON.

653
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,463
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO THE POSSIBILITY

654
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,006
OF OUR JOINING FORCES--

655
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,926
MY STARSHIP AND YOUR CONVOY.

656
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,928
CLEARLY WE'D BE A STRONGER
FORCE IF WE DID THAT.

657
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,221
WE COULD TRAVEL TOGETHER
FOR AS LONG

658
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,557
AS IT'S ADVANTAGEOUS
TO BOTH OF US.

659
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,727
MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUR WAY
OUT OF KAZON TERRITORY,

660
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,437
AND YOU COULD SETTLE
ON A NEW HOME WORLD.

661
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,979
IT'S A REASONABLE IDEA,
CAPTAIN.

662
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,732
I HAVE NO OBJECTION.

663
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,817
BUT IT WOULD ONLY BENEFIT
YOUR GROUP AND MINE.

664
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:27,654
THERE ARE OTHER TRABE
WHO WOULDN'T ENJOY
THE SAME PROTECTION.

665
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,197
I WONDER...

666
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,325
IF YOU MIGHT CONSIDER
A SOMEWHAT MORE... BOLD PLAN.

667
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,993
TELL ME.

668
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,662
TOGETHER, THE<i> VOYAGER</i>
AND THE TRABE

669
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,122
WOULD BE A FORCE
TO BE RECKONED WITH.

670
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,124
SUPPOSE WE TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THAT

671
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,375
AND ASKED
THE REPRESENTATIVES

672
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,043
OF ALL THE KAZON FACTIONS

673
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,963
TO JOIN US
AT THE BARGAINING TABLE.

674
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,924
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE WHAT?

675
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:51,010
PEACE. TOGETHER
WE WOULD REPRESENT
A STABILIZING FORCE

676
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,262
IN THIS PART
OF THE QUADRANT--

677
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,722
BRING THE FACTIONS TOGETHER.

678
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,224
CONVINCE THEM THAT
AN END TO VIOLENCE

679
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,811
WOULD BE IN EVERYONE'S
BEST INTEREST.

680
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,353
THINK ABOUT IT.

681
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,355
I BELIEVE IT COULD WORK.

682
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,234
IT'S A MESSAGE FROM<i> VOYAGER.</i>

683
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,905
THEY'VE FORMED AN ALLIANCE...
WITH THE TRABE!

684
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,031
THE TRABE?

685
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,619
THEY'RE CALLING FOR A CONFERENCE
OF ALL FIRST MAJES.

686
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,037
HOW COULD THIS
HAVE HAPPENED?

687
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,916
IT HAPPENED BECAUSE
YOU LET<i> VOYAGER</i> SLIP AWAY

688
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,168
RIGHT INTO THE HANDS
OF THE TRABE BY INSISTING

689
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,087
ON THAT RIDICULOUS
EXCHANGE OF CREWS.

690
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,715
I COULD NOT LET
THE NEGOTIATIONS

691
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,384
BE DICTATED BY THAT WOMAN.

692
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,346
THAT'S BECOMING
A TIRED REFRAIN, CULLAH.

693
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,348
ONE DAY THAT ATTITUDE
WILL BE YOUR UNDOING.

694
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,308
WATCH YOUR TONGUE.

695
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,228
OR WHAT?

696
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,564
I'M CARRYING YOUR CHILD.

697
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,984
I DON'T THINK YOU'D DO ANYTHING
TO JEOPARDIZE HIM.

698
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,447
WE CAN STILL TURN THIS
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

699
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,824
WE HAVE A CREWMAN ON<i> VOYAGER</i>

700
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,576
WHO'S WILLING TO PROVIDE
INFORMATION TO US.

701
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,329
THERE'S LONG-TERM POTENTIAL
IN THAT ARRANGEMENT.

702
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,039
WE MUSTN'T LOSE SIGHT OF IT.

703
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,417
YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING
WE<i> GO</i> TO THIS CONFERENCE--

704
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,503
THAT WE COME RUNNING
LIKE A CALOGAN DOG

705
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,254
WHEN THE FEDERATIONS
CALL?

706
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,466
COULD YOU RISK BEING THE ONLY
MAJE WHO<i> DOESN'T</i> ATTEND?

707
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,511
OF COURSE YOU'LL GO,

708
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,680
AND LISTEN.

709
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,515
NOTHING SHOULD BE
NEGOTIATED THERE--

710
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,518
NOT AT THE POINT
OF A FEDERATION WEAPON

711
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,102
BUT YOU CAN LEARN A GREAT DEAL.

712
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,064
ASSESS THE MOOD
OF THE OTHER MAJES.

713
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,734
FIND OUT THE STRENGTH
OF THE TRABE CONVOY.

714
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,113
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

715
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,033
YOU CAN COME OUT
OF THIS A HERO.

716
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,869
YOU CAN USE
THIS CONFERENCE

717
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,954
TO UNITE THE FACTIONS

718
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:45,667
ERADICATE THE TRABE
ONCE AND FOR ALL

719
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,879
AND TAKE<i> VOYAGER</i>
AS A TROPHY.

720
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,338
OOH.

721
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:57,554
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 49342.5.</i>

722
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:00,057
<i>NEELIX HAS RETURNED</i>
<i>FROM SOBRAS, WHERE HE LEARNED</i>

723
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,808
<i>A DISTURBING PIECE</i>
<i>OF INFORMATION</i>

724
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,728
<i>THAT MAY REQUIRE US</i>
<i>TO RETHINK OUR PLANS.</i>

725
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,605
HE WAS A TAKRIT--

726
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,566
A BAND OF MERCENARIES
THAT OPERATES IN THIS SYSTEM.

727
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,694
WHAT WAS HE DOING WHEN THE
KAZON-POMMAR ARRESTED HIM?

728
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,405
MY CONTACT ON THE PLANET SAID
THAT HE WAS MAKING A SKETCH

729
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,282
OF THE CONFERENCE SITE.
AND, BELIEVE ME,

730
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,158
THE TAKRIT ARE NOT KNOWN
FOR THEIR ART.

731
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,577
WHO SENT HIM?

732
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,913
THAT'S AS MUCH INFORMATION
AS I GOT.

733
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,290
SO SOMEONE WANTS TO
SABOTAGE THIS CONFERENCE.

734
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,292
Chakotay:
ONE OF THE MAJES.

735
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,919
WHY MISS A CHANCE
TO WIPE OUT YOUR RIVALS

736
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,796
WHILE THEY'RE TOGETHER
IN ONE ROOM?

737
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,799
IF THAT IS TRUE, THEN
ONE OF THEM WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY TRY TO LEAVE

738
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,216
BEFORE THE MEETING
IS FINISHED.

739
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,094
CAPTAIN, I THINK YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER NOT GOING

740
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,804
TO THE CONFERENCE.

741
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:42,808
NO. IF I CAN HELP BRING
STABILITY TO THIS QUADRANT,

742
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,851
I'M NOT GOING TO WALK AWAY
BECAUSE OF A RUMOR.

743
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,980
A RUMOR THAT MUST
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY NONETHELESS.

744
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,272
AGREED.

745
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,359
COMMANDER...

746
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,904
MONITOR ALL THE KAZON VESSELS
CAREFULLY

747
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,405
AND LOOK OUT FOR ANY
SUSPICIOUS SHIP MOVEMENT

748
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,615
NEAR THE SURFACE.

749
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,575
KEEP US ON A CONSTANT
TRANSPORTER LOCK

750
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,745
SO WE CAN BEAM OUT
AT THE FIRST HINT OF TROUBLE.

751
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,706
TUVOK, NEELIX,
YOU'RE WITH ME.

752
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,014
I GAVE A GREAT DEAL
OF THOUGHT

753
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,765
TO THE SHAPE
OF THE TABLE.

754
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,934
I FINALLY DECIDED
ON A TRIANGLE.

755
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,602
YOUR GROUP WOULD
SIT ON ONE SIDE.

756
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,855
THE MAJES WOULD
OCCUPY THE OTHER TWO.

757
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,482
DOES THAT SEEM
APPROPRIATE?

758
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,027
HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING MORE

759
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,486
ABOUT THE MATTER
WE DISCUSSED?

760
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,655
DON'T TALK
ABOUT THAT HERE.

761
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,282
IT COULD MEAN MY HEAD.

762
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,827
DOES THE TABLE SHAPE
SEEM ACCEPTABLE?

763
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,746
TERSA, THIS TIME I AM HERE
WITH A POWERFUL STARSHIP.

764
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,498
YOU'D BETTER BE TELLING ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

765
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,458
I AM, I SWEAR.

766
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,419
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE

767
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,630
TO HAVE THE CONFERENCE
HERE ON SOBRAS.

768
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,340
MY MAJE HAS
REWARDED ME HANDSOMELY

769
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,676
FOR THE PRESTIGE
IT AFFORDS HIM.

770
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,637
IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER WAY
I CAN BE OF SERVICE

771
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,222
PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

772
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,355
HE HASN'T HEARD ANYTHING MORE,
BUT HE'S FRIGHTENED.

773
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,440
HE MUST BELIEVE
SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

774
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,237
Tersa:
THE FIRST MAJES
OF THE KAZON ORDER.

775
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,159
MINNIS OF THE POMMAR...

776
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,457
SURAT OF THE MOSTRAL...

777
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,589
LORAN OF THE HOBII...

778
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,637
VALEK OF THE OGLAMAR...

779
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,602
AND CULLAH OF THE NISTRIM.

780
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:59,569
CAPTAIN, WE SEEM DESTINED
TO ENCOUNTER EACH OTHER.

781
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,614
THIS IS MABUS,
A GOVERNOR OF
THE TRABE.

782
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:06,284
MAJE CULLAH, I'M GRATIFIED
TO BE MEETING YOU LIKE THIS.

783
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,912
I HOPE WE'LL BE ABLE
TO COME TO TERMS.

784
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,663
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE THE DAY

785
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,959
WHEN ANY OF US WOULD SIT
AT A TABLE WITH THE TRABE.

786
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,668
TIMES CHANGE, MAJE.

787
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,587
PERHAPS.

788
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,380
SHALL WE?

789
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,222
OUR GRACIOUS HOST, JAL MINNIS
HAS PROVIDED FOOD AND DRINK

790
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,225
TO MAKE OUR DISCUSSIONS
MORE PLEASANT.

791
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,560
WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMING.

792
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,188
WE HOPE THIS WILL LEAD
TO A NEW CLIMATE OF PEACE.

793
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,940
PEACE?

794
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,150
WITH THE TRABE?

795
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,318
FORGIVE ME
IF I'M A BIT SKEPTICAL.

796
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,820
I UNDERSTAND.

797
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,613
AFTER DECADES OF ANTAGONISM,

798
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,573
YOU'RE BOUND
TO BE SUSPICIOUS.

799
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:50,787
BUT SURELY, EVERYONE HERE IS
TIRED OF CONSTANT VIOLENCE.

800
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:55,167
AREN'T YOU REALLY TRYING
TO GET US TO RELAX OUR GUARD

801
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,585
SO THE TRABE
CAN CONQUER US AGAIN?

802
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,546
HOW COULD WE DO THAT?
WE'RE SCATTERED AND DISPIRIT.

803
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:05,802
ALL WE ASK FOR IS A CHANCE
TO FIND A NEW HOME WORLD
AND SETTLE PEACEFULLY.

804
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,595
EXCUSE ME.

805
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,899
CAPTAIN JANEWAY,
I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE NATURE

806
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,401
OF THIS ALLIANCE
YOU'VE STRUCK WITH THE TRABE...

807
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:28,033
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU REFUSED
MY OFFER OF A SIMILAR PACT.

808
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,492
Janeway:
I FOUND THE GOALS
OF THE TRABE

809
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,911
TO BE COMPATIBLE
WITH OUR OWN.

810
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,039
I REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION
WHICH IS DEVOTED

811
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,374
TO PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE
AMONG PEOPLE.

812
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,626
THE TRABE WANT
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT.

813
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,505
THE TRABE HAVE ALWAYS
WANTED PEACE FOR THEMSELVES.

814
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,257
BUT WE PAID THE PRICE.

815
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,508
THEY LIVED IN LUXURY

816
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,635
AND WE LIVED
IN SQUALOR AND MISERY.

817
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,262
WHAT I FEAR, CAPTAIN,

818
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,931
IS THAT THIS UNION
YOU'VE MADE WITH THE TRABE

819
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,893
IS AN EFFORT TO FORCE US
TO CAPITULATE.

820
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:59,731
IF SO, WE ASSURE YOU
IT IS DOOMED TO FAILURE.

821
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:04,277
I WON'T PRETEND THAT OUR
ALLIANCE WASN'T AN ATTEMPT
TO MAKE A SHOW OF STRENGTH.

822
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,530
SEPARATELY, WE AND
THE TRABE ARE VULNERABLE.

823
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,490
TOGETHER, WE ARE STRONGER.

824
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,327
ARE YOU THREATENING US,
CAPTAIN?

825
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:16,206
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU
UNDERSTAND OUR DETERMINATION.

826
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,456
BUT IT'S NOT A THREAT.

827
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,293
IT'S AN OFFER.
A NEGOTIATED PEACE

828
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:24,047
AMONG ALL OF US WOULD
PROVIDE A GREATER STABILITY
IN THIS QUADRANT.

829
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,800
HOW COULD THAT DO ANYTHING
BUT BENEFIT US ALL?

830
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,553
I CAN'T SPEAK
FOR ALL OF YOU,

831
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,473
BUT I FOR ONE DON'T THINK
WE CAN TRUST THIS PROPOSAL.

832
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,185
A WOMAN AND A TRABE--

833
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,230
HOW CAN WE LISTEN
TO THEM?

834
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,649
I FIND YOU NOTHING
BUT A HYPOCRITE, CAPTAIN--

835
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,403
ALLYING YOURSELF
TO THE GREATEST VILLAINS

836
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,154
THIS QUADRANT
HAS EVER KNOWN.

837
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:52,200
IF THIS IS WHERE YOUR REVERED
FEDERATION VALUES HAVE TAKEN YOU

838
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,618
I WANT NO PART OF IT.

839
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,287
GENTLEMEN,

840
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,081
ALLOW ME TO CONFER WITH
MY FEDERATION COLLEAGUES.

841
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,540
PLEASE, HAVE
SOME REFRESHMENTS

842
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,335
AND LET US CONTINUE
IN A FEW MOMENTS.

843
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,753
CAPTAIN,

844
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,588
WOULD YOU PLEASE JOIN ME?

845
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,674
(<i> rumbling</i> )

846
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,848
CAPTAIN, I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU NOW.

847
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,477
GET DOWN!

848
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,814
WHAT IS THIS, CAPTAIN?

849
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,776
Janeway:
IT'S A TRAP! TAKE COVER!

850
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,905
<i>VOYAGER,</i> RED ALERT.

851
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,657
Chakotay:
We're on it.

852
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,861
YOU'VE RUINED WHAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN

853
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:13,114
THE GREATEST STEP
TOWARD PEACE IN DECADES.

854
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,492
PEACE? A MASSACRE?

855
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,119
I COULD HAVE DECIMATED
THE KAZON LEADERSHIP.

856
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,996
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM
YEARS TO RECOVER.

857
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,123
YOU PLANNED THIS WHOLE THING,

858
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,502
AND USED OUR GOOD WILL TO MAKE
SURE YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL.

859
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,086
YOU DON'T KNOW THE KAZON.

860
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,963
THERE'S NO DEALING
WITH THEM.

861
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,340
VIOLENCE IS ALL
THEY UNDERSTAND.

862
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,509
OR PERHAPS
IT'S ALL<i> YOU</i> UNDERSTAND.

863
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,927
YOU ARE NAIVE, CAPTAIN.
IT'S CLEAR

864
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:38,764
YOU HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING
OF THE HARSH REALITIES
OF THIS PART OF SPACE.

865
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,517
WHAT I TRIED TO DO WAS
DONE AS MUCH FOR YOU

866
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,893
AS IT WAS FOR US.

867
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,313
I'M NOT GRATEFUL,
AND I WANT YOU OFF MY SHIP.

868
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,149
CHIEF, BEAM OUR FORMER GUEST
BACK TO HIS VESSEL.

869
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,817
CAPTAIN, DON'T DO THIS.

870
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,819
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED US.
I DON'T THINK SO.

871
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,155
THE KAZON WILL BE DETERMINED
TO SEEK REVENGE.

872
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,449
HOW CAN THIS ONE SHIP
HOPE TO SURVIVE?

873
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,659
NOT BY MAKING DEALS
WITH EXECUTIONERS.

874
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,036
ENERGIZE.

875
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,959
I WOULD SUGGEST WE
DEPART BEFORE THE KAZON

876
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,627
HAVE A CHANCE TO RETURN
TO THEIR SHIPS.

877
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,964
JANEWAY TO PARIS.
GET US OUT OF HERE.

878
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,851
THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'RE MORE
VULNERABLE NOW THAN EVER.

879
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,144
WE HAVE TO TAKE EVERY MEASURE

880
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,272
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
PREPARED FOR AN ATTACK.

881
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:30,525
I WANT CONTINUAL
DIAGNOSTICS ON
ALL SHIPS' SYSTEMS.

882
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,152
I WILL SCHEDULE ADDITIONAL
BATTLE DRILLS FOR ALL HANDS.

883
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,238
MR. NEELIX,
WHAT ABOUT OUR FOOD SUPPLIES?

884
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,156
WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE, CAPTAIN.

885
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,576
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STOP
ANYWHERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

886
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,660
GOOD. LIEUTENANT,
WHAT'S THE CONDITION

887
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,746
OF OUR
PROPULSION SYSTEMS?

888
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,998
WE HAVE A REASONABLE
SUPPLY OF ANTIMATTER.

889
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,292
BARRING ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS,

890
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,127
WE SHOULD HAVE
MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE

891
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,589
OF BOTH WARP AND
IMPULSE ENGINES.

892
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,967
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING
I WANT TO SAY.

893
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,470
I HOPE THERE'S A LESSON
FOR ALL OF US IN THIS.

894
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,347
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE SPECIES
WE'VE ENCOUNTERED HERE
HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL,

895
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,351
OTHERS SEEM GOVERNED ONLY
BY THEIR OWN SELF-INTERESTS.

896
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:09,606
THIS APPEARS TO BE
A REGION OF SPACE THAT
DOESN'T HAVE MANY RULES.

897
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:13,443
BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN LEARN
SOMETHING FROM THE EVENTS
THAT HAVE UNFOLDED.

898
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,112
IN A PART OF SPACE
WHERE THERE ARE FEW RULES

899
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:19,740
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER
THAT WE HOLD FAST TO OUR OWN.

900
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,410
IN A REGION WHERE SHIFTING
ALLEGIANCES ARE COMMONPLACE,

901
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,706
WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING
STABLE TO RELY ON, AND WE DO--

902
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:31,002
THE PRINCIPALS AND THE IDEALS
OF THE FEDERATION.

903
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,588
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

904
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:37,342
THOSE ARE THE BEST ALLIES
WE COULD HAVE.
