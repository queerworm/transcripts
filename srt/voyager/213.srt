1
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,205
It's extraordinary.

2
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,709
I must remind you
( device chittering )

3
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,879
that it is also
a potential security risk.

4
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,088
It's losing power.

5
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,799
I'd like to move it
to Engineering

6
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,134
to see if I can repair it
before it drains completely.

7
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,971
I suggest we allow
the power to drain.

8
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,514
We should take
the opportunity

9
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,057
to examine it
while it is idle.

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,308
Then we can decide

11
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,310
whether it is wise
to repair it.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,979
Captain, this thing

13
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,105
has a completely
unfamiliar power source.

14
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,941
Once it stops working,

15
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,109
it's very possible I'll never be
able to get it going again,

16
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,695
and we'll have lost
an opportunity

17
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,989
to study a new technology.

18
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,117
This<i> is</i> a ship
of exploration, Mr. Tuvok.

19
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:24,376
TORRES:
The power's surging.

20
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,920
If we can't find
a way to stabilize it,

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,838
we're going to lose it.

22
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,758
What about an interface
with an EPS power conduit?

23
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,801
Well, the
energy signatures
are incompatible,

24
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,846
but it might
buy us some time.

25
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,058
( whirring )

26
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,943
Okay, let's give it
a try.

27
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:52,071
TORRES: Two-second burst,
five percent maximum output.

28
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,323
On my mark.

29
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,617
Now.

30
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,369
We're losing it.

31
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,580
Maybe we're overloading
its systems.

32
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,958
Let's try
a longer burst
at lower power.

33
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,042
Got it.

34
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,961
Five seconds
at three percent.

35
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,503
On your mark.

36
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,213
Now.

37
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,132
I think
it's working.

38
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,009
EPS flow
is holding steady.

39
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,303
EM field leakage
is minimal.

40
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,556
We'll have to watch the pressure
at the connector.

41
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,934
Let's try to keep it below
eighty-five percent.

42
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,144
Flux capacitance is spiking
intermittently,

43
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,063
but I don't think
that's the problem.

44
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,023
Let's reinforce the power
conduit coupling,

45
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,191
just to be on
the safe side.

46
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,489
<i>( dramatic</i>
<i>theme music playing )</i>

47
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,969
TORRES: It's suffered
a lot of damage,

48
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,512
but I think
the EPS charge

49
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,724
will keep it running
for at least 18 hours.

50
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,184
It's not a cyborg.

51
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,061
It's completely robotic.

52
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,772
No organ components
of any kind.

53
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,067
This looks like some kind
of programming center.

54
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,777
But I'm not detecting
any pathways

55
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,946
for transmitting
information.

56
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,781
It's got arms, legs.

57
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,323
We saw it move its head.

58
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,203
It's clearly designed
to perform motor functions.

59
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,663
So where do those
commands come from?

60
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,706
Maybe it needs to interface

61
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,667
with an
outside source.

62
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,628
Speaking of sources,

63
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,922
this energy module
seems to be what powers

64
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,424
the entire mechanism.

65
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,927
It isn't designed
to run on EPS energy.

66
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,180
It runs on some kind
of super-conducting plasma.

67
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,307
( gasps )

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,893
If we keep charging it,

69
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,979
we may end up destroying it.

70
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,355
( high-pitched tone )

71
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,109
( babbling )

72
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,986
It's trying
to communicate.

73
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,363
We don't know that. It may just
be some kind of recording.

74
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,573
Pralor! Pralor!

75
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,034
Pralor! Pralor!

76
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,329
Pralor! Pralor! Pralor!

77
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,914
What are you
trying to say?

78
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,667
What's "Pralor"?

79
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,921
If you can hear me,
try to move...

80
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,422
Try to move your arm.

81
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:46,638
B'Elanna, we don't even know
if it can see you,

82
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,848
much less understand

83
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,267
a word you're saying.

84
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,116
We've got to figure out
a way to fix it.

85
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,534
We've been trying for hours.

86
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,869
We need a break.

87
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,079
The EPS charge should
hold till morning.

88
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,455
You go ahead.

89
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,749
I could use some time
alone to think.

90
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,252
If you're staying,
I'm staying.

91
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,254
Get some rest, Harry.

92
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,007
You may think you're tougher

93
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,009
than everybody else,
B'Elanna Torres,

94
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,511
but I can go without sleep
just as long as you can.

95
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,348
Don't make me laugh,
Starfleet.

96
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,101
And don't make me
pull rank on you either.

97
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,312
If you insist.

98
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,939
But let me know if you
come up with anything...

99
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,524
Lieutenant.

100
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,118
TORRES:<i> Chief Engineer's Log:</i>
<i>Supplemental.</i>

101

106
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,519
Neelix, I need
another pot of coffee.

107
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,897
Even though breakfast
isn't officially served

108
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,481
for another
hour and a half,

109
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,319
I'd be happy to pour you
a glass of traggle nectar.

110
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,071
I will even fix you

111
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,366
my special Jibalian
seven-spice omelet.

112
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,076
Just coffee.

113
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,870
I'm sorry, B'Elanna,
but two pots of Lauris blend

114
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,998
is the absolute limit.

115
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,084
You're cutting me off?

116
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,799
Oh, I guess
you're right.

117
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,219
It was starting to
taste almost palatable.

118
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:55,642
Still no idea how to revive
our mechanized guest?

119
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,060
All I've been
able to do

120
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,646
is postpone
the inevitable.

121
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,356
The constant
power depletion

122
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:05,735
is like a
bleeding artery,

123
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,071
and haven't got
a tourniquet.

124
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,324
I remember
when I was trying

125
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,201
to perfect the recipe
for my Jibalian omelet.

126
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,744
I tried everything--

127
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,081
a little more spith basil,
a little less prishic--

128
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,084
but I couldn't get it right.

129
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,420
Finally, I fell asleep
from exhaustion.

130
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,213
Right there
at the counter.

131
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:30,385
And then, in a dream,
it came to me.

132
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:35,640
I was using six spices,
but the omelet needed seven.

133
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,184
Let me guess.

134
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,686
Leola root.

135
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,022
Nimian sea salt,
actually.

136
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,065
Salt?
Yes, salt--

137
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,526
the most common spice
in the galaxy.

138
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,030
But I was too tired,
so I couldn't see it.

139
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,700
That is...

140
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,871
a very interesting
story, Neelix.

141
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,540
Now, how about
some more coffee?

142
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,042
To bed.

143
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,085
I said to bed...

144
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,670
I'm going.

145
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,466
I'm going.

146
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,897
( sighs )

147
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,816
( hollow knocking )

148
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,236
Anybody home?

149
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,655
What's that?

150
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,243
You think I should
go to bed too?

151
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,123
Well...

152
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,167
I guess I'm outnumbered.

153
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,826
Computer, activate Emergency
Medical Holographic program.

154
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,620
Please
state the nature.

155
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,708
If there has been a change
in the official dress code,

156
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,668
I certainly wish someone
would have informed me.

157
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,003
This is what I sleep in.

158
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,422
I didn't have
time to change.

159
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,798
I see.

160
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,716
May I assume your haste
is an indication

161
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,802
that you have a medical
problem of some kind?

162
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,304
An engineering
problem actually,

163
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,972
but I thought you
might have some insight.

164
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,476
Hm. I should remind you
I'm a doctor...

165
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,060
Not an engineer. Right.

166
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,229
But this isn't a typical
engineering problem.

167
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:50,275
I've been working on
trying to repair a robot.

168
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,611
Ah, yes.
The mechanical man.

169
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,321
Kes told me about it.
Fascinating.

170
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,281
He's about to die.
Die?

171
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,158
Die. Stop functioning.
Whatever.

172
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,328
Unless I can figure out a way to
sustain his main energy source.

173
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,121
What kind of energy source
are we talking about?

174
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,124
Well, it's some type
of chromo-dynamic module

175
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,418
powered by
a tri-polymer plasma.

176
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,837
But the plasma
is contaminated.

177
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,046
It's decaying.

178
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,923
Hm. Like diseased blood.

179
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,385
Right. It can't retain enough
energy to keep the module
running.

180
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,387
Have you considered
a transfusion?

181
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,265
You mean replacing
the plasma itself?

182
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,809
Well, that was one
of my first ideas.

183
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,146
But where do I get my hands
on a polymer plasma
composed of elements

184
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,398
I didn't even know existed
24 hours ago?

185
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,527
Aren't<i> Voyager's</i> engines
powered by warp plasma?

186
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,073
Well, it's a very
different substance.

187
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,034
It's too highly charged.

188
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,911
It would burn out
the robot's systems in seconds.

189
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,082
It would be like
trying to give a Bolian

190
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,251
a blood transfusion
from a Vulcan.

191
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,253
Which ordinarily
would kill

192
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,548
the unfortunate Bolian.

193
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,965
But there
have been instances

194
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,634
when artificial blood
was unavailable,

195
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,011
and existing blood cells
were genetically altered

196
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,846
for interspecies
transfusions.

197
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,890
It's a good idea,
but warp plasma radiates

198
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,102
at too high a frequency
to alter electro-chemically.

199
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,604
Unless...

200
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,938
Go on...

201
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:17,070
I could modify a series
of anodyne relays,

202
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,281
attach them directly
to the robot's power module.

203
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,116
They could act
as a sort of regulator

204
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,493
to make
the warp plasma compatible

205
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,078
with the robot's
energy matrix!

206
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,956
That's exactly
what I was going to suggest.

207
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,960
That's the last
of the relays.

208
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,256
The plasma injector
is sealed.

209
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,091
This is your show,
Lieutenant.

210
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,593
Whenever
you're ready.

211
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,182
Activating the relays.

212
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,520
All right, Harry,
start the infusion.

213
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,688
20% nominal flow.

214
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,732
Initiating plasma flow.

215
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,235
Energy levels
are up 14%.

216
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,279
The relays
are holding.

217
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,155
Harry, give it
a little more juice.

218
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,449
Got it.

219
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,076
I'm taking it
to 30 percent.

220
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,620
35 percent.

221
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,996
Wait. The energy levels
are rising too fast.

222
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,957
We're going
to burn out its systems.

223
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,584
But it needs more plasma.

224
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,919
What about increasing the
capacitance of the relays?

225
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,170
Let's give it a try.

226
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,925
It's stabilizing.

227
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,010
Hold the flow
right there

228
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,221
and see what happens.

229
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,182
The plasma's
circulating.

230
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,186
The programming center
is activated.

231
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,563
I think we may have done it.

232
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,189
( gasps )

233
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,899
MALE COMPUTER VOICE:

I am Automated

237
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,911
Thank you for reactivating me,
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres.

238
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,790

TORRES:<i> Chief Engineer's Log:</i>

240

246

( device chittering )

247
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,481
I think we're past
the critical stage.

248
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,065
I concur.

249
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,067
According to my
self-diagnostic systems,

250
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,363
Automated Personnel Unit 3947
is currently functioning

251
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,616
at 68% of peak
operating capabilities.

252
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,328
Automated Personnel
Unit 3947

253
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,206
is an extremely
well-designed machine.

254
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,666
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres

255
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,043
is an extremely
proficient humanoid.

256
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,341
So how did you end up floating
in space so badly damaged?

257
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,677
I was operating
an asteroid-mining pod.

258
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,011
It exploded.

259
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,472
Do you know what
caused the explosion?

260
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,432
I am unable to access
that information.

261
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,226
My memory cells
are not yet functioning

262
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,770
at optimal efficiency.

263
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,938
Do you remember
where you come from?

264
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,693
I am stationed aboard
a Pralor vessel.

265
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,571
Well, we'll do our best
to find your ship

266
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,946
and return you
to your people.

267
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,490
Thank you.

268
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,284
I'm hoping that the memory loss
is only temporary.

269
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,662
Once the new plasma
has a chance

270
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,122
to fully integrate
into your systems,

271
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,585
I think you'll be
pretty close to... optimal.

272
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,086
The new plasma?

273
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,921
Yes, I adapted
your power module

274
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,799
to accept our warp plasma
as an energy source.

275
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,968
You repaired my power module?

276
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,470
Are you a Builder?

277
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,390
A Builder?

278
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,308
Well, I guess
you could say that.

279
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,769
I'm an engineer.

280
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,521
I'm responsible for repairing
and maintaining

281
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,814
all the systems on the ship.

282
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,775
Only the Builders
were capable

283
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,444
of constructing or repairing
power modules.

284
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,531
The Builders are...
the people who created you?

285
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,699
Yes.

286
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,659
And they're humanoids?
Like me?

287
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,412
Yes. Like Lieutenant
B'Elanna Torres.

288
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,212
You could create
a new power module.

289
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,965
You don't need
a new module.

290
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,050
The one I just fixed
will work fine now.

291
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,762
The new power module
will not be for me.

292
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,847
It will be a prototype
for the construction

293
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,849
of additional
automated units.

294
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,393
Can't the Builders make
additional units?

295
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,396
The Builders no longer exist.

296
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,909
Apparently, thousands of them
were built as service modules.

297
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,703
But the race who created them--
these Builders--

298
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,372
were killed off
decades ago in a war.

299
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,416
Leaving the automated units
to fend for themselves.

300
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,627
Now they're wearing out,
breaking down.

301
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,504
They've learned to make
repairs for themselves--

302
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,880
some pretty complex.

303
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,883
But the construction
of a power module--

304
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,803
the device
which sustains them--

305
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,387
is beyond their grasp.

306
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,141
It's... an incredible
challenge, Captain.

307
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,185
But with enough time
to study their systems

308
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,354
I might be able
to do it.

309
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,608
I don't doubt
your abilities, B'Elanna,

310
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,568
but helping them reproduce

311
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,655
is a clear violation
of the Prime Directive.

312
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,949
They've expressed
a desire to procreate.

313
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,868
That's basic
to any lifeform.

314
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,577
I'm not saying
they don't have the same rights

315
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,788
as any organic species.
That's not the issue here.

316
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,122
Are you sure?

317
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,249
Suppose
they<i> were</i> organic.

318
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,793
But they
had become sterile.

319
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,170
And we had a treatment
that would enable them

320
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,255
to start reproducing again.

321
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,801
Would you withhold
that treatment?

322
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,470
Maybe. I'd have to know more
about the circumstances.

323
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,972
But we're not talking

324
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,098
about treating
a disorder here, are we?

325
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,559
What's the difference?

326
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,561
Unlike a species
that's become sterile,

327
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,897
these robots never had
the ability to reproduce.

328
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,733
What you're talking about
is giving them new abilities,

329
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,984
which is the equivalent

330
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,777
of altering
their genetic structure.

331
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,070
To correct a flaw.

332
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,572
You can't call it
a flaw.

333
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,156
This is the way
they were designed.

334
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,158
I'm trying to save them
from extinction.

335
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,161
Unfortunately, extinction is
often the natural end of
evolution.

336
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,581
So you'll just willing to let
their entire society die off?

337
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,708
We don't know
that's going to happen.

338
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,586
If they're adaptable as you say,
and capable of educating
themselves,

339
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,881
they might learn to build a
power module themselves someday.

340
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,341
"Someday" could be
too late.

341
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,094
There are only a few
hundred of them left.

342
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,346
I feel for
the robots' plight.

343
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,182
But what you're proposing
is exactly the kind of tampering

344
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,768
the Prime Directive
prohibits.

345
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,770
We know almost nothing
about these creatures,

346
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,563
or the race
that built them.

347
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,482
What would be the consequences
of increasing their population?

348
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,193
Both to their own civilization
and others in this quadrant?

349
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,112
Who are we
to swoop in, play god,

350
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,489
and then continue on our way
without the slightest
consideration

351
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,575
of the the long-term effects
of our actions?
Captain...

352
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,370
B'Elanna, I share
your scientific curiosity,

353
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,958
and I admire your compassion,
but the answer is no.

354
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,467
I do not concur
with your captain's decision.

355
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,428
She's following
our Prime Directive.

356
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,473
Define
"Prime Directive."

357
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,391
It forbids us
to interfere

358
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,978
in the natural development
of other cultures.

359
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,898
The automated units
were not created naturally.

360
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,483
We were built.

361
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,526
You could help us
build more.

362
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,362
Captain Janeway
doesn't think
that's a good idea.

363
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,491
But Lieutenant
B'Elanna Torres does.

364
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,578
Maybe...

365
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,665
I don't know...

366
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,835
I'd like to try...

367
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,711
but I can't.

368
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,757
Without your help,
we will not survive.

369
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,176
( sighs )

370
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,140
I thought Lieutenant
B'Elanna Torres
was a Builder.

371
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,894
So did I.

372
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,027
We've located your ship.

373
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,487
We should be in communications
range in about an hour.

374
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,573
Thank you.

375
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,789
The alien vessel is entering
visual range, Captain.

376
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,207
Yellow Alert.

377
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,542
Slow to one-quarter impulse.

378
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,127
Put them on screen,
Ensign Kim.

379
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,419
KIM: Aye, Captain.

380
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,671
JANEWAY: Magnify.

381
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,009
TUVOK:
We're being scanned, Captain.

382
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,719
That's all right.
Let them take a look.

383
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,470
Open the channel.

384
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,058
<i>Pralor Automated</i>
<i>Personnel Unit 6263</i>

385
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,852
<i>requests you identify</i>
<i>yourselves.</i>

386
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,311
I'm Captain
Kathryn Janeway

387
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,689
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

388
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:35,860
<i>What are your intentions,</i>
<i>Captain Kathryn Janeway?</i>

389
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,653
We rescued
one of your crew members--

390
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,740
Unit 3947-- and we'd like
to return him to your ship.

391
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,283
<i>We'll prepare</i>
<i>to receive the unit.</i>

392
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,078
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for your assistance.</i>

393
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,957
Very polite,
these automated units.

394
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,379
Captain Janeway
gave me permission

395
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,173
to give you some
extra warp plasma

396
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,009
in case the plasma
we've infused into
your system

397
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,761
starts to degrade.

398
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,512
Thank you.

399
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,225
And you'll have to re-modulate
the anodyne relays periodically.

400
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,809
You are
repeating instructions

401
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,436
you have
already given me, B'Elanna.

402
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,897
I'm just making sure.

403
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,359
Well, I guess
this is good-bye.

404
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,614
( grunts in pain )

405
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,574
What are you doing?

406
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,951
( gasps )

407
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,664
Captain, I'm detecting a
chromo-dynamic energy discharge

408
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,583
in Transporter Room Two.

409
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,086
Bridge to
Transporter Room Two.

410
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,462
Janeway to Torres.

411
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,382
( scanner chittering )

412
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,552
Captain, someone's
initiating a transport.

413
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,768
It's Torres
and the robot.
Override.

414
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,020
I can't block it.

415
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,563
Their patterns are already
in the buffer.

416
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,694
They're gone, Captain.

417
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,832
Transport her
back now, Mr. Kim.

418
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,209
KIM: I can't get
a lock on her.

419
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,627
TUVOK: They have erected
some sort of

420
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,420
subspace defense
field around their vessel.

421
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,715
Our targeting scanners
cannot penetrate it.
Hail them.

422
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,092
KIM: They're not
responding.

423
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,594
Open a channel
on wide-band subspace.

424
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,054
Channel open.

425
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,806
This is Captain Janeway.

426
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,308
Your abduction
of our crew member

427
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,018
is a clear act of aggression.

428
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,853
If you do not return her
immediately,

429
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,813
we will be forced
to retaliate.

430
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,775
Confirm that they've received
the transmission, Mr. Kim.

431
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,401
They heard us all right.

432
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,112
They're just not answering.

433
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,242
Mr. Tuvok,
power the forward phaser banks.

434
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,542
What the hell
is going on here?

435
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,044
This is where
you will assist

436
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,795
in the creation
of the prototype.

437
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,423
I told you
I can't help you!

438
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,176
Now return me to my ship.

439
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,635
That is not possible.

440
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,179
Torres to<i> Voyager.</i>

441
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,639
Your communication device
has been deactivated.

442
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,561
I do not wish to
injure you, B'Elanna.

443
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,938
I helped you.
I reactivated you.

444
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,273
Why are you doing this?

445
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,733
We require additional
automated units

446
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,400
to prevent
our extinction.

447
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,237
Captain Janeway won't let you
get away with this!

448
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,240
It would be inadvisable
for your captain to provoke us.

449
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,574
Still no response, Captain.

450
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,992
Mr. Tuvok, any luck

451
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,827
penetrating their
defense field?
Negative.

452
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,829
Commander, is there
any sign that they're

453
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,664
preparing to attack?

454
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,917
Their shielding is making it
difficult to get clear readings.

455
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,378
I can't even tell you what
their weapons capabilities are.

456
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:44,590
Mr. Tuvok, I don't want you
to hit their ship,

457
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,759
but I do want you to open a hole
in their shielding

458
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,219
wide enough
to transport through.

459
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,427
Understood.

460
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,347
Mr. Kim,
match the targeting scanners

461
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,973
to the coordinates
of the phaser fire,

462
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,226
and stand by
to beam B'Elanna back.

463
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,769
Phasers calibrated.

464
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,978
Fire.

465
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,151
Their field strength
is down to 80%.

466
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,528
That's progress.
Fire again.

467
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,947
( deep rumbling )

468
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,538
Initiating evasive pattern
Omega Six.

469
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,333
They're firing
some kind of

470
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,168
quantum resonance charges,
Captain.

471
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,963
Our aft shields
are down to 53% and dropping.

472
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,382
Rerouting power
to aft shields.

473
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,384
Down to 24%.

474
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,677
Switching evasive pattern
to Theta One.

475
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,264
Lieutenant Tuvok, load
torpedo bays one through four

476
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,515
and stand by to fire
on my order.

477
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,478
Your captain has made
a tactical error

478
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,521
by attacking us.

479
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,815
Our weapons systems

480
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,984
are substantially
superior to yours.

481
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,735
Your shields are failing.

482
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,280
Your weapons pose
no threat to us.

483
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,326
Aft shields
have been penetrated.

484
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,286
We've got
to get out of here.

485
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,745
Agreed.

486
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,414
We'll try to come back
for B'Elanna later.

487
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,707
Do it, Mr. Paris.
Warp Three.

488
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,752
Propulsion systems are off-line.
We're dead in the water.

489
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,173
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

490
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,342
Hull breach on Deck Six.

491
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,427
Initiating
emergency containment field.

492
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,595
Environmental control systems
are failing.

493
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,431
Oxygen levels
on decks three through seven

494
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,890
have dropped to Critical.

495
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,059
We've lost artificial gravity
on Deck Eight.

496
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,560
Injury reports from all decks.

497
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,813
( rumbling impact )
( Janeway grunts )

498
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,482
You've got to stop this.

499
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,774
Your ship opened fire.

500
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,401
We are programmed
to defend ourselves.

501
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,487
They're helpless.
Can't you see that?

502
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,490
Our enemies
must be destroyed.

503
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,907
We a not your enemies.

504
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,409
You are not
my enemy, B'Elanna,

505
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,827
but your captain is,

506
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,787
and your crew
follows her commands.

507
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,622
Captain Janeway
backed me

508
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,249
when I wanted
to reactivate you,

509
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,418
over the objections of
her Chief Security Officer.

510
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,670
You wouldn't be here
if it weren't for her.

511
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,341
All right.

512
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:54,011
If that's what it will take
to stop this, I'll do it.

513
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,348
I'll build your
damned prototype.

514
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,475
We're losing
life support, Captain.

515
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,022
The robots have powered down
their weapons systems.

516
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,524
They're hailing us, Captain.

517
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,901
On screen.

518
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,237
<i>Captain,</i>
<i>is everybody okay?</i>

519
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,155
We'll be all right.
What about you?

520
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,698
( sighs )

521
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,368
<i>I've agreed to help them</i>
<i>build their prototype.</i>

522
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,287
Lieutenant...

523
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,830
<i>I know how you feel</i>
<i>about this, Captain.</i>

524
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,541
<i>I don't like it either,</i>

525
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,835
<i>but if I don't do it,</i>
<i>they'll destroy</i> Voyager.

526
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,298
<i>What choice do I have?</i>

527
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,021
UNIT 3947: These are all
the materials necessary

528
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,399
to construct
a prototype unit.

529
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,983
You will be provided
with whatever additional

530
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,111
tools and equipment
you require.

531
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,947
You may access our database
and schematic information

532
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,575
from this computer terminal,
but it will not allow you

533
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,785
to interface
with any critical systems.

534
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,287
While you're on board,

535
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,080
you will have no contact
with your ship,

536
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,165
nor will you leave
this room.

537
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,625
I will remain here
to supervise your work.

538
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,462
You may proceed.

539
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,467
Proceed. Right.

540
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,553
But the question is,
where do I proceed from?

541
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,142
Let me ask you this.

542
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:27,396
Have any of you ever tried
to build a prototype?

543
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,399
We have tried,
and failed.

544
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,735
What was the problem?
I am unable to explain
the failure.

545
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,447
We duplicated a power module
to exact specifications

546
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,824
on several occasions,
but in all instances

547
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,995
the energy output of the new
module was insufficient to
operate a unit.

548
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,248
And you're sure you reproduced
the module exactly?

549
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,834
This is a schematic
of a power module

550
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,628
from a terminated unit.

551
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,630
This one is from
a failed prototype.

552
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,590
They are identical.

553
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,176
There is no reason why one
should function while
the other does not.

554
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:01,180
Unit 3947,
what can you report?

555
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,681
Well, let's see.
We've been working
for about five minutes.

556
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:07,186
So, I guess we don't have
a lot of progress to report.

557
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,522
Our sensors indicate
that the humanoid vessel

558
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,941
will require approximately
140 hours to repair.

559
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,943
It is necessary for
you to complete work

560
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,404
on the prototype
before that time.

561
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,533
Why? We don't seem to be
any match for you.

562
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:24,244
Our tactical subprocessors
indicate a 79% likelihood

563
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,621
that a rescue
will be attempted

564
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,747
once sufficient repairs
are completed.

565
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,124
At optimal efficiency,

566
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,709
your engines are more
powerful than ours.

567
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,587
It is also possible
that these humanoids

568
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,714
will not make decisions
based on tactical probabilities.

569
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:40,010
Their cognitive process
is... unpredictable.

570
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,930
We will remain on
full tactical alert.

571
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,308
The humanoid may
purposefully attempt

572
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,268
to delay completion
of the prototype,

573
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,312
hoping
she will be rescued.

574
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,898
I don't know if a promise
means anything to you people,

575
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,525
but it does to us.

576
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,819
I gave you my word
that I'd do my best. And I will.

577
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,446
According to my observations,

578
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,199
the humanoid is operating
at optimal efficiency.

579
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,992
Thank you.

580
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,369
But I have to tell you,

581
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,287
there are no guarantees here.

582
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,872
Building a prototype
from scratch

583
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,165
is a lot different

584
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,042
than repairing
a broken power module.

585
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,752
I don't even know
if it's possible.

586
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,464
If you fail,
you and your people will die.

587
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,468
B'Elanna Torres,

588
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,513
6263 is
a designated command unit.

589
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,558
He is merely following
his programming.

590
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,354
I don't need to be threatened.

591
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,440
I told you I'd do my best.

592
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,235
I believe you,
but Unit 6263 does not.

593
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,488
He does not know Lieutenant
B'Elanna Torres as I do.

594
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,911
Let me see one of those
terminated power modules.

595
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,496
We've managed to repair
the hull breach,

596
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,582
but we have no power
on decks three through seven.

597
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,334
Aft shields are still
completely nonfunctional.

598
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,586
And last but not least,

599
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,337
the dilithium matrix
is destabilized,

600
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,465
so we can't get
the warp engines running.

601
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,342
We're talking about at least
another six days of repairs.

602
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,010
We're not sticking
around that long.

603
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,138
I want a plan to get
B'Elanna off that ship

604
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,515
before she can finish
building the prototype.

605
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,808
In that case,
I suggest

606
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,727
we make warp drive
our priority.

607
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,562
Any rescue attempt
will no doubt necessitate

608
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,564
a rapid departure.
Agreed.

609
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,566
Mr. Kim, can you give me
an estimate

610
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,276
on repairing
the dilithium matrix?

611
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,986
How does 72 hours sound?

612
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,363
Like 24 hours too long.

613
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,657
Dismissed.

614
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,035
TORRES: Hand me
the sub-micron scanner.
( whirring )

615
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,625
Phase coil resonator.

616
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,919
( whirring )

617
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,340
Well, I think I know why
your other prototypes failed,

618
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,134
but... I'm not sure I know
what to do about it yet.

619
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,594
Explain.

620
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,513
The automated units
are modular.

621
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,515
Your parts are identical,
interchangeable, right?

622
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,557
That is correct.

623
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,601
So...

624
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,061
If you lose an arm,

625
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,148
you can replace it
with another one,

626
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,442
and over the years, you've
learned to make new arms

627
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,402
because
they're all the same,

628
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,363
and your programming
is sophisticated enough

629
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,240
to allow you to reproduce
what you see,

630
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,160
but each power module

631
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,205
has a slightly different
energy signature,

632
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,375
so, even if you copy
this guy's module exactly,

633
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,377
it wouldn't work
in any other unit.

634
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,630
As far as I can tell,
every automated unit

635
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,050
has a power module with
a unique energy code.

636
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,135
Can you reprogram
the energy codes

637
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,887
to make the modules
interchangeable?

638
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,557
I don't think so.

639
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,560
You have failed.

640
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,770
I will inform 6263.

641
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,937
Hey!

642
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,439
Do all you
automated units give up

643
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,858
the minute you hit
a bump in the road?

644
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:43,193
Do you have
an alternative idea?

645
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,945
What we've got to do

646
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,947
is design
a standardized module

647
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:52,118
with a uniform energy code
that can power any unit.

648
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,787
According to my observations,

649
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,749
there is now sufficient reason
for greater optimism.

650
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,043
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

651
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,133
TUVOK: Due to the complexity
of their defense field,

652
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,052
and our severe power shortage,

653
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,012
it is unlikely that we can
modify the transporters

654
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,681
to beam
Lieutenant Torres out.

655
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,516
But if we can maneuver
inside the field...

656
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,976
Our transporters
could get the job done.

657
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,353
Is that a
viable option?

658
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,564
For a shuttlecraft,
it may be.

659
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,775
They were able to knock
out<i> Voyager's</i> shields
in a matter of minutes.

660
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,735
A shuttle would be
even more vulnerable.

661
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,153
It would be advisable to create
a diversion of some sort.

662
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,072
To take their attention
away from the shuttle.

663
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,365
Attack them again?

664
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,867
I don't want to risk that
a second time.

665
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,493
I don't need
a diversion.

666
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,704
Just give me a chance.
I'll get her out of there.

667
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,164
You don't mind if
we give you a little
help, do you, Paris?

668
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,875
I'd hate to lose
another shuttle.

669
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,294
Your concern
for my welfare

670
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,587
is heartwarming.

671
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,838
In another 12 hours

672
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,506
our warp engines
will be back on line.

673
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,925
I'd like to come up
with a diversion

674
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,676
before then.
Okay, gentlemen?

675
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,398
So far, so good.

676
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,110
I'm not getting any feedback
from the motor circuits.

677
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,071
You going to be
the obstetrician
of this unit, 3947?

678
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,032
Please rephrase
the question.

679
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,576
If this works,

680
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,412
will you be in charge
of assembling the new units?

681
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,748
I am programmed
as a ships maintenance unit.

682
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,500
I have no knowledge of design,

683
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,418
nor do any of the other
automated personnel.

684
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,630
Sounds like you just
volunteered for new duty.

685
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,881
I hope you're
watching closely.

686
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,549
I am observing your work.

687
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,926
However, I do not possess

688
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,136
your improvisational
capabilities.

689
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,556
Well, once we have
the prototype,

690
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,892
all you'd have to do is copy it.

691
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,522
Tell me
something, 39.

692
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,106
Can I call you 39?

693
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,026
I am Automated Unit 3947.

694
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,194
Fine.

695
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,279
3947,

696
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,157
did you wake up
on a bench like this one?

697
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,492
How long have you been alive?

698
00:33:55,492 --> 00:34:00,288
I have been in service
1,314,807 hours

699
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,832
and 33 minutes.

700
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:05,418
I was activated by a Builder
from the Pralor homeworld.

701
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,754
Tell me something more
about these Builders.

702
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,548
Were they anything like us?

703
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,049
I have insufficient knowledge
of your culture

704
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,843
to provide an adequate response.

705
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,845
Will you provide
additional information?

706
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,471
Well, I asked
about your culture.

707
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,390
Only fair
you should ask about mine.

708
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,352
Does your culture include
artificial life-forms?

709
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,855
As a matter of fact, it does.

710
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,314
Are they similar

711
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,441
to the automated personnel
units aboard this ship?

712
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,485
Well, they come
in different shapes and sizes.

713
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,362
Some have limbs, some don't.

714
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,032
Most don't have
your cognitive abilities.

715
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,242
Are they your servants?

716
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,954
Well, I guess you could say

717
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,998
that the robots we use
are servants,

718
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,750
in a manner of speaking.

719
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,502
But they aren't sentient
like you.

720
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,505
In fact, we have
only one sentient

721
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,173
artificial life-form
in our society,

722
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,551
and he is treated
the same as any human.

723
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,178
The same. He is equal
to a Builder?

724
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,515
That's right.

725
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,101
He works on a ship
just like you and I.

726
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,144
He wears the same uniform I do.

727
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,023
What is his designant number?

728
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:12,485
He has a name,
like the rest of us. "Data."

729
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,740
Data. I would like
to be acquainted with this Data.

730
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:25,415
Well, it looks like this
standardized power module

731
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,959
is working pretty well so far.

732
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,168
You will succeed,
B'Elanna Torres.

733
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,088
Don't send me flowers yet.

734
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,464
I've still got to see

735
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,633
whether it will power
an actual unit.

736
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,636
I believe it will.

737
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,721
We're making progress
on the dilithium matrix.

738
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,223
It should be stable enough
to reinitialize the warp core

739
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,349
in about six hours.

740
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,768
Good. What about
our diversion?

741
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,478
Any suggestions?

742
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,897
When we were in the Maquis,

743
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,482
B'Elanna once linked
a holoemitter

744
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,984
to a deflector array

745
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,778
and projected an image
of another ship into space.

746
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,488
I like it.

747
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,448
But do we have enough power?

748
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,659
We will by the time
the warp core's on line.

749
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,243
I already have Kim working on
the holodeck...

750
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,454
<i>Tuvok to Captain Janeway.</i> 
Go ahead.

751
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,456
<i>I'm picking up</i>
<i>an unidentified alien ship</i>

752
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,874
<i>on long-range sensors.</i>

753
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,128
<i>It's heading</i>
<i>for our coordinates.</i>

754
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,545
We're on our way.

755
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,717
Well, it fits.

756
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,177
Cross your fingers.

757
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,769
So far, so good.

758
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,981
Let's hope it can interface
with the unit.

759
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,400
( unit powers up )

760
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,236
( power fails )

761
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,531
It does
not function correctly.

762
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,450
It does not function
correctly<i> yet.</i>

763
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,077
Your builders
should have programmed you

764
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,579
with a little more patience.

765
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:51,292
I'm going to try adjusting
the flux capacitance.

766
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,086
( unit powers up )

767
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:04,056
Prototype Unit 0001 is ready
to accept programming.

768
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,349
We did it.

769
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,602
We actually did it.

770
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,938
<i>You</i> did it,
B'Elanna Torres.

771
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,773
I knew this task
would not exceed

772
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,817
your operating
capabilities.

773
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:21,489
Prototype Unit 0001
is ready to accept programming.

774
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,326
What are you doing?

775
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,913
I am congratulating you!

776
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,581
You're a father.

777
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,041
( laughing )

778
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,250
( rumbling )

779
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,258
No sign of organic life
aboard that ship either.

780
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,468
They appear to be manned
by automated units

781
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,055
virtually identical to those
operating the first ship.

782
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,639
Is it possible
that we've stumbled

783
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,185
into the middle
of some kind of... robotic war?

784
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,187
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

785
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:58,526
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

786
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,403
We've got to get
Torres back now.

787
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,948
Agreed, but first I want
to show both those ships

788
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,490
this isn't our fight.

789
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,910
Ease us back on maneuvering
thrusters, Mr. Paris,

790
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,120
nice and steady.

791
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,913
The second ship
is hailing us.

792
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,873
On screen.

793
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,042
<i>Cravic Automated Commander 122</i>

<i>requests you identify yourself.</i>

795
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,129
My name
is Kathryn Janeway,

796
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,589
Captain of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

797
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,008
<i>Withdraw from this area</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

798
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,885
I'm afraid I can't do that.

799
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,804
One of my crew members
is being held hostage

800
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,305
aboard the Pralor vessel.

801
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,640
I won't leave without her.

802
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,892
<i>Remain at</i>
<i>your present coordinates</i>

803
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,229
<i>and don't attempt to intervene,</i>
<i>or you will be fired on.</i>

804
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,649
Captain,
this new ship could be a...

805
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,818
The diversion
we've been looking for.

806
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,737
Mr. Kim, what's the status
of our warp engines?

807
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,031
We're still an hour
away at best.

808
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,242
We may not have an hour.
Get down to Engineering.

809
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,701
Be ready to give me
as much power as you can

810
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,162
the minute we get Torres back.

811
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,537
Aye, Captain.

812
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,331
If those two ships
keep each other busy,

813
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,458
we may not need warp
to get away.

814
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,295
Mr. Paris, report
to the Shuttle Bay.
Yes, ma'am.

815
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,046
Chakotay,
you have the con.

816
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,679
Who are they?

817
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,682
Automated personnel units
of the Cravic homeworld.

818
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,143
Robots from
another world?
That is correct.

819
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,644
Why are they
attacking you?

820
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,604
They were programmed to
do so by their builders.

821
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:21,359
Prototype Unit 0001
is ready to accept programming.

822
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,071
The Cravic Builders,
the Pralor Builders--

823
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,200
Were they enemies?
That is correct.

824
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,952
Look, maybe Captain Janeway
can contact the Cravic leaders

825
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,829
and convince them
to stop the fighting, then...

826
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,539
That is not possible.

827
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,832
Why not?

828
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,917
The Cravic are also extinct.

829
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,471
I'm approaching the perimeter
of the defense field.

830
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,639
TUVOK:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

831
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,350
Rotate your
shield harmonics

832
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,559
until
they are synchronized

833
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,852
with the frequency
of the field.

834
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,022
Shields synchronized.

835
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,565
I'm going in.

836
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,359
( shuttle struck by weapon )

837
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,902
Then again, maybe not.

838
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,445
It didn't work.
He bounced right
off the field.

839
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,657
Mr. Paris, re-set your heading
for coordinates 105.

840
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,326
Mark 4-0.

841
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,328
Uh, if I understand you, Tuvok,

842
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,163
that would take me
into a direct line of fire

843
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,414
with the Cravic ship.

844
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,583
Precisely.
The concentration of fire

845
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,501
is opening a rift
in the Pralor defense field.

846
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,628
Which I just might be able
to sneak through

847
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,131
if I can dodge
a disruptor blast or two.

848
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,632
Changing heading.

849
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,387
If both sides
were annihilated,

850
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,846
then why continue
your war?

851
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,098
3947: All automated
personnel units

852
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,724

854
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,813
The Cravic ship has penetrated
our defense shield.

855
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,898
Has anyone
in all these years

856
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,524
ever tried
to stop this war?

857
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,360
The Pralor and the Cravic
called a truce.

858
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,820
Wait a minute, if both sides
called a truce,

859
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,198
then why didn't they
stop you from fighting?

860
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,574
They attempted to do so.

861
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,825
And?

862
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,120
We terminated the Builders.

863
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,622

Showing a rift

867
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,091
in the defense field
off your starboard bow.

868
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,508
I'm on it.

869
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,892
When it was anticipated
that the war would end,

870
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,228
the Builders no longer
required our services

871
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,813
and they attempted
to terminate us.

872
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,982
In doing so,
they became the enemy.

873
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,359
We are programmed
to destroy the enemy.

874
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,111
It is necessary
for our survival.

875
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,822
Now that you have
constructed the prototype,

876
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,991
we will soon outnumber
the Cravic units.

877
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,160
We will achieve victory.

878
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,244

00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:42,167
to the Reconstruction Bay
Number One.

881
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,294
The individual energy codes--

882
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:46,212
is that why
the Builders added them--

883
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,381
to prevent
the procreation of these units?

884
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,882
( gasps )

885
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,717
My God, what have I done?

886
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:08,985
Prototype Unit 0001
is ready to accept programming.

887
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,071
( zapping )
( warbling speech )

888
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,241
( grunts )

889
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,041
You have terminated
the prototype.

890
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,835
Yes. I have.

891
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,504
You will build another.

892
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,172
Never.

893
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,049
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres,

894
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,219
I told 6263
you were not our enemy.

895
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:38,806
I never wanted to be your enemy.

896
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,933
I'm sorry.

897
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,067
Shuttle to<i> Voyager.</i>

898
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,070
I've got her, but she's injured.
Tell the doctor to stand by.

899
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,739
<i>Beam her out as soon as</i>
<i>I clear the defense field.</i>

900
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,241
Acknowledged, Mr. Paris.

901
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,327
The ships are continuing
to exchange fire, Captain.

902
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,745
They are ignoring
the shuttle.

903
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,081
Bridge to Engineering.

904
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,499
Stand by, warp engines.

905
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,418
We'll engage
the moment Mr. Paris gets back.

906
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:07,544
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

907
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:10,296
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

908
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,968
One pot of Landras blend,
compliments of the chef.

909
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,179
Mm. I never thought
Neelix's coffee

910
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,472
could taste so good.

911
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,682
I'll tell him
you said so.

912
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,313
( sighs )

913
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,524
I don't know what to say.

914
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,112
As far as I'm concerned,

915
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,239
you did what you thought
was necessary

916
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,742
to ensure the safety
of this crew.

917
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,287
Thank you.

918
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,789
It must have been difficult.

919
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,292
Difficult?

920
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,586
To destroy what you created.

921
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,631
It was necessary.

922
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,341
I read your report.

923
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,305
It was no small achievement,
B'Elanna.

924
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,015
You gave that unit life.

925
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,021
You should have
seen it, Captain.

926
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,609
It was incredible.

927
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,403
I installed that module,

928
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,906
and the prototype
looked up at me

929
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,867
and asked me
for programming.

930
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,375
As I said,
it must have been difficult.

931
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,714
It was necessary.

932
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:44,223
