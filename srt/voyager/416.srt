1
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,594
The prey's course
has become erratic.

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,346
I will intercept to kill.

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,555
No.

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,766
Maintain distance.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,059
His ship is damaged.

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,645
He's injured.

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,396
Let him bleed.

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,774
This prey is resilient.

9
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,860
We will lose the moment.

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,613
The way a creature
behaves

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,990
when it is wounded

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,575
is the key to
its destruction.

13
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,661
Maintain distance.

14
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,999
Direct hit.

15
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,167
Our hull armor is stable.

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,212
His weapons must
be weakening.

17
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,549
The prey is heading
for an asteroid belt.

18
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,552
Vector 168.9.

19
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,100
We are losing him.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,521
He hasn't come
here to hide.

21
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:06,358
He's come to make
a final stand.

22
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,239
Tracking.

23
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,661
He's holding position
above an asteroid

24
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,663
and he's left his ship.

25
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,289
Follow him.

26
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,501
The prey is scattering
our sensors.

27
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,087
Impressive.

28
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,966
He counters our pursuit
to the final moment.

29
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,508
Compensating.

30
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,178
No. Disengage sensors.

31
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,680
For what reason?

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,684
I want to take him
with my own eyes.

33
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,269
Follow.

34
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,406
I'll draw
his attack.

35
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,784
Prepare to target
his thoracic crest.

36
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,854
(<i> rocks clattering</i> )

37
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,522
(<i> growls</i> )

38
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,648
(<i> snarling</i> )

39
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,656
(<i> snarling shrieks</i> )

40
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,630
A flawless kill.

41
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,497
"Please remain still so that
I can treat your injuries.

42
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,166
"Thank you.

43
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,501
"I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

44
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,503
"I'll try to be more careful.

45
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,547
"Thanks for being
a patient patient.

46
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,716
Have a pleasant afternoon."
This is absurd.

47
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,051
Not at all.
Keep going.

48
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,219
You're doing fine.

49
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,762
This vernacular
is not applicable

50
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,014
to my duties on<i> Voyager.</i>

51
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,473
We can tailor the vocabulary

52
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,101
to your specific situations
a little later.

53
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,187
Right now, it's the
sentiment that counts.

54
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,938
I don't see the relevance.

55
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,440
I created these exercises
three years ago

56
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,152
to familiarize myself
with the social graces.

57
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,821
I found that if I repeated
them several times each day,

58
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,448
the words became
almost second nature.

59
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,950
Let's continue.

60
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,828
Exercise two:
"The workplace encounter."

61
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,913
Kes used to help me
with this one.

62
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,748
Now I'll be the nurse.
You be the doctor.

63
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,836
(<i> sighs</i> )

64
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,796
"Please hand me
the hypospray."

65
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,923
"Of course, doctor,
immediately."

66
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,884
"Thank you.
Looks at instrument."

67
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,178
No, no. Don't read that part--
only the dialogue.

68
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,140
"Excuse me, Nurse.

69
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,975
"This is the wrong
hypospray.

70
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,894
Would you mind finding
the correct one?"

71
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,895
"Not at all."

72
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,146
"Thank you."

73
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,397
"Did I mention you
look lovely today?"

74
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,858
"Oh, doctor,
you're so charming."

75
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,527
This lesson
is terminated.

76
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,156
I know it's awkward.

77
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,949
For me, it was
even painful,

78
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,535
but I think you'll find the
rewards well worth the effort.

79
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,037
Rewards.

80
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,121
The ability

81
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,706
to put others at ease...

82
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,251
make them feel more
comfortable around you.

83
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,170
You're a lot like me when
I was first activated.

84
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,504
If I'd had a mentor,

85
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,258
things would have gone
a lot more smoothly.

86
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,177
I'm willing to
share my wisdom,

87
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,098
but, if you're not
interested... fine.

88
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,225
I'll stick to your
physiological maintenance.

89
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,271
I will examine
your data.

90
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,980
Oh, good.

91
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,233
Pay special attention
to Exercise 17:

92
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,984
"Bridge banter
for beginners."

93
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,825
Have a pleasant day.

94
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,536
Hmm?

95
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,080
Verify.

96
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,415
Monotanium hull plating,

97
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,499
dicyclic warp signature--

98
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,543
the vessel is
definitely Hirogen.

99
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,795
They're moving to intercept.

100
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,422
Evasive maneuvers?

101
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,590
No. We need to settle
our differences here and now.

102
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,259
Hard about,
full impulse.

103
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,303
Red Alert.

104
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,887
They're in visual range.

105
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,931
On screen.

106
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,474
JANEWAY:
Hail them.

107
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,644
No response.

108
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,645
They're closing.

109
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,481
50,000 kilometers...

110
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,776
forty-five...
forty...

111
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,320
Maintain course, Mr. Paris.

112
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,737
Curious.

113
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,240
They are not
charging weapons.

114
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,825
PARIS:
They're slowing, sir.

115
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,034
CHAKOTAY:
Life signs?

116
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,161
TUVOK:
Only one.

117
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,620
And it's erratic.

118
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,414
They've stopped,
Captain.

119
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,249
Their engines just
went off-line.

120
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,877
This could be a trap.

121
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,506
Harry, run a long-range scan.

122
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,758
Are there any other
Hirogen ships out there?

123
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,513
None.

124
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,268
Take us within
transporter range.

125
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,354
You intend to board
their ship.

126
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,729
Yes.

127
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,691
The Hirogen vessel is
a potential threat.

128
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,526
We should destroy it.

129
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,695
Seven, what you
call a threat,

130
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,447
I call an opportunity...

131
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,907
to gain knowledge
about this species--

132
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,119
and in this case,
maybe even show some compassion.

133
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,247
There seems to be
a wounded pilot over there.

134
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,082
Our experience with
the Hirogen indicates

135
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,918
that compassion would
not be reciprocated.

136
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,046
And all of my experience says

137
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,089
we've got to take
that chance anyway.

138
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,427
JANEWAY:
Commander.

139
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,095
Tuvok, Paris,
you're with me.

140
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,334
Looks like there
was a fight.

141
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,963
Search for the life signs.

142
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,477
(<i> squeaking</i> )

143
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,730
(<i> squeaking</i> )

144
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,983
(<i> squeaking</i> )

145
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,639
Commander.

146
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,269
I'm reading bones,
muscle tissue...

147
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,229
from at least
nine different species.

148
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,441
It's all being broken down
by some sort of enzyme.

149
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,111
Perhaps this is their method
of denaturating their prey.

150
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,697
Either that... or it's dinner.

151
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,242
(<i> sighs</i> )

152
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,309
Looks like somebody
lost their helmet.

153
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,816
(<i> yells</i> )

154
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,488
Commander.

155
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,284
I'm not picking up
any weapon residuals.

156
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,037
I'd say he was
physically torn apart.

157
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,456
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

158
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,166
I'm picking up
the life signs.

159
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,250
This way.

160
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:06,100
(<i> wheezing</i> )

161
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,401
Massive internal bleeding.

162
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,152
Let's get him
to Sick Bay.

163
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,658
The data we downloaded
from the ship's computer

164
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,076
included
navigational records.

165
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,036
Can you give us a map
of this region?

166
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,041
This is the Hirogen vessel's
flight path

167
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,501
over the past five years.

168
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,920
They've certainly covered
a lot of space.

169
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,171
This ship alone has visited

170
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,549
over 90 star systems
in the last year.

171
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,092
I analyzed some of their logs.

172
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,177
From what I can tell,
this is a hunting species.

173
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,762
We saw the
skeletal remains

174
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,641
from dozens of alien races
displayed like trophies.

175
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,101
There was also evidence

176
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,353
they may be using some
of their victims for food.

177
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,770
The entire culture

178
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,440
seems to be based
on the hunt--

179
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,734
social rituals, art,
religious beliefs.

180
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,193
They're nomadic.

181
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,404
Their existence is driven
by the pursuit of prey.

182
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,531
And it's carried them
across huge distances.

183
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,908
There is no evidence
of a home planet.

184
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,036
Their ships travel alone
or in small groups.

185
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,122
On occasion,
several will join forces

186
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,457
in a multipronged attack.

187
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,083
Like wolves.

188
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,670
How's our "wolf" in Sick Bay?

189
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,550
TUVOK:
Still unconscious...
behind a level-5 force field.

190
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,636
You were right, Seven.

191
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,178
This species is a threat.

192
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,514
But despite the risk
of sending an away team,

193
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,476
we know a lot more about
who we're dealing with now.

194
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,185
You were correct, Captain.

195
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,811
It was worth the risk...

196
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,105
this time.

197
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,779
So, there's
one question remaining.

198
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,948
Who's hunting the hunters?

199
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,215
I was trying to remove
his body armor

200
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,217
to treat the
internal injuries,

201
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,094
when he suddenly
regained consciousness.

202
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,639
Needless to say,
he's not happy to be here.

203
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,683
Can you sedate him?
I've already tried.

204
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,685
His immune system
neutralizes everything.

205
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,603
I could synthesize
a more potent compound,

206
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,397
but that would take hours.
He could be dead by then.

207
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,856
His wounds are severe.

208
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,779
Your crewmate is dead...

209
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,449
and your ship has been damaged
beyond repair.

210
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,951
I brought you here
to treat your injuries.

211
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,954
What happened
to your ship?

212
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,832
Who attacked you?

213
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,378
The first time
I met your species,

214
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,754
it wasn't
on the best of terms,

215
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,464
but that doesn't mean
you and I

216
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,966
can't find a way
to change that.

217
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,343
Our prey.

218
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,887
You were on a hunt.

219
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,639
Yes.

220
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,683
A formidable alien.

221
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,976
We captured it two days ago,

222
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,562
but it broke free

223
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,231
of its restraints...
attacked us.

224
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,524
Release me.

225
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,109
I must continue the hunt.

226
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,446
Not without your ship
and not in this condition.

227
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,407
You'll die
without treatment.

228
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,617
Let us help you.

229
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,623
Doctor?

230
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,920
All right...

231
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,214
I'm going to enter
the force field now

232
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,551
and start with a few scans
of your midsection.

233
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,927
You should know I'm a hologram

234
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,555
and can't be bent,
spindled or mutilated

235
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,265
so don't bother trying.

236
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,643
Hmm.

237
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,937
Please lie down.

238
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,942
Or remain standing.

239
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,698
Captain, we've detected
six more Hirogen ships.

240
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,784
They're converging on us
from all directions.

241
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,159
The one in Sick Bay

242
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,454
may have sent a distress call
from his vessel.

243
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,789
How long do we have?

244
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,749
The nearest ship
is half a light-year away--

245
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,833
four hours at most.

246
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,379
Tom, analyze
their approach pattern.

247
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,756
Evade them as long as you can.

248
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,758
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,343
I want to buy the doctor enough
time to treat our hunter.

250
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,263
If I can gain his confidence,
he might call off his friends.

251
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,766
Good old-fashioned diplomacy
could get us out of this yet.

252
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,016
Don't count on it.

253
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,560
From what I found
in their database,

254
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,729
diplomacy isn't a part
of their lifestyle.

255
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,188
They don't see us as equals.

256
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,690
To them, we're simply game.

257
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,442
It's time
we convince them otherwise--

258
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,487
or like any other cornered
animal, we'll show our teeth.

259
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,156
TUVOK:
There's been
a hull rupture

260
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,491
on Deck 11, Section 3.

261
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,117
Damage is minor.

262
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,244
It appears
a plasma conduit overloaded.

263
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,331
Increase power to the structural
integrity field.

264
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,874
(<i> rumble</i> )

265
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,752
A bulkhead has collapsed
in Jefferies Tube 84.

266
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,211
Another overload?

267
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,881
KIM:
Negative.
The plasma network is stable.

268
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,342
This wasn't caused by any
power surge or system failure.

269
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,887
Harry, Tuvok, get to Deck 11
and check it out.

270
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,444
This was no overload.

271
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,946
Indeed.

272
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,783
Commander.

273
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,255
It's a dense mixture of DNA
and polyfluidic compounds.

274
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,215
Tuvok to Bridge.

275
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,508
JANEWAY:
<i>Go ahead.</i>

276
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,218
We may have
an intruder on board.

277
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,013
<i>I'm analyzing what could be</i>
<i>a sample of its blood.</i>

278
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:39,058
<i>The readings are consistent</i>
<i>with Species 8472.</i>

279
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,435
Intruder alert.

280
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,687
Bridge to Security.

281
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,397
Seal off Decks 10 through 12.

282
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,984
Internal sensors
aren't detecting any intruders.

283
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,611
The last time
we ran into this species,

284
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,072
it was impervious
to our scanners.

285
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,575
We'll have to track it visually.

286
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,453
How did it get
past our shields?

287
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,747
We'll worry about that later.

288
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,040
You have the Bridge, Commander.

289
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,207
I'll be on Deck 11.

290
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,381
I've erected a level-10 force
field around Engineering.

291
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,174
Good. Set up
secondary force fields

292
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,343
around every hatch,
Jefferies tube and conduit

293
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,678
leading into this room.

294
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,723
I want every one
of these consoles secured--

295
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,224
authorized
command codes only.

296
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,351
I'm going to lock down
the warp core.

297
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,103
Ensign, realign
the dilithium matrix

298
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,648
to a frequency of 3.69.

299
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,192
(<i> hissing</i> )

300
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,238
(<i> snarling</i> )

301
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,916
Report.

302
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,085
Four crew members are
wounded, two seriously.

303
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,838
Get them to Sick Bay.

304
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,340
Species 8472
accessed Engineering

305
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,009
through the antimatter
injector port.

306
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,762
Our phaser fire
was insufficient.

307
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,138
It attacked us,
then escaped

308
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,099
through Jefferies
Tube 17-Alpha.

309
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,600
Janeway to Tuvok.

310
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,851
<i>Tuvok here.</i>

311
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,519
The intruder
just left Engineering.

312
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,646
Seal off the area.

313
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,814
<i>Understood.</i>

314
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,898
Secure the warp core.

315
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,899
Yes, Captain.

316
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,067
Seven.

317
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,659
It would seem
that the Hirogen

318
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,201
underestimated
their latest prey.

319
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,203
You believe they were
hunting the creature.

320
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,332
Yes. When the Borg
were fighting Species 8472,

321
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,084
did they ever engage
in physical combat?

322
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,543
On many occasions.

323
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,713
Can you recall anything
that might help us here?

324
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,757
Each time they boarded
a Borg vessel,

325
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,843
they went directly to
the central power matrix

326
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,094
and disabled it.

327
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,762
The creature was just
in Engineering.

328
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,806
Didn't touch any
of our power systems.

329
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,850
It's obviously adjusted
its strategy.

330
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,687
Species 8472 is devious
and highly intelligent.

331
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,356
It will seek the most efficient
means of destroying us.

332
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,482
Let's get to Sick Bay.

333
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,414
DOCTOR:
She's going to be
just fine, Captain.

334
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,416
Is it alone?

335
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,127
Have you seen
any others like it?

336
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,503
Why?

337
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:15,173
Six months ago,
this species invaded our galaxy

338
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,340
with thousands of ships.

339
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,884
We were barely able
to fight them off.

340
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,927
Your prey could indicate
another invasion.

341
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,013
If it does,
we're all in trouble.

342
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,430
How many ships

343
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,557
have you seen?

344
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,601
Only one. Damaged.

345
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,938
We tracked it
across 50 light-years.

346
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,024
We thought that we had
killed the creature,

347
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,526
but this prey is
unlike any other.

348
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,319
It has many lives.

349
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,407
Lower the force field
and I will finish the hunt.

350
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,035
Your attempt to destroy
it will fail.

351
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,496
Species 8472 is highly
resistant to all technology.

352
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,499
All but one...
Borg nanoprobes.

353
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,751
"Nanoprobes"?

354
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,586
CHAKOTAY:
Microscopic
weapons that can

355
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,588
attack the species
on a cellular level.

356
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,840
We've tried it before
and it worked.

357
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,633
SEVEN:
I'll modify
the phaser rifles

358
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,135
to fire nanoprobe discharges.

359
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,345
I want you to incapacitate
the creature, not kill it.

360
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,223
Can you make
that modification?

361
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,850
Yes, but it would
require additional time.

362
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,186
We must stop it
as soon as possible.

363
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,311
She's right.

364
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,313
Not until we know
why it returned.

365
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,983
You will be exposing
this crew to unnecessary risk.

366
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,985
I disagree.
Captain...

367
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,320
You have your orders,
Seven.

368
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,323
Six of your vessels will be here
in under four hours.

369
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,744
I hope you'll let them know
that we saved your life

370
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:30,081
and we want to avoid any further
conflict with your people.

371
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:34,752
Let me resume the hunt,
and I will grant your request.

372
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,671
We have enough problems
on this ship as it is

373
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,257
without him running around.

374
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:42,593
I spent six months studying
this prey's behavior.

375
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,262
I know how to track him.

376
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:47,181
Let me continue

377
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,100
or I will have the others
destroy you.

378
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,979
<i>Tuvok to Janeway.</i>

379
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,272
Go ahead.

380
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,690
We're holding position
in Section 94,

381
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,902
but the creature has accessed
the environmental controls.

382
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,071
Deck 11 is losing life support.

383
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,743
Artificial gravity has also
been compromised.

384
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,120
<i>Evacuate the deck.</i>

385
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,496
Regroup on Deck 10.

386
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,705
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

387
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,000
He's trying to
barricade himself.

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,709
He did the same thing to us.

389
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,377
You want to be
part of the hunt?

390
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,963
Now's your chance.

391
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,465
He'll be under
your supervision, Commander.

392
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,093
If he steps out of
line, shoot him.

393
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,653
My weapon.

394
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,741
CHAKOTAY:
Temperature gradient.

395
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,451
PARIS:
Affirmative.

396
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,704
Atmospheric recyclers.

397
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,831
Engaged.

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,918
Is your body armor
designed to handle

399
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,545
rapid pressure
fluctuations?

400
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,632
It can defeat most
hostile environments.

401
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,886
I once tracked
a silicon-based life-form

402
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,388
through the neutronium mantle
of a collapsed star.

403
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:13,726
I once tracked a mouse
through Jefferies Tube 32.

404
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,107
Chakotay to Tuvok.
We're ready to go.

405
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,859
As are we.

406
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,361
<i>Proceed to Deck 11.</i>

407
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,154
<i>Keep your com links open.</i>

408
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,741
Understood. Activate
the nanoprobe charges.

409
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,493
Level five should be sufficient
to stun the creature.

410
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,591
Depressurizing hatch.

411
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,842
Magnetize.

412
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,491
Maintain your position.

413
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,869
He's here.

414
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,871
I said maintain
your position.

415
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,832
This is my hunt.

416
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,250
I'm at point.

417
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,295
My knowledge of this prey
is superior to yours.

418
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,754
But you're on
unfamiliar terrain.

419
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,590
I know this ship.
You don't.

420
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,303
The prey will likely attack
the man at point.

421
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,182
You would not survive.

422
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,476
I'll take that chance.

423
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,269
Now, fall back.

424
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,159
No problem.

425
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,785
I'll take up the rear.

426
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,440
You missed.

427
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,696
Since Species 8472
invaded the ship,

428
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,907
you've become
increasingly agitated.

429
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,909
They were the only species

430
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,661
to offer true resistance
to the Borg.

431
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,997
They destroyed
millions of drones,

432
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,749
hundreds of our worlds.

433
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,919
I have reason to be<i> agitated.</i>

434
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,308
PARIS:
What is it?

435
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,269
It's blood.

436
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,978
The prey is wounded.

437
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,065
This corridor ends
about 20 meters ahead.

438
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,692
The only thing down there
is Deflector Control.

439
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,528
It's got nowhere to run.

440
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,780
He is not planning to run.

441
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,614
He is waiting.

442
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:00,119
He'll attempt to slip around us,
attack from behind.

443
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,038
Chakotay to Tuvok.

444
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,457
<i>Tuvok here.</i>

445
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,376
We've cornered
the intruder in Section 59.

446
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,253
On our way.

447
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,471
(<i> moaning snarl</i> )

448
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,015
It's hurt.

449
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,351
This prey is resilient.

450
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,770
He will strike
with his dying breath.

451
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:31,900
We must kill him now.

452
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,569
That may not
be necessary.

453
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,654
Hold your fire.

454
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,739
I said lower
your weapon!

455
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,617
(<i> grunts</i> )

456
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,827
(<i> yells</i> )

457
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,830
(<i> squealing cries</i> )

458
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,082
(<i> gasps</i> )

459
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,807
(<i> weak snarling</i> )

460
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,985
Mr. Neelix, I must ask you

461
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,196
to exchange your spatula
for a phaser rifle.

462
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,489
Sir?

463
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,199
We have
two intruders onboard

464
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,159
and six Hirogen vessels
on the way.

465
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,578
I need additional
security personnel.

466
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,830
Right away, sir.

467
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,706
What's my assignment?

468
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,709
Join the security detail
on Deck 10, Section 12.

469
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,588
You'll receive
further instructions there.

470
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,965
I'll expect tactical updates
every 20 min...

471
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:40,927
(<i> gasping</i> )

472
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,388
Lieutenant?

473
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,056
Are you all right?

474
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,724
You have your orders.

475
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,479
Report.

476
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,064
The Hirogen's
back in Sick Bay

477
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,148
within a force field.

478
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,774
And Species 8472?

479
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,652
We've established
a security perimeter.

480
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,071
Basically, we've turned this
entire section into a brig.

481
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,323
As an added precaution,
have B'Elanna start working

482
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,741
on a way
to lock onto the creature,

483
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,493
in case we have to beam it
off the ship.

484
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,328
You mentioned it was injured.
In what way?

485
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,871
I wish I could tell
you for certain.

486
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,374
Its body is generating
some sort bioelectric field

487
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,709
making it impossible
to scan,

488
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,127
so I could only make
a visual diagnosis.

489
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,213
It's conscious
but immobile.

490
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,340
Its epidermis displays
any number of injuries--

491
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,551
punctures, energy burns--

492
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,387
and its demeanor is that
of a wounded animal.

493
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,931
The Hirogen said they'd been
chasing it for several months.

494
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,266
Is there anything
you can do?

495
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,101
I don't know enough
about its physiology

496
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,310
to treat
the surface wounds,

497
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,895
let alone
any internal damage.

498
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,522
Frankly, I'm at a loss.

499
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,900
Captain, just
before we cornered it,

500
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,820
Species 8472 accessed deflector
control from this panel.

501
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,989
I've analyzed
the transmission protocols.

502
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,909
It was attempting to open
a singularity into its realm,

503
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,952
but it failed.

504
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,496
It was trying
to get home.

505
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,081
That's what it looks like.

506
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,632
(<i> weak snarling moan</i> )

507
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,051
Tuvok?

508
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,553
The creature

509
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,473
initiated telepathic
contact with me.

510
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,434
What's it saying?

511
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,819
Its ship was damaged during
the conflict with the Borg.

512
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,782
When the other members
of its species retreated

513
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,533
into fluidic space...

514
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,118
it was left behind.

515
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,751
It has been trapped in the
Delta Quadrant ever since...

516
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,211
alone...

517
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,089
pursued
by Hirogen hunting parties.

518
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:45,385
It has no desire
for further conflict.

519
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,429
It only wants to return

520
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,055
to its domain.

521
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,684
It is dying,
Captain.

522
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,943
You have nothing
to be afraid of.

523
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,699
We're going to help you
get back to your realm.

524
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,908
Does it
understand?

525
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,786
It does.

526
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,954
It will
take time

527
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,748
to open a singularity,

528
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:19,044
and we have no way
of treating your injuries,

529
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,547
but if there's anything
you can tell us about your...

530
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,299
(<i> snarling groans</i> )

531
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,181
It has lost
consciousness.

532
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,975
Our telepathic link
has been severed.

533
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,405
Where is my prey?

534
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,698
Lying at the end
of a corridor

535
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,033
on Deck 11...

536
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,951
nearly dead thanks to you.

537
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,245
Take me to it.

538
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,371
No.

539
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,707
Take me to it!

540
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,292
In less than three hours,
your ships will arrive.

541
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:05,006
By that time, Species 8472
will no longer be on<i> Voyager.</i>

542
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,383
What do you mean?

543
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,552
I'm sending it back
where it came from.

544
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,430
Surrender the creature to<i> me</i>

545
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,266
and you will not be harmed.

546
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,934
This isn't a hunt;
it's a slaughter.

547
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,103
And I'm calling it off
right now.

548
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:22,858
We will not be denied our prey.

549
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,778
Give us the creature....

550
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,533
or your crew
will take its place.

551
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,787
Tuvok?

552
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,715
Have Seven of Nine
report to my ready room.

553
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,007
You intend to ask her

554
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,218
to open a rift
into 8472's realm.

555
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,011
She's the only one
on board who knows how.

556
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,680
Given her feelings
toward the species,

557
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,098
she may not want
to cooperate.

558
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,141
We'll see.

559
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,316
You wish to see me,
Captain?

560
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,400
I've made a decision

561
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,986
about Species 8472.

562
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,114
I'm going to return it
to fluidic space.

563
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,409
In order to do that, I need you
to open a quantum singularity.

564
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,829
I don't believe that is
a prudent course of action.

565
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,413
I realize it may be

566
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,374
difficult for you to help
save this creature's life,

567
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:25,003
but part of becoming human
is learning to have compassion

568
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,672
for those who are suffering,

569
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:29,967
even when they're
your bitter enemies.

570
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,093
Why?

571
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,932
I remember
when I was a Lieutenant.

572
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:40,018
It was during
a Cardassian border conflict.

573
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,854
My away team was cut off

574
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,189
while we were defending
a Federation outpost.

575
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,732
We'd been exchanging
phaser fire

576
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,694
with a group of Cardassians
for about three days--

577
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,529
a stalemate.

578
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:57,076
One night, during
a break in the fighting...

579
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,706
we could hear
this low moaning sound

580
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,791
coming from somewhere
in the brush.

581
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,210
We knew that none of
our people were out there,

582
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,212
so it had to be
a wounded Cardassian.

583
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,798
Well, you have to understand--

584
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,258
we'd been killing each other
for weeks on this planet.

585
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,719
It was brutal.

586
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,348
But our commanding officer
decided...

587
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,561
that we couldn't just sit there

588
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,563
and listen
to that poor man suffer.

589
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:29,192
So he ordered me
and an Ensign...

590
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,487
to crawl out there

591
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,823
and bring that Cardassian
back to our camp.

592
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,074
I thought he was crazy.

593
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,076
He was risking our lives
for someone

594
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,412
who would have shot us
without hesitation.

595
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,331
But we did it...

596
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,502
and the Cardassian lived.

597
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,255
Three days later,
we secured the outpost.

598
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,882
It was a major victory.

599
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,551
We were all decorated
by Starfleet Command,

600
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,429
but in retrospect...

601
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,723
the thing I'm most proud of

602
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,601
was the night we saved
that man's life.

603
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,312
Explain.

604
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,906
A single act of compassion

605
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,951
can put you in touch
with your own humanity.

606
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,453
You are trying to justify

607
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,204
your present decision.

608
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,831
No.

609
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,835
I'm trying to help you see
this as an opportunity to grow.

610
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,671
I know you don't want
to do it, Seven,

611
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,882
but I'm telling you
as your Captain

612
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,843
and as your friend,
you won't regret it.

613
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,346
No.

614
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,975
Your decision is
tactically unsound.

615
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,102
We will be surrounded
by Hirogen ships

616
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,478
in approximately two hours.

617
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,105
If we do not surrender
the creature,

618
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,273
they will destroy us.

619
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,985
A lesson in compassion
will do me little good

620
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,235
if I am dead.

621
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,489
It is wrong to sacrifice
another being

622
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,116
to save our own lives.

623
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,951
I have observed that
you have been willing

624
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:03,411
to sacrifice your own life
to save the lives of your crew.

625
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,956
Yes, but that's different.
That was my choice.

626
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,249
This creature
does not have a choice.

627
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,586
It invaded our ship,

628
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,797
put our lives at risk
to save its own.

629
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,134
In my view, it has already
forfeited its freedom.

630
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,678
I'm giving you an order.

631
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,096
Report to Deflector Control

632
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,807
and begin working
on creating a singularity.

633
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,851
I will not comply.

634
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,187
I have agreed
to remain on<i> Voyager.</i>

635
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,856
I have agreed to function

636
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:34,192
as a member of your crew,
but I will not be a willing

637
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,277
participant
in my own destruction

638
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,237
or the destruction of this ship.

639
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,240
Objection noted.

640
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,367
We'll do this without you.

641
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,995
You will fail.

642
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,664
And you have just
crossed the line.

643
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:48,665
End of debate.

644
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,833
Report to the cargo bay

645
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,668
and remain there
until this is over.

646
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,670
Is that understood?

647
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,649
Shields down to 84 percent.

648
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,193
Return fire.

649
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:19,362
Three more ships are closing
from port and starboard. 

650
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,614
All escape trajectories
have been cut off.

651
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,325
Our weapons are having little
effect on their hull plating.

652
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,953
I'm scanning for weaknesses
in the molecular structure.

653
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,754
Shields at 79 percent.

654
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,005
TUVOK:
They are hailing us.

655
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,715
Better late than never.

656
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,968
Open a channel.

657
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,470
<i>You've taken our prey</i>
<i>and one of our hunters.</i>

658
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,389
<i>Surrender them.</i>

659
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,601
Call off your attack
and we'll return your crewman.

660
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,396
As for your prey,
it's under our protection now.

661
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,731
<i>It belongs to us.</i>

662
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,275
It belongs to no one.

663
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,860
Now, order your ships
to withdraw

664
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,237
and this can end peacefully.

665
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,076
All vessels are firing.

666
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,911
Any luck finding a
crack in their armor?

667
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,121
Not yet.

668
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,504
Doctor to Bridge.

669
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,049
Species 8472
appears to be regenerating.

670
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,343
I'm no exobiologist,

671
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,180
but I'd say this fellow
is becoming highly agitated.

672
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,015
It could be sensing
the Hirogen attack.

673
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,058
Doctor, can you sedate it?

674
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,643
<i>I believe so,</i>

675
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,812
<i>but I'll need another dose</i>
<i>of Borg nanoprobes.</i>

676
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,439
Stand by.

677
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,066
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

678
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,859
Yes.

679
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,737
<i>Report to Deck 11 immediately</i>
<i>with a supply of nanoprobes.</i>

680
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,072
Understood.

681
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,829
B'Elanna, how's it going
down there?

682
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,371
Transporters are ready.

683
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,874
I can establish a lock
on the creature at any time,

684
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,418
but I still haven't duplicated
the deflector protocols

685
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,795
to open a singularity.

686
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,005
<i>How long?</i>

687
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,633
I need another hour...
maybe two.

688
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,718
Captain, we can outmaneuver
the Hirogen ships

689
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,679
for a few more minutes,
but beyond that...

690
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,931
Direct hit
to the EPS manifold!

691
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,308
Main power just went down!

692
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:14,186
Force fields on all decks
are off-line.

693
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,146
Switch to auxiliary power.

694
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,897
Done. Force fields
have been restored,

695
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,441
but I don't know
how long they'll hold.

696
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,819
Bridge to doctor.
Report.

697
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,862
It's all right, Captain.

698
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,488
The creature is contained.

699
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,573
Bridge to Sick Bay.

700
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,160
Security respond.

701
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,753
Security,
dispatch teams to Deck 5.

702
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,048
The Hirogen may be loose.

703
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,633
Direct hit
to our port nacelle.

704
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,387
Now, they've taken out
our starboard nacelle.

705
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,763
They've crippled us.

706
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,932
Tuvok, divert warp power
to the phaser banks.

707
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,059
Maybe that'll help us

708
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,643
penetrate their
hull plating.

709
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,774
The nanoprobes?

710
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,734
Armed and ready.

711
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,569
Not a moment too soon.

712
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,364
(<i> groaning</i> )

713
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,911
Give me the prey.

714
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,206
Lower your weapon
or I will destroy you.

715
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,253
I don't think you will.

716
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:24,005
You want me to destroy
this creature.

717
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:28,509
I saw it on your face
earlier in the medical bay.

718
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,929
It's a look I've seen
a thousand times.

719
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,349
Stand aside.

720
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,354
(<i> snarling fiercely</i> )

721
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,160
What are you doing?

722
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,415
Captain, someone's accessing
the transporter system

723
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,332
from Deck 5.

724
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,209
Lock them out.
I can't.

725
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,919
They're overriding
my commands...

726
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,963
with Borg encryption codes.

727
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,935
JANEWAY:
Report, Mr. Kim.

728
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,686
8472 and the Hirogen...

729
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,855
they've been beamed to one
of the attacking ships.

730
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,483
All six vessels are moving away
at high warp.

731
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,277
Tom, can we pursue?

732
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,029
I'm sorry, Captain.

733
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,906
Warp engines
are still off-line.

734
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,244
Resume our
previous course.

735
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,329
Full impulse.

736
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,042
Seven of Nine?

737
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,922
Seven of Nine.

738
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:53,886
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51652.3.</i>

739
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,638
<i>It's been 12 hours</i>

740
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,599
<i>and our sensors show no sign</i>
<i>of any Hirogen vessels,</i>

741
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,019
<i>but their people are scattered</i>
<i>throughout this region</i>

742
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,603
<i>and something tells me</i>

743
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,939
<i>that the "hunt" for</i>
Voyager<i> is far from over.</i>

744
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,894
Captain.

745
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,437
Step down, please.

746
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:52,320
Seven, you disobeyed
my direct orders

747
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,322
and as a result,

748
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,033
you condemned a sentient
being to its death.

749
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,618
By doing so, I also diverted
the Hirogen attack,

750
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,371
an attack which
would have destroyed us.

751
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,872
Maybe not.

752
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,750
In any case, the decision
wasn't yours to make.

753
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,586
The creature broke the force
field. I had no choice.

754
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,796
I didn't come here to
debate your decision.

755
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,425
I came here to inform you
of the consequences.

756
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,052
When you first
came to<i> Voyager,</i>

757
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,929
I decided to grant you
the same liberties

758
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,805
and freedoms of any crew member

759
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,559
because I wanted you to
be a part of this family.

760
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,062
And I've been willing
to accommodate your...

761
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,106
unique way of doing things--

762
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,608
even when you rubbed
somebody the wrong way

763
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,193
or violated protocol.

764
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,946
But this time,
I can't accommodate you.

765
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:39,325
From this point forward,
you will no longer have access

766
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,245
to any primary systems
on this ship--

767
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,830
not without my
direct authorization.

768
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,916
If you attempt
to circumvent me,

769
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,918
I'll throw you in the brig.

770
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,253
I still need your expertise

771
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,088
in the Astrometrics
Lab if you're willing.

772
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:55,300
If not, you can spend your
time here in the cargo bay.

773
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,302
Is that understood?

774
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,430
Yes.

775
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,269
It is puzzling.

776
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,437
What's that?

777
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,608
You made me into an individual.

778
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,568
You encouraged me
to stop thinking

779
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,236
like a member of the collective,

780
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:19,407
to cultivate my independence
and my humanity.

781
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,785
But when I try to assert that
independence, I am punished.

782
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,122
Individuality has its limits...

783
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,375
especially on a starship where
there's a command structure.

784
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,089
I believe
that you are punishing me

785
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,425
because I do not think
the way that you do,

786
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,260
because I am not becoming

787
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,596
more like you.

788
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,098
You claim to respect
my individuality,

789
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:47,602
but in fact,
you are frightened by it.

790
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,688
As you were.
