00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:06,674
NEELIX:
<i>Ambassador's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53263.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,761
<i>Though helpful during</i>
<i>my negotiations</i>
<i>on the Kesat homeworld,</i>

3
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>Commander Tuvok certainly</i>
<i>hasn't been the most sociable</i>

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,808
<i>of travel companions.</i>

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,351
Mr. Neelix.

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,227
Sorry.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:29,321
How about a game
of "Species, Starship
or Anomaly"?

8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,241
Surely you could find
something more productive
to occupy your time.

9
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,119
Come on, Tuvok.
It'll be fun.

10
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,247
You think of something--
species, anomaly or starship--

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,500
and I have 15 questions
to guess what it is.

12
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,042
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

13
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,796
I would prefer
some peace and quiet.

14
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,965
How about a riddle?

15
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,175
Mr. Neelix.

16
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,177
Come on!

17
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,555
Ha. It'll be fun.

18
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,640
I have no desire
for fun.

19
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,350
Okay, forget fun.

20
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,895
A good riddle can
stimulate the mind.

21
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,314
Now, no self-respecting
Vulcan can say no to that.

22
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,316
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Very well.

23
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,151
<i>One</i> riddle.

24
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,696
Okay, here goes.

25
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:14,074
A lone Ensign finds
himself stranded

26
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,327
on a Class-L planetoid
with no rations.

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,623
His only possession...
a calendar.

28
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,835
When Starfleet finds
him 12 months later,

29
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,754
he's in perfect health.

30
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,424
Why didn't he
starve to death?

31
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,301
It is a theoretical possibility

32
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,889
that such planetoids contain
hot water springs,

33
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,600
which could sustain the man
for several weeks.

34
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,936
Ooh, but not for
a whole year.

35
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,855
I concur.
Logic dictates

36
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,232
that the Ensign
in question would perish.

37
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,109
Aha!
(<i> laughs</i> )

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,695
Ha! I stumped you.

39
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,739
As a matter of fact,

40
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,284
he not only survived,
but his belly was full.

41
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,955
Why? Because he feasted
on "dates" from the calendar.

42
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,708
Your answer is merely wordplay.

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,087
It has no basis in reality.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,298
Where are you going?
To find some peace and quiet.

45
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,301
Have fun.

46
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,941
(<i> console beeping</i> )

47
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,615
Tuvok to Neelix.

48
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,533
Miss me already, Commander?

49
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,036
Did you activate
the aft tactical station?

50
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,245
No.

51
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,539
Why?

52
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,918
There appears to be
a download in progress.

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,920
That's odd.

54
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,339
I'm detecting
anomalous readings.

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,508
What sort of readings?

56
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,011
I'm not certain, but I believe

57
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,637
it's a cloaking frequency
that consists...

58
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,764
(<i> groaning</i> )

59
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,642
(<i> static</i> )

60
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,435
Commander?

61
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,483
Tuvok!

62
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,028
<i>Delta Flyer</i> to<i> Voyager.</i>
<i>Mayday!</i>

63
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,738
(<i> grunting</i> )

64
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,952
Tuvok, what happened?

65
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,152
Report.

66
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,820
He's in neuroleptic shock.

67
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,822
I'll need another
20 milligrams of synaptizine.

68
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,448
I'll get it.

69
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,706
It's not working.
I'll need to try
direct cortical stimulation.

70
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,127
Initiate a neurostatic
pulse on my mark.
Right.

71
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,795
(<i> grunting</i> )

72
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,046
Now!

73
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,339
(<i> pulsing sound</i> )

74
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,633
Again!

75
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,599
(<i> sighs</i> ):
His vital signs have stabilized

76
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,768
for the moment, anyway.

77
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,022
But he suffered severe
neurological trauma.

78
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,066
Do you know
what caused it?

79
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,818
Some kind of
alien weapon.

80
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,987
NEELIX:
By the time
I reached Tuvok,

81
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,363
whoever had attacked him
was gone.

82
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,782
What about
the surrounding space?

83
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,366
Any indication
of cloaked vessels?

84
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,286
Between trying to tend
to the Commander

85
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,746
and piloting the<i> Flyer,</i>
<i>I had my hands full.</i>

86
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,168
I... I didn't think
to scan for cloaked ships.
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,794
You saved Tuvok's life,
Neelix.

88
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,504
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

89
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,464
How do you plan
to treat him?

90
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,550
I won't know until
I've run a series of
neurological scans.

91
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,177
But it would
certainly help

92
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,970
to know something
about the weapon.

93
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,598
Neelix, these Kesat
you were negotiating with...

94
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,143
any reason to believe they
might know something about this?

95
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,354
It couldn't
hurt to ask.

96
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,065
Time to reopen
diplomatic channels.

97
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,866
Deputy Investigator Naroq,
Kesat Security.

98
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,745
Captain Janeway,
Commander Chakotay,
Ambassador Neelix.

99
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,580
You've done
your homework.

100
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,874
I familiarized myself
with the facts
on the way here.

101
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,918
We're hoping you can help us
shed some light

102
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,378
on what happened
to our crewman.

103
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,921
I believe I can.

104
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,797
Based on the information
you provided,

105
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,633
it is my opinion that he was
a victim of the Ba'Neth.

106
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,053
I've never heard of them.
NAROQ: I'm not surprised.

107
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,430
In my language, their name
means "shadow people."

108
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,600
They're a species
obsessed with concealing
their identity--

109
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,852
extremely paranoid
and xenophobic.

110
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,979
Well, that explains
their cloaking technology.

111
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,190
It's my belief
they've been responsible

112
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,901
for several unexplained attacks
similar to this one.

113
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,694
Why wasn't I
warned about them

114
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,696
during my negotiations
with your government?

115
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,489
Because my government's
official position

116
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,409
is that
the Ba'Neth do not exist.

117
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,452
Most people think
they're a myth.

118
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,871
There's nothing mythical about
what happened to Mr. Tuvok.

119
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,291
Why is your government
so skeptical?

120
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,127
Because there have been
so few encounters
with the Ba'Neth.

121
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,130
And, well, no one's ever
actually seen one.

122
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,716
How many encounters
are we talking about exactly?

123
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,011
Before this incident, 12.

124
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,389
I guess we're lucky 13.

125
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,308
You're lucky
I gave my supervisor

126
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,684
two bottles of Kesatian ale
to get this assignment.

127
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,770
Any other inspector would have
simply attributed

128
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,399
Commander Tuvok's injuries
to "unexplained phenomena."

129
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,568
No offense, Mr. Naroq,

130
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,947
but what makes you so sure
the Ba'Neth aren't just a myth?

131
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,199
This incident fits
the pattern, Captain.

132
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,285
All of the alleged encounters

133
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,745
have occurred aboard vessels
foreign to this sector.

134
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,831
I believe they've been
attempts by the Ba'Neth

135
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,292
to assess the technology
of new arrivals.

136
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,462
They were trying to
download tactical data.

137
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,630
And Commander Tuvok suffered
severe neural damage.

138
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,049
That's also consistent
with previous attacks.

139
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,595
The Ba'Neth were making sure
he would not tell anyone
what he saw.

140
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,599
Maybe that's why Tuvok's
tricorder was destroyed.

141
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:41,604
They didn't want us to see
the cloaking frequency
he'd found.

142
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,940
He found a cloaking frequency?

143
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,608
Apparently.

144
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,944
Captain, I don't blame you

145
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,030
for finding my theories
a bit eccentric.

146
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,656
I'm used to it.

147
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,201
It's why I'm still
a deputy investigator.

148
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,412
But I've brought equipment
to help your investigation.

149
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,539
Let me examine Commander Tuvok

150
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,875
and run scans on the vessel
where he was attacked.

151
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,420
I may finally be able
to prove my theories.

152
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:10,217
With all due respect,
we're more interested
in saving Tuvok's life.

153
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,595
If we work together,
maybe we can do both.

154
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,434
His cognitive, memory
and logic centers

155
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,019
have all been
severely damaged.

156
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,396
But he still has
brain activity,

157
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,938
which is more
than I can say

158
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,690
for any of the
previous victims.

159
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,650
Vulcan neural tissue
is extremely resilient.

160
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,610
I have no doubt that a brain
from a lesser species

161
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,779
would not have survived.

162
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,824
If you could only
tell us what you saw,
Mr. Tuvok.

163
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,785
I don't think we'll be hearing
from him anytime soon.

164
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,038
Keep working.
I'll let you know

165
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,374
if we find anything
that might help.

166
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,126
I'll take you to see
where the attack occurred.

167
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,391
Something I can do
for you, Mr. Neelix?

168
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,059
I want to help.

169
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,144
Unless you have a degree
in Vulcan neurobiology

170
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,856
that I'm not aware of,
there's nothing you can do.

171
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,900
There must be something.

172
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,985
My advice is to return
to your quarters

173
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,737
and get some rest.

174
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,365
There's no way that I'm
going to be able to sleep

175
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,201
knowing that Tuvok
is lying here like this.

176
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,000
There have been rare cases

177
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,046
in which comatose patients
responded to external stimuli:

178
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,925
aromas, touch, voices.

179
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,928
So... you're saying
that if I stay here

180
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,846
and, and try to talk to Tuvok,
I might be able

181
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,765
to provoke some sort
of response.

182
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:45,270
If anyone can provoke Tuvok,
Mr. Neelix, it's you.

183
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,364
Good morning, Tuvok!

184
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,575
I brought you a few more
items from your quarters

185
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,701
to help liven up
Sick Bay.

186
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,787
Your<i> kal-toh</i> game,

187
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,873
in case you decide
you're ready for a match.

188
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,836
Oh, and I also thought
that you might enjoy
a recitation

189
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,088
of that classic
proto-Vulcan drama,

190
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,049
<i>Clash on</i>
<i>the Fire Plains.</i>

191
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:19,095
I'll be performing
all 23 parts myself.

192
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,973
Uh, I also brought
you some flowers

193
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,142
from Airponics Bay.

194
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,811
Oh, that's fragrant, isn't it?

195
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,111
Uh, perhaps you'd enjoy
some Vulcan incense.

196
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,036
Now, how about some music?

197
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:48,707
Computer, access
Vulcan audio file,

198
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,753
selection 56-Alpha.

199
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,090
(<i> voices chanting atonally</i> )

200
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,474
Mr. Neelix, what is
that dreadful noise?

201
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,101
<i>The Chants of the Monks</i>
<i>of T'Panit.</i>

202
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,853
Personally, I think
it's dreadful, too,

203
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,064
but it's one of
Tuvok's favorites.

204
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,650
I appreciate
your efforts, Mr. Neelix,
but I'm trying to analyze

205
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,610
his latest
neurological scans,

206
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,447
and this music
is very distracting.

207
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,740
You said I was
supposed to stimulate
his senses.

208
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,661
I said stimulate
them, Mr. Neelix,
not annihilate them.

209
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,622
Computer, pause music.

210
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,541
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Thank you.

211
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,548
Doctor.

212
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,594
Tuvok!

213
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:46,433
You've had an accident.
You're in Sick Bay.

214
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,438
Relax, Commander,
I only want to scan you.

215
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,231
NEELIX:
Don't worry, Tuvok.

216
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,650
He's only trying
to help you.

217
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,075
It's only a tricorder.

218
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,910
See?

219
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,663
I-it won't hurt you.

220
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,124
Now try it.

221
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,887
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Well done, Mr. Neelix.

222
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,900
Commander Chakotay says
you've found something.

223
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,194
That, Captain,
is an understatement.

224
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,862
Listen.

225
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,407
(<i> chirping</i> )
What is it?

226
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,535
The sound of history
being made.

227
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,704
Less poetry, Mr. Naroq,
more facts.

228
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,207
The sound you're hearing
indicates the presence
of veridium isotopes.

229
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,918
Residual particles
from the Ba'Neths'
cloaking field.

230
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,212
You've detected
these isotopes before?

231
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,089
Yes, but only
after they've decayed.

232
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,342
You see, veridium has
a very brief half-life--

233
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,511
less than 70 hours.

234
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,597
The previous sites I've
studied have been months,
sometimes years old!

235
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,641
But these isotopes
are still active.

236
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,560
We can use Mr. Naroq's
photolitic converter
to illuminate them.

237
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,147
So you see, Captain,
why this is an historic moment?

238
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,609
We may finally learn
what the Ba'Neth look like.

239
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,778
Well, let's see
what we've got.

240
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,954
You don't know how long
I've waited to meet you.

241
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,041
So, the Ba'Neth aren't a myth
after all.

242
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,084
This is the clearest image
ever captured!

243
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,212
Perhaps.
I believe I can adjust

244
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,088
our internal sensors
to improve it.

245
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,757
What are you doing?
What are you...

246
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,176
You might disrupt
the image entirely.

247
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,766
Tentacles!

248
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,310
I always suspected
they were multipeds.

249
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,270
Doctor to the Captain.

250
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,022
Please report to Sick Bay.

251
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,566
I'm on my way.

252
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,318
Seven...
if we can integrate

253
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,321
Mr. Naroq's
photolitic technology
into the deflector array,

254
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,115
we might be able to de-cloak
a Ba'Neth ship.

255
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,326
The technology only
works at close range.

256
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,953
We have to find
the ship before
we can expose it.

257
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,164
We still need that
cloaking frequency.

258
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,875
One step at a time.

259
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,714
DOCTOR:
The Vulcan brain--

260
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,591
a puzzle
wrapped inside an enigma,

261
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,760
housed inside a cranium.

262
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,263
Tuvok's neural pathways
have begun to bypass
the damaged tissue.

263
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,014
They're forming
new synaptic connections.

264
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,225
In effect, his brain
is rewiring itself.

265
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,436
Whether this is due
to<i> my</i> neurostatic therapy

266
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,979
or Neelix's
rehabilitation regimen

267
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,981
or some combination of the two,
I can't be certain.

268
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,276
Is there any chance he'll
make a full recovery?

269
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,944
It's much too soon to say,

270
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,071
but he's alert
and he's already regained

271
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,489
his basic motor skills.

272
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,366
But still no speech.

273
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,243
NEELIX:
It's only a matter
of time, Captain.

274
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,078
Look how far
he's come already.

275
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,581
I hope you're right, Neelix.
But if he could talk,

276
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,959
he might be able
to tell us something about
that cloaking frequency.

277
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,169
We're not sure
how much he recalls.

278
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,213
For that matter,
we're not certain

279
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:08,217
he recognizes any of us
or even knows who<i> he</i> is.

280
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,053
I'm going to take him
on a tour of the ship.

281
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,514
The Doctor thinks that
familiar sights and sounds

282
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,309
might get the old
synaptic juices flowing.

283
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,272
Don't worry, Captain.

284
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,065
Tuvok will be back
to his old self

285
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,610
before you can say,
"live long and prosper."

286
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,165
I've brought a visitor.

287
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,375
CHAKOTAY:
Good to see you
up and around.

288
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,212
You remember
Commander Chakotay.

289
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,930
We were just running
a shield diagnostic.

290
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,223
Would you like
to take a look?

291
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,018
This is Tactical Station,
where you work.

292
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,901
Just keeping it
warm for you.

293
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,611
Hope you don't mind.

294
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,033
That's the shield array.

295
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,369
This controls
the tractor emitters.

296
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,789
I think he remembers it.

297
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,959
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

298
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,170
You just activated
the photon torpedo banks.

299
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,088
That's all
right, Tuvok.

300
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,174
Everybody
makes mistakes.

301
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,887
We'll be back later.

302
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,191
Last... but not least...

303
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,737
your quarters.

304
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,408
You spend a lot
of time here,

305
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,243
reading...

306
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,953
meditating...

307
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,416
Mr. Paris once
referred to it

308
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,209
as the "Vulcan Vault."

309
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,211
(<i> chuckles</i> )

310
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,256
Ahh...

311
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,217
Well, look around, explore.

312
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,431
Astrometrics to the Bridge.
Mr. Naroq and I

313
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,433
have completed our
deflector modifications.

314
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,226
We're ready
to test the array.

315
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,395
Stand by. Reduce speed
to one-quarter impulse.

316
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,606
Harry, full power
to the deflector array.

317
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,399
KIM:
Aye.

318
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,903
All right, Seven...
do it.

319
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,989
Activating the deflector.

320
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,037
I'd call that
a pretty successful test.

321
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,081
They've been watching
us all along.

322
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,874
Hail them.

323
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,501
Which one?

324
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,378
There's practically
a fleet out there.

325
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,011
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

326
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,596
We intend you no harm.

327
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,724
They're charging weapons.
Shields.

328
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,602
They're scrambling, Captain,

329
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,853
in all directions.

330
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,939
Follow the lead vessel.

331
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,070
(<i> crying out</i> )

332
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,281
It's okay, Tuvok.

333
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,908
I'm here with you.

334
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,244
Everything is going
to be all right.

335
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,582
You're safe with me.

336
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,505
Still no response
to our hails.

337
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,591
I hate to ruin a good chase,
but the Ba'Neth ship

338
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,885
is moving out of
the deflector's range.

339
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,220
Seven, can you get
their cloaking frequency?

340
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,973
They're blocking our scans.

341
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,223
We've lost them.

342
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,605
They're gone now, Tuvok.

343
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,696
I told you you'd be safe.

344
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,366
Yes...

345
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,160
you did.

346
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,330
Tuvok?

347
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,628
What?

348
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,341
Tell me, what did I do?

349
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,927
You told me...

350
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,680
I wouldn't be hurt.

351
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,353
Do you know who I am?

352
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,857
You are Neelix.

353
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,319
I'm safe... with you.

354
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,585
We need Tuvok to tell us
anything he can remember
about the attack.

355
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,129
Captain, he may be
talking again,

356
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,924
but that doesn't mean
he's ready to be interrogated.

357
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,594
He's beginning
to experience emotions--
volatile ones.

358
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,722
During this last encounter with
the Ba'Neth, he was terrified.

359
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,016
We'll tread lightly,
I promise.

360
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,897
All right, Tuvok,
you can come in now.

361
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,196
It's nice to see you.

362
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,699
Captain Janeway.

363
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,867
That's right.

364
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,827
This is Mr. Naroq.

365
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,829
Please sit down.

366
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,708
Two days ago, you
were aboard a shuttle
with Mr. Neelix.

367
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,169
You detected
a cloaked intruder.

368
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,963
He attacked you.

369
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,049
Yes...

370
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,384
th-that's why I'm having
difficulty now.

371
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,971
Yes, and in order
to help you,

372
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,890
we have to find
the people who hurt you.

373
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,059
Before the intruder
injured you,

374
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,812
you managed to scan
him with this.

375
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,064
You recorded his
cloaking frequency,

376
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,941
but the tricorder
was damaged

377
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,359
and the information
was lost.

378
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,904
Can you tell us anything
about that frequency?

379
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,739
Try to remember.

380
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,205
I was scanning.

381
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,000
That's right.
What did you see?

382
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,760
I... I don't remember.
Try!

383
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,720
JANEWAY: All right,
that's enough.

384
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,346
We're done for now.
But, Captain...

385
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,348
Join Seven of Nine
in Astrometrics.

386
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,227
See if she's made any progress
with the Ba'Neth.

387
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,732
Well, uh, we should
be going, too.

388
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,694
A few of the crew have
offered to help with
Tuvok's rehabilitation.

389
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,655
I thought we might have lunch
later, just the two of us.

390
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,742
I prefer to stay with Neelix.

391
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,912
Oh, Tuvok... I'm-I'm sure
that you would...

392
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,789
It's all right.
You two go ahead.

393
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,457
I have a lot of work
to do anyway.

394
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,959
Oh...

395
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,927
The object of the game
is to turn this
jumble of rods

396
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,762
into a perfect sphere.

397
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,182
We take turns
positioning our pieces.

398
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,852
Whoever gets the shape
to appear first wins.

399
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,355
I like the way it looks now.

400
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,606
(<i> chuckling</i> )

401
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,568
What do you say
we give it a try?

402
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,113
This has always been one
of your favorite games, Tuvok.

403
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,909
It helps keep
your logic sharp.

404
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,493
I'll go first.

405
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,128
Now you.

406
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,297
Go ahead.

407
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,280
I don't like this game.

408
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,282
When you first taught me
how to play,

409
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,534
I wasn't very good, either,
but you kept encouraging me

410
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,787
and pretty soon, I scored
my first<i> kal-toh.</i>

411
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,748
It just takes
practice,
that's all.

412
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,293
Try again.
You can do it.

413
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,669
I don't like this game!

414
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,351
The Doctor helped me access
my personnel file.

415
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,939
NEELIX:
Nice picture.

416
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,523
You should see mine.

417
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,818
It's awful.

418
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:50,072
I was an instructor
at Starfleet Academy.

419
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:54,410
I've received
17 commendations
for valor.

420
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,703
I'm a husband...

421
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,747
a father.

422
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,583
You're an extraordinary fellow,
Tuvok.

423
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:06,005
I<i> was</i>
<i>an extraordinary fellow.</i>

424
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,632
You're still the same person.

425
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,720
Then why do I no longer work
on the Bridge?

426
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,765
We talked about that.

427
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,101
You had an accident.

428
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,561
And now I'm not smart enough.

429
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,150
Tuvok, you've just
got to be patient.

430
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,445
Look how much progress
you've made already.

431
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,823
He... could dismantle
a photonic warhead

432
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,742
in... in less than
30 seconds.

433
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,412
I can't even play<i> kal-toh.</i>

434
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,164
It's going to take time,

435
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,000
but you'll relearn
all those things.

436
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,960
How do you know that?

437
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,587
Well, because the Doctor...
The Doctor?

438
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,675
The Doctor doesn't know
how to make me better!
Does he?

439
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,719
Well, not yet, but...

440
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,846
I'll never be him again!

441
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,266
You don't know that.
The Vulcan mind...

442
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,978
I'm not a Vulcan!
Not anymore!

443
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,356
(<i> angry grunting</i> )

444
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,024
What's going on?

445
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,235
It's okay, Doctor.
I can handle this.

446
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,487
Please, Tuvok,
try to relax.

447
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,280
Everything's
going to be fine.

448
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,241
No! Nothing's fine!

449
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,742
Get away from me!

450
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,910
You'd better go.

451
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,119
Now, Mr. Neelix!

452
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,954
I'll take it from here.

453
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,474
Oh, sorry;
I didn't mean to interrupt.

454
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,101
You didn't.

455
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,520
Yes, I did.

456
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,480
You were pondering...

457
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,983
something difficult,
by the looks of it.

458
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,361
Anything I can help you with?

459
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,239
Unlikely.

460
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,533
Try me.

461
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,417
How do you find something
that's invisible?

462
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,462
The Ba'Neth.

463
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,338
We have the ability
to illuminate them,

464
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,173
but to do so,
we must first locate them,

465
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,674
which we cannot accomplish

466
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,135
without their
cloaking frequency.

467
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,929
That's quite a riddle.

468
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,722
One that we might
be able to solve

469
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,933
if Commander Tuvok could tell us
what he saw.

470
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,644
How is his
rehabilitation
progressing?

471
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:33,319
Well, I thought
it was going great, but now...

472
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,238
let's just say that I've got
a riddle of my own.

473
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,243
Try me.

474
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,037
All right.

475
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,292
When is a Vulcan
no longer a Vulcan?

476
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,128
When his genetic code
is sufficiently altered.

477
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,671
No. I-I-I was speaking
metaphorically.

478
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:58,010
In that case, a person
is no longer Vulcan
when he's lost his logic.

479
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,054
Right! And how
does he get it back?

480
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,764
He must be taught.

481
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,100
Exactly, but what
if he's brain damaged

482
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,311
and emotionally
unstable?

483
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,063
How does he learn?

484
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,608
It may be impossible
for him to learn

485
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,652
what you're trying
to teach.

486
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,321
Well, thanks
for the pep talk.

487
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,533
I was merely suggesting
that you adapt to
the circumstances.

488
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,409
What circumstances?!

489
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,786
Are you saying that the,
the Tuvok I know is gone--

490
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,206
that I should stop
trying to help him?

491
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,792
When I was separated
from the collective,
I, too, was damaged.

492
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,337
I was no longer connected
to the hive mind.

493
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:37,841
I lost many abilities that
I had acquired as a drone,
but I adapted.

494
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:41,554
Because Captain Janeway
didn't give up on you.

495
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,014
She kept trying to help you.

496
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,309
But not by restoring me
to what I'd been--

497
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,937
by helping me discover
what I could become.

498
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,908
What are you making?

499
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,618
A flower.

500
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,378
It's for you.

501
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,923
Thank you.

502
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,010
I'm not sure
I deserve a gift.

503
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,763
I shouldn't have
shouted at you.

504
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,433
I was angry.

505
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,602
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,144
You were frustrated.

507
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,188
I don't blame you.

508
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,024
I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

509
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,568
Why?

510
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,071
Because I was pushing
you too hard.

511
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,243
I was trying to mold you
into something you weren't.

512
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,870
You were disappointed in me

513
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,958
because I can't
do anything as well
as I did before.

514
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,253
Maybe there are things
that you can do<i> better.</i>

515
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,172
What can I do better?

516
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,093
Well... this, for example.

517
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,970
You would've
considered it

518
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,598
an "illogical use
of your time."

519
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,642
It's not good.

520
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,518
No, it's wonderful.

521
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,687
It's... creative.

522
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,398
It's a symbol of friendship.

523
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,108
Before your accident,

524
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,110
you never would
have considered

525
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,154
that my feelings
might have been hurt.

526
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,366
You, you would have certainly
never have made me a gift.

527
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,286
We weren't friends?

528
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,664
Well, uh...

529
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,291
we were colleagues,

530
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,086
and I certainly felt affection
for you.

531
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,050
But I didn't return
those feelings.

532
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,513
You... tolerated me.

533
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,182
I don't understand.

534
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,434
You said things like

535
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:56,021
(<i> imitating Tuvok</i> ):
"Mr. Neelix, please contain
your exuberance."

536
00:30:56,062 --> 00:31:00,984
And, uh, "Mr. Neelix,
I have no desire for fun."

537
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,903
(<i> both laughing</i> )
And you never smiled.

538
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,031
You got a much better
sense of humor now.

539
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,533
I like to smile.

540
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,284
Me, too.

541
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,748
I don't want to play
<i>kal-toh</i> anymore...

542
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,416
or-or meditate...

543
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,378
or... work on
logic problems.

544
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,879
You don't have to.

545
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,589
What can we do instead?

546
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,424
Whatever you want.

547
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,761
Teach me things
that you like to do.

548
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,684
Here we are--

549
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,935
a triple-chocolate
<i>wikki</i> fruit sundae

550
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,813
with warm fettran sauce.

551
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,940
Fettran sauce on...
a sundae?

552
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,693
Wait till you taste it.

553
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,737
And you really made this?

554
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,113
As Neelix says,
dig in.

555
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,077
Mmm... this is great.

556
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,912
This is
fantastic.

557
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,206
What did I tell you?

558
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,917
Tuvok has a
flair for food.

559
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,503
All morning, he's been
creating new recipes,

560
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,380
using combinations
of ingredients

561
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,090
that I, I never would
have imagined.

562
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,093
For example...
a terra nut soufflé...

563
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,471
Jimbalian fudge cake
with peppermint coulis...

564
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,892
sweet<i> leola</i> root tart.
Mmm!

565
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,769
Only desserts?
How come?

566
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,730
They taste good.
Ha!

567
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,816
Yeah, you better watch out,
Neelix. Tuvok may put you
out of a job.

568
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,235
From your mouth to
the Captain's ears.

569
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,779
She must have heard me.

570
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,280
(<i> both laugh</i> )

571
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,823
What's all this?

572
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,867
We're having fun.

573
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,994
Uh, turns out Tuvok is
quite the pastry chef.

574
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,247
Would you like
some terra-nut
soufflé, Captain?

575
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,708
Oh, I'd love some.
Thank you.

576
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,213
Oh...
that is delicious.

577
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,800
I'm pleased that
you like it.

578
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,433
What are you
making now?

579
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,727
Pistachio cake with
<i>parra</i> cream sauce.

580
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,979
Oh,<i> parra</i> cream's
my favorite.

581
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,774
Then you'll have
the first piece.

582
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,443
Tuvok, have you
remembered anything more

583
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,570
about what happened
on the<i> Flyer?</i>

584
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,912
I detected
a cloaking frequency.

585
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,205
Yes, that's right.

586
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,792
Can you describe it?

587
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,175
I don't know, I, I...

588
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,635
Did it have
a symmetric modulation?

589
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,346
Was the amplitude
constant?

590
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,348
I-I don't understand.

591
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,767
It's all right.
I don't mean
to push you, Tuvok,

592
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,101
but maybe if we could...

593
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,187
It's difficult for him,
Captain.

594
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,064
Maybe you can try again
tomorrow.

595
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,233
This...

596
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,658
This is what I saw.

597
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,284
What is it?

598
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,832
A cloaking frequency.

599
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,919
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

600
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,380
<i>The computer has analyzed</i>
<i>Tuvok's diagram</i>

601
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,090
<i>and identified</i>
<i>the Ba'Neth cloaking</i>
<i>frequency.</i>

602
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,677
<i>We've narrowed the search</i>
<i>to a handful of systems.</i>

603
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:18,557
Here we go, Captain.
A nine-million terawatt
cloaking field in Grid 216.

604
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,183
Nine million terawatts.

605
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,060
Whatever they're hiding,
it's huge.

606
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,478
Alter course, Mr. Paris.

607
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,938
PARIS:
Yes, ma'am.

608
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,732
Bridge to Astrometrics.
Status.

609
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,275
SEVEN:
The deflector array
is ready, Captain.

610
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,110
Raise shields.

611
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,404
Aye, Captain.

612
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,072
PARIS:
We're within range.

613
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,615
All right, Seven...

614
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,701
light them up.

615
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,006
KIM:
It's an armed outpost.

616
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,341
Approximately
3,000 life signs, 22 ships.

617
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,593
Hail them.

618
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,554
No response, Captain.

619
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,014
They're charging weapons.

620
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,558
Open a channel,
all subspace bands.

621
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,769
They're firing.

622
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,022
Cease fire immediately...

623
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:11,610
or I'll transmit
the coordinates of this outpost
to the Kesat homeworld.

624
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,282
That got their attention.

625
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,244
Several days ago,
a member of your species
attacked one of my crewmen.

626
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,830
He was badly injured.
In order to treat him,

627
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,542
I need to know more
about the weapon that was used.

628
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,628
They're responding.
Audio only.

629
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,714
We do not share technology.

630
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,716
But you take it from others.

631
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,302
The attacker was downloading
our tactical database

632
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,178
when the incident occurred.

633
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,807
We must assess
potential threats.

634
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:45,060
Paranoid,
just as I predicted.

635
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:48,438
In exchange for information
about your weapon,

636
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,899
we'll provide you
with tactical data

637
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,485
on several species
we've recently encountered.

638
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:57,322
You can assess their
potential threats all you want.

639
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,117
The Kesat investigator
aboard your vessel

640
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,201
cannot be trusted.

641
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,164
You know about me?

642
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,042
You have been attempting
to expose us for years.

643
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,253
You are a threat.
You must be stopped.

644
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,964
They're charging
weapons again.

645
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,674
Wait.

646
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,676
It was
my photolitic converter

647
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,638
that allowed<i> Voyager</i>
<i>to de-cloak you.</i>

648
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,724
If you give Captain Janeway
what she wants,

649
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,518
I'll give you the converter.

650
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,812
You can use it
to adapt your technology

651
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,606
so ours can no longer
expose you.

652
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,862
I doubt you'll get
as enticing an offer

653
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,698
from the Kesat homeworld.

654
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,326
It would be a shame
if you forced me to hail them.

655
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,664
We have an agreement.

656
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,671
(<i> mid-tempo jazz playing</i> )

657
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,882
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Enter.

658
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,053
What are you listening to?

659
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,931
A selection
from Tom's jazz database--

660
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,017
it really swings.

661
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,186
(<i> laughing</i> )

662
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:13,606
Computer, pause the music.

663
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,317
I've been reviewing
the holodeck files.

664
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,612
I wish to visit the Risa
Water Recreation Park.

665
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,573
Will you accompany me?

666
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,449
Maybe after
your doctor's appointment.

667
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,368
Appointment?

668
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,329
The Doctor's analyzed
the Ba'Neth weapon,

669
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,750
and he's devised
a procedure to treat you.

670
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:43,344
You... you should be
proud of yourself.

671
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,680
I-if you hadn't drawn
that picture on the cake,

672
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,724
we may never have found
a treatment.

673
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,145
I wish I never
drew that picture.

674
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,439
Why?

675
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,736
Because I don't wish
to undergo the procedure.

676
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,032
You're having
preoperative jitters.
That's all.

677
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,743
Don't worry.
Everyone gets them.

678
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,121
Just think about it.

679
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,248
In a few hours,
you'll be yourself again.

680
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,126
I<i> am</i> myself.

681
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:18,004
But... you'll be able
to do all the things

682
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,506
that you used to do--
work on the Bridge,

683
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,883
advise the Captain.

684
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,343
I want to be
able to have fun.

685
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,512
With you.

686
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,017
I won't be able to.

687
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,477
Will I?

688
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,729
Well...

689
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,695
you won't call it fun.

690
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,740
You'll call it
"deriving satisfaction,"

691
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,701
but it's basically
the same thing.

692
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,454
You'll still
experience emotions.

693
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,041
But I won't express them.

694
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,295
Probably not.

695
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:08,638
Then how will you know
how much I enjoy being with you?

696
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,725
You've just told me.

697
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,939
We'll still be friends?

698
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,608
Of course.

699
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:26,865
Even if I...
merely tolerate you?

700
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,909
I'd be lying if I told you

701
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,204
that things between us
will stay the same.

702
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,124
Well, then, why?

703
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,169
Why do you want me to go back
to the way I was?

704
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,425
Because this crew needs

705
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,679
its Tactical Officer
on the Bridge,

706
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,098
and I wouldn't be
a very good friend

707
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,519
if I ignored that just so
that you'd be nicer to me.

708
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,321
Mr. Tuvok, I
was beginning

709
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,823
to think you
weren't coming.

710
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:12,369
I was experiencing
preoperative jitters.

711
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,038
Neelix helped me
overcome them.

712
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,373
Glad to hear it.

713
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,084
Now, please
lie down.

714
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,594
I'll see you
after the procedure?

715
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,471
Of course.

716
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,065
I'm going to miss him.

717
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,359
Me, too.

718
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,273
Hello, Commander.

719
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,275
Mr. Neelix.

720
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,739
It's good to see
you up and about.

721
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,117
Are you feeling better?

722
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,577
The Doctor has approved
my return to duty.

723
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,747
That's wonderful news.

724
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,750
How about a celebratory
glass of champagne?

725
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,378
Tea will suffice.

726
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,089
Of course.

727
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,390
I'm preparing
a special dinner tonight,

728
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,351
in honor of your recovery.

729
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,397
I don't suppose
that you'd be interested

730
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,566
in preparing one
of your famous desserts.

731
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,944
I have much more important
things to do

732
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:13,365
than engage in the preparation
of nutritionally
deficient foods.

733
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,162
Maybe another time.

734
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,997
Sundays.

735
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,124
I beg your pardon?

736
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,044
I have given
further consideration
to your riddle

737
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,213
regarding the Ensign
who survived

738
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,007
by consuming the "dates"
from his calendar.

739
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,800
It occurs to me

740
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:36,679
that he could also have eaten
the "Sundays."

741
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,227
That's a very clever answer,
Mr. Vulcan.

742
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,607
But it's not very logical,
is it?

743
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,572
No.

744
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,449
It's not.
