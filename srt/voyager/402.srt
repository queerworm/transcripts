1
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:59,351
( door opens, closes )

2
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,570
So, how's the newest
addition to our family?

3
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,030
At the moment, she's stable,

4
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,781
but the prognosis
isn't clear.

5
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,534
Her human physiology has
begun to reassert itself,

6
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:19,204
respiratory system, neurological
functions, immune response.

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,040
But those systems are swarming

8
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,457
with Borg implants.

9
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,668
There's a battle being
waged inside her body,

10
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,920
between the biological,

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,337
and the technological,

12
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,923
and I'm not sure
which is going to win.

13
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,841
Well, it's time
we brought her up-to-date.

14
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,133
Wake her.

15
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,106
Captain Janeway.

16
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,442
What have you--?

17
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,744
The others, I can't
hear the others.

18
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,161
The voices are gone.

19
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,873
We had to neutralize
the neuro-transceiver

20
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,625
in your upper spinal column.

21
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,544
Your link to the collective
has been severed.

22
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,381
You will return this
drone to the Borg.

23
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,841
I'm afraid I can't do that.

24
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,552
You will return this
drone to the Borg!

25
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,429
If I were to turn
this ship around,

26
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,347
and head back
into Borg territory,

27
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,808
I'd be putting my crew at risk.

28
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,225
I'm not prepared to do that.

29
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,812
Try to understand.

30
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,648
You have to stay
on board<i> Voyager,</i>

31
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,817
but I'm offering you freedom
from the collective,

32
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,485
and I assure you,
we'll do everything

33
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,945
we can to help the transition--

34
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,405
You will supply us with
a subspace transmitter,

35
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,075
and leave us on
the nearest planet.

36
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,576
The Borg will come for us.

37
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,911
It's too late for that.

38
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,538
Your human cells
are starting to regenerate.

39
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,041
You won't survive
without medical care.

40
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,752
We need nothing from you.

41
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,713
We are Borg.

42
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,298
We are--

43
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,883
( groaning )

44
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,888
This implant is being rejected
by the tissue underneath.

45
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,765
It's going to have
to be removed.

46
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,476
You will suppress the
human immune system!

47
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,311
I'm sorry, but the process
has gone too far.

48
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,771
We've got to get you
to Sick Bay.

49
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,065
No! We are Borg!

50
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,400
We are Borg!

51
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:29,918
( theme music playing )

52
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,311
This armor plating
is anchored to the skull

53
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,980
with over 3 million
microconnectors.

54
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,815
There's no time
to cut through them.

55
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,442
I'm going to have to remove the
outer layer of the skull itself.

56
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,819
Lieutenant,

57
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,695
will you please leave
the surgical bay!

58
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,447
This Borg is a security risk.

59
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,782
She is heavily sedated.

60
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,826
I assure you, she's
not going anywhere.

61
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,041
Thank you.

62
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,751
Kes,

63
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,837
I want you to anesthetize
her cranial nerves.

64
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,255
Twenty milligrams anetrizine.

65
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,547
Yes, Doctor.

66
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,094
Kes...?

67
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,263
I don't know what happened.

68
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,765
I looked at the hypospray,
and it just came to me.

69
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,601
Have you been experimenting with
your psychokinetic abilities?

70
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,145
No, not for months.

71
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,939
But I have been feeling
a little strange lately,

72
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,649
lots of energy, sleeping less...

73
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,234
I can see why.

74
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,903
Your serotonin levels are
62 percent above normal.

75
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,699
It's the telepathic
centers of your brain.

76
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,534
They're in a state
of hyperstimulation,

77
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,328
like they were
a few days ago,

78
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,121
when you were in contact
with Species 8472.

79
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,456
Are they attempting
to communicate with you again?

80
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,500
No.

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,710
This time, it's different.

82
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,337
I don't feel their presence
at all.

83
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:21,464
Perhaps she's experiencing
an aftereffect of some kind.

84
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,966
A reasonable
diagnosis...

85
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,383
for a security
officer.

86
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,761
I'll run a full
microsynaptic analysis,

87
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,055
but it will
have to wait.

88
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,931
We should get back
to our Borg.

89
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,237
( door chimes )

90
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,696
Come in.

91
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,282
Ship's status report.

92
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,658
We've got two teams
on the hull

93
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,244
stripping off
the Borg armor.

94
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,745
They're working
around the clock,

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,080
but it's still
slow going.

96
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,706
What about the warp drive?

97
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,292
Torres is having problems
cleaning out the plasma relays.

98
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,417
It's disrupting

99
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,003
the antimatter
reaction.

100
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,130
Until she's got it fixed,
we're stuck at impulse.

101
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,506
She's requesting all personnel

102
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,550
with a Level-3
engineering rating or higher

103
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,885
to lend a hand.

104
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,636
Granted.

105
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,763
Tactical update?

106
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,182
Long-range sensors
are picking up

107
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,809
residual transwarp signatures,
Borg vessels.

108
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,437
They passed by
probably three days ago.

109
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,814
So we're not
out of the woods yet.

110
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,276
Having half our propulsion
system overrun by Borg implants

111
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,902
doesn't make repairs
any easier.

112
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,198
Seven of Nine
could help us with that.

113
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,325
That might be true,
if she were willing,

114
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,660
but she's not in
the most cooperative mood.

115
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,206
That could change.

116
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,541
I just have to reach her
somehow.

117
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,380
Annika Hansen.

118
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,382
Our Borg?

119
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,134
It took some digging

120
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,635
through the
Federation database,

121
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,345
but I managed to
find a single entry

122
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,013
in the records of Deep Space 4.

123
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,851
Her parents were...
unconventional.

124
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,812
They fancied
themselves explorers,

125
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,647
but wanted nothing
to do with Starfleet

126
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,773
or the Federation.

127
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,524
Their names were
last recorded

128
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,820
at a remote outpost
in the Omega Sector.

129
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,239
They refused to file
a flight plan.

130
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,700
Apparently, they aimed
their small ship

131
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,868
toward the Delta Quadrant,

132
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,412
and were never
heard from again.

133
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,788
For all we know,

134
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,790
Annika and her parents
were the first humans

135
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,126
the Borg ever assimilated.

136
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,586
From what she's
told me,

137
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,672
that was almost
20 years ago.

138
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,841
So she was raised
by the Borg.

139
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,593
It's the only life
she ever really knew.

140
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,846
If you were thinking of
bringing her into the fold,

141
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,431
that might not
be possible.

142
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,976
What's the alternative?
Toss her back to the wolves?

143
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,936
DOCTOR:
<i>Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.</i>

144
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,188
What is it, Doctor?

145
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,689
<i>Could you come down here,</i>
<i>Captain?</i>

146
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,192
<i>We're having some...</i>
<i>problems.</i>

147
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,526
I'll be right there.

148
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,046
It's like peeling an onion.

149
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,549
Store it in a
biostasis chamber.

150
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,635
It may still
be active.

151
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,471
If you think
there's a risk, Mr. Tuvok,

152
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,974
you can throw one of your little
forcefields around the chamber.

153
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,560
A prudent security measure...
for a doctor.

154
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,023
Report.

155
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,941
I'm afraid we have
a decision to make,

156
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,528
a difficult one.

157
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,988
Her human immune system
has reasserted itself

158
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,324
with a vengeance, body
armor, Borg organelles

159
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,660
biosynthetic glands,
they're all being rejected.

160
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,287
Her life is in danger.

161
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,747
I have little recourse

162
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,832
but to remove
the Borg technology.

163
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,377
Which is the last thing
Seven of Nine would want.

164
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,170
Hence, the difficult
decision.

165
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,756
If a patient told me
not to treat them,

166
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,758
even if the situation
were life-threatening,

167
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,761
I would be ethically obligated
to honor that request.

168
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,556
This is
no ordinary patient.

169
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,225
She may have been raised
by Borg,

170
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,685
raised to think like a Borg...

171
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,020
but she's with us now,

172
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,189
and underneath
all that technology,

173
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,649
she is a human being.
Whether she's

174
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,570
ready to accept
that or not.

175
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,280
And until she is ready...

176
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,241
someone has to make
the decisions for her.

177
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,996
Proceed with the surgery.

178
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,957
Aye, Captain.

179
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:30,130
( mellow theme plays )

180
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,756
( sighing )

181
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,385
Kes.

182
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,308
Let's begin with the
microtubule network

183
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,226
embedded in the
esophageal tract.

184
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,313
( warning beeps )

185
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,564
What's happening?

186
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,940
I'm not sure.

187
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,651
She's going into neural shock.

188
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,736
I can't localize
the source.

189
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,071
Kes, try to stabilize

190
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,323
her motor cortex.

191
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,824
Use a neuro sequencer.

192
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,202
Kes, I said
to stabilize her cortex

193
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,537
or we're going
to lose her.

194
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,830
Wait.

195
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,499
I can see it.

196
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,167
What?

197
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,503
I think the problem
is in her colliculi.

198
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,519
Yes...I can see it.

199
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,188
A Borg implant,
it's pressing against

200
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,231
her trochlear nerve.

201
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,359
Can you tell me
how we might remove it

202
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,194
without severing the nerve?

203
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,404
I think I can do more
than tell you.

204
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,627
( medical tricorder beeping )

205
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,173
The implant is
deteriorating.

206
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,885
Her nervous system
is stabilizing.

207
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,224
Nice work, Kes.

208
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,267
Unconventional...

209
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,061
but effective.

210
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,495
DOCTOR:
They say the eye is
the window to the soul.

211
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,498
In this case,
it's a little bit more.

212
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,584
I fabricated
this artificial organ

213
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,711
to replace her eyepiece,
but I've had

214
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,462
to retain some
of the Borg circuitry

215
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,963
along the optic nerve.

216
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,592
As a result, she'll have
increased acuity in one eye.

217
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,759
Note how perfectly
I've matched

218
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,930
the pigment of the iris
to her human eye.

219
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,181
Excellent work, Doctor.

220
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,058
I admire your
attention to detail.

221
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,686
When can I speak
with her?

222
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,479
She's out
of immediate danger,

223
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,689
and I don't plan to resume

224
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,441
the extraction process
until tomorrow.

225
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,858
I can wake her now
if you'd like.

226
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,151
I would.

227
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,073
How are you, Kes?

228
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,782
I feel exhilarated,
Captain.

229
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,119
I've never been
so focused in my life.

230
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,913
And my telepathic abilities are
stronger than they've ever been.

231
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,874
Your performance today
was astonishing.

232
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,211
However, your psychokinetic
powers are still undisciplined,

233
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,213
and, as a result, unpredictable.

234
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,215
I feel like I'm in control.

235
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,842
Nevertheless, you must
proceed with caution,

236
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,470
and with my assistance.

237
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,179
What are you suggesting?

238
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,891
A series of guided meditations
to help her explore the depth

239
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,268
of these
new abilities.

240
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,478
Kes?

241
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,730
I'm ready.

242
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,691
TUVOK:
Well, then, if
you'll excuse us,

243
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,151
we should begin immediately.

244
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,373
Ready when you are, Captain.

245
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,554
Don't be alarmed.

246
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,806
You're in Sick Bay.

247
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,098
You're going to be fine.

248
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,731
What have you done to me?

249
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,107
Your body
was rejecting

250
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,442
the Borg technology.

251
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,610
You were dying.

252
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,321
I'm sorry, but
we had no choice.

253
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,699
Those are
dermaplastic grafts.

254
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,701
They'll help
the regeneration process.

255
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,539
Unacceptable.

256
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,382
You should have let us die.

257
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,552
I couldn't do that.

258
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,346
This drone cannot survive
outside the collective.

259
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,889
I beg to differ.

260
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,099
Now that the Borg implants
are being excised,

261
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,019
your human systems are free
to thrive and thriving they are.

262
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,605
As a matter
of fact, I--

263
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,234
I want to help you,

264
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,403
but I need to understand
what you're going through.

265
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,989
Do not engage us in superficial
attempts at sympathy.

266
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,283
It's obvious
that you're in pain,

267
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,451
that you're frightened,

268
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,538
that you feel
isolated, alone.

269
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:17,333
You are an individual.

270
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,420
You are small.

271
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,174
You cannot understand
what it is to be Borg.

272
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,135
No, but I can imagine.

273
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,932
You were part
of a vast consciousness,

274
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,685
billions of minds
working together,

275
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,020
a harmony of
purpose and thought,

276
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,314
no indecision,
no doubts.

277
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:45,528
The security and strength
of a unified will...

278
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,697
and you've lost that.

279
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,787
This drone is small now.

280
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,496
Alone.

281
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,586
One voice. One mind.

282
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,756
The silence
is unacceptable.

283
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,090
We need the others.

284
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,842
I can't give you
back to the Borg,

285
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,260
but you're not alone.

286
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,262
You're part of a
human community now,

287
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,222
a human collective.

288
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,390
We may be individuals,

289
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,601
but we live
and work together.

290
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,771
You can have some
of the unity you require

291
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,564
right here on<i> Voyager.</i>

292
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,068
Insufficient.

293
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,613
It'll have to do.

294
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,868
And the fact is,
this community needs you.

295
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,830
The Borg modifications
you made to our vessel

296
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,081
are disrupting our warp drive.

297
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,041
We need your help
to remove them,

298
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,588
your...expertise.

299
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,007
Your cooperation.

300
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,512
You must comply.

301
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,059
TORRES:
All right.

302
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,020
I think I've got
all the Borg garbage

303
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,522
out of the plasma
intake manifold.

304
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,733
Let's try reinitializing
the antimatter reaction.

305
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,576
KIM:
Matter, antimatter reaction

306
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,578
at 22 Cochranes
and rising.

307
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,542
( engine powering down )

308
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,752
Damn! What happened?

309
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,338
Intake manifolds 11 and 13
are still blocked.

310
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,798
This is like pulling weeds.

311
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,758
You think you've got
them all out, and then...

312
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,802
You have neglected to
remove the autonomous

313
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,345
regeneration sequencers.

314
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,055
Lieutenant Torres,
Ensign Kim,

315
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,891
you remember
Seven of Nine.

316
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,059
How could we forget?

317
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,228
We can't afford to delay
repairs any longer.

318
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,313
So I've asked her to
help us remove the Borg

319
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,565
modifications.

320
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,774
She only has
a few hours

321
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,192
before she returns
to Sick Bay.

322
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,569
I suggest you
put her to good use.

323
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,195
You can start
with the plasma relays.

324
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,530
They're
in Jefferies Tube 13...

325
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,782
Jefferies Tube
13-Alpha, Section 12.

326
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,951
We fully recall the
engineering specifications

327
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,285
of your vessel.

328
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,788
Good. Can you also recall
the way it looked

329
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,916
before you turned it
into a Borg circus?

330
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,251
Yes.

331
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,005
Well, now that
the pleasantries are over,

332
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,339
why don't you get to work?

333
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,341
I want updates every hour.

334
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,719
Yes, Captain.

335
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,477
TUVOK:
The flame of the lamp,

336
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,856
is fire disciplined,
tamed and under control.

337
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,942
It is the
appropriate focus

338
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,651
for the task
ahead of us.

339
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,486
How do we begin?

340
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,697
I will attempt
to guide you

341
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,449
in manipulating
the flame

342
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,451
at the subatomic level.

343
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,870
Concentrate on the flame,

344
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:47,710
try to see past the surface...
past the light...

345
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,421
to the patterns
of energy and matter.

346
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,970
I can see the essence
of the fire.

347
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,220
Good.

348
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,180
Now, reach out with your mind

349
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,474
and intensify the flame.

350
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,404
I'm making it hotter,
brighter.

351
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,408
Now, with your thoughts...

352
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,743
reduce the flame.

353
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,254
Excellent.

354
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:36,175
You've never demonstrated
this level of control before.

355
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:41,806
It's as though I knew
what had to be done and...

356
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,350
What's wrong?

357
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,060
Something's happening.

358
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,606
I can see further,
beyond the subatomic.

359
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,528
Kes, there is nothing
beyond the subatomic.

360
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,780
But I can see it, Tuvok.

361
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,705
It's a new level of reality.

362
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,541
It's beautiful.

363
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,421
Perhaps we should stop for now.

364
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,007
Wait a few seconds.

365
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,717
I want to try to control it.

366
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,563
Don't worry, Tuvok.

367
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,618
What about these linkages?

368
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,912
Every time
I pull one out,

369
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,496
another one comes
back in its place.

370
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,665
Autonomous regeneration
sequencers.

371
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,542
They function
to counteract resistance.

372
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,793
Amazing.

373
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,003
How did you come up

374
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,755
with the pattern-
duplication design?

375
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,923
We came up with nothing.

376
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,549
The Borg assimilated
this technology

377
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,927
in Galactic Cluster 3
from Species 259.

378
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,345
I'm not interested
in a history lesson.

379
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,889
How do we disable it?

380
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,016
You must disconnect
each sequencer conduit

381
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,434
at the insertion juncture.

382
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,352
Why don't you two work
on the Jefferies tube?

383
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,854
Start with
the plasma relays.

384
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,152
I'll start here.

385
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,537
You said the Borg got
this stuff from Species 259.

386
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,123
Who were they?

387
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,296
I guess the Borg meet a lot
of people, don't they?

388
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,508
( quietly ):
Stupid question.

389
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,599
So what's it like out there
in Galactic Cluster 3?

390
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,310
Beyond your comprehension.

391
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,937
Try me.

392
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,734
Galactic Cluster 3
is a transmaterial energy plane

393
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,737
intersecting 22 billion
omnicordial life-forms.

394
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,075
Oh. Interesting.

395
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,053
Ensign Kim,
your assistance.

396
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,183
( door closes )

397
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,645
Captain, somebody's
trying to access

398
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,272
the subspace transmitter.

399
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,775
Captain, I don't know how,

400
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,320
but she's erected some kind
of force field around the door.

401
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,570
We can't break through it.

402
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,405
She's bypassed
our security protocols.

403
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,658
Disable the transmitter.

404
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,493
It's too late.

405
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,996
It's obvious your mental
abilities have progressed

406
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,873
beyond this particular
Vulcan exercise.

407
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,208
I suggest we...

408
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,253
What is it?

409
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,546
Something's wrong.

410
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,885
The Borg is trying
to contact her people.

411
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,680
Tuvok to Security Team 1.

412
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,098
Intruder alert in Engineering.

413
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,851
Wait.

414
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,769
I think I can stop her.

415
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,400
( beeping )

416
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,995
( grunts )

417
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,082
It's over.

418
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,792
Tuvok to Bridge.

419
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,336
Status?

420
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,588
There was some kind of explosion
in the Jefferies tube

421
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,798
just as she was about
to initiate her transmission.

422
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,926
We don't know what
caused it.

423
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,678
I believe I may
have the answer, Captain.

424
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,274
I can tell by the
expression on your face,

425
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,900
that you've got
some bad news.

426
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,278
I have no expression
on my face.

427
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,445
However, you are correct.

428
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,907
The news on two separate
fronts is not good.

429
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,285
I checked the
subspace bandwidths.

430
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:15,037
At least a partial signal
was transmitted from<i> Voyager.</i>

431
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,622
Enough for a Borg
ship to track?

432
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,831
Possibly.

433
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,457
And the second front?

434
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,253
I believe there's also cause
for concern, regarding Kes.

435
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,504
Explain.

436
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,757
Internal sensor logs show
that she destabilized

437
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,759
the Jefferies tube
at the molecular level.

438
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,969
The effect weakened

439
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,971
the infrastructure
throughout the deck.

440
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,224
She wishes to develop
her abilities further.

441
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,768
I am not certain
it would be safe...

442
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,561
for Kes or<i> Voyager.</i>

443
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,356
I've got an Ocampan who
wants to be something more

444
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,650
and a Borg who's afraid of
becoming something less.

445
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,985
Here's to Vulcan stability.

446
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,447
Wait for me.

447
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,879
So this is human freedom.

448
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,257
I've decided to keep you
in the brig,

449
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,093
until I'm certain
you won't try to harm us again.

450
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:15,139
If necessary, the Doctor
can treat you here.

451
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,724
I honestly believed
you were going to help us.

452
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,186
You were not deceived,
Captain Janeway.

453
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,313
It was my intention to help you.

454
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,981
What happened?

455
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,442
There was a chance
to contact the collective.

456
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,734
I took advantage of it.

457
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:35,909
Your attempts to assimilate
this drone will fail.

458
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,662
You can alter
our physiology,

459
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,623
but you cannot
change our nature.

460
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,711
We will betray you.
We are Borg.

461
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,508
I've met Borg who were freed
from the collective.

462
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:53,677
It wasn't easy for them
to accept their individuality,

463
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,595
but, in time, they did.

464
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,431
You're no different.

465
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,017
Granted, you were assimilated
at a very young age,

466
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,935
and your transition
may be more difficult,

467
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,480
but it will happen.

468
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,740
If it does happen...

469
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,202
we will become
fully human?

470
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,163
Yes, I hope so.

471
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,959
We will be autonomous,
independent.

472
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:31,340
That's what individuality
is all about.

473
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,470
If at that time, we choose
to return to the collective,

474
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,847
will you permit it?

475
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,977
I don't think
you'll want to do that.

476
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:53,779
You would deny
us the choice,

477
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,822
as you deny us now.

478
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,493
You have imprisoned us
in the name of humanity,

479
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,869
yet you will
not grant us

480
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,330
your most "cherished"
human right,

481
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,958
to choose our own fate.

482
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:11,171
You are hypocritical,
manipulative.

483
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,136
We do not want
to be what you are!

484
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,763
Return us to the collective!

485
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,182
You lost the capacity
to make a rational choice

486
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,725
the moment you were assimilated.

487
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,643
They took that from you.

488
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,062
And until I'm
convinced you've

489
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,688
gotten it back...

490
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,275
I'm making the choice for you.

491
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,902
You're staying here.

492
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,697
Then you are no different
than the Borg.

493
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,123
Talaxian champagne.

494
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,958
Moon-ripened.

495
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,751
Your favorite.

496
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,920
Neelix, where did
you get this?

497
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,465
I put a bottle away...

498
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,801
for a special occasion.

499
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,054
Remember when we last
sipped this together?

500
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,474
Three years ago.

501
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,851
It was when we first
arrived on<i> Voyager.</i>

502
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,936
And do you remember
the toast I made?

503
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,229
Yes.

504
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,523
"To the adventure."

505
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,816
"To the adventure."

506
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,950
When you left Ocampa,

507
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,120
you said that your people
were being held back.

508
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,788
That if you were
only given the chance,

509
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,791
you could become
something so much more.

510
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,835
And you have.

511
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,671
I know things
haven't worked out

512
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,047
exactly the way
we planned.

513
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,299
I was only holding you back.

514
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,011
That's obvious to me now.

515
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,096
No. I couldn't have come
this far without you.

516
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,727
And I love you.

517
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,564
I always will.

518
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,773
It's just, uh...

519
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,448
My cooking.
You've always hated my cooking.

520
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,700
( chuckles )

521
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,159
That's exactly what it was.

522
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,707
Ah...

523
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,751
So tell me more
about what's happening to you.

524
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,420
What does it all mean?

525
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,465
I don't know, and that's
what makes it so exciting.

526
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,300
It's as if I can see
into a place

527
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:26,557
where the distinction between
matter and energy and thought

528
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:27,766
no longer exists.

529
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,769
And that's only
the beginning.

530
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,146
I feel as if all the boundaries
within me

531
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,356
are about to fall away.

532
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,067
It sounds...

533
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,780
er...uh...interesting.

534
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,823
I only have to look
at an object,

535
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,952
gaze at it,
and I can begin to see...

536
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,538
that the space between the atoms

537
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,374
is being filled
with something else.

538
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,671
Uh, Kes...

539
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,299
I can see...I see...

540
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,805
Uh, Kes, stop!

541
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,056
No.

542
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,516
( grunts )

543
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,018
Neelix!

544
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,271
Captain, I'm picking up
some strange energy readings

545
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,814
from Deck 2,
the Mess Hall.

546
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,941
Bridge to Neelix.
What's going on down there?

547
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,486
Neelix, report.

548
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,446
The bulkhead in that
section is coming apart.

549
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,698
Increase the structural
integrity field of Deck 2.

550
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,032
Tuvok.

551
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,525
I've run every conceivable
neural analysis,

552
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:02,235
everything short of
dissecting the brain itself.

553
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,780
Her telesynaptic
activity is increasing,

554
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,366
but I don't know why,
or how to stop it.

555
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,076
Have the ship's internal
sensors revealed anything?

556
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,579
For 17.4 seconds,
Kes's body went

557
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,623
into a state
of cellular flux.

558
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,833
She began

559
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,710
to destabilize
at the subatomic level.

560
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,127
JANEWAY:
And for some reason,

561
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,004
her atoms
reestablished their bonds,

562
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,631
and she was back in one piece.

563
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,132
But what about the next time?

564
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,759
Her condition is escalating.

565
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,427
We must find
a way to suppress it

566
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,513
or the last we'll see of Kes
could very well be

567
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,931
her molecules blowing
through the ventilation ducts.

568
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,226
Tuvok, enhance the structural
integrity fields

569
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,894
throughout the ship.

570
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,189
If she has another incident,
I'd like to avoid a hull breach.

571
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:44,194
Doctor, maybe it's time
we broaden our horizons.

572
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:47,280
This appears to have gone
beyond medical science.

573
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,907
We're into
particle physics now.

574
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,200
I'll try looking

575
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,244
through the quantum
substructure database.

576
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,454
Maybe it'll give me
some...inspiration.

577
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,914
Keep me informed.

578
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:10,721
Kes, until I can devise
another diagnostic procedure,

579
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,431
you're free to return
to your quarters.

580
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,932
Actually, I'd like
to stay here,

581
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,183
help with the research.

582
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,436
I don't want you
to overexert yourself,

583
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,564
and risk precipitating
another telepathic incident.

584
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,815
Try to get some rest.

585
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,443
Just let me stay a little while.

586
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,779
I haven't seen you much
over the past few days.

587
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:27,987
I miss you.

588
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,450
All right, just for a while.

589
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,050
( yelling )

590
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,263
( yelling )

591
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,556
<i>Ensign Ayala to the Bridge.</i>

592
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,974
Go ahead, Ensign.

593
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,976
<i>You'd better come</i>
<i>down to the brig, Ma'am.</i>

594
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,771
One.

595
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,650
One.

596
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,162
My designation
is Seven of Nine...

597
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:21,458
but the others are gone.

598
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,962
Designations are
no longer relevant.

599
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,301
I am...one.

600
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,179
Yes, you are.

601
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:39,643
But I cannot function this way,
alone.

602
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,187
You're not alone.
I'm willing to help you.

603
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,860
If that's true,
you won't do this to me.

604
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,988
Take me back to my own kind.

605
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:55,033
You are
with your own kind, humans.

606
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,077
I don't remember being human.

607
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:02,165
I don't know
what it is to be human.

608
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,673
( sighs )

609
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,514
What are you doing?

610
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,724
I'm coming in.

611
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,684
I'll kill you.

612
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,312
I don't think you will.

613
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,760
Do you remember her?

614
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,137
Her name was
Annika Hansen.

615
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:04,561
She was born on Stardate
25479 at the Tendara Colony.

616
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,439
There's still a lot
we don't know about her.

617
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,775
Did she have any siblings?

618
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,109
Who were her friends?

619
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,611
Where did she go to school?

620
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,487
What was her
favorite color?

621
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,955
Irrelevant!

622
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,415
Take me back
to the Borg.

623
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,708
I can't do that.

624
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,378
The...quiet.

625
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,880
One voice.

626
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,217
One voice can be stronger
than a thousand voices.

627
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,804
Your mind is
independent now

628
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,847
with its own
unique identity.

629
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,391
You are forcing
that identity upon me.

630
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,643
It's not mine.

631
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,478
Oh, yes, it is.

632
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,772
I'm just giving you back
what was stolen from you,

633
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,108
the existence you were denied,

634
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,651
the child who
never had a chance.

635
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,987
That life is
yours to live now.

636
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,405
I don't want that life!

637
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,698
It's what you are.

638
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,950
Don't resist it.

639
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,159
No!

640
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,412
( groaning )

641
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,167
( sobbing ):
No.

642
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,419
( gasping )

643
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,344
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

644
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,262
<i>Warp drive is still off-line,</i>

645
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,932
<i>and we don't know whether</i>
<i>the Borg have detected us.</i>

646
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,226
<i>Kes's psychokinetic abilities</i>
<i>continue to damage the ship's</i>

647
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,187
<i>structural integrity,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

648
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,773
<i>our defenses</i>
<i>have been compromised.</i>

649
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,108
( door chimes )

650
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,318
Come in, Captain.

651
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,823
You wanted to see me?

652
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,909
Oh, Tuvok's
meditation lamp.

653
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,285
I was with him
when he got it

654
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,246
six years ago, from
a Vulcan master...

655
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,540
who doubled the price

656
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,291
when he saw our
Starfleet insignias.

657
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,335
I'm sure it was
the logical thing to do.

658
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,051
I've been thinking
about everything

659
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,969
that's been going on...

660
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,181
and I know what I have to do.

661
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,560
It's time for me
to leave<i> Voyager.</i>

662
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,145
Oh, Kes...

663
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,980
Something important
is happening to me,

664
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,190
and I want to explore it,

665
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,067
but I can't stay here
any longer.

666
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,526
I'm a danger
to all of you.

667
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,444
We're going to get
to the bottom of this.

668
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,821
The Doctor's already working

669
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,447
on a new approach...

670
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,366
Everybody thinks
that what's happening

671
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,617
is a medical condition.

672
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,452
That's not it at all.

673
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,997
I'm going through
a transformation.

674
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:33,210
I don't know how or why,
but every cell in my body

675
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,756
is telling me...that I'm
changing into something more.

676
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,925
But what if it's not true?

677
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,843
What if you're simply
being swept up

678
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,054
in the excitement
of what you think is happening,

679
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,931
but it's not real.

680
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:49,434
On the basis of a feeling,
an intuition,

681
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,687
you're asking me to let you go?

682
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,774
Quite likely forever?

683
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,110
Kes, I just can't do that.

684
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:03,031
It's my decision,
my fate.

685
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,324
Would you really
try to stop me?

686
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,705
No.

687
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,040
But argue with you,

688
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,833
even plead with you
to reconsider?

689
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,377
Absolutely,
for as long as it takes.

690
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,341
It won't work.

691
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,178
Look at me, Captain.

692
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,555
I'm the same Kes
you've always known.

693
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,268
I haven't lost my judgment.

694
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:34,980
I'm not under
some alien influence.

695
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:41,360
I believe something crucial
is happening to me,

696
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,362
and I want
to see it through.

697
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,367
You've lived
most of your life here.

698
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,288
<i>Voyager</i> has been your home...

699
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,834
and you've been
a vital part of this family.

700
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,134
Oh, I'm going to miss you.

701
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,983
Now, all I have to do
is tell the Doctor.

702
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,276
He's not going to be happy.

703
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,989
It's starting.

704
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,574
Janeway to Bridge.

705
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,826
Chakotay here.

706
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,203
<i>Prepare a shuttle for launch,</i>

707
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,579
<i>and have Tuvok</i>
<i>meet me on Deck 6.</i>

708
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,165
Captain?

709
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,624
<i>Kes is leaving us.</i>

710
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,592
Come on.

711
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,636
Captain, I
can't stop it.

712
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,892
Janeway to Chakotay.

713
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,644
Beam us directly
to the Shuttle Bay.

714
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,190
The molecules in Kes's body
are destabilizing.

715
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,025
It's interfering
with the transporter.

716
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,442
Captain, we can't get a lock.

717
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,986
Acknowledged.

718
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,364
Looks like we're going to have
to do this the hard way.

719
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,249
( console beeping warning )

720
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,457
What's happening?

721
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,876
The hull is destabilizing.

722
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,128
The molecular bonds
are breaking down.

723
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,216
Tuvok...

724
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,057
I can't keep going.

725
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,477
I will attempt
a mind-meld,

726
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,563
to help you delay
the transformation.

727
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,608
Our minds are one.

728
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,111
( grunting )

729
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,738
Our thoughts are one.

730
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:52,284
Try to regain
control...

731
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,286
for a moment.

732
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,662
Only for a moment.

733
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,916
Only for...a moment.

734
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,501
( grunting )

735
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,172
You must hurry.

736
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,802
( alarm blaring )

737
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,887
Hull breach on Decks 3, 4 and 5.

738
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,931
Emergency containment fields.

739
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:18,435
JANEWAY:
<i>Janeway to the Bridge.</i>
<i>Kes is aboard the shuttle.</i>

740
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:19,727
<i>Initiate launch sequence.</i>

741
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,646
Acknowledged.

742
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,028
Shuttle distance,
100,000 kilometers.

743
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,529
Speed, one-quarter impulse.

744
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,576
Can you hail her?

745
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,828
I've been trying.

746
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,121
KES:
<i>It's happening.</i>

747
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,623
<i>It's happening to me.</i>

748
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,250
Her atomic structure
is completely

749
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,584
destabilizing.

750
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,172
My gift to you.

751
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,103
Torres to Bridge.

752
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,480
The warp core
just came on line.

753
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,357
<i>Matter, antimatter reaction</i>

754
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,607
at 102 percent...

755
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,943
One hundred
and ten percent?

756
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,778
A hundred and twenty!

757
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,867
This can't be right.

758
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,118
Our speed is...

759
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,411
It's impossible!

760
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,538
We're coming apart!

761
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,257
We've just dropped
out of...

762
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,842
whatever it was
we were in.

763
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,635
Systems coming back on line.

764
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,179
On screen.

765
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,308
Where are we?

766
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:44,687
Nine point five thousand
lightyears from where we were.

767
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,027
She's thrown us safely
beyond Borg space.

768
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,323
Ten years closer to home.

769
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:14,050
( door opens )

770
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,725
I've extracted 82 percent
of the Borg hardware.

771
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,727
The remaining
bio-implants are stable,

772
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,729
and better than anything
I could synthesize

773
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,064
at such short notice.

774
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,111
It is acceptable.

775
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,280
Fashion, of course,
is hardly my forte.

776
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,656
Nevertheless, I've
managed to balance

777
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,451
functionality
and aesthetics

778
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,035
in a pleasing
enough manner.

779
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,245
I also took the liberty

780
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,080
of stimulating
your hair follicles,

781
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,874
a vicarious experience for
me, as you might imagine.

782
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,839
You'll have to spend
a few hours each day

783
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,883
regenerating in a Borg alcove
until your human

784
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,427
metabolism can function
on its own.

785
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,262
We'll leave one
operational.

786
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,973
Understood.

787
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,350
Let's see how things go
over the next few weeks.

788
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,146
I'll consider granting you
access to the rest of the ship,

789
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,231
once I can trust
that you won't try

790
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,899
to get us all assimilated again.

791
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,820
It will not happen again.

792
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,949
Good.

793
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:23,077
If you need anything...
contact me.

794
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,916
Red.

795
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,585
What?

796
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,963
The child you spoke of...
the girl.

797
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,549
Her favorite color was red.
