00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,478
(<i> imitating engine humming</i> )

2
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,857
Alert! Alert!

3
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,317
Decompression on Platform 684!

4
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,319
Brace for hull rupture!

5
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,112
Thrusters are down!

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,031
We're going to crash!

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,033
(<i> screaming</i> )

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,368
Hey, what do you think?

9
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,996
Look at the detail
on that dorsal plating.

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,497
Impressive.

11
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,875
Are you sure you're
willing to part with it?

12
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,668
I just hope your boy enjoys it
as much as I do.

13
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,252
I'm certain
he will

14
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,006
if we make it home in
time for his birthday.

15
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,256
We'll make it.

16
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,468
If you and Sivad had
a child of your own,

17
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,095
you'd have an excuse to
play with toys more often.

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,976
I'm detecting a fluctuation
in tank 4.

19
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,144
There's a full-scale rupture
in progress!

20
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,479
Isolate the deck.

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,649
Activate the emergency
containment field.

22
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,485
The emergency systems
are off-line.

23
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,738
Backup controls
are down too.

24
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,489
Eject the tank.
Here?

25
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,991
There's
an inhabited system...

26
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,617
We have no choice.

27
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,247
The ejection ports
aren't responding.

28
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,498
Impossible.

29
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,917
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

30
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,209
There's another rupture forming

31
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,045
in tank 6.

32
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,923
We'll have to

33
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,173
send somebody
down there

34
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,592
to seal off
the tanks manually.

35
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,134
Contact the Theta Corps.

36
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,970
Communications are down.

37
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,224
Get down to the injector pod
and seal those tanks.

38
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,394
I didn't sign up
for core labor.

39
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,604
I'm giving you an order.

40
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,439
I'll be contaminated.

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,899
Now!

42
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:51,148
The flame, like emotion,
is a primitive force.

43
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:55,652
Left unchecked,
it's chaotic, destructive,

44
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,156
but, if controlled,
it can be a powerful tool.

45
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,576
The lamp controls the flame,
as you must learn

46
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,785
to control your emotions.

47
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,454
I lost my temper--
No big deal.

48
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:10,084
You destroyed the Doctor's
holographic camera.

49
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,754
I told him three times
to leave Engineering,

50
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,547
but he kept buzzing around

51
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,092
snapping pictures
for some photo essay.

52
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,468
"A day in the life
of the warp core."

53
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,598
I apologized, and I
replicated him a new camera.

54
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,102
You have a long history
of emotional volatility.

55
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,145
The point of this exercise

56
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,856
is not to atone
for past transgressions,

57
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,983
but to prevent future ones.

58
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,611
You can't order
someone to meditate.

59
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,281
Commander Chakotay
thinks otherwise.

60
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,408
(<i> sighs angrily</i> )

61
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,960
Are my eyes supposed
to be open

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,335
or closed
for this part?

63
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,214
Whichever allows you
to focus your mind.

64
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,721
Envision the flame
burning within you.

65
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,056
(<i> laughs</i> )

66
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,058
Sorry.

67
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,478
The flame grows hotter...

68
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,730
a point of white light.

69
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,483
Follow it backward
through the years

70
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,194
to a time when you were
younger, a child.

71
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,612
(<i> laughing</i> )

72
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,740
Is there something
amusing, Lieutenant?

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,204
I'm sorry. An image just
flashed through my mind.

74
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,998
You as a child.

75
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,250
Those pointy little ears.

76
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,460
You must have been cute.

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,212
Indeed.

78
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,714
Please follow my instructions

79
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,175
or we'll discontinue
this exercise.

80
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,425
(<i> clears throat</i> )

81
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,385
Right. Me-- Childhood.

82
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,720
How old?

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,764
Your earliest memories.

84
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,641
Try to recall a time

85
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,186
when you experienced
uncontrollable anger.

86
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,942
Daniel Bird.

87
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,527
I beg your pardon?

88
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,280
Well, he was one

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,949
of my classmates
in grammar school.

90
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,327
He was always terrorizing me.

91
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,831
He used to point
at my cranial ridges

92
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,459
and tease me
about being half-Klingon.

93
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,712
He called me...

94
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,297
"Miss Turtlehead."

95
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,632
That angered you.

96
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,134
Of course, it did.

97
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,139
So I attacked him once,
during recess...

98
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,682
on the gyro-swing.

99
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,809
I disengaged
the centrifugal governor.

100
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,812
He was spinning so fast,
he almost flew apart.

101
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,480
Then I yanked him off the swing

102
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,524
and started pounding
his little face.

103
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,401
If Miss Malvin hadn't showed up,
I probably would have...

104
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,403
Describe the anger
you felt at that moment.

105
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,241
I...

106
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,576
I wanted to hurt him.

107
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,040
To take revenge for all
the humiliation he caused me.

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,668
Your anger was
a source of strength.

109
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,589
It protected you,
gave you courage.

110
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,385
I suppose it did.

111
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,636
And, when the Doctor
tried to take

112
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,097
a holo-photograph
of you?

113
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,514
I was annoyed.

114
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,392
He kept getting in the way.

115
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,103
The rage within you runs deep.

116
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,897
It's been with you
for many years.

117
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,900
I'm not a Vulcan.
I'll survive.

118
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,652
Whatever you say...

119
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,862
Miss Turtlehead.

120
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,906
What did you say?

121
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,866
You're easily provoked.

122
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,911
You must learn
to master your emotions.

123
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,705
I've had enough mastery
for one day.

124
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,707
School's out.

125
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,722
So how'd it go
with B'Elanna today?

126
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,434
Our meditation sessions
are confidential.

127
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,186
No. I'm not asking
for sordid details.

128
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,687
I just want to know

129
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,815
if you think
you can help her.

130
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,360
Her training will be
a challenge for both of us.

131
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,736
(<i> chuckling</i> )

132
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,655
Take it from me,
getting B'Elanna

133
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,824
to control her temper
is like convincing

134
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,076
a Ferengi to leave
his estate to charity.

135
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,244
(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

136
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,745
KIM:
Captain, we're receiving

137
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,164
an automated
distress call.

138
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,373
Origin.

139
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,125
Coordinates
121 by 268.

140
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,585
Range: Two billion
kilometers.

141
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,837
Who's sending it?

142
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,546
I can't tell.

143
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,799
Let them know help's on the way.
Set a course, Mr. Paris.

144
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,648
37 escape pods.

145
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,608
PARIS:
They're
contaminated

146
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,944
with theta radiation.
Malon?

147
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,529
Possibly. Life signs?

148
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,739
Two, but they're erratic.

149
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,116
Beam them to Sick Bay.

150
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,494
Initiate biohazard
containment procedures.

151
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,204
TUVOK:
Theta radiation
has affected

152
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,289
a radius
of 600 million kilometers.

153
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,623
Source?

154
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,793
A Malon freighter traveling
at high impulse.

155
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,753
It appears to be abandoned.

156
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,175
TUVOK:
I thought we'd seen
the last of the Malon.

157
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,469
I guess they're looking
for new places

158
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,970
to dump their toxic waste.

159
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,722
Do we know what happened
to their ship?

160
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,890
Were they attacked?

161
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,599
I'm just as curious
as you are.

162
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,060
Can you revive
either of them?

163
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,444
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

164
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,446
Fesek...

165
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,823
(<i> coughing</i> )

166
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,909
Controller Fesek.

167
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,118
Where am I?

168
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,412
You're on my vessel.

169
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,829
We responded to
your distress call.

170
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,914
My ship...

171
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,083
It's heavily damaged.
Where?

172
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,584
Three million kilometers
from here.

173
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,002
That's too close.

174
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,422
We've got to get further away.
Calm down.

175
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,964
Calm down.

176
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,466
Tell me what's wrong
with your ship.

177
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,051
Why did you abandon it?

178
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,599
We were on a waste
export mission.

179
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,142
Dumping theta radiation.

180
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,520
Two of the theta tanks ruptured.

181
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,565
Systems malfunctioned
one-by-one--

182
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,984
Communications, navigation,
propulsion.

183
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,362
We had no choice.

184
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,655
Radiation was venting
from every port.

185
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,200
Over 60 crewmen died

186
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,493
within minutes.

187
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,078
It was chaos.

188
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,124
We stumbled through the gas
to get to the escape pods.

189
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,209
Only a few of us made it.

190
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,133
Where are the others?

191
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,593
The two of you were

192
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,553
the only ones
we found alive.

193
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,731
Listen to me... very carefully.

194
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,068
The fact that we're still here

195
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,571
means the ship
hasn't exploded... yet.

196
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,699
When it does, over four trillion
isotons of antimatter waste

197
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,785
is going to ignite.

198
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,623
Everything within three
light-years will be destroyed.

199
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,000
Janeway to the Bridge.

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,418
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Go ahead.</i>

201
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,752
Put at least five light-years
between us

202
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,045
and the Malon freighter,
quickly.

203
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,339
You heard her, Tom.

204
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,174
JANEWAY:
<i>Send out a sector-wide alert.</i>

205
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,510
Warn any other ships
in the vicinity

206
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,428
<i>to evacuate immediately.</i>

207
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,054
Our warp field
just collapsed.

208
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,266
All this theta radiation,
it's disrupting subspace.

209
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,310
Can you reinitialize the field?

210
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,727
Negative.

211
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,606
Tuvok...

212
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,566
Without warp drive,

213
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,276
there's no chance we'll
clear the blast radius.

214
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,819
Agreed.

215
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,030
Mr. Paris, set a course
for the freighter, full impulse.

216
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,032
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>
What?!

217
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,660
If we can't outrun your ship,
maybe we can disable it.

218
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,328
Every deck has been
contaminated.

219
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,039
Anyone who goes on board
will liquefy within minutes.

220
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,541
We'll find a way.

221
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,918
We? I'm not going
anywhere near that vessel.

222
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,129
You can either
stay and help us

223
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,215
or I'll send you back
to your escape pod.

224
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,508
Your choice.

225
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,718
Clean them up, Doctor.

226
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,762
I need them on the Bridge.

227
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,990
JANEWAY:
How long until those

228
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,450
storage tanks explode?

229
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,327
Approximately six hours.

230
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,037
Can we get
an away team on board?

231
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,664
The freighter's hull
is intact.

232
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,832
Life support appears
to be operational.

233
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,585
However, 33 of 42 decks

234
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,087
are flooded with high levels
of theta radiation.

235
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,754
Including the control room,

236
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,049
which is where we'd have to go
to reestablish containment.

237
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,384
As I told you...

238
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,719
We could beam onto one
of the lower levels

239
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,303
where there's
less radiation

240
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,305
and vent the contaminated
sections one by one.

241
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,140
Clear a path
to the control room.

242
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,351
I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

243
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,145
but if what you're
considering were possible,

244
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,023
we'd have tried it before
we abandoned the ship.

245
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,483
We have years
of experience

246
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,859
aboard freighters
of this gradient.

247
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,445
TORRES:
Your experience

248
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,739
is what got us into this
mess in the first place.

249
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,865
JANEWAY:
That's enough, Lieutenant.

250
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,325
Maybe there's another way.

251
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,702
I'm listening.

252
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,287
Four hours
from here,

253
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,872
there's a nebula
that could protect us

254
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,165
from the blast.

255
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,375
We could alter course--

256
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,753
Wait there
until after the explosion.

257
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,463
There are at least
three other ships

258
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,838
in the sector.

259
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,215
What about them?

260
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,092
I don't see what we can do.

261
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,428
So hundreds of people
become contaminated

262
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,180
because you're not willing
to clean up your garbage.

263
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,057
Lieutenant.

264
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,309
Assemble an away team.

265
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,977
We're going over there.

266
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,020
Wait!

267
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,774
Tell them about the<i> vihaar.</i>

268
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,692
What's he talking about?

269
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,235
Nothing. It's a myth.

270
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,571
CHAKOTAY:
What kind of myth?

271
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,406
It's an old story

272
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,492
shared among
freighter crews.

273
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,370
Some of them say
they've seen creatures

274
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,080
in the theta
storage tanks.

275
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,957
Creatures?

276
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,833
Created by
radiogenic wastes.

277
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,963
According to the legend,
they are poisonous monsters

278
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,508
that wreak havoc
aboard Malon ships.

279
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,842
It's a common belief

280
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,179
among our more
superstitious recruits.

281
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,973
I never believed it myself,
but during the evacuation,

282
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,225
some of the crew people
saw something, a form.

283
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,812
Hallucinations are one
of the first symptoms

284
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,980
of theta poisoning.
You know that.

285
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,608
Maybe. Then how do you
explain what happened?

286
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,818
We checked every system.

287
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,194
TORRES:
You'd say anything

288
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,780
to get out of going back
to that freighter.

289
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,365
If you'd been there...

290
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,117
you'd be afraid
to go back too.

291
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,871
This chamber seems to be

292
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,414
the least affected
by radiation.

293
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,749
We'll beam in there.

294
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,835
That's 15 decks
below the control room.

295
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,253
We'll have to
work our way up.

296
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,298
The pressurization systems,
they're off-line.

297
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,758
How will we vent the gas?

298
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,052
NEELIX:
There are two main
air locks on each deck.

299
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,721
We'll open them
as we go--

300
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,930
Perform a series
of controlled
decompressions.

301
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,850
What's to stop us
from being vented?

302
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,518
Force fields.

303
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,062
I spent six years
aboard a Talaxian
garbage scow.

304
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,815
I know a few things
about waste management.

305
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,942
Even low levels of theta
radiation can be lethal.

306
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,111
Our Doctor's developed
an inoculation.

307
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,072
It'll temporarily
prevent our cells

308
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,448
from absorbing the radiation.

309
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,783
How long will it last?

310
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,076
Two, three hours.

311
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,452
Half of the doors
and bulkheads are fused.

312
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,704
The ascenders are off-line.

313
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,455
It could take us
twice as long as that

314
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,290
to reach the control room.
Then we'll have to work quickly.

315
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,959
We'll take phasers
to cut through any obstacles.

316
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,838
I've ordered my men to do
a lot of risky things,

317
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,964
but nothing as
foolish as this.

318
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,633
More foolish
than towing around

319
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,094
a trillion isotons
of toxic waste?

320
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,304
We take every precaution
to keep it contained.

321
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,306
Until you dump it
in someone's backyard.

322
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,226
Is your crew always
so... diplomatic?

323
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,686
Your concerns are noted.

324
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,978
Get them inoculated.

325
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,815
We'll meet you in
Transporter Room 1.

326
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:47,530
We're trying to avoid
explosions, remember?

327
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,657
Oh, not another lecture
about my emotions.

328
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,576
No. A lecture
about how to treat guests

329
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,993
aboard this ship.

330
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,328
Guests? Chakotay,
these people

331
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,830
are the scourge
of the Quadrant.

332
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,290
Agreed. But right now,

333
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,626
they're our only hope
of repairing that freighter,

334
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,211
so I suggest
you make friends.

335
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,130
Diplomacy...

336
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,257
Janeway's answer
to everything.

337
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,050
This isn't the Captain talking.

338
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,761
It's me, and I'm
giving you an order.

339
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,011
Keep your temper in check.

340
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,305
Understood?

341
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,766
Understood?

342
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,934
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Yeah.

343
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,977
I didn't hear you.
Yes.

344
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,939
B'Elanna, I need your expertise
on this mission,

345
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,231
not your bad mood.

346
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,109
I'll see what I can do.

347
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,508
(<i> choking</i> )

348
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,009
CHAKOTAY:
Ready, Neelix?

349
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,260
Uh, not quite.

350
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,804
Do we still
have a minute?

351
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,723
It's just... it's
not quite strong enough yet.

352
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,934
Oh...

353
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,895
Would you mind passing me
that little dish?

354
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,189
Neelix, I admire
your dedication,

355
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,066
but the crew can figure
out lunch on their own.

356
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,444
Lunch and dinner
and a midnight snack

357
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,363
have all been taken care of.

358
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,865
This is for me.

359
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,368
It's a Talaxian
theta radiation remedy--

360
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,830
Crushed Rama leaf
and Katyllian clove.

361
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,415
It helps fortify
the cellular membranes.

362
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,918
I think the Doctor's
inoculation might be

363
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,211
a better way to go.

364
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,129
Every little bit helps.

365
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,174
Oh, uh, by the way...

366
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,467
thank you.

367
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,802
For what?

368
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,179
For sending me on such
an important mission--

369
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,056
Not that my duties
in the Mess Hall

370
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,307
aren't challenging.

371
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,517
It was an easy choice.

372
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,894
You were the best man
for the job.

373
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,188
Well... our scow once ran

374
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,065
smack into a theta
radiation field...

375
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,692
knocked the propulsion out.

376
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,110
We had no choice
but to sit there.

377
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,488
We were barely alive
when they found us.

378
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,576
If it hadn't been for this,
nobody would have survived.

379
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:03,207
(<i> grunting</i> )

380
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,341
Once you get past the...
the choking reflex...

381
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,343
it's really not...
really not so bad.

382
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,553
Want to try some?

383
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,263
No. I'll take my chances.

384
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,766
KIM:
<i>Transporter Room 1</i>
<i>to Commander Chakotay.</i>

385
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,267
<i>We're ready to proceed.</i>

386
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,602
On our way.

387
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,066
B'Elanna...

388
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,901
aren't you
forgetting something?

389
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,277
I don't think so.

390
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,280
Well... uh, a "good-bye"
would be nice

391
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,783
"so long," "see you soon"--
Something along those lines.

392
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,158
I didn't want
to risk it.

393
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,577
Risk what?
Starting an argument.

394
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,204
Ha! Argument? Us?

395
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,791
So I hear it's been
a short fuse kind of day.

396
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,000
About this long.

397
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,501
Nothing you can't handle.

398
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,753
If you think so.

399
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,046
I know so.

400
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,299
I suppose it's always
going to be like this.

401
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,342
Like what?
Me against the galaxy.

402
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,386
Well, the galaxy
doesn't stand a chance.

403
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,014
Now... promise me

404
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,558
that you're going to be
careful over there.

405
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,893
No stopping to have fun.

406
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,771
Fun? On a Malon
freighter?

407
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,650
I'll see you soon.

408
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,705
(<i> coughing</i> )

409
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,791
Well, it's nothing
a fresh coat of paint

410
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,167
wouldn't brighten up.

411
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,877
This way.

412
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,754
Theta radiation
density--

413
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,632
20 million EV
per cubic meter.

414
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,258
Structural integrity
is holding.

415
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,885
(<i> coughs</i> )

416
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,346
I wish I could say the same
for my lungs.

417
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,766
What was that?

418
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,644
This corridor's filled
with methogenic particles,

419
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,895
highly charged.

420
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,396
(<i> tricorder beeping loudly</i> )

421
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,359
Something's causing
an electrostatic cascade.

422
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,987
Our scanning signals
are igniting the particles.

423
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,531
It's the tricorders.
Take cover!

424
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,076
(<i> all coughing</i> )

425
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,833
No more tricorders.

426
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,757
Control mechanisms are down.

427
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,635
We're going to have to open
the air locks manually.

428
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,554
Wait here.
We'll take care of it.

429
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,056
B'Elanna, go
with them.

430
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,265
We can do this ourselves.

431
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,476
I'd prefer to keep an
eye on your progress.

432
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,811
You're on my freighter.

433
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,270
I'm in charge here.

434
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,772
You abandoned ship, remember?

435
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,399
You take your orders from me.

436
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,028
We'll have to crawl
into an injector port.

437
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,031
It's only big enough
for two people.

438
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,366
Pelk, you
stay with us.

439
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,162
Shall we?

440
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,173
How can you stand

441
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,925
to work in these
conditions?

442
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,135
You think we're animals,
don't you?

443
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,636
You said it,
not me.

444
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,514
I'm a waste controller
half the year.

445
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,184
Do you know what I do
the rest of the time?

446
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,270
I'm a sculptor.

447
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,563
What's your point?

448
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,315
Every year,
I give up work I love

449
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,443
to expose myself to radiation

450
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,113
that will probably
cut my life in half.

451
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,488
Then why do it?

452
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,741
Have you ever been
to Malon Prime?

453
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,701
It's a remarkable place.

454
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,704
It's one of the most beautiful
worlds you'll ever see.

455
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,625
Our planet would choke
with industrial wastes

456
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,586
if it weren't for the sacrifices
of people like me.

457
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,338
How many worlds are you
willing to contaminate

458
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,716
to keep your own home so tidy?

459
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,261
Do you have any idea
of the trouble we go to

460
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,513
to locate isolated areas?

461
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,731
Manual actuators.

462
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,775
I'll release them.

463
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,069
You monitor
the pressure variance.

464
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,029
Right.

465
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,284
Do you have any children?

466
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,701
No.

467
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,411
I have a son.

468
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,705
He's 7 years old.

469
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,041
He wants to be
a waste controller

470
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,417
when he grows up.

471
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,586
You must be very proud.

472
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,340
Ready.

473
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,884
Torres to Chakotay.

474
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,470
Stand by
for the decompression sequence.

475
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,847
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

476
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,736
It didn't work.

477
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,740
There's something jamming
the air-lock controls.

478
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,034
<i>Torres to Chakotay.</i>

479
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,285
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

480
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,204
<i>The actuators aren't working.</i>

481
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:54,290
<i>Somebody's going to have</i>
<i>to go up there and take a look.</i>

482
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,625
Wait, that deck
is still contaminated.

483
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,877
I'll go.

484
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,130
I've been exposed
to worse.

485
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,422
Wait.

486
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,761
One for the road.

487
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,014
It's probably
just the decouplers.

488
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,184
They're always getting
encrusted with oxides.

489
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,317
(<i> wheezing</i> )

490
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,082
Who's there?

491

(<i> screaming</i> )

496
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,114
I... I saw it...

497
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,116
I saw it...

498
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,325
What?

499
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,077
The creature.

500
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,458
Give me 20 cc's
of anesthezine.

Transporter status.

502
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,301

<i>Still too much interference.</i>

503
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,844
<i>I'll try compensating. Stand by</i>
<i>for further instructions.</i>

504
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,554
TORRES: What happened?
We don't know.

505
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,223
He went away for a minute.

506
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,682
He screamed, and
we found him here.

507
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,601
These look like
chemical burns.

508
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,729
Without tricorders,
it's hard to make a diagnosis.

509
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,440
It's here.

510
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,024
What?

511
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,483
The creature.

512
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,445
You're hallucinating.

513
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,904
It's the radiation,

514
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,990
but you're going
to be all right.

515
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,992
No!

516
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,286
It attacked me.

517
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:58,789
It... a...

00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,833

00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,293
Pelk, get up!

00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,379
(<i> groaning</i> )

521
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,091
He's not responding.

522
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,814
He said the creature
attacked him.

523
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,858
He imagined it.

524
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,861
He was probably scalded
when that conduit ruptured.

525
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,614
Or maybe there is someone else
on this ship.

526
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,074

<i>Aye, sir.</i>

533
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,674
Someone still needs

534
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,634
to get up there
and open the air locks.

535
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,886
Me.

536
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,471
CHAKOTAY:
Hold on.

537
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,431
I'll join you.

538
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,142
From now on,
nobody works alone.

539
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,197
Progress?

540
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,573
They've vented five decks--
Ten to go.

541
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,326
At this rate,

542
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,953
they'll reach the control room
in approximately three hours.

543
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,706
However, the storage tanks
will detonate in less than two.

544
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,084
I've been working on
a contingency plan.

545
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,336
An O-type star.

546
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,755
If the freighter exploded
within the star's corona,

547
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,298
it might absorb
the radiation.

548
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,926
The star is not
in the freighter's trajectory.

549
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,929
What if we gave it
a little nudge?

550
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,597
A series of carefully timed
tractor pulses

551
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,683
could alter
the freighter's course,

552
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,519
but, given the vessel's
weakened state,

553
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,812
one miscalculation
could set off the explosions.

554
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,940
I'm still counting on
the away team to succeed.

555
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,110
But I want to be ready with
Plan B if they don't.

556
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,073
TORRES:
I don't know about
the rest of you,

557
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,075
but I could sure use
a sonic shower.

558
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,410
NEELIX:
I'd love to soak

559
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,869
in a hot bath
for a day or two.

560
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,913
Oh, not me-- I want to
feel those sonic pulses

561
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,874
dissolving every last atom
of this grime off my body.

562
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,794
FESEK:
We have
a decontamination bay on board

563
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,046
that can purge
up to 50 workers at a time.

564
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,006
Well, that
sounds like fun.

565
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,092
(<i> coughing</i> )

566
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,306
B'Elanna?

567
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,891
I'm okay. I'm just
a little light-headed.

568
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,395
Your hand.

569
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,481
Oh, God...

570
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,984
FESEK:
Freighter blight--

571
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,402
From the prolonged
exposure.

572
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,778
Lovely.

573
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,948
In my business,
it's an occupational hazard.

574
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,408
We'd better try inoculating
you again.

575
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,867
If she's blistering,

576
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,660
she's already received
a fatal dose of radiation.

577
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,498
She needs treatment.
I'll live. Let's keep moving.

578
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,166
We have medicines
in the infirmary.

579
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,459
It's only two sections
from here.

580
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,586
We don't have time
for a detour.

581
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,087
B'Elanna, go with him.

582
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,839
We'll meet you outside
the control room.

583
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,132
Chakotay, I'm fine.

584
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,716
I said go.

585
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,733
This is the infirmary?

586
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,611
Looks more like a morgue.

587
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,159
What happened to him?

588
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,411
It looks like he
was being treated

589
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,745
for long-term exposure.

590
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,164
He was probably
left behind

591
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,457
during the evacuation.

592
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,376
Tough luck, huh?

593
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,003
There was nothing more
we could do for him.

594
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,338
He was a core laborer.

595
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,340
Meaning?

596
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,342
He worked close
to the storage tanks.

597
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,637
Only three of ten core laborers
survive a standard mission.

598
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,973
Occupational hazard?

599
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,226
They know the risks
when they accept the assignment.

600
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,811
They know they're going
to end up like this?

601
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,231
Core laborers can make more
in two months

602
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,358
than most Malon make
in a lifetime.

603
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,069
What good is the money if
they're not around to collect?

604
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,156
It will go to his family.

605
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,952
What is that thing?

606
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,871
It's a subdermal injector.

607
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,209
It contains analeptic compounds
to reverse the cell damage.

608
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,753
I feel better already.

609
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,130
I won't hurt you.

610
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,299
I've done this
a hundred times.

611
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:26,014
You'll feel a slight
burning sensation.

612
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,019
Commander...

613
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,938
the Captain's Plan B.

614
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,898
I've calculated
the inertial force

615
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,983
required to divert
the freighter.

616
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,737
Plan C: Shield modulations
that should reduce

617
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,655
the structural
damage of<i> Voyager.</i>

618
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,616
It will also help
protect the crew

619
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,410
against theta radiation
poisoning... if we fail.

620
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,412
A wise precaution.

621
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,372
With any luck, we
won't be needing it.

622
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,083
I didn't think
Vulcans believed in luck.

623
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,543
As a rule, we don't,

624
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,336
but serving with
Captain Janeway

625
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,088
has taught
me otherwise.

626
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,923
She does seem to succeed

627
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,134
more often than
random chance would allow.

628
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,136
I'll factor it
into my calculations.

629
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,099
Is there a Plan D?

630
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,143
No.

631
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,900
Initiating decompression
sequence, Deck 4!

632
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,235
Deck clear!

633
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,987
NEELIX:

(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

635
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,078
The air locks are opening
on this deck!

636
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,871
What?

637
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,123
I can't close them!

638
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,459
Force fields!
Where are they?

639
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,918
They're off-line!

640
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,462
We've got to get
off this deck!

641
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,213
Move!

642
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,758
This way!

643
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,059
(<i> explosion</i> )

644
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,229

645
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,315

646
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,238
Chakotay!

647
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,824
He was right
behind me.

648
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,408
Torres to Chakotay.

649
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,037
That deck is
a vacuum by now.

650
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,331
Torres to<i> Voyager.</i> 
KIM:<i> Acknowledged.</i>

651
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,041
Lock on
to Chakotay's com signal

652
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,626
and beam him to Sick Bay.

653
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:25,967
<i>We've got him.</i>
<i>He's okay.</i>

654
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,636
I thought that deck
was secure!

655
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,928
It was.

656
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,972
Then why did we almost
get blown into space?

657
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,016
I don't know.

658
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,685
Air locks don't open
by themselves!

659
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,102
What are you saying?

660
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,229
You think it was me?

661
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,856
Calm down,
both of you!

662
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,316
We don't have time to argue
about what happened.

663
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,360
We've got to keep moving.

664
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,711
Chakotay?

665
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:01,920
Unconscious but stable.

666
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,963
The Doctor is
treating him now.

667
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,716
We'll be able to talk to
him in less than an hour.

668
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,133
I'll want a full report.

669
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,927
Shall I beam
to the freighter

670
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,262
and take command
of the away team?

671
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,471
I just spoke with B'Elanna.

672
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,765
She's got everything
under control.

673
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,933
This is a dangerous
situation.

674
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,227
There is no margin
for emotional error.

675
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,604
We have plenty to do here.

676
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,522
Help me remodulate
the tractor beam.

677
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,526
B'Elanna is unpredictable,
Captain.

678
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,111
Under these
circumstances,

679
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,113
her volatile nature could
compromise the mission.

680
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,656
Your concerns
are noted,

681
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,032
but, if I send
you over there,

682
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,659
I'd be sending
the wrong message--

683
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,245
That I don't have faith
in her, but I do.

684
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,539
Your faith is admirable,
but logic suggests...

685
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,375
This isn't about logic.
It's about trust.

686
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,710
She'll come through for us.

687
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,128
Now, give me a hand.

688
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,591
NEELIX:
Lieutenant?

689
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,305
Lieute...

690
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,182
Are you all right?

691
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,184
Fine.

692
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,436
Report.

693
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,938
We just vented the last deck.

694
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,482
We should have a clear path
to the control room.

695
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,152
Let's get this thing
over with then.

696
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,904
If you need to rest...

697
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,405
I said I'm fine.

698
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,035
I was...

699
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,329
meditating.

700
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,539
Meditating?

Do me a favor.

704
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,213
Don't tell Tuvok.

The next time I
volunteer to board

709
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,101
a Malon freighter,
check me into Sick Bay

710
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,103
and have my
head examined.

711
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,022
I feel like
I'm ready to explode.

712
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,066

this together.

713
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,360
I got a knack

<i>We're outside the control room,</i>

719
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:07,587
but without tricorders, we can't
tell if it's safe to go in.

720
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,881
(<i> console beeping</i> )

721
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,340
The room is too heavily
shielded.

722
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,717
Our sensors can't penetrate it.

723
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,468
<i>You must stand by.</i>

724
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,470
The theta dampening field
is still active.

725
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,889
It should be safe.

726
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,017
After you.

727
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,981
(<i> coughing</i> )

728
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,780
It's worse
than I expected.

729
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,409
Theta gas has leaked
into the warp manifold.

730
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,913
We've got less than ten minutes
before this vessel explodes!

731
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,916
Emergency systems are down.

732
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,125
This should feed enough energy
to your power matrix

733
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,003
to reinitialize them.

734
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,671
Try it now.

735
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,801
FESEK:
They're coming
back on line,

736
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,679
but only one containment grid
is still operational.

737
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,014
We have
two unstable tanks.

738
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,724
One grid
can't handle them both.

739
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,351
We'll seal them one at a time.

740
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,272
Doctor?

741
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,608
Easy, Commander.

742
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,901
Ow, my head aches.

743
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,569
I'm not surprised.

744
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,987
You took a severe blow.

745
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,073
I've got to get back
to the freighter.

746
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,407
Not in this condition.

747
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,951
If you want to help,

748
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:22,037
you can answer some questions
about Mr. Pelk's death.

749
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,665
I've found unidentified
tissue in his wounds.

750
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,166
What sort of tissue?

751
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,711
The computer is running
a microcellular scan.

752
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,297
Pelk said he was attacked.

753
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,216
Ah, yes, the Malon bogeyman.

754
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,386
COMPUTER:
<i>Microcellular analysis</i>
<i>is complete.</i>

755
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:49,106
Odd. The tissue is saturated
with theta radiation,

756
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:52,692
but it's not showing signs
of decay.

757
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,153
It came from someone...
or some thing...

758
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,448
that's developed
a resistance to the radiation.

759
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,199
Sick Bay to Seven of Nine.

760
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,743
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

761
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,912
Scan for additional life-forms
aboard the Malon vessel.

762
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,747
<i>I've been running</i>
<i>continuous scans.</i>

763
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,541
I assure you there is no one
there aside from the away team.

764
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,460
This life-form's
heavily irradiated.

765
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,838
It could be blending in
with ambient toxins.

766
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,715
I'll recalibrate our sensors.

767
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,551
Tank 1 stable.

768
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,554
Reroute the containment grid
to Tank 2.

769
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,932
What happened?

770
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,517
A power surge!

771
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,185
We're losing the grid.

772
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,729
It was triggered
from a workstation on this deck.

773
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,356
<i>Janeway to away team.</i>

774
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,067
We've detected an alien
life-form aboard the freighter.

775
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,360
We believe it killed Pelk.

776
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,154
TORRES:
<i>Captain, we just lost power.</i>

777
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,698
We're diverting the freighter
into a nearby star.

778
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,908
Leave the control room
so we can get a lock on you.

779
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,284
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

780
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,331

I've detected

784
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,671
the alien life-form.

785
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,007
It's moving toward
your position.

786
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,684
The gas is being routed through
the environmental system!

787
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,978
I'll try to shut it down!

788
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,813
Is there another way out?

789
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,356
No.

00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,901
Do you have them?

792
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,819
Not yet.

793
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,783
The life-form has entered
the control room.

Get that hatch open!

808
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,465
I'm trying!

You've been

818
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,548
There's no other way
to make them understand.

819
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:47,426
So that's your way of getting
even-- Killing your crew?

820
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,680
Causing an explosion that
will contaminate other ships?

821
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,474
They poisoned me!

822

The freighter's on course
for the star.

No effect.

As long as
they're in the control room,

00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,354
I can't get a lock.

836

I know...
I know that you're so angry,

850
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:14,180
you want to destroy everything

00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,599
another way to make
them understand.

852
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,059
I'm on your side.

853
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,936
I can help you.

854
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:26,109
Innocent people are going to die

The Malon's thrusters
are powering down.

862
00:41:56,681 --> 00:42:00,018
I've restored
the freighter's trajectory.

What makes you say that?

871
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,869
From what
Neelix told me,

872
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,414
you kept your temper
in check over there.

873
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,918
Don't expect me
to make a habit of it.

874
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,794
Well, I've repaired

875
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,423
most of your

876
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,841
I wish I could say
the same for you,

877
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,719
but you've suffered
long-term systemic damage.

878
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,056
Your condition will
deteriorate over time.

879
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,225
It's an occupational hazard.

880
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,477

to explain what happened.

885
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,613
Tell them the truth.
