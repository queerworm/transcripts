1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,297
Hello?

2
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,096
Hello?

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,600
I'm here.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,352
Hello?

5
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,336
(<i> gasps</i> )

6
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,504
(<i> speaks alien language</i> )

7
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,340
I'm here to see Mr. Kurros.

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,800
Could you...?

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,761
(<i> speaking alien language</i> )

10
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,181
Could you tell me where
to find Mr. Kurros? Ooh...

11
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,432
(<i> beeping and clicking</i> )

12
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,767
Wait.

13
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,071
(<i> deep, reverberating moans</i> )

14
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,747
Do not mind Bevvox.

15
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,918
He can be... grouchy
in the morning.

16
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,252
Welcome aboard.

17
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,587
Thank you.

18
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,963
You seem tense.

19
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,965
No.

20
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,259
This is a time
for celebration.

21
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,762
The geo-stability
of your world

22
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,179
has been restored...

23
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,765
your people saved...

24
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,850
and all because you
had the wisdom

25
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,894
to accept our help.

26
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,353
You accomplished in days

27
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,523
what our scientists failed
to achieve in decades.

28
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,903
That it not to say
it was not a challenge.

29
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,988
Finding the precise harmonic

30
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,783
for a planetary
containment field

31
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,868
did put my colleague here
to the test,

32
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,245
but, in the end...

33
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,122
she prevailed.

34
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,499
We owe you our lives.

35
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,168
Solving problems is what we do,

36
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,631
and seeing the look
of gratitude in your eyes

37
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,133
is almost reward enough.

38
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,885
Almost.

39
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,805
I have some bad news.

40
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,516
Our bernicium mines
were destroyed

41
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,019
in the last series of quakes.

42
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,106
The ore's buried
under 60 gigatons of rock.

43
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,523
We can't get to it.

44
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,985
We hoped you'd accept
this instead.

45
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,903
A rubidium geode.

46
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,655
Priceless.

47
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,324
The only one ever found
on our planet.

48
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,076
It is rare...

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,371
but hardly unique,

50
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,500
and it is not what
we agreed upon.

51
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,961
I'm sorry. This is all
we can offer you.

52
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,631
You are lying.

53
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:56,093
The mines collapsed,
but before they did,

54
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,220
you transferred the ore
to a shielded storage facility.

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,473
Needless to say...

56
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,224
we detected it.

57
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,643
Please, we need the ore

58
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,311
to repair our
replicator systems.

59
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,982
Without it, we'll be unable
to feed our people.

60
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,110
Get it to us now...

61
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,279
or I will deactivate
the containment field.

62
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,992
Have you ever experienced
a level-12 seismic event?

63
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,535
Most find it...

64
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,244
...quite unnerving.

65
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,122
No.

66
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,417
I'll have the ore
transported at once.

67
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,255
This... this was all
a misunderstanding.

68
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,633
Of course.

69
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,511
It is already forgotten,
my friend.

70
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,597
Perhaps we will do business
again someday.

71
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,932
Yes.

72
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,601
Show our friend back
to his shuttle.

73
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,856
I would hate for him to get lost
in such an unfamiliar place.

74
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,993
Oh!

75
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,205
Pardon me.

76
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,538
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Yes.

77
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,208
Captain, long-range scans
have detected...

78
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,835
One second.
I've wasted two hours

79
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,462
on this thing
and I'm no closer to solving it.

80
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,464
You can thank Ensign Paris
for introducing

81
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,883
the artifact
to the ship.

82
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,093
He was behind
the last shipwide craze too--

83
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,345
"Yo-yos."

84
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,595
Now it's "sheer lunacy."

85
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,097
Another hour and I'll go insane.

86
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,849
The solution is quite simple.

87
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,142
If you align...

88
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,852
No. I want
to figure this out myself.

89
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,692
You said something
about long-range scans?

90
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,401
They've revealed a planetoid

91
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,696
with high concentrations
of dilithium crystals.

92
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,366
Let's take a look.

93
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,087
KIM:
Got it!

94
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,298
False alarm.

95
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,093
Keep at it, Harry.

96
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,426
We're within visual range.

97
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,096
On screen.

98
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,057
TUVOK:
Initial scans revealed

99
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,476
substantial dilithium deposits
beneath the planetoid's crust.

100
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,187
Full sensor sweep.

101
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,688
(<i> console beeping</i> )

102
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,399
The deposits are in
the upper mantle,

103
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,442
about 60 kilometers down.

104
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
We'll have to use
phasers to cut through...

105
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,737
KIM: Hold on.
What is it?

106
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,488
Some kind of
resonance wave

107
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,283
emanating from the core.
It's building fast, Captain.

108
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,909
Right after we ran
our scans.

109
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,120
That can't be a coincidence.
Back us off, Tom.

110
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,830
The planetoid is destabilizing.

111
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,165
Shields.

112
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,673
Report.

113
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,342
We're trapped in a cloud
of metreon gas.

114
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,718
It's collapsed our warp field

115
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,304
and knocked
impulse engines off-line.

116
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,180
A heavily armed vessel
just dropped out of warp,

117
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,432
off the port bow.

118
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,976
SEVEN:
Captain,
I recognize it.

119
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,560
It's Hazari.

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,354
Species 4228.

121
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,815
Technologically advanced,
extremely violent.

122
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,942
They make excellent
tactical drones.

123
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,444
What do they want with us?

124
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,154
The Hazari are hired

125
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,489
to capture and deliver
alien vessels.

126
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,698
Bounty hunters.

127
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,617
Yes.

128
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,953
So who hired them?
CHAKOTAY: The Malon,

129
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,456
the Devore-- We've made
our share of enemies here.

130
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,333
They're hailing.

131
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,921
<i>Surrender.</i>
<i>No one need be hurt.</i>

132
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,967
<i>My client would prefer</i>
<i>your vessel intact.</i>

133
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,510
Who hired you?

134
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,553
<i>That's not your concern.</i>

135
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,140
I'm only asking because I'm
curious how much they're paying.

136
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,475
Maybe we can do better.

137
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,934
<i>Doubtful.</i>

138
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,394
We're far from defenseless.

139
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,229
Why don't you
save yourself some trouble.

140
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,689
<i>It's no trouble.</i>

141
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,985
Charge phaser banks
to full power.

142
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,778
<i>Fire and you'll ignite</i>
<i>the gas cloud.</i>

143
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,071
<i>You'll be destroyed.</i>

144
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,656
You've left me no choice.

145
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,116
I suggest you back off

146
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,951
if you want to save
your own ship.

147
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,370
End transmission.

148
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,455
They are moving closer.

149
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,291
They've locked on
a tractor beam.

150
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,751
Looks like they're
calling your bluff, Captain.

151
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,170
It was a bluff, wasn't it?

152
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,049
Seven, do we still
have warp power?

153
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,010
Yes, but it's useless while
we remain in the gas cloud.

154
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,387
Maybe not.

155
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,889
Reroute every spare gigawatt
to the shields.

156
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,182
Prepare
to fire phasers.

157
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,475
TUVOK:
Our target?

158
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,893
The gas cloud.

159
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,437
Do you believe the impact
will throw us clear?

160
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,688
If our shields hold.

161
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,565
That's a big if.

162
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,109
Go to warp 1 on my command.

163
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,736
Fire.

164
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,080
Shields are holding.

165
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,331
We're approaching

166
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,790
the perimeter
of the gas cloud.

167
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,252
PARIS:
We're out.

168
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,586
Warp speed.

169
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,632
No sign of pursuit.

170
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,970
They weren't
that heavily damaged.

171
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,473
Why aren't they following us?

172
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,147
There's the reason
they didn't come after us.

173
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,732
They've got
reinforcements

174
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,317
throughout
the sector.

175
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,902
Twenty-three ships.

176
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,946
And long-range scans
show more on the way.

177
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,448
Must be one hell
of a reward.

178
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,366
The size of the bounty
is immaterial.

179
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,244
According to Seven of Nine,
the Hazari pride themselves

180
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,703
on honoring
their agreements.

181
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,747
Great. Bounty hunters
with a work ethic.

182
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,624
CHAKOTAY:
There's got
to be a way out,

183
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,543
something
they haven't anticipated.

184
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,587
Download the data
for the Captain.

185
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,714
She wants to see what she
can come up with on her own.

186
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,147
Should I have the Doctor

187
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,398
prepare
a hypospray?

188
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,690
Excuse me?

189
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,984
So you can absorb

190
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,527
the caffeine
more directly.

191
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,736
Save time.

192
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,988
Point well taken.

193
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,031
I'll make this my last cup.

194
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,493
How about trying
a sounding board?

195
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,536
Oh, you don't want
that job.

196
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,830
Try me.

197
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,415
It's these Hazari.

198
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,334
They're like jackals.

199
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,003
Circling... feinting
to draw us out

200
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,340
while they cut off
every route of escape.

201
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,258
You make them sound
worse than the Borg.

202
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,051
At least the Borg
come straight at you.

203
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,262
The Hazari wait,
invite you to make mistakes.

204
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,515
They've anticipated
almost every move we can make,

205
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,642
and the few things
they seem to have missed,

206
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,892
I'm convinced are traps.

207
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,102
You still glad
you volunteered?

208
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,812
We've faced
tough odds before.

209
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,064
You'll get us through.

210
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,860
Good night.
Night.

211
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,545
There is nothing
like a good problem

212
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,130
to spark the
synapses, is there?

213
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,007
To open the mind

214
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,969
to new possibilities...
new ways of seeing things.

215
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,721
Of course, one must
always confront

216
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,307
self-doubt and fear,

217
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,767
but that is a
small price to pay

218
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:12,273
for the... exhilaration
of finding the perfect solution.

219
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,443
Who are you
and what do you want?

220
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,030
You have a problem, Captain.

221
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,533
I am the solution.

222
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,419
Security to the Mess Hall.
Intruder alert.

223
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,795
I deactivated your
communications device,

224
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,881
Captain, but do not worry.

225
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,925
I am not an intruder.

226
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,553
In fact, I am not really here.

227
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,096
A hologram.

228
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,889
Nothing so crude.

229
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,517
An isomorphic projection.

230
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,608
You actually enjoy this?

231
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,443
It's an acquired taste.

232
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,696
It bears a resemblance
to an Alkian confection

233
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,989
we acquired
several years ago.

234
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,408
"We"?

235
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:07,203
I am a member
of a small group--

236
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,499
Explorers like you, but
we seek out challenges,

237
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,418
problems to be solved--

238
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:17,130
Technological,
biological, social,

239
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,465
even artistic.

240
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,924
A think tank.

241
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,176
I like that.

242
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,305
It's very... apt.

243
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,975
Our "Think Tank" is nearby.

244
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,727
A modest vessel.

245
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,854
I have come to
offer our help

246
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,649
with your Hazari paradox.

247
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,692
"Paradox"?

248
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,153
That is right.

249
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:47,826
Is it an escape route
or is it a trap?

250
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,870
Do they know
that you know

251
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,706
that they know?

252
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,292
It is the best kind
of puzzle--

253
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,671
Pure tactics, psychology.

254
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,921
Something tells me

255
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,839
your help comes
with a price tag.

256
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,428
Whatever your culture has
to offer that is unique.

257
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,764
Technology perhaps,
or maybe something

258
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,890
you would not
even think to value.

259
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,850
I would need a closer look
at your database.

260
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,772
And how do I know<i> you</i>
aren't an Hazari trap?

261
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,357
Maybe they're trying

262
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,694
to lure us into an
ambush like before.

263
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,113
You are wise
to be suspicious, Captain.

264
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,325
We have done some
preliminary analysis

265
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,785
on their maneuvers.

266
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,955
It does suggest some
more likely ambushes.

267
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,958
I've downloaded the data
onto your computer.

268
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,050
All right.

269
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,844
You've got my attention,

270
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,763
but I want to meet
you face-to-face

271
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,557
and the rest of your crew.

272
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,561
Naturally. Our coordinates
are in here too,

273
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,772
but we have our own security
concerns, Captain.

274
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,693
Please bring only one crewman
and no scanning equipment.

275
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,486
Fair enough.

276
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:07,365
Then, I look forward
to meeting you... in person.

277
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,754
TUVOK:
We're approaching
the coordinates.

278
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,630
Full stop.

279
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,424
Looks like
there's nothing here.

280
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,800
Maybe they're cloaked.

281
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,428
I'm reading a subspace flux.

282
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,351
The vessel's hull is composed
of a neutronium-based alloy.

283
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,437
Starfleet's theorized
about such materials,

284
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,772
but we've never come close

285
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,314
to producing them.

286
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,316
Neither have the Borg.

287
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,027
The Think Tank's technology
is advanced.

288
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,988
Well, you and I will have a
chance to evaluate it firsthand.

289
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,240
Mr. Kim,

290
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,368
you have the transport
coordinates.

291
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,881
(<i> speaking alien language</i> )

292
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,258
The universal translator
must be inoperative.

293
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:11,429
Or his speech patterns
are too complex to process.

294
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,978
They must be studying it.

295
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,688
KURROS:
Actually,

296
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,649
she is studying you.

297
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,569
Our resident expert
on temporal physics.

298
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,029
Perhaps the most gifted
member of our group.

299
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,492
She finds you
interesting.

300
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,993
How do you
communicate?

301
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,662
One of my most gifted crewmen,

302
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,790
Seven of Nine.

303
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,667
Bionetic implants...

304
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,961
neural transceivers?

305
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,171
A Borg?

306
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,548
I've never seen one
outside the collective.

307
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,133
I am an individual now.

308
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,218
You may address
your comments to me.

309
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,596
Forgive me.

310
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,182
I am Kurros
and this is Fennim.

311
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,478
(<i> speaking alien language</i> )

312
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,732
In answer
to your earlier question,

313
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,152
this device allows the
members of our group

314
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,196
to communicate
telepathically.

315
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,741
Impressive.

316
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,160
(<i> deep, reverberating moans</i> )

317
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,663
It sounds as if another
member of our crew

318
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,332
is anxious to meet you.

319
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,597
A bioplasmic life-form.

320
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,932
His name is Bevvox.

321
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,852
He prefers
a variable-gravity environment.

322
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,145
What's his specialty?

323
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,399
At the moment, exo-sociology
and quantum mechanics,

324
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,276
but his interests vary
from time to time.

325
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,487
Bevvox founded our group
more than 100 years ago,

326
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,822
after wandering

327
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,074
the galaxy on his own
for a few millennia.

328
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,784
How old is
this creature?

329
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,705
(<i> loud moaning</i> )

330
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:05,919
If you please, that is
a sensitive topic with him.

331
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,298
And there is one
other... individual

332
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,134
who rounds out
our group.

333
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,429
(<i> beeping and clicking</i> )

334
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,098
An artificial intelligence.

335
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,517
The mind
of a mathematician

336
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,853
and the soul
of an artist.

337
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,065
I'm afraid he'd much rather
be modeling a fractal sculpture,

338
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,150
than analyzing the data
of our latest astronomical scan.

339
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,486
And now you have met us all.

340
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,114
A small group of minds,

341
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,491
but we have helped
hundreds of clients.

342
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,910
We turned the tide
in the war

343
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,120
between the Bara Plenum
and the Motali Empire,

344
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,164
reignited the Red Giants
of the Zai Cluster.

345
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,501
Just recently, we found
a cure for the Vidiian phage.

346
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,545
The Vidiians?

347
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,338
You would
hardly recognize them now.

348
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:55,593
Just last month, we helped
retrieve a Lyridian child's

349
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,720
runaway pet--
A subspace mesomorph,

350
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,138
I might add.

351
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,681
We had to invent
a whole new scanning technology

352
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,933
just to find it.

353
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,645
And what did you ask
for as compensation?

354
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,648
One of their transgalactic
star charts--

355
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:12,068
The best map of
the known galaxy ever created.

356
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:16,155
When we helped the citizens
of Rivos V resist the Borg,

357
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,741
all we asked for was the
recipe for their famous

358
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,868
zoth-nut soup.

359
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,829
Care for a taste?

360
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,581
Another time, perhaps.

361
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,378
Tell me,
is there any job you won't do?

362
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,881
What do you mean?

363
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:38,011
Well, we have a non-interference
protocol-- Our Prime Directive.

364
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,304
I'm curious
where you draw the line.

365
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,892
As you know, there is
no shortage of conflict

366
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,687
in what you call
the Delta Quadrant.

367
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,230
Many of our clients are at war.

368
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,152
To be frank, we will assist

369
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,279
in the neutralization
of fleets, starbases,

370
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,782
even planets, but we will
not participate

371
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,493
in the decimation
of an entire species,

372
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,705
nor will we design weapons
of mass destruction.

373
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,665
(<i> artificial intelligence</i>
<i>beeping</i> )

374
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,249
Hmm.

375
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,879
My colleague here wishes
to speak to Seven of Nine

376
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,048
about her bionetic technology.

377
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,966
May he interface
with you?

378
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,480
I am in direct
telepathic communication

379
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,107
with this... individual.

380
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,069
It is requesting
information about

381
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,863
integrating organic components
into its technology.

382
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,448
Feel free to give him
some pointers.

383
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,042
You're welcome.

384
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,961
To business, Captain.

385
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,714
I believe we can solve
the Hazari paradox

386
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,758
without firing
a single weapon.

387
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,593
That's just what
I'm looking for.

388
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,845
Then there is only
the matter of payment.

389
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,435
<i>Voyager's</i> schematics

390
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,353
and an overview
of its database.

391
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,440
Specify what you want
and I'll see what I can do.

392
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,025
I recommend
the replicators.

393
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,194
They're very
popular this year.

394
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,613
I'll contact you
with our requests.

395
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,833
I take it first
contact was a success?

396
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,169
I have some qualms
about their morality,

397
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,130
but I believe
they can help us.

398
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,672
It was an interesting
experience.

399
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,049
Glad to hear it.

400
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,926
We don't have much
good news of our own.

401
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,263
Every escape route
we've considered
is clearly a trap,

402
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:48,015
and more Hazari ships
keep joining the search.

403
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,767
Then we have no choice.

404
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,103
We'll put our own
plans on hold

405
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:55,397
and see what the Think
Tank comes up with.

406
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,204
(<i> door chimes</i> )

407
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,832
Come in.

408
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,416
You have a visitor.

409
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,045
Mr. Kurros has returned
in isomorphic form.

410
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,755
Send him in.

411
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,261
Welcome back.

412
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,264
Captain, we have
compiled a short list

413
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,266
of items we would like.

414
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,725
It was not easy.

415
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,312
<i>Voyager</i> has
a great deal to offer.

416
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:37,231
"Quantum slipstream technology."

417
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,524
I should warn you.

418
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,193
We never got that
to work reliably.

419
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,653
It is still intriguing,
theoretically.

420
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,865
"Neelix's recipe
for<i> chadre'kab?"</i>

421
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,992
Yes.

422
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:52,246
"An ancient Olmec figurine."

423
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,914
I guess Commander Chakotay

424
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,875
could be persuaded
to part with it.

425
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,251
I'm pleased
to hear that.

426
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,008
You can't be serious.

427
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:07,970
I realize the next item
may seem unorthodox,

428
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,222
but I believe

429
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,224
it can be beneficial
to both of us.

430
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,061
You never mentioned anything
about bartering my crew members.

431
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,064
She will have an
extraordinary opportunity

432
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,774
to explore the galaxy
as one of us.

433
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,277
I'm afraid the answer is no.

434
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,405
I understand
your feelings, Captain, but...

435
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:32,953
have you thought to ask
Seven of Nine herself?

436
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,172
A curious proposition.

437
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,840
To say the least.

438
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,302
How do you wish
to proceed?

439
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,179
I want your opinion.

440
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,639
They are offering us
the assistance we require.

441
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,600
I am the payment they require.

442
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,935
The solution is obvious.

443
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,435
This isn't a puzzle, Seven.

444
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,063
There's no "solution."

445
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:02,024
What's at issue here
is your future.

446
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,777
The issue is<i> Voyager's</i> survival.

447
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,695
Sit.

448
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,032
Please.

449
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,703
While I still question

450
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,497
this Think Tank's
way of doing things,

451
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:21,419
there is a genuine
opportunity for exploration.

452
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,422
It could be the chance
of a lifetime.

453
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,215
You're saying I should go?

454
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,592
I don't want you to go,

455
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,054
but it's not my right
to tell you what to do.

456
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,974
Until now, I've kept
a close eye on your progress,

457
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,558
helped you with decisions,

458
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,603
but I think you've learned
enough as an individual

459
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,939
to make this decision yourself.

460
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,024
Would you like to join them?

461
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,236
I am intrigued.

462
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,990
They are an unusual collective
with a compelling mission,

463
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,325
but I require more data.

464
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,951
That's why
I want you

465
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,744
to talk to Kurros yourself.

466
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,122
See if he can answer
your questions.

467
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,498
Captain...

468
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,127
I appreciate
your giving me this choice.

469
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,212
You've earned it.

470
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:10,009
And remember-- If
you do choose to go...

471
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,510
make sure it's what you want...

472
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,597
not what you think
is best for<i> Voyager.</i>

473
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,641
We're getting out of this--

474
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,395
With or without
the Think Tank's help.

475
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,608
Why me?

476
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,819
KURROS:
I admire
your humility.

477
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,364
The collective knowledge
of the Borg

478
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,491
contained within
a single mind.

479
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,327
When we factor in
your innate intelligence

480
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,620
and the enhancements
afforded you

481
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,247
by your bionetic implants,

482
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,958
we concluded you are
an ideal candidate...

483
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,585
the first we have
recruited in 17 years.

484
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,339
When did you arrive
at this assessment?

485
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:51,800
During your... interview.

486
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,513
My dialogue with
the artificial intelligence.

487
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,056
It was the most
efficient way

488
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,016
to evaluate your abilities.

489
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,519
I am sure
you can appreciate that.

490
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,603
How much do you know about me?

491
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,231
Enough to know

492
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,649
that you are tapping
into only a fraction

493
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,529
of your potential
as a member of<i> Voyager's</i> crew.

494
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,323
You were adjusting
the deflector array

495
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,783
to improve shield harmonics.

496
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,494
(<i> chuckles</i> )

497
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,830
Do you find such duties
challenging?

498
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,124
No.

499
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,709
Without problems
that test

500
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:30,005
the limits of your abilities,
you cannot expand them.

501
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,384
Perfection will always be
beyond your reach.

502
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,677
Seven of Nine, you could become

503
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,098
one of the greatest intellects
in the galaxy,

504
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,393
but that will not happen here
among these

505
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,562
limited life-forms.

506
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:47,022
The crew of<i> Voyager</i>
has accepted me...

507
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,274
integrated me

508
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,776
into their collective.

509
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,320
They are your family.

510
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,867
It was hard for me
to leave my family too...

511
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,662
and I was only a child...

512
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:07,167
not much older than you
when you were first assimilated.

513
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,461
Why did you leave?

514
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,171
To help them--
And my world--

515
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,715
Solve a cataclysmic problem.

516
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,386
The Think Tank
requested you as payment?

517
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,263
I did not realize it
at first--

518
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,514
I was too young--

519
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,850
But they gave me
a remarkable opportunity,

520
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,313
and now I am offering
the same to you.

521
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,065
Your group can assist
many collectives,

522
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,568
and yet you often
use that ability

523
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,862
as a means of coercion
to obtain what you want.

524
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,491
How many have suffered
because they were

525
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,742
unwilling to agree
to your conditions?

526
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:45,372
We have a singular mission--
To perfect our knowledge.

527
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:50,961
Perfection sometimes
necessitates selfishness.

528
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,088
It is your life...

529
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,008
not<i> Voyager's,</i>
not Captain Janeway's

530
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,968
or anyone else's.

531
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,470
It is up to you

532
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,015
to achieve the goals
you have set for yourself.

533
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,683
I agree.

534
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,607
But I can do that here.

535
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:17,737
Please, take more time
to think about this.

536
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,741
We will remain nearby
in case you change your mind.

537
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,494
I doubt that will happen.

538
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:27,122
TUVOK:
<i>Seven of Nine,</i>
<i>report to the Bridge.</i>

539
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,706
Acknowledged.

540
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,000
May I accompany you?

541
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,627
As you wish.

542
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,926
Do you have
a problem, Captain?

543
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,721
Two Hazari ships
are approaching.

544
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,473
I have declined their offer.

545
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,184
Our first offer.

546
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,436
Glad you're sticking around.

547
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,646
Take your station.

548
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,023
TUVOK:
They are dropping
out of warp,

549
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,858
flanking
our position.

550
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,444
JANEWAY:
Which one fired?

551
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,778
The ship to starboard.

552
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,699
Shields down to 60 percent.

553
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,116
Evasive maneuvers.

554
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,161
Target their weapon systems
and return fire.

555
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,997
Their shields are holding.

556
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,542
I can't get away.
They're right on top of us.

557
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,420
KIM:
Hull integrity's
been compromised

558
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,713
on Decks 7 and 12.

559
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:19,216
Captain, when the Hazari
strike in pairs,

560
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,176
one ship always
remains behind

561
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,722
to reinforce the shields
of the attacking vessel.

562
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,057
So we should target
the support ship.

563
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,435
How much is this tip
going to cost me?

564
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,353
This one is free.

565
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,814
I'll take it. Tuvok...

566
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,942
Retargeting.

567
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,069
Firing photon torpedoes.

568
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,240
TUVOK:
They are disengaging.

569
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,284
Get us out of here--
Maximum warp.

570
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,619
Thanks for the help.

571
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,204
Consider it a friendly
gesture of good will

572
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,707
in the hopes that Seven
will change her mind.

573
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,041
I have not.

574
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,127
You are making
a fatal mistake.

575
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,464
We have already analyzed
hundreds of scenarios.

576
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,299
<i>Voyager</i> will not survive

577
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,508
without our help.

578
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,343
Your scenarios,
not mine.

579
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,763
Your confidence
is unfounded, Captain.

580
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,765
Reconsider.

581
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,392
Order Seven of Nine to join us.

582
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,812
We have an old expression,
Kurros--

583
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,606
"Don't call us. We'll call you."

584
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:19,025
Remodulate the shields
to a phase-variant frequency.

585
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,368
TUVOK:
His ship is vanishing
from sensors.

586
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,037
It's being absorbed
into subspace.

587
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,331
I get the distinct feeling

588
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,040
they won't take no
for an answer.

589
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,417
Same here.

590
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,670
Looks like we're facing
two threats now--

591
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,382
The Hazari...
and our would-be saviors.

592
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,432
Our offer was denied.

593
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,601
How shall we proceed?

594
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,853
<i>We are already proceeding.</i>

595
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,814
<i>Our offer was refused.</i>

596
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,775
<i>We must let</i>
<i>the scenario continue.</i>

597
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,943
<i>Our calculations</i>
<i>indicate</i>

598
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:06,532
<i>a 96 percent chance</i>
<i>the Borg will still be ours.</i>

599
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,952
Then it is decided.

600
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,288
We will wait...

601
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,750
and let our problem...
solve itself.

602
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,094
MALE:
Duranium hull fragments,

603
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:32,599
a thruster assembly,
human organic residue...

604
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,518
We were supposed
to disable their ship,

605
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,854
not destroy it!

606
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,814
They've entered
the debris field.

607
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:42,693
Detonate the
spatial charges.

608
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,034
Their vessel has taken
heavy damage.

609
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,119
Shields and weapons
are off-line.

610
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,747
Move us into position.

611
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,081
Lock on a tractor beam

612
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,584
and pull them into
the shuttlebay.

613
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,753
We're in transporter range.

614
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,337
I've got a lock.

615
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,589
Two life-forms.

616
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,173
Energize.

617
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,362
Any luck?

618
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,866
I'm still trying to access
their primary database.

619
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,242
Let me guess.

620
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,077
They're the strong
but silent types.

621
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,328
Very silent.

622
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,872
Did you try
a mind-meld?

623
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,039
Without success.

624
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,583
They're unusually resistant.

625
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,167
Well, hold off
on the torture

626
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,169
till we see
what we can dig up here.

627
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,421
(<i> beeping</i> )

628
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,131
CHAKOTAY:
I found something.

629
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,092
A series of encoded
transmissions.

630
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,428
They've been
discussing<i> Voyager--</i>

631
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:52,805
Our coordinates,
our defenses.

632
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,808
Whoever hired the Hazari
know a lot about us.

633
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,016
Check their sensor logs.

634
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,143
See if they had
any visitors recently.

635
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,270
I've got some
bio-readings,

636
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,855
but they're
pretty scrambled.

637
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,148
If they are bio-readings,

638
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,817
perhaps the Doctor
can unscramble them.

639
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,192
Tell him to give it a try.

640
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,241
I've created
a forensic reconstruction

641
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,869
from the bio-readings,
using the holo-emitters.

642
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,830
Brace yourselves.

643
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,375
JANEWAY:
Malon.

644
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,461
Huh... they must
really hold a grudge.

645
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,338
We haven't run
into them for months.

646
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,547
I'm sorry, Doctor.

647
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,966
Something
doesn't feel right.

648
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:32,135
The Malon are
economically
motivated.

649
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,554
And there's no profit
in revenge.

650
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,139
Take a look at this.

651
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,350
Isomorphic signatures

652
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,018
embedded
in the bio-readings.

653
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,436
This was no Malon.

654
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,396
It was only
a projection.

655
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,524
You mean that's
a hologram...

656
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,025
of a hologram?

657
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,527
In a manner
of speaking.

658
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,195
I believe I can restore

659
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,322
the original
bio-signal parameters.

660
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,700
Brace yourself.

661
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,706
JANEWAY:
Well, it appears

662
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,208
our Hazari paradox
is more complex

663
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,251
than we thought.

664
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:10,298
I believe we're both being
manipulated by the same person.

665
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,803
Recognize him?

666
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,430
No.

667
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,599
His name is Kurros.

668
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,977
The Malon you met with

669
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,145
was nothing more
than a projection.

670
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,106
My sensors would have
detected a hologram.

671
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,358
Not this one.

672
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,904
Kurros is a member
of a... Think Tank.

673
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,489
They solve problems
for a price.

674
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,076
Oh, you have
heard of them.

675
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,537
They're notorious
in this sector.

676
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,664
They've made
quite a few enemies.

677
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,332
Enemies who might
be willing to pay

678
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,918
a hell of a bounty.

679
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,961
Their technology
is very advanced.

680
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,963
Makes them
difficult to track.

681
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,297
Not if we work together.

682
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,926
You're the best hunters
in the Quadrant

683
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,761
and we have the perfect lure.

684
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,931
All we have to do now is...

685
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,934
outthink the Think Tank.

686
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,561
We've got a puzzle,

687
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,939
and we're not leaving this room
until we solve it.

688
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,857
The Think Tank
is out there somewhere,

689
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,776
hiding in subspace.

690
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,360
How do we find them?

691
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,320
And even if we can,
their ship's hull

692
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,908
is neutronium-based alloy,
impervious to our weapons.

693
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,077
How do we capture them?

694
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,913
What if we send out
a multispatial probe?

695
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,623
It would take weeks
of scanning to find them.

696
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,999
HAZARI:
Weeks?

697
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,834
We're not willing
to wait that long.

698
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,880
We could use subspatial charges
to force them into the open.

699
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,339
Where do we target
the charges?

700
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,758
We've still got
to find them first.

701
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,301
JANEWAY:
Maybe we're
going about this

702
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,844
the wrong way.

703
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,722
A direct assault
seems unlikely to succeed.

704
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,850
"Pure tactics, psychology..."

705
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,895
that's how they solve problems.

706
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,563
That's what
we have to do.

707
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,398
They've created
this paradox

708
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,693
to manipulate us
into giving them Seven of Nine.

709
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,695
How do we manipulate them?

710
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:58,865
Think.

711
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:18,384
I thought we were onto something
with B'Elanna's plan to...

712
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,678
Forget it.
I was wrong.

713
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,846
Let him talk.

714
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,180
We're talking
in circles.

715
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,723
Enough!

716
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,476
Three hours, no progress.

717
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,187
I should have contacted
my ships by now.

718
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,981
Maybe we can't
outthink them.

719
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,524
Captain?
We have to assume

720
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,318
they've planned
for every contingency,

721
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,196
including anything we could come
up with to undermine their plan.

722
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,865
This thing
has been driving me crazy.

723
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,784
You said you knew
the solution. Prove it.

724
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,679
Seven, how'd
you do that?

725
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,347
I scanned the device.

726
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,225
Its mechanism operates
on a simple fractal regression.

727
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,560
You scanned it?

728
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,853
That's cheating.

729
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,938
Cheating is often
more efficient.

730
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,400
If you can't solve
a puzzle, cheat.

731
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,571
If you can't outthink
a Think Tank, don't try.

732
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,573
Are you suggesting
we give up?

733
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,908
Not at all.

734
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,283
When you were
in contact

735
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,911
with the artificial
intelligence,

736
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,328
you were linked

737
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,455
through their internal
communications array.

738
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,790
Yes, for several seconds.

739
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,876
If you were to link
with them again,

740
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,837
we might be able to
disrupt those systems.

741
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,296
If they can't
communicate,

742
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,716
they can't function
as a Think Tank.

743
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,176
They'd be
vulnerable.

744
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,887
Back to square one--
How do we find them?

745
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,181
Simple. We give them
what they want.

746
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,307
You're going to join

747
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,144
their group
willingly.

748
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,395
They won't believe her.

749
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,064
We'll have
to make them believe.

750
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,481
Pull up a chair.

751
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,983
We've got some
more work to do.

752
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:11,164
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
An Hazari vessel is sending
hails into subspace.

753
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,125
It's trying to contact us.

754
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,626
Put them through.

755
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,878
They're responding.

756
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,048
KURROS:
<i>Hazari vessel,</i>
<i>we have received your hails.</i>

757
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,800
<i>Can we be of assistance?</i>

758
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,301
You deceived us.

759
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,678
<i>I do not believe we have met.</i>

760
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,180
Stop the pretense.

761
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,808
You wanted us
to deliver<i> Voyager.</i>

762
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,561
Very well, but only
if you triple our bounty.

763
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,232
<i>My friend, regardless</i>
<i>of the circumstances,</i>

764
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,109
<i>we have a contract.</i>

765
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,695
Pay us, or we let<i> Voyager</i> go.

766
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,741
<i>All right.</i>

767
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,910
<i>We will triple the bounty,</i>

768
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,164
<i>but you must deliver them</i>
<i>to us... now.</i>

769
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,456
Agreed.

770
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,792
We'll contact
the rest of our ships.

771
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:59,171
We'll seize<i> Voyager</i> as planned.

772
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,349
TUVOK:
Shields down
to 30 percent.

773
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,809
Return fire.

774
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,229
Our phasers aren't penetrating
their shields.

775
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,605
That last volley took out

776
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,065
our shield generators
and phaser banks.

777
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,483
Life support's failing,

778
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,110
all decks.

779
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,154
KURROS:
Let us be honest, Captain.

780
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,990
Things do not seem
to be going your way.

781
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,950
Don't count us
out just yet.

782
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,827
I admit you have been clever.

783
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,620
You uncovered our subterfuge,

784
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,832
but you failed to factor in
all the variables.

785
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,335
The greed of the Hazari,
for example.

786
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,963
Photon torpedoes?

787
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,673
Aft launchers are still on line.

788
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,925
Target a full spread
at the lead Hazari ship.

789
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,803
KURROS:
A few torpedoes will
not alter the outcome.

790
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,306
If you do not convince
Seven of Nine to join us now,

791
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,849
the destruction of your ship

792
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,433
is 99.8 percent
certain.

793
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,019
Fire.

794
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:01,066
Direct hit.
It's been disabled.

795
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:04,152
Clinging to that .2 percentage?

796
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,946
Hazari reinforcements
should be here any minute.

797
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,614
PARIS:
He's right.

798
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,949
Sensors just picked up

799
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,910
a half dozen ships on an
intercept course.

800
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,287
CHAKOTAY:
Captain, I'm detecting

801
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,122
an unauthorized shuttle launch.

802
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,749
It's Seven of Nine.

803
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,712
What the hell is she doing?

804
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:26,299
I believe she's
saving your ship.

805
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,593
KIM:
She's not
answering hails.

806
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,304
Her shuttle's being
pulled into subspace.

807
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,847
She's gone.

808
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,059
Have a safe
journey home...

809
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,769
Captain.

810
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:47,320
Seven of Nine, welcome.

811
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,406
Your hospitality is irrelevant.

812
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,741
I am here because
you left me no choice.

813
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,035
You gave in to your
human instincts

814
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,080
to save your crew,
as we knew you would.

815
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,540
Just another factor
in our equation.

816
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,460
If<i> Voyager</i> is destroyed,
I will not cooperate.

817
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,962
Do not worry.

818
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:08,174
The solution to the Hazari
paradox is quite simple.

819
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,803
KURROS:
We have what we want.

820
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,138
Call off your attack.

821
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,556
Not until we've
been compensated.

822
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,058
Fine.

823
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,312
But first order your
other vessels to stand down.

824
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:23,481
Now, or we'll destroy<i> Voyager.</i>

825
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,446
Why is he in
such a hurry?

826
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,489
Comply.

827
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:36,161
If we de-cloak,
we would be vulnerable.

828
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,081
The Hazari could make
quite a bounty on us...

829
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,417
far more than
we are paying them.

830
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,003
Their technology
is inferior to yours.

831
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,297
They would never
attack you directly.

832
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,215
I think this is a trap--

833
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,593
A new paradox your Captain
has created for us.

834
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,846
If we call their bluff,

835
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:59,851
the Hazari might destroy<i> Voyager</i>
and we would lose you.

836
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,896
If we reveal ourselves,
we could be destroyed.

837
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,773
You told me,
"without problems

838
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,733
"to test the limits
of your ability,

839
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,903
you can never
expand them."

840
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,531
There is one
very simple way

841
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,241
to narrow the odds.

842
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:20,497
We simply link you
to our communications system,

843
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:23,082
allow our
artificial intelligence

844
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,793
to probe your mind
as it did before,

845
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,463
and Captain Janeway's plans

846
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:32,842
will be revealed like a jewel
in a bed of fog.

847
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,852
Sick Bay to Bridge.

848
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,646
Seven's neural transceiver
has been activated.

849
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,857
Acknowledged.
Do it.

850
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:52,153
I'm transmitting
the carrier wave.

851
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,826
(<i> equipment powering down</i> )

852
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,207
(<i> beeping and clicking</i> )

853
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,751
<i>Voyager</i> is sending
an interference signal

854
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,044
into our systems

855
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,296
using her cortical implants
as a relay.

856
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,548
Disconnect the link.

857
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:12,965
(<i> speaking alien language</i> )

858
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,511
Disconnect the link.

859
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,929
They can't understand you.

860
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,809
<i>Voyager</i> to Hazari vessels.

861
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,686
Their systems are down.

862
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,772
Fire the spatial charges.

863
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,319
We seem to be experiencing
some turbulence.

864
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,196
Primitive spatial charges.

865
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,365
I will have the dome
back on line

866
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,409
before they can do any damage.

867
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,621
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

868
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,415
We're being pulled
out of subspace.

869
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,256
I've got a lock on Seven.

870
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,258
JANEWAY:
Initiate transport.

871
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,344
TUVOK:
The Hazari vessels

872
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,472
are converging
on the Think Tank.

873
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,475
Tom.
Setting a course.

874
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,101
I urge you

875
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,978
to reconsider,
Captain.

876
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,938
A good guest knows when
he's outstayed his welcome.

877
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,817
We can still negotiate
a peaceful solution.

878
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,736
Do not destroy
my faith in diplomacy.

879
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,323
Your diplomacy could use
some polishing.

880
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:21,451
You know you will never be

881
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:23,620
satisfied here,
among these

882
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,455
people.

883
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:27,832
Is this what you really want?

884
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:31,043
Acquiring knowledge
is a worthy objective,

885
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,589
but its pursuit
has obviously not elevated you.

886
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,969
Looks like
your ship's having difficulties.

887
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,516
A minor problem.

888
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:46,976
Oh, I'm sure
you'll find a solution.

889
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,728
Just give it some... thought.
