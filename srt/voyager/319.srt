1
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,615
Fire.

2
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,079
The asteroid is fragmenting,
but most of the debris

3
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,248
is still on a collision course
with the planet.

4
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,835
Target the fragments.
Destroy them.

5
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,796
That asteroid should have been
vaporized. What happened?

6
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,422
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,133
Sensors showed a simple
nickel-iron composition.

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,385
We shouldn't be
seeing fragments

9
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,012
more than a centimeter
in diameter.

10
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,889
Ambassador,
I'm afraid I was right.

11
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,431
This isn't
going to work.

12
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,099
The same thing happened
to us yesterday.

13
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,977
We tried to vaporize
two incoming asteroids,

14
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,937
but they fragmented
and struck the surface.

15
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,898
I've destroyed
most of the debris, Captain.

16
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,649
However, targeting scanners

17
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,860
were unable to track
two of the fragments.

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,111
They have already entered
the upper atmosphere.

19
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,770
The debris impacted
on the largest continent

20
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,396
approximately 500 kilometers

21
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,690
from the southern tip.

22
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,358
The central desert.

23
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,112
Fortunately that region
isn't heavily populated.

24
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:19,074
Substantial cratering,
atmospheric shock waves...

25
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,450
and large concentrations of dust

26
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,201
and other
stratospheric contaminants.

27
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,788
How long
until the next asteroid hits?

28
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,165
Approximately six hours.

29
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:30,002
Can you give us an idea
of its trajectory?

30
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:33,547
Same continent, but this time
on the eastern coastal region.

31
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,632
Our largest colonies are there.

32
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,426
Over 5,000 citizens.

33
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,471
Captain,
we appreciate your efforts,

34
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,891
but I think it's time
we considered an evacuation.

35
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,767
According to my analysis,
there are at least

36
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,769
12 more asteroids
heading in our direction.

37
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,605
How can we hope to destroy
them all even with your help?

38
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,191
Incoming hail from the surface.

39
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,359
It's coming from one
of the heavily damaged areas.

40
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,611
On screen.

41
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,864
<i>Ambassador,</i>
<i>I've been analyzing the debris</i>

42
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,033
<i>and I've discovered</i>
<i>disturbing evidence</i>

43
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,618
<i>that the asteroids</i>
<i>are not what they seem.</i>

44
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,621
<i>They are composed</i>
<i>of artificial materials.</i>

45
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>I must meet</i>
<i>with you immediately.</i>

46
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,209
<i>I think we can stop--</i>

47
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,960
I've lost the
transmission.

48
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,921
Location?

49
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,423
I can't find them. Too much
interference.

50
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,716
That was Dr. Vatm,

51
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,260
our most prominent
astrophysicist.

52
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,846
He mentioned the composition
of the asteroids.

53
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,431
Could he have found
something important?

54
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,891
At this point,
Ambassador,

55
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,726
I don't know what that
discovery could be.

56
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,438
Mr. Paris, can we send a shuttle
down through that turbulence?

57
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,566
It would be a rough ride,
but I think it's possible.

58
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,443
Our chances of finding
Dr. Vatm are slim.

59
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,986
We should evacuate
the colonies.

60
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,614
We haven't time to evacuate
all those people.

61
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,325
I won't give up,
not now.

62
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:49,206
Captain, I'm asking
for your help again...

63
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,499
but I won't ask you
to risk your crew.

64
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,835
In for a penny,
in for a pound.

65
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,670
Excuse me?

66
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,090
It's a human expression,
Ambassador.

67
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,176
And it means
we're not leaving you now.

68
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,011
Tuvok, assemble rescue teams.

69
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,346
We'll send down three shuttles
to find Dr. Vatm.

70
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,390
Aye, Captain. Mr. Paris?

71
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,227
CHAKOTAY:
Bridge to Engineering.

72
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,728
B'Elanna, I want you
to beam aboard

73
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,106
a sample of the debris
from that last asteroid.

74
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,024
Let's find out why
it wasn't vaporized.

75
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,277
I'm going to study the data
we've collected so far.

76
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,903
I'll be in my ready room.

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,328
I need analeptic compounds.

78
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,579
Are you ill?

79
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,456
No, no! I'm feeling
quite vigorous.

80
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,458
I requested a place
on the rescue team

81
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,960
as part of
my Starfleet training

82
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,170
and the Captain said yes.

83
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,629
So, I thought
it might be useful

84
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,673
to bring along a few
extra medical supplies.

85
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,009
We have some analeptic compounds
in the bio lab.

86
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,011
I'll get them for you.

87
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,770
May I suggest
a tranquilizer?

88
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,355
No, no, no.
I'll be fine.

89
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,899
Just that I'm
a little apprehensive.

90
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,943
I've been assigned
to Lieutenant Tuvok's team,

91
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,445
and no matter what I do,
I can't seem to please him.

92
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,199
Vulcans are notoriously
difficult to impress.

93
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,118
Mr. Tuvok seldom
acknowledges my brilliance.

94
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,744
A word of advice,
Mr. Neelix.

95
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,414
Try to restrain
your... enthusiasm.

96
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,584
You're there to
observe and learn.

97
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,086
Yeah.

98
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,421
It's good advice,
Doctor.

99
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,972
Altitude:
15 kilometers.

100
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,516
Velocity: mach 2.1.

101
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,271
Entering the upper
troposphere.

102
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,066
( gasping and groaning )

103
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,735
Mr. Sklar, are you all right?

104
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,905
I'm an exo-geologist.
I prefer working on the ground.

105
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,991
We'll be landing shortly.
Try to relax.

106
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,576
Ah!

107
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,286
What's happening?!

108
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,705
We're entering a layer of
electrodynamic turbulence.

109
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,665
Full power
to thrusters.

110
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,834
Thrusters
aren't responding.

111
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,419
Attempting to level
our descent.

112
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,675
Oh, oh!
We're losing main power!

113
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,761
I will have to land
the shuttle manually.

114
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,055
Brace for impact.

115
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,849
Commander, I've lost contact
with Tuvok's shuttle.

116
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,559
Hail them.

117
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,519
No response.

118
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,479
Notify Lieutenant Paris
and the others.

119
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,647
We may have a team down.

120
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,066
<i>Torres to Bridge.</i>

121
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,442
Go ahead.

122
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,861
We've beamed aboard
a piece of the debris.

123
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,571
I'll be right there.

124
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,365
Ambassador?

125
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,454
( thumping )

126
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,875
( thumping )

127
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,671
( thumping )

128
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,216
( coughing )

129
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,260
( thumping )

130
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,647
TUVOK:
Dr. Vatm.

131
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,191
I heard what sounded
like a ship crashing.

132
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,152
I came looking for you.

133
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,736
This is Hanjuan.

134
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,323
He's a miner at the nearby
gallicite excavation.

135
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,032
He heard your
ship too.

136
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,909
Have you seen any other
vessels like ours?

137
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,202
No. Just you.

138
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,703
Doctor, you said
you had information

139
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,705
on the composition of
the asteroids. What is it?

140
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,499
That data is classified.

141
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,376
I can only speak
to the ambassador.

142
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,919
You may also speak to me.

143
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,796
Your ambassador sent us
to find you.

144
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,589
No.

145
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,133
I prefer to wait.

146
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,344
Doctor, we almost died
trying to get that information.

147
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,137
Tell us.
Be silent, Sklar!

148
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,555
Now, gentlemen, there's
no point in arguing.

149
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,766
Right now, we have to get
this shuttle off the ground.

150
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,893
Unfortunately, that will
not be possible.

151
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,895
All primary systems
are off-line.

152
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,398
Warp drive and impulse engines
have been destroyed.

153
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,359
I suggest we repair
the com system

154
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,734
and send
a distress call.

155
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,278
How long
will that take?

156
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,113
Several hours
at least.

157
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,366
We don't have several hours.
When the next asteroid hits,

158
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,783
it could destroy
this entire region.

159
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,369
We've got to
get out of here soon.

160
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,287
I assure you, we're doing
everything we can.

161
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,706
Mr. Neelix,
please go outside

162
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,541
and inspect
the toroidal antenna.

163
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,461
I need to know if any of
the signal relays were damaged.

164
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,380
If they were,
I can try to repair them.

165
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,756
A damage report
will be sufficient.

166
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,092
I've been studying
with Lieutenant Torres.

167
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,346
She gave me a full orientation
on shuttlecraft systems.

168
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,306
The damage report, Mr. Neelix.

169
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,640
Aye, sir.

170
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,476
In the meantime,

171
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,312
I suggest everyone
try to remain calm.

172
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,813
Allowing anxiety
to overcome you

173
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,359
will only hinder
the efficiency of our efforts.

174
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,444
He's really
a very pleasant fellow

175
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,571
once you get to know him.
And intelligent.

176
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,990
I'm sure he'll have the com
system up and running--

177
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,576
Neelix.
On my way.

178
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,204
( strong wind blowing )

179
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,185
Why won't you
share the data?

180
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,020
Excuse me.
Mr. Tuvok?

181
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,897
You couldn't have
finished already.

182
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,357
Not exactly.

183
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,444
What I mean to say is,
I know I'm here to observe

184
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,612
and I don't mean
to step out of line,

185
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,574
but I think I've observed
a way out of here.

186
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,158
Where?

187
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,826
I saw what appeared to be

188
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,703
an orbital tether
anchored nearby.

189
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,997
Yes, we use those
to lift cargo from the surface

190
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,707
to the orbital
supply stations.

191
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,918
May I assume it uses
magnetic leverage

192
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,087
to lift the carriage?
Yes.

193
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,423
What is your point?

194
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,342
What if we use that carriage
to climb the tether?

195
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,386
The tether's
over 300 kilometers long.

196
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,221
It takes 12 hours
to reach the station.

197
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,600
Well, we wouldn't have to go
all the way to the station.

198
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,684
We just have to leave
the ionosphere.

199
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,770
Once we get above
all this interference,

200
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,564
we can contact<i> Voyager,</i> 
they'll beam us aboard.

201
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,524
VATM:
I've already considered
that option.

202
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,443
The carriage was damaged
on the last impact.

203
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,528
The induction coils
are off-line.

204
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,491
Maybe we can replace the coils

205
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,201
with attitude control thrusters
from the shuttle.

206
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,912
It would take
a little creative mechanics,

207
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,581
but I think we can do it.

208
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,708
I spent two years on a tether
maintenance team on Rinax.

209
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,004
The principles
are undoubtedly the same.

210
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,765
Our probability
of being detected

211
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,059
by<i> Voyager</i> 
or the other rescue teams

212
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,645
is greatest
if we remain here.

213
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,396
SKLAR:
What if they don't
find us in time?

214
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,565
He's right. We should try
the tether.

215
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,858
It's better
than sitting here

216
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,901
waiting to be buried
in dust.

217
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,367
I've helped rebuild
a dozen mag-lev carriages.

218
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,910
Give me a chance
to get that one working.

219
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,789
If I can't, we'll come back
and wait for the others.

220
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,754
Very well.

221
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,757
You won't regret this,
Lieutenant.

222
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,260
We need to get
to the base of the tether.

223
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,616
( beeping )

224
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,872
I think we can
integrate our thrusters

225
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,834
into the induction matrix,
but we'll need to--

226
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,387
Looks like
somebody's been here recently.

227
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,013
Get away or
I'll kill him!

228
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,314
Drop your weapon!

229
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,899
Now!

230
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,739
This is my shelter.

231
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,823
These are my supplies!

232
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,951
We have no interest
in your supplies.

233
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,454
We are here to use the carriage
to get to safety.

234
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,414
He's telling the truth.

235
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,957
We'll take you with us.

236
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,500
The carriage is damaged.

237
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,085
Yes, we know.

238
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,754
The induction coils.

239
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:19,090
But we've brought equipment
to replace them.

240
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,092
I know it's been difficult.

241
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,053
This catastrophe has taken
it's toll on everyone.

242
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,930
But you have got to believe us.

243
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,182
We only want
to get off the surface.

244
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,477
What-- What about
the oxygen converters?

245
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,019
They've been damaged too.

246
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,021
They can't produce
enough air for six people.

247
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,190
Maybe we can augment
the converters.

248
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,734
We brought along
some equipment

249
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,527
that might do the trick.

250
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,574
I don't have enough
rations for everyone.

251
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,661
Don't expect me
to share.

252
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:51,539
If I can fix the tether,
no one will need your rations.

253
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,916
We have a starship in orbit.

254
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,962
They'll beam us aboard
once we leave the ionosphere.

255
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,226
If I'm not mistaken,

256
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,062
it sounds like you know a thing
or two about tethers, as well.

257
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,607
Not really.
I'm a foundry worker.

258
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,109
Good.

259
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,154
We could use someone
with metallurgical knowledge.

260
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,366
Let's get to work.

261
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,371
Have faith, Mr. Vulcan.

262
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,581
We'll be tether-borne
in no time.

263
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,583
(<i> sighs</i> )

264
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,555
I've completed
the mineralogical scans.

265
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,433
The rock is composed
of tryoxene, olivine...

266
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,435
Wait a minute.

267
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,855
I'm reading
a concentration of triadium.

268
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,190
Triadium?
Isn't that an alloy?

269
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,859
Yes.

270
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,320
B'Elanna, give me
a hand with this.

271
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,328
TORRES:
This doesn't look like any
asteroid I've ever seen.

272
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,581
But I'll bet it's the
source of our triadium.

273
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,165
It looks like a control node

274
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,585
for some kind
of guidance system.

275
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,169
Ambassador, I have a feeling

276
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,547
these asteroids aren't striking
your planet by chance.

277
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,761
Are we ready to bring
main power back on line?

278
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:31,431
I... I think so.

279
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,016
The coil bypass is active.

280
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,614
Bypass is holding.

281
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,742
Congratulations, Mr. Vulcan.
We've done it!

282
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,453
We must still repair
the oxygen regenerators

283
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,204
and the damaged
tether couplings.

284
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,748
Then let's get started.

285
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,833
I'll go check
on the oxygen supply.

286
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,634
How's it coming,
Lillias?

287
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,303
I still can't get
this power relay on line.

288
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,055
I'm not an orbital engineer.
I can't do this.

289
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,933
Maybe I can help.

290
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,559
Let's see.

291
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,106
Aha.

292
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,694
You need to recalibrate
the pressure valve...

293
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,362
like this.

294
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,534
That should about do it.

295
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,792
We're going
to need a name.

296
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,794
A name?

297
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,296
For the mag-lev carriage.

298
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:49,133
Whenever we finished
building a tether on Rinax,

299
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,678
we named the carriage
for good luck.

300
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,097
Any suggestions?

301
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,725
No.

302
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,103
How about...

303
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,191
<i>Alixia?</i>

304
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,860
<i>"Alixia"?</i>

305
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,696
My favorite sister.

306
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,991
She was always
taking me out to explore.

307
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:16,452
She showed me
the Caves of Touth...

308
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,997
the equatorial dust shrouds.

309
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:23,042
Once, she even took me
hunting for arctic spiders.

310
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,213
Whenever I think of her,
I think of adventure.

311
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:31,968
And this is an adventure
she would appreciate.

312
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,386
What do you think?

313
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,555
Where is your sister now?

314
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,226
She was killed
when I was a young man

315
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,811
in a war on my homeworld.

316
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,646
My entire family was lost.

317
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,106
I'm sorry.

318
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,442
I still see each of them.

319
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:53,031
Every night before I go to
sleep, I recall their faces

320
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,325
and share something about my day
with each of them.

321
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,914
Tonight, I'm going to have
quite a lot to tell them.

322
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,383
Thank you.

323
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,224
I have a sister too.

324
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,642
Halla.

325
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,228
Three weeks ago,
after the first impact,

326
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,274
our home was destroyed
and we were separated.

327
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,070
I haven't seen her since.

328
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,951
I don't even know
if she's alive.

329
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,411
When we get back to<i> Voyager,</i>

330
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,039
I'll ask my Captain
to help you find her.

331
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,832
TUVOK:
Mr. Neelix?

332
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,751
Excuse me.

333
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,299
Yes, sir!
Your interpersonal activities

334
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,342
are delaying our progress.

335
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,346
What do you mean?
Since we arrived,

336
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,975
you have spent as much time
engaged in idle conversation

337
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,352
as you have
making repairs.

338
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,855
I'm just trying to cheer
everyone up a little.

339
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,607
Your function at the moment

340
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,027
is to repair this vessel,
not to boost morale.

341
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,905
This is not the holodeck,
nor the Mess Hall.

342
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,448
This is a life-threatening
situation

343
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,866
and your attention
should be focused

344
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,745
on one thing alone,
our safe return to<i> Voyager.</i>

345
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,540
I'm sorry, sir.

346
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,793
I'll finish
as fast as I can.

347
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,013
LILLIAS:
Once we start
moving up the tether,

348
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,472
will we be able
to reverse course?

349
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,307
It will take several hours
to reach the station.

350
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,684

We've only been able to fix

351
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,019

supplies.

00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,148
( equipment powering up )
TUVOK: ...were to turn back,

354
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,191
we might not be able
to break through the ionosphere.

355
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,443
Mr. Sklar,
examine this piece.

356
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,529
See if the...

357
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,200
NEELIX:
Dr. Vatm!

358
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,036
What are you doing?!

359
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,495
He's opening
the launch doors!

360
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,288
He's leaving without us!
Dr. Vatm!

361
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,790
( no audio )

362
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,249
Please stop!

363
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,880
The tether's base
hasn't been secured!

364
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,464
If he launches now,

365
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,801
he'll destabilize
the entire cavern!

366
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,179
Wait, please!

367
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,014
Don't leave us here!

368
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,016
Stand aside.

369
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,152
It's too late!

370
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,237
The cavern support structure
is collapsing.

371
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,446
We've got to
get out of here.

372
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,033
Can we launch?
I think so.

373
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,785
Seal that door.

374
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,287
I despise
enclosed spaces.

375
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,497
Hang on.

376
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,168
(metal clanking and rumbling)

377
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,849
NEELIX:
Velocity:
30 kilometers per hour.

378
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,642
Internal
atmospheric pressure:

379
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,061
700 millibars.

380
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,563
Altitude: 800 meters
and climbing.

381
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,650
We're losing mag-lev cohesion.

382
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,070
NEELIX:
All right. We have to
stabilize that right away.

383
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,696
Otherwise, we'll go
into free fall.

384
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,989
You mean, we're going to drop?

385
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,324
How do we prevent that?

386
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,994
Neelix!
Hold on! Hold on!

387
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,538
I'm thinking!

388
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,999
Velocity. Let's try
increasing the velocity.

389
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,709
It should stabilize
our ascent.

390
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,420
See if you can increase power
to the tether couplings.

391
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,299
( groaning )

392
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,430
Routing backup power
to the tether couplings.

393
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,392
Stand by. I'm going to try
giving her a little more speed.

394
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,279
Velocity:

395
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,657
47 kilometers per hour...

396
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,117
and holding.

397
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,910
Mag-lev cohesion...

398
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,246
stable.

399
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,498
We're all right.

400
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,792
Good girl,<i> Alixia.</i>

401
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,586
I knew you could do it.
<i>"Alixia"?</i>

402
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,339
I named the carriage
after my sister.

403
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,883
For good luck, no doubt.

404
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,260
We will need it.

405
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,179
One of the oxygen converters
has ruptured.

406
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,763
We'll have to find a way

407
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,598
of increasing output
to the other converter.

408
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,684
Otherwise, we'll run out of air
about halfway up.

409
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,978
What are the chances
of our reaching the ionosphere?

410
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,231
I'd say they, uh...
they were pretty good.

411
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,816
We did leave ahead of schedule,

412
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,194
and that could cause
a few glitches along the way.

413
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,989
Glitches?
I wasn't able

414
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,866
to get the auto-ascent sequencer
back on line.

415
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,952
That means, I'll have to keep
controlling the ascent manually.

416
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,329
And there is the problem

417
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,247
of maintaining atmospheric
pressure.

418
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,624
I'm already beginning to detect
a few fissures in the hull.

419
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,335
We must repair them.

420
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,295
Where is the emergency
containment grid?

421
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,257
Containment grid. Containment
grid.

422
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,550
Uh...

423
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,926
I'm... I'm not quite sure.

424
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,350
Mr. Neelix, you told
me you had experience

425
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,767
with this kind
of technology.

426
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,435
I did. I did.

427
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,437
Sort of.

428
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,689
They weren't exactly

429
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,692
what you might call
working carriages.

430
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,569
They were
more like prototypes.

431
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,071
Specifically.

432
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,531
All right, they were models,
one-tenth scale,

433
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,449
but they were
extremely detailed.

434
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,285
You built models.

435
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,120
Yes, but they were
basically identical

436
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,454
to real mag-lev carriages.

437
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,999
Same principles,
same mechanical components.

438
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,043
I was planning
to familiarize myself

439
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,794
with all the systems
on this carriage.

440
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,005
I just didn't plan
on leaving ahead of schedule.

441
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,925
But don't worry, I've got
everything under control.

442
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,095
There is little we can
do now that we are

443
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,305
30 kilometers
above the surface.

444
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,431
I suggest we continue to--
VATM: What are you doing?!

445
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,393
LILLIAS:
Let's go.
You wanted to leave?

446
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:58,312
Fine, then leave.

447
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,688
( beeping )

448
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,232
( grunts )

449
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,234
That is enough.

450
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,988
He may be crucial to
the survival of your colonies.

451
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,907
He would've let us
die down there.

452
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,744
That is no justification
for murder.

453
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:18,624
Dr. Vatm, why did you
try to launch without us?

454
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,667
Does it have to do with
the discovery you made

455
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,169
about the asteroids?

456
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,172
Answer him, or
I'll throw you out myself.

457
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,091
Compose yourself,
Mr. Hanjuan.

458
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,135
Once we return to<i> Voyager,</i> 
we will find out...

459
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,761
Who put you in command?

460
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,388
This rescue mission
was authorized

461
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,680
by the Captain of my ship

462
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,308
and the ambassador
of your government.

463
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,101
I say we throw Vatm
out the door.

464
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,312
We could use
the extra oxygen.

465
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,397
If you are trying
to intimidate me,

466
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,316
I should inform you
that, as a Vulcan,

467
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,483
I possess physical strength
many times your--

468
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,529
( groans )

469
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,368
It is going to be
a long and perilous journey.

470
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,871
As such, I will need
your full cooperation.

471
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,206
Understood?

472
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah.

473
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,969
Mechanical glitches
would seem to be

474
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,138
the least of our problems.

475
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,019
PARIS:
<i>We've just completed</i>
<i>our third low-altitude survey.</i>

476
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,190
<i>There's no sign of Dr. Vatm</i>
<i>or Tuvok and his rescue team.</i>

477
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,984
We're monitoring a major
dust storm heading your way.

478
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,944
You'll need to head due north
within the hour.

479
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,737
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Paris out.</i>

480
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,073
Captain, I'm getting more
detailed sensor readings

481
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,700
on the approaching asteroid.

482
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,244
It's huge, over half
a kilometer in diameter,

483
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,996
and it's moving faster
than the others.

484
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,539
Time to impact?

485
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,834
Approximately two hours.

486
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,387
( breathing heavily )

487
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:08,359
( breathing heavily )

488
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,115
Doctor, I'm going
to inject you

489
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,658
with a triox compound.

490
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,328
It will help to
oxygenate your blood.

491
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:32,132
( coughing )

492
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,093
I've prepared
an injection of...

493
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:38,055
Yes, uh, I know.
I heard you.

494
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,266
It...

495
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,975
won't be painful, will it?

496
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,312
No. It is a simple
subdermal transfer.

497
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,939
Oh, good. Good.

498
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,316
I... I despise needles.

499
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,197
Any progress with the...

500
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,116
with the converters?

501
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,452
We were unable to salvage
the damaged tank.

502
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,953
But Lillias is working

503
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,539
to increase the efficiency
of the functioning one.

504
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,833
And if she can't,
we'll all suffocate.

505
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,252
It is illogical

506
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,712
to dwell on situations
beyond your control.

507
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,132
It will only serve
to heighten your anxiety,

508
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,842
which, if I may say so,
is heightened enough.

509
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:20,097
Oh. Well, thank you
for the reassurance.

510
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,848
( breathing heavily )

511
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,439
How is everybody?

512
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,065
They are suffering
the initial stages

513
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,234
of carbon dioxide
poisoning.

514
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,402
And you?

515
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,322
My lungs are capable
of respirating

516
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,574
in an extremely thin atmosphere.

517
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,369
Then if we can't fix
this air supply,

518
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,955
you may be the only one left
to pilot this thing.

519
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,706
I'd better start
showing you

520
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,875
how to use the
ascent thrusters.

521
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,048
They must be kept
at a minimum temperature--

522
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,383
Stop!
What are you doing?

523
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,260
Get away.

524
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,221
I've got to get out.
Let me out.

525
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,557
Let go of me.

526
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,766
I need it.

527
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,560
So, now he wants to leave.

528
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,104
Let him.
No, you don't understand.

529
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,730
There's something
out there.

530
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,107
What is out there?

531
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,817
On...

532
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,653
the roof.

533
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,237
( groaning )

534
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,947
TUVOK:
He's going into shock.

535
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,703
( steady tone sounds
from tricorder )

536
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,208
He's dead.

537
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,337
Can you revive him?

538
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,048
His cardiopulmonary tissues
have begun to deteriorate.

539
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,008
From lack of oxygen?

540
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,926
No.

541
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,057
I believe he was murdered.

542
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,653
Murdered? How?

543
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,279
Poisoning.

544
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,866
According
to my tricorder readings,

545
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,284
his water supply
has been

546
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,537
contaminated with
a lydroxide corrosive.

547
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,372
Lydroxide?

548
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,666
That's the coolant used
in the tether couplings.

549
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,334
How do you know
it wasn't an accident?

550
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,961
The coolant system
is completely sealed,

551
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,423
and there is no lydroxide
anywhere else on board.

552
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,007
Now we have a choice

553
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,135
between death by suffocation
or death by poisoning.

554
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,012
I will conduct
an investigation

555
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,514
once we return
to the ship.

556
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,350
For now, we must
focus on survival.

557
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,269
HANJUAN:
Again you take command.

558
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,521
Again
you decide our fate.

559
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,398
How do we know you
didn't kill him?

560
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,233
TUVOK:
I have no motive.

561
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,612
HANJUAN:
Your motive would be the
same as ours, revenge.

562
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:40,987
TUVOK:
I am Vulcan.

563
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,364
I do not succumb
to emotion.

564
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,783
Oh, and we are expected
to believe that.

565
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,410
I think we should stop
the carriage.

566
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,161
Why?

567
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,247
Something Dr. Vatm said...

568
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,207
about getting up on the roof.

569
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,377
Dr. Vatm was delirious
from lack of oxygen.

570
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,505
He attempted to open the hatch
of this vessel and go outside.

571
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,924
It would have killed him
and possibly all of us as well.

572
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,885
Exactly. He was desperate enough
to risk his own life.

573
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,472
I think we should go up and find
out what he was talking about.

574
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,515
If we stop the carriage,

575
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,892
we'll risk losing
mag-lev cohesion again.

576
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,145
We'll check the roof
upon returning to<i> Voyager.</i>

577
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,854
I don't know.

578
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,149
I've got a funny feeling
about this.

579
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,526
I'm not interested
in your funny feeling.

580
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,154
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

581
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,532
Delirious or not, he said
he needed whatever's up there.

582
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,743
What if it's something
that can help us?

583
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,161
I will not debate this with you.

584
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,996
Please pilot the craft
and remain silent.

585
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,791
You're going to listen to me!

586
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,128
( equipment powering down )

587
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,172
You are becoming
emotionally distraught.

588
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,758
There is little point in
furthering this discussion.

589
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,135
I'll tell you
who's being emotional. You.

590
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,012
You hide it beneath
that Vulcan calm,

591
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,348
but the truth is, you're filled
with contempt and sarcasm

592
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,767
and I'm tired of being the
target of all your hostility.

593
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,603
You are mistaken.
LILLIAS: No, he's not.

594
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,896
I can see it every time
you talk to Neelix.

595
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,065
You're dismissive
and condescending.

596
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,610
You are projecting your own
emotional bias onto my actions.

597
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,487
I have no feelings
toward Mr. Neelix.

598
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,031
That's right! That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

599
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,991
You have no feelings
for me,

600
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,160
but you have feelings
against me.

601
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,204
For three years,
you've ridiculed me

602
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,539
and made it obvious
to everyone

603
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,165
that you have
no respect for me,

604
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,875
and I've tolerated it.

605
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,877
You know why?
You know why?

606
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,588
Because you are smarter
than I am, Tuvok,

607
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,175
and more logical
and... stronger

608
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,803
and superior
in almost every way.

609
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,638
And I admire you,

610
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,015
but you don't have
any instincts.

611
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,768
You don't have
any gut feelings,

612
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,396
and you don't really
understand people.

613
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,814
But non-Vulcans
have feelings,

614
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,315
and they have
to listen to them.

615
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,275
And I've got to listen to mine,
and right now,

616
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,528
they're telling me we need
to get up on that roof

617
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,613
and find out what the Doctor
was talking about.

618
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,742
I disagree.

619
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,326
Fine!

620
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,666
But I'm the only one
who can pilot this vessel

621
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,042
and we're not going anywhere

622
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,795
till someone
goes up on that roof.

623
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,596
You leave me little choice.

624
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,016
All right, then...

625
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,854
now... one of us
needs to go outside.

626
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,731
I'm not going out there.

627
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,982
Don't even think
about me.

628
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,818
I'm willing to give it--

629
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,237
I will go.
You?

630
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,865
I am the logical one
to make the egress.

631
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,451
I can breathe the
rarefied atmosphere.

632
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,831
I can't believe
you're going out there.

633
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,541
You don't even know
what you're looking for.

634
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,377
I am looking for
Mr. Neelix's instinct.

635
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,588
Perhaps it will be marked.

636
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:57,350
It's strange...

637
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,227
but I really like him.

638
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,855
( hatch opening )

639
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,608
I just wish the feeling
were mutual.

640
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,814
Tuvok to Neelix.

641
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,357
Go ahead.

642
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,400
<i>I have found</i>
<i>a data storage device</i>

643
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,569
<i>lodged in the internal</i>
<i>circuitry.</i>

644
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,864
<i>It appears</i>
<i>to contain information</i>

645
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,407
<i>about an alien starship.</i>

646
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,493
But I will need to remove it and
bring it into the cabin

647
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,828
for further examination.

648
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,454
Be careful up there.

649
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,748
If you can't remove it, don't.

650
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,709
( air whooshes )

651
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,295
Sklar! What are you doing?!

652
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,009
( both grunting )

653
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,344
LILLIAS:
Neelix!

654
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,957
( groans )

655
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,509
( hatch closes )

656
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,222
Where's Tuvok?

657
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,642
Mr. Tuvok
returned to the surface.

658
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,230
Get this carriage moving.

659
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,148
What are you...?
Now!

660
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,484
He can't.
He's hurt.

661
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,695
Back away.

662
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,325
Get up.

663
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,124
Get up!

664
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,502
( groaning softly )

665
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,714
Well... we're going to
have to figure out

666
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,883
how to fly this vessel.

667
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,764
Captain, the asteroid
is within visual range.

668
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,349
Let's see it.

669
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,851
Ensign.

670
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,605
There's a large crew complement.
At least 2,000.

671
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,817
They remodulated their shields
to fool our sensors.

672
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,485
We're being hailed.

673
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,028
On screen.

674
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:58,615
<i>The Etanian Order</i>
<i>claims this territory.</i>

675
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,659
<i>You will withdraw.</i>

676
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,452
This planet belongs
to the Nezu.

677
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,496
They have five
colonies here.

678
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,414
<i>You are not Nezu.</i>

679
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,874
I'm a friend of theirs,

680
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,085
Kathryn Janeway, and
I'm not going anywhere

681
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,045
until you've lowered
your weapons.

682
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,255
<i>You will be willing to die</i>
<i>for them?</i>

683
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,092
<i>A loyal friend</i>

684
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,970
<i>and a foolish one.</i>

685
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,263
They'll be here
in under ten minutes, Captain.

686
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,271
Battle stations.

687
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,941
( groans )

688
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,028
SKLAR:
Why haven't we started?

689
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,529
LILLIAS:
If we don't get moving soon,

690
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,531
the tether couplings
will give out. They'll snap.

691
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,158
We'll lose
mag-lev cohesion.

692
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:44,161
Then get us moving.
I can't! I don't know how.

693
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,496
SKLAR:
There's the accelerator control.
Try it.

694
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:49,958
LILLIAS:
Too dangerous. We've got to
secure the tether first.

695
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,293
SKLAR:
All right, you,
go outside

696
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,587
and check the couplings. Make
sure they haven't given out.

697
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,048
HANJUAN:
I'm not going out there.

698
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,091
Besides, I wouldn't know
what to look for.

699
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:01,803
LILLIAS:
The only person who knows how
to pilot this ship is Neelix.

700
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,305
SKLAR:
It can't be that complicated!

701
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,224
Keep trying.

702
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,309
LILLIAS:
I'm doing my best.

703
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,024
SKLAR:
Come on, come on, come on.

704
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,035
( screaming )

705
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,553
I'm glad you're all right.

706
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,472
Fortunately, I was able
to grab hold of

707
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,058
an induction coil
and climb to safety.

708
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,229
Thank you, Mr. Neelix.

709
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,690
What?

710
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,945
I said thank you
for opening the door.

711
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,240
Don't mention it.

712
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,618
I believe we know now
who killed Dr. Vatm.

713
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,911
But why did he kill him?

714
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,663
TUVOK:
The data storage
device contains

715
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,748
tactical information
about an alien starship.

716
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,127
Weapons, warp drive,
shield modulations.

717
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,712
Apparently, Sklar
did not want us to find it.

718
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,219
You have an occipital
concussion.

719
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:10,473
I'm afraid my understanding of
Talaxian physiology is limited.

720
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,100
I cannot treat you.

721
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,354
I don't know
how to do this.

722
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,940
We're going to lose cohesion
any minute now.

723
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,401
Neelix. We need you.

724
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,113
( groans )

725
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,199
I don't think
I can do it.

726
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,326
You must.

727
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,204
I can barely keep
my eyes open.

728
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,254
Do it...

729
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,506
for Alixia.

730
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,678
She would be proud of you.

731
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,849
I'm glad to see

732
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,727
your interpersonal
skills are improving.

733
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,445
You're learning how
to motivate people.

734
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,502
Speed: 45 kilometers per hour.

735
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,341
CHAKOTAY:
The ship is within range.

736
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,675
They're charging weapons.

737
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,262
Full power to the shields.
Ready phasers.

738
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,265
Shields down to 85 percent!

739
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,141
Return fire.

740
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,434
No effect.

741
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,020
We can't penetrate
their shields.

742
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,147
Hang on!

743
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,025
We're breaking through
the ionosphere!

744
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,491
Engaging induction dampers.

745
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,874
We did it.

746
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,834
We made it.

747
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,130
( chuckling )

748
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,008
Tuvok to<i> Voyager.</i>

749
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,844
<i>Janeway here.</i>
<i>Are you all right, Lieutenant?</i>

750
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,596
Yes, Captain.

751
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,349
<i>We're a little busy right now.</i>
<i>Prepare to beam aboard.</i>

752
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,607
Shields down to 23 percent.
Structural integrity is failing.

753
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,525
Captain.

754
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,528
This data device contains
tactical information

755
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,738
about the enemy vessel,

756
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,491
including their
shield modulation.

757
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,493
Adjust our phasers to match.

758
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,870
Target their primary reactor.

759
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,791
Ready.
Fire at will.

760
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:49,966
Direct hit.
Their reactor is off-line.

761
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,177
CHAKOTAY:
They're remodulating
their shields.

762
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,678
Target their weapons array.

763
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,096
Fire.

764
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,519
Their weapons
have been destroyed.

765
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,271
They're retreating,
Captain.

766
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,820
What happened to you
down there?

767
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,613
Where's Sklar?

768
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,740
Mr. Sklar...

769
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,163
returned to the surface.

770
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,257
I've just come
from a staff briefing.

771
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,348
The people who attacked
your colonies,

772
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:40,892
they call themselves
the Etanian Order.

773
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,519
Apparently, they
have a unique way

774
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,270
of invading other worlds.

775
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,771
First, they create

776
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,607
what appears to be
a natural disaster.

777
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,194
In your case,
an asteroid bombardment.

778
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,488
Once the population
has evacuated,

779
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,656
they arrive
and stake their claim.

780
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,576
But they didn't expect
<i>Voyager</i> to intervene,

781
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,746
so they arrived before our
colonies had been evacuated.

782
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,249
Exactly.
What about Dr. Vatm?

783
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,583
From what
we could tell,

784
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,253
Dr. Vatm found out
about the Etanian Order

785
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,255
and was secretly
collecting information

786
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,797
about their starship technology.

787
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,259
He also knew
that one of your colonists

788
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,302
was a traitor,
helping the Etanians,

789
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,472
feeding your government false
information about the asteroids.

790
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,434
But he didn't know
that it was Sklar.

791
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,269
He didn't know who to trust.

792
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,980
That's why he tried to hide the
data storage device on the roof.

793
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,654
The damage to our world
could have been much worse.

794
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,200
Thank you.

795
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,084
I have just received word
from the ambassador.

796
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,877
Your sister, Halla,
has been found.

797
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,754
( gasping )

798
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,756
Tell her I said hello.

799
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,306
Mr. Neelix.

800
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,224
I thought you should know
that I have submitted

801
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,059
my mission report
to the Captain.

802
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,936
I have given you
a special commendation

803
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:10,189
for your endurance
and bravery.

804
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,567
I'm honored.

805
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,570
Your instincts were correct.

806
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:19,324
However, one day,
your intuition will fail,

807
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:20,825
and you will finally understand

808
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,744
that logic is primary
above all else.

809
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,248
Instinct is simply another term
for "serendipity."

810
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,125
And one day,
Mr. Vulcan,

811
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,752
I'll get you
to trust your gut.

812
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,338
That is doubtful.

813
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,006
We'll see.

814
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,050
Your attempts
have yet to succeed.

815
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,471
You always have to get in
that last word, don't you?

816
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,890
I am simply responding
to your erroneous statement.

817
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,225
Something tells me

818
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,727
you just hate to lose
an argument.

819
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,606
Losing is irrelevant.

820
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,107
See what I mean?

821
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,944
No... I do not.
