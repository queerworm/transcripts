1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,879
(<i> whistle blows</i> )

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,017
(<i> sheep bleating</i> )

3
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,819
Good day to you.

4
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,278
Good day to you.

5
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,784
(<i> sighs</i> )
Good morning, Tom.

6
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,494
Good morning, Grace.

7
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,287
So, where are
you heading?

8
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,164
Uh, Sullivan's.
Care to join me?

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,583
Oh, I wish I could,
but there's a bit of a problem.

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,960
Oh, really?

11
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,795
Well, you see,
Tommy, me boy,

12
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,172
the good Lord blessed me
with a fine wife.

13
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,966
I'll never forget
the day I met her.

14
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,218
I was on me way
to the fair in Dooleen...

15
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,803
or was it Kilkee?

16
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,388
There's some fine
trout fishing

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,890
to be had in Kilkee
this time of year.

18
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,850
Who said anything
about trout?

19
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,019
Timothy Ryan,
God rest his soul.

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,770
He was one
for the trout.

21
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,480
The poor man's
been dead a fortnight.

22
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,690
Some say he had
the croup,

23
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,149
but don't you believe it.

24
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,402
The widow Moore
gave him the evil eye.

25
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,278
And... your point?

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,864
Me wife and I--

27
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,657
well, we've hit
a bit of a rough patch.

28
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,576
A better woman never walked
the face of the earth.

29
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,327
She threw you
out again.

30
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,246
With nothing but the clothes
on me back.

31
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:23,333
How much?
A shilling or two
should suffice.

32
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,044
Keep the change.

33
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,837
God bless you,
Tommy, me boy.

34
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,756
(<i> chuckles</i> )

35
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,134
(<i> sighs</i> )

36
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,972
Harry...

37
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,266
weren't you supposed
to meet me at Sullivan's?

38
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,309
Oh, sorry,
I got distracted

39
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,895
by the, uh, scenery.

40
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,396
This is Maggie.

41
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,690
We've met.
Could you excuse us?

42
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,316
Charmed to have
met you, Harry.

43
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,069
Charmed.

44
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,528
What's the hurry?

45
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,947
A word to the wise--

46
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,198
stay away from
Maggie O'Halloran.

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,575
She's promised
to a pig farmer

48
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,326
with a very
large rake.

49
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,203
Well, does she have
a sister?
Wooden teeth.

50
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,747
Oh, nothing
a little adjustment

51
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,248
to the holo-matrix
wouldn't fix.

52
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,000
No, no, I'm not
changing a thing.

53
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,711
Fair Haven is perfect
just the way it is.

54
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,838
Tommy boy, you forgot
the leprechauns.

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,465
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Yeah. No.

56
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,342
No leprechauns, no
aliens, no starships.

57
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,012
I want this to be
a place where the
crew can unwind.

58
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,014
(<i> bell rings</i> )
Morning, lads.

59
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,683
Ah, heard any good
confessions lately?

60
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,394
Doctor/patient confidentiality,
Mr. Paris.

61
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,773
Harry hasn't seen
Sullivan's yet.
Do you care to join us?

62
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,944
Don't mind if I do.
I'll need to leave
no later than 1300 hours.

63
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,779
Medical emergency?

64
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,783
Not exactly. I'm
working on my homily
for Sunday's mass,

65
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,200
and I expect
both you sinners...

66
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,912
to be in attendance.

67
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,915
He's kidding, right?

68
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:48,335
You wanted
authenticity.

69
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,211
(<i> sighs</i> )

70
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,656
Everybody, place your bets!

71
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,742
Three bob on Liam.
Three bob it is.

72
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,535
Five shillings
on Liam.

73
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,621
You're going to hurt
Harry's feelings.

74
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,373
Oh, very well.
Two shillings
on Mr. Kim,

75
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,126
and I'll pray
for a miracle.

76
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,002
Excuse me, Father,
but I needed
a bit of counsel.

77
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,629
I'm off duty right now.

78
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,714
But I've broken the
Fifth Commandment again.

79
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,841
Say ten "Our Fathers"
and call me in the morning.

80
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,593
Oh, thank
you, Father.
Gentlemen.

81
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,140
(<i> crowd shouting</i> )
Come on, come on, Mr. Kim.

82
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,558
Show him what for.
You can do it.

83
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,196
What'll it be?

84
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,614
I'm looking
for some friends of mine.

85
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,407
Well, we're all
friends here.

86
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,326
Well, then,
have you seen Tom Paris?

87
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,329
He's right over there
with young Harry.

88
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,789
Poor sod.

89
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,499
I'm afraid no
one's whipped Liam

90
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,001
in three years.

91
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,628
There's a first time
for everything.

92
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,588
An optimist,
are you?

93
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,799
A realist.

94
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,304
Come on, Ensign, try!

95
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,972
Try!

96
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,017
Come on, me boy,
push, push!

97
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,476
I'm trying!

98
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,854
Come on! Try harder!

99
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,730
You got him! You got him, lad!
You got him!

100
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,150
(<i> grunting</i> )

101
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,695
What?!
What in God's name...?!

102
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,155
Come on, Liam, push!

103
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,533
Yes! Yes!

104
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,078
I knew you could
do it, Ensign.

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,997
So, this is the program

106
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,874
I've been hearing
so much about.

107
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,043
Welcome,
weary traveler.

108
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,128
You have outdone yourself
this time.

109
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,840
Everything is authentic,
except for one tiny detail.

110
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,466
Oh?

111
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,427
The harp on the sign--
it's backwards.

112
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,057
Oh. Everybody's a critic.

113
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,934
As I recall, the Captain
is quite an aficionado
of Irish history.

114
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,602
I hate to break
up the party,

115
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,395
but we have some
business to attend to.

116
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,357
There's a neutronic
wavefront approaching,

117
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,691
class-9.

118
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,942
Class-9?

119
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,487
Sorry, boys,
duty calls.

120
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,700
Uh, "wavefront"?

121
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,827
Now, what in the name
of God is that?

122
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,747
Um, a wee bit
of bad weather.

123
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,374
Oh.

124
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,721
SEVEN:
Borg classification
3472,

125
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,514
particle density
anomaly.

126
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,141
Where'd it come from?

127
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,935
I believe it was formed
by the collision

128
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,353
of two neutron stars.

129
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,230
The wavefront is traveling

130
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,732
at a velocity of 200,000
kilometers per second,

131
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,735
and it extends
for 3.6 light-years.

132
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,571
How long before
it hits?

133
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,531
Approximately 15 hours.

134
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,325
We're already
feeling its effects.

135
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,827
The neutron radiation
is disrupting plasma flow.

136
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,704
We can't jump to warp.

137
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,664
Impulse power won't be enough
to outrun that thing.

138
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,293
Then we'll have
to ride it out.

139
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,211
We'll generate an
inverse warp field

140
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,921
and drop anchor.

141
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,340
That should protect us
from the turbulence.

142
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,135
What about the radiation?
It'll only get worse.

143
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,929
Have the Doctor
prepare inoculations
for the crew.

144
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,056
Go to Yellow Alert.
Tom, B'Elanna,
get started

145
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,308
on converting
the warp core.

146
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,767
PARIS:
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,602
Let's batten down
the hatches.

148
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,237
Captain.

149
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,114
Just burning
the midnight oil.

150
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,740
Midnight's
come and gone.

151
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,617
Then it's time
for a break.

152
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,994
Do you mind?

153
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,870
I could use
the company.

154
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,334
This approaching
wavefront--

155
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,336
it's bringing back
some unpleasant memories.

156
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,920
How so?

157
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,381
You know I grew up
on a farm in Indiana.

158
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,216
We used to have some
terrible thunderstorms

159
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,717
during the summer months.

160
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,428
At the first bolt
of lightning,

161
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,846
I'd bolt under the bed.

162
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,681
We had some pretty nasty weather

163
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,266
on Talax, too.

164
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,935
I always enjoyed
a good ion storm.

165
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,645
Give me clear skies any day.

166
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,148
Well, now that
you bring it up, uh,

167
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,943
I am concerned
with keeping up morale
over the next few days.

168
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,197
The crew is not used
to sitting still.
Suggestions?

169
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,074
Everyone seems to love
Fair Haven.

170
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,161
I was thinking we might initiate
an open-door protocol

171
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,288
on the holodeck
and keep the program running

172
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,041
24 hours a day, let people
come and go as they please.

173
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,834
Permission granted.

174
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,628
Fair Haven's just become
our port in the storm.

175
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,088
(<i> sighs</i> )

176
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,508
I'm, uh, heading
down there myself,

177
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,176
if you'd like
to join me.

178
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,552
There's a charming
little inn

179
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,054
called The Ox
and Lamb.

180
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,680
The owner
offered to share

181
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,098
some of his recipes.

182
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,518
No, thanks.
I still have work to do.

183
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,144
Okay.

184
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,703
(<i> chair rattles</i> )

185
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,747
What'll it be?

186
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,042
A cup of tea would be nice.

187
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,836
I just made one.

188
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,339
Cream?
Please.

189
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,429
So, what brings you
to Fair Haven, Miss...?

190
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,681
Kathryn. I'm just
passing through...

191
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,683
on my way home.

192
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,936
How long have you been
on the road?

193
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,273
Five years,
almost six.

194
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,191
You must be homesick.
No.

195
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,736
Sometimes. Thank you.

196
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,909
<i>"Cead mil failte."</i>

197
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,536
Translation?

198
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,288
"A hundred thousand
welcomes."

199
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,083
It's an old Irish saying.
We're all friends here.

200
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,255
I had an aunt who used to
have a saying like that.

201
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,467
"A stranger is a friend
you just haven't met yet."

202
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,884
Definitely Irish.

203
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,719
She had an Irish
temper, too.

204
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,764
She and my uncle had
a place not far from here

205
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,224
in County Clare.

206
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,851
Ah... then you're
closer to home

207
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,105
than you think,
Katie O'Clare.

208
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,358
(<i> sets spoon down</i> )

209
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,860
You know, it's later
than I thought, and I've
kept you long enough.

210
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,322
Oh, now, stay awhile.
Didn't your auntie teach you

211
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,032
that it's impolite to leave
without playing a game of rings?

212
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,410
I really can't,
but thanks for the tea.

213
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,287
Afraid you'd lose?

214
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,917
I rarely lose.

215
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,211
Prove it.

216
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,261
One game.

217
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,221
I'll set them up.

218
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,441
Another ringer.
Well, I'm not surprised.

219
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,401
You stepped
over the beer stain.

220
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,944
I did not.
You did, too,

221
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,988
by half a boot,
and then you moved back,

222
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,865
hoping I wouldn't notice.

223
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,118
These boots are half a size
too large, so in reality,

224
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,205
my toes never crossed the line.
Your turn.

225
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,207
For luck.

226
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,876
Getting sweet with the rings
isn't going help you.

227
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,336
We'll see.

228
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,049
Damn!
Devil won't help you, either.

229
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,469
Well, maybe rings
aren't my forte after all.

230
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,513
Would you care
to arm wrestle?

231
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,599
That's not
a woman's game, Katie.
You could get hurt.

232
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,476
I'm stronger
than I look.

233
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,480
Ah!
(<i> laughs</i> )

234
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,691
Now, that's quite
a grip you have.

235
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,067
Not bad yourself.

236
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,610
(<i> grunting</i> )

237
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,489
I couldn't help but notice
that you have your leg

238
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,115
braced against the bar.

239
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,827
Well, how else do you
expect me to win?

240
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,371
(<i> grunting</i> )

241
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,747
Well, will we call it
a draw?

242
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,626
Sounds good to me.

243
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,003
(<i> groaning</i> )

244
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,340
We run a foot race
down to the station and back?

245
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,509
(<i> laughing</i> )

246
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,553
It's good to make
a new friend.

247
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,138
You have a nice way
about you.

248
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,266
"Flattery's the
food of fools."

249
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,309
Another pearl of wisdom
from your auntie?

250
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,853
No. Jonathan Swift.

251
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,813
Swift? Never heard of him.

252
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,982
He was an author.

253
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,693
I was never one
for reading.

254
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,819
Well, that's too bad.

255
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,281
Some of the greatest
writers in the
world are Irish.

256
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,368
Well, they say that Dr. Gilroy
has a library of books,

257
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,495
and, well, next time
I see him,

258
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,582
I'll ask him can I borrow
one or two.

259
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,292
Good mornin'.

260
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,960
Good mornin'.

261
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,881
Oh, my God, will you
look at the time?

262
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,259
Frannie, come here.

263
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,553
There's someone
I want you to meet.

264
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,805
Katie O'Clare,
this is my wife,

265
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,142
Francis.
Pleased to meet you.

266
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,103
I hope Michael hasn't been
bending your ear
all night long.

267
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,982
My ear, my elbow...
We were arm wrestling.

268
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,900
Mmm, such a gentleman.

269
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,819
Well, thank you very much
for your hospitality,

270
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,698
and now I really
must be leaving.

271
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,785
And, uh, drop in again
before you leave town.

272
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,369
I will!

273
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,251
If you experience
any dizziness,

274
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,711
report to Sick Bay
immediately.

275
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,296
Thank you.

276
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,839
Good morning, gentlemen.

277
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,426
I believe it's
afternoon-- oversleep?

278
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,303
Holodeck.
Fair Haven?

279
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,763
Welcome, weary traveler.

280
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,515
Even I have to admit--

281
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,391
Mr. Paris' latest effort
is quite a tour de force.

282
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,519
Ooh, high praise
from a hologram.

283
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,479
Oh, I was thinking,
Captain--

284
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,607
now that we've got
this open-door policy,

285
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,068
maybe I could expand Fair Haven
into Holodeck 2.

286
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,987
It would give me some room
to create the seacoast.

287
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,198
By all means.
Speaking of revisions,

288
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,535
I was hoping I could give
my character a more active role.

289
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,245
In the period you've created,
the village priest

290
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,997
<i>was</i> the most prominent
member of the community,

291
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,957
held in the highest regard.

292
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,210
You know, that's
a great idea, Doc.

293
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,213
We could send
Father Mulligan

294
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,298
on a retreat
to a nearby monastery,

295
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,843
where he takes
a vow of silence

296
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,553
and never speaks again.

297
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,097
Try it!

298
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,850
And you'll be saying
"Hail Marys"

299
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,727
till St. Patrick's Day.

300
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,689
(<i> both laughing</i> )

301
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,690
Time?

302
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,274
30 seconds.

303
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,068
Let's see it.

304
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,494
All hands,
this is the Captain.

305
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,497
Secure your stations
and brace for impact.

306
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,678
We've cleared the leading edge.
Turbulence is decreasing.

307
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,889
Shields are holding.
Damage?

308
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,016
We've got a ruptured
plasma conduit, Deck 9.

309
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,269
Send a repair team.

310
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,062
Maintain Yellow Alert.

311
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,733
Let's hope that was
the worst of it.

312
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,403
<i>Captain's Personal Log.</i>

Adjust his parameters to
the following specifications.

324
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,835
Give him the education
of a 19th century...

at Trinity College.

330
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,436
Specify.

331
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,565
Give him a more
complicated personality.

332
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,108

00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,325
more confident,
not so reserved...

336
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,704

00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,968
three centimeters.

341
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,431
Remove the facial hair.

342

No... no,
I don't like that.

343
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,355

about two days' growth.

00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,902
Better.
Oh, one more thing.

Are you ill,

00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:30,568
I am experiencing
a slight loss of equilibrium

00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,451
Unlikely. I'm not prone
to that condition.

355
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,536
Perhaps you should
go to Sick Bay.

356
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,162
I'll be fine.

357
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,123
KIM:
I'm telling you,
we should add more fog.

358
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,833
Fog is depressing.

359
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,086
It's authentic!
It's dangerous!

360
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,088
(<i> sighs</i> ):
All right, we could add
a lighthouse.

361
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,966
It's<i> Fair</i> Haven, Harry.
Sunshine.

362
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,802
Tuvok, what do you think:
Irish seacoast--

363
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,177
fog or no fog?

364
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,888
I have no opinion.

365
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,181
He hasn't visited our
little paradise yet.

366
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,850
Nor do I intend to.

367
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,936
KIM:
I think you'd
like it, Commander.

368
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,228
It's a great place
to meditate.

369
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,897
Imagine yourself
sitting

370
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,399
high on a bluff
overlooking the ocean.

371
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,110
Salt air...

372
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,904
the rhythm of the waves
rising and crashing

373
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,448
against the rocks...
a tiny fishing boat

374
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,992
bobbing on the
water below...

375
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,242
up and down,

376
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,787
up and down.

377
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,331
I get the idea, Ensign.
Thank you.

378
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,709
Mutton, creamed cabbage
or blood pudding?

379
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,169
Explain.

380
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,879
I'm preparing
a traditional Irish meal

381
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,506
at The Ox and Lamb
this afternoon,

382
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,842
and I cannot decide
on a main course.

383
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,844
Blood pudding--
you can't lose.

384
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,096
Well, that was
my first choice, too,

385
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,722
but replicating
the lamb's intestines--

386
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,350
it-it could be tricky,
and every time

387
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,478
I try to heat the blood,
it coagulates in the milk.

388
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,063
If you'll excuse me.

389
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,191
I think I<i> will</i> consult
the Doctor.

390
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,821
(<i> dogs barking</i> )

391
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,032
(<i> sheep bleating</i> )

392
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,134
Excuse me, ma'am.
Hmm?

393
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,677
Have you seen
Michael Sullivan?

394
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,970
Oh, you might try
the pub.

395
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,722
I just came
from there.

396
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,932
Oh, then he'll be
at the train station.

397
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,600
Yeah.
Thank you.

398
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,227
Sure.

399
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,951
Excuse me, sir.
Is the train to Galway
running on time?

400
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,163
Um... I'm afraid
you've just missed it.

401
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,041
Have a seat.
Wait for the next one.

402
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,882
Do you know Jane Eldon?

403
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,094
Eldon. No,
I've never met her.

404
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,678
Well, I'd be terrified
if you had.

405
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,346
She's been
dead 70 years.

406
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,307
(<i> laughing</i> )

407
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,809
No, I was, uh...

408
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,978
I was thinking
about her poetry.

409
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,106
It's too pastoral
for my taste.

410
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,732
Don't you agree?

411
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,401
I'm not familiar
with her work.

412
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,028
Really?

413
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,405
Well, what about
Sean Gogarty?

414
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,075
They have similar
rhyming schemes.

415
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,747
You've some
catching up to do.

416
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,331
(<i> chuckling</i> )

417
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, I'm here
every afternoon.

418
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,877
You should join
me sometime.

419
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,296
I tried talking
poetry with Seamus,

420
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,007
but all he can do
is recite limericks.

421
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,261
I'd love to.
Strange place
to read, though.

422
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,929
Not at all.

423
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,098
I love the sound of the
trains coming and going.

424
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,933
Gets me thinking
about places

425
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,018
I'd like to visit.

426
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,521
Have you traveled
much yourself?

427
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,482
As a matter of fact...

428
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,443
But there's one place
I haven't been yet--
Castle O'Dell.

429
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,988
It's a steep climb,

430
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,864
but from the top
of the battlement,

431
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,658
you can see all
the way to Dublin.

432
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,493
We'd better
be moving.

433
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,003
They say when the sun
goes down,

434
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,172
the King of the Faeries
reclaims the castle.

435
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,340
Maybe he'll invite
us to supper.

436
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,093
Eh, you'll be dining alone,
without me.

437
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,095
One taste
of the faeries' banquet,

438
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,888
and you'll never return
to this world.

439
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,932
Oh, don't tell me you
believe those stories.

440
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:34,770
Believe? No.
But I do respect them.

441
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,605
Can I ask you something,
Katie?

442
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,316
Please.

443
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,194
Have you a man
waiting for you at home?

444
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,820
No.

445
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,072
Are you looking for one?
(<i> laughing</i> )

446
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,991
Why, do you
have somebody?

447
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,492
In Fair Haven?

448
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,953
Not unless you fancy
a pig farmer.

449
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,789
Oh, not my type.

450
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,582
Well, what about
a barkeep

451
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,919
who reads poetry
in strange places?

452
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,339
Captain?

453
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,300
I thought that was you.

454
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,468
Just getting
in the spirit.

455
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,304
I can see that.

456
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,930
I don't believe we've met.

457
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,641
Sullivan.
Michael Sullivan.

458
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,851
Chakotay.

459
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,102
That's a fine tattoo.

460
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,478
Are you off a ship?

461
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,564
You could say that.

462
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,525
We're on the way up
to the old castle.

463
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,485
You're welcome
to come with us.

464
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,321
Thanks, but, um...

465
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,990
I'm meeting Neelix
at The Ox and Lamb.

466
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,534
You two have fun.

467
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:37,333
Is it my imagination,
or did he call you Captain?

468
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,001
<i>Did</i> he?

469
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,259
Looks like the worst
is yet to come.

Commander?

471
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,511
I just came
from Astrometrics.

472
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,805
Seven's found an increase
in the neutronic gradient

473
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,766
at the trailing edge
of the wavefront.

474
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,642
It's going to be
a rough ride when it hits.

475
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,353
We've still
got two days.

476
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,563
Start working on a
new shield modulation.

477
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,232
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,276
That could explain
my recent space sickness.

479
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,279
Vulcan physiology
is highly sensitive
to neutronic gradients.

You'd make a good barometer,
Tuvok.

wouldn't happen to be
in Ireland?

You can wipe
that smirk off your face.
It's not what you think.

488
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:34,140
I wasn't thinking anything,
but now that you mention it...

489
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,684
I have an interest
in Irish culture.

490
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,519
It's understandable.
They've produced

491
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,897
great writers
for hundreds of years...

492
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,108
not to mention great bartenders.

493
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,778
He's a hologram.

494
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,157
I couldn't help but notice--
he seemed a little taller

495
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,699
than the last
time I saw him.

496
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,118
Yes, I made
a few modifications.

497
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,953
In the interest
of Irish culture?

498
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,288
Exactly.

You seemed embarrassed
when I ran into you.

reason to be.

isn't he?

530
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,650
The Doctor's going to sing
something called "Danny Boy",

531
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,111
and Mossie Donegan's promised
to bring his talking pig.

532
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,906
Well, let's just say
I'd rather stick to
reality right now.

533
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,744
1900 hours...
if you change your mind.

534
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,288
Thank you.

535
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,837
Saints preserve us.

536
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,840
I possess superior
hand/eye coordination.

537
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,552
That's not all
that's superior.

538
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,471
The lily and the rose
are staging

539
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,723
a competition
on your face.

540
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,099
Clarify.

541
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,893
The fullness
of your lips

542
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,811
and the paleness
of your cheeks--

543
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,897
it's enough to
make a man faint.

544
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:55,775
Then, in that case,
perhaps we should sit down.

545
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,241
I don't believe it.

546
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,784
It's called
"old-world charm," Harry.

547
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,454
What'll it be,
gentlemen?

548
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,788
Nothing for me.

549
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,708
"Temperance
is a virtue."

550
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,875
Where's Michael?

551
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,293
Over there.

552
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,465
That's strange.

553
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,842
I programmed him
not to drink.

554
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,054
Must be a glitch
in his subroutine.

555
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,353
Are these seats taken?

556
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,731
Sit anywhere
you like.

557
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,194
(<i> clears throat</i> )

558
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,739
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Vile.

559
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,619
It's been 15 years
since I touched the stuff.

560
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,537
You making up
for lost time?

561
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,123
I was hoping
it might ease the pain.

562
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,374
Are you in discomfort?

563
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,752
Agony's more like it.

564
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,922
How could you do this to me,
Lord?

565
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,636
Why don't you ask him?

566
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,471
You've got his ear,
don't you?

567
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,055
Well...

568
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,683
Three days...

569
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,728
the happiest three days
of my life.

570
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,148
I was a fool to think
she felt the same.

571
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,902
I was such a fool!
SEAMUS:
Aw, sit down, Sullivan.

572
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,613
Shut your mouth, man,
or I'll shut it for you.

573
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,947
Oh, you will,
will you?

574
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:24,906
Hey, hey, hey...

575
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,866
take it easy.

576
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,749
Um... why don't you tell us
what happened?

577
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,210
(<i> sighs</i> ):
We...

578
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:42,257
we spent a perfect day
together by the lake.

579
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,259
I drifted off to sleep,

580
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,887
and... when I woke up,
she was gone.

581
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:51,891
Where is she, Tom?

582
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,560
Who?

583
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,270
Katie O'Clare--
who else?

584
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,064
Katie O'Clare?

585
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,858
Your friend.

586
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,154
Um...

587
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,198
are you sure
you didn't...

588
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,117
uh... misinterpret
her interests?

589
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,077
I mean, we're
all friends here.

590
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,705
Maybe she was just
being friendly.

591
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,955
You calling me a liar?

592
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,999
N-no, no,
not at all.

593
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:20,253
I thought...
Katie and me were in love.

594
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,048
I may have to do
some reprogramming...

595
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,718
What's the matter?
You don't think
I'm good enough for her?

596
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,344
No, I-I didn't
say that.

597
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,804
Well, tell me
where she's gone.

598
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,473
I don't know.
Well, I think you do!

599
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,850
(<i> grunting</i> )

600
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,894
Gentlemen, please!

601
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,146
"Love thy neighbor."

602
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,068
Let's see...
I remember

603
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,903
trying to reach the
holodeck controls.

604
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,531
Then, uh, somebody
grabbed my leg.

605
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,575
Maybe it was
the talking pig.

606
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,244
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
If it was, he had
one hell of a left hook.

607
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,789
What's all this?

608
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,500
I'm afraid there's
been some trouble
in paradise--

609
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,586
an altercation in the pub
this afternoon.

610
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,463
Several crewmen
were injured.
Nothing serious.

611
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,965
Arm wrestling get
out of hand, boys?

612
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,342
Not exactly.

613
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,802
It was Michael Sullivan,
Captain.

614
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,804
He was...
(<i> clears throat</i> )

615
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,014
...looking for someone.

616
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,227
Why don't we...
take a little walk?

617
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:25,277
Let me guess--
that someone is me.

618
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,487
I don't mean to
pry, Captain,

619
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,364
but we've got a
broken-hearted hologram

620
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,366
who believed that the
two of you were in love.

621
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,993
Oh, I was sure he'd be
on to the next lass by now.

622
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,621
I hope he's all right.

623
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,163
Far from it.

624
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,583
The fight spilled
out onto the street.

625
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,251
Before long, he'd
climbed up a tree

626
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,670
and began shouting
your name.

627
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,590
Mr. Neelix managed
to... talk him down.

628
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,092
It could be a malfunction
in his behavioral subroutines.

629
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,428
I've already checked that.
His subroutines are fine.

630
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,221
But I did notice
you've made

631
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,557
quite a number
of alterations
to his program.

632
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,184
Minor improvements.
To make him more appealing?

633
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,978
You're starting
to pry, Doctor.

634
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,606
I apologize for
overstepping my bounds,

635
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,483
but I'm worried
about you.

636
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,526
Michael Sullivan
is a hologram.

637
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,779
His broken heart can be
mended with the flick
of a switch.

638
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,405
<i>Your</i> feelings,
however,

639
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,992
are a little more...
complicated.

640
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,702
I'm not going to be
climbing any trees,

641
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,121
if that's what you're
worried about.

642
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,499
If you decide
you want to talk,

643
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,043
I've been hearing a lot
of confessions lately.

644
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,671
Let me know.

645
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,715
You want a confession,
Doctor?

646
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,679
All right.

647
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,017
I've become
romantically involved

648
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,936
with a hologram,
if that's possible.

649
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,479
Tell me what
happened.

650
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,439
Oh, you know the story--
girl meets boy;

651
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,065
girl modifies
boy's subroutines.

652
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,734
Did you have
<i>intimate</i> relations?

653
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,402
That's none
of your business.

654
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,613
Let's just say it was
a memorable three days.

655
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,073
I don't see
the problem.
Don't you?

656
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,451
Michael Sullivan
is exactly my type--

657
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,036
attractive,
intelligent.

658
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,663
We share
the same interests,

659
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,414
and if there's something
I don't like,

660
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,166
I can simply change it.

661
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,960
I've noticed that
humans usually try

662
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,753
to change the people
they fall in love with.

663
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,882
What's the difference?
In this case, it works.

664
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,262
We had a picnic by the lake
yesterday afternoon.

665
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,681
Michael drifted off
to sleep.

666
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,474
His head was lying
on my shoulder,

667
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,728
and I remember thinking,
"This is close to perfect."

668
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,229
Then he began to snore.

669
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,314
Did I nudge him
with my elbow,

670
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,191
hoping he'd roll over
and stop?

671
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,318
Did I whisper in his ear
to wake him? No.

672
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,030
Why bother, when I could
simply access the computer

673
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,990
and alter
his vocal algorithms?

674
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,867
And that's exactly
what I was about to do,

675
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,660
when I realized
that everything around me

676
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,830
was an illusion,
including him, so I left.

677
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,790
Oh, I almost wrote him a note
to say good-bye.

678
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,961
Could you believe that--
a "Dear John" letter
to a hologram?

679
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,092
I understand your
trepidation...

680
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,761
but you're
the Captain.

681
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,220
You can't have
a relationship

682
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,680
with a member
of your crew.

683
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,181
They're all your
subordinates.

684
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,850
So where does
that leave you--

685
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,561
the occasional
dalliance with
a passing alien?

686
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,438
<i>Voyager</i> could be in
the Delta Quadrant

687
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,314
for a very long time.

688
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,609
A hologram may be
the only logical
alternative.

689
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,069
He's not real.

690
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,779
He's as real
as I am.

691
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,697
Photons and force fields;
flesh and blood--

692
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,700
it's all the same,
as long as your
feelings are real.

693
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,703
He makes a joke;
you laugh.
Is that an illusion?

694
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,496
He says something
that makes you think.

695
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,541
Does it matter how his
molecules are aligned?

696
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,294
Did it ever occur to you
that it's not
just a question

697
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,129
of whether or
not he's real?

698
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,756
What do you mean?

699
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,507
I think you should
stop trying to control

700
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,802
every aspect of
this relationship.

701
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,429
Romance is born
out of differences

702
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,514
as well as
similarities...

703
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,060
out of the unexpected
as well as the familiar.

704
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,106
Maybe I just needed
to be sure...

705
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,524
he'd love me back.

706
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,902
But isn't that the
risk you always take,

707
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,529
hologram or not?

708
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,698
All I know is...

709
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,493
Michael Sullivan was
up in that tree,

710
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,162
shouting your name.

711
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,540
I've never been afraid
of taking risks.

712
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,626
Then perhaps
next time,

713
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,505
you should just...
let him snore.

714
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,232
The neutronic gradient's
rising--

715
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,275
30 million terajoules...

716
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,485
40 million.

717
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,486
Shields.

718
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,779
Holding.

719
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,865
60 million.

720
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,160
Torres to Bridge. The inverse
warp field's destabilizing.

721
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,786
We're losing our anchor.

722
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,538
Acknowledged. How long
before we're clear?

723
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,040
At least
another five minutes.

724
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,708
That's about four
minutes too long.

725
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,169
The gradient's rising fast--
90 million.

726
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,839
Stabilizers are off-line.

727
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,427
Thrusters.

728
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,056
No effect.
Shields are failing.

729
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,432
How close are we
to the perimeter?
A thousand kilometers,

730
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,810
but we're being pulled along
with the storm.

731
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,770
What have you got in mind?
The deflector beam--

732
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,480
we might be able
to cut a path
through the wavefront.

733
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,649
It's possible,
but we'd have to route

734
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,401
all available power
to the emitters.

735
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,820
That won't be enough.
Primary systems are down.

736
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,239
Then transfer all
secondary power sources--

737
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,034
transporters,
replicators, holodecks.

738
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,702
Captain, there's not enough time

739
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,495
to go through the hologrid
shutdown sequence.

740
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,039
We'd lose most of Fair Haven.

741
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,959
Do it.

742
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,171
Hull fractures,
Decks 6 and 7.

743
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,297
You've got
all the secondary power, Tuvok.

744
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,508
Is that enough?
Negative.

745
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,301
Siphon energy
from the plasma network--

746
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,846
every last deciwatt!

747
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,973
Deflector beam active.

748
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,438
We're approaching
the perimeter.

749
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,107
500 kilometers...

750
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,649
400...

751
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,527
Deflector output is dropping.

752
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,571
Give him everything we've got--
life support,

753
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,990
environmental control.
Scrape the residual ions

754
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,576
off the sonic showers
if you have to.

755
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,133
(<i> sighing</i> )

756
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,979
Doesn't look good, Tom.

757
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,772
With this much
photonic decay,

758
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,441
we'll be able to save five,
maybe ten percent.

759
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,986
So much for the
luck of the Irish.

760
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,946
It might be easier
to start from scratch.

761
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,447
It wouldn't
be the same.

762
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,365
It's like trying
to rewrite a novel

763
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,367
after the only copy
of the data file's
been deleted.

764
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,453
All the details,
the nuances--

765
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,704
they're all gone.

766
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,540
Morning, lads.
Hey, Seamus.

767
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,418
Looks like
a storm brewing.
A storm?

768
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,005
Heading in from the west.
Could be a big one.

769
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,465
Oh... you're right.

770
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,759
I don't suppose
you could spare
a shilling or two?

771
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,678
Me wife and I made up
last night,

772
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,805
and I wanted
to buy her a new parasol.

773
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,017
The grid's
destabilizing.

774
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,644
We'd better get started
on those repairs.

775
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,397
So, what do we try and save?

776
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,733
The Ox and Lamb? The church?

777
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,111
Maggie O'Halloran?

778
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:26,656
There's someone
I should talk to
before we decide.

779
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,824
(<i> door chimes</i> )

780
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,117
Come in.

781
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,414
Fair Haven didn't fare
too well.

782
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,792
I'll break the news to the crew.

783
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,752
With your permission,

784
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,671
I'd like to try
to reconstruct the program.

785
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,381
How long will it take?

786
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,133
Six or seven weeks.

787
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,719
Harry tells me that
we should be able to save

788
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,763
about ten percent
of the existing elements.

789
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,766
I thought you might have
a suggestion or two.

790
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,038
Computer,
is Fair Haven character

791
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,623
Michael Sullivan still intact?

792
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,209
Affirmative.

793
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,881
Activate him.

794
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,051
Hello.

795
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,054
You disappeared
on me, Katie.

796
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,306
I woke up,
and you had gone.

797
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,600
I had some
thinking to do.

798
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,143
Are you done?

799
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,520
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Yes.

800
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,610
I'm leaving Fair Haven.

801
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,445
Why?

802
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,697
Because.

803
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:52,409
That's not a very good reason.

804
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,745
The situation is complicated.

805
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,872
Another man?

806
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,540
No.

807
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,710
Your friends...

808
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,712
they don't approve of me?

809
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,923
They think you're charming.

810
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,804
Are you not ready
to settle down yet?

811
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,641
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

812
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,979
You're not making any sense.

813
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,649
No, I guess I'm not.

814
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,277
Well, I have a feeling

815
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:31,323
that, uh, you won't
be forgetting us that easily.

816
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,492
Fair Haven has that effect
on people.

817
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,415
But there's one thing
I want you to know.

818
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,668
I love you, Katie.

819
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,880
(<i> sighs</i> )

820
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,675
I might actually
be passing this way

821
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,720
in, uh... six or seven weeks.

822
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,849
Maybe I'll stop by the pub.

823
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,103
See that you do.

824
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,118
Oh, computer,
end program.

825
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,753
Wait.

826
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:35,220
I want to make one more
modification to the character.

827
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,055
COMPUTER:
Specify.

828
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:45,355
Deny Kathryn Janeway
any future access

829
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,899
to his behavioral subroutines.

830
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,902
Modification complete.

831
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,990
Save program.

832
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,909
(<i> computer beeps</i> )
