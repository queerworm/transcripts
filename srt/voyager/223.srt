00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,296
( playing "Jazz Impromptu" )

00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,018
( pounding on wall )

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,561
Sorry!

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,189
Obviously, Ensign Baytart
doesn't appreciate music.

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,358
It's the darn fluid conduits
running through the walls.

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,985
They conduct sound.

7
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,445
You think when they designed
this thing, they would've--

8
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,489
The ship was built for combat
performance, Harry,

9
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,866
not musical performance.

10
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,785
Nobody figured
we'd be taking any long trips.

11
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,912
Where am I supposed to practice?

12
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,246
How about Cargobay?

13
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,374
KIM:
Bad acoustics.

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,377
We could get Baytart transferred
to the night shift.

15
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,338
Ha. Couldn't do that.

16
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,840
Could we?

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,341
( chuckles )

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,050
So now you have an excuse
to give your mother

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,887
why you didn't practice
while you were gone.

20
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:58,475
Look, I'm trying to prepare
for an important performance.

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,186
Oh, really?
Are we scheduled to rendezvous

22
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,356
with the Delta Quadrant
Symphony Orchestra?

23
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,400
No. Susan Nicoletti and I
have been working on

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,569
a new orchestral program
for the holodeck.

25
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,905
Lieutenant Nicoletti?

26
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,824
The one I've been chasing
for six months?

27
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,409
Cold hands, cold heart?

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,536
Not when she plays the oboe.

29
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>Chakotay</i>

<i>Please report to the Bridge.</i>

31
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,292
You know, Harry,

32
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,837
I've always wanted to learn
how to play the drums.

33
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,047
( chuckles )

34
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:31,592
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

35
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,058
( console beeping )

36
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,643
I am picking up communication
satellites in orbit.

37
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,895
They're nonfunctional.

38
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,022
Mr. Paris, take us
in a little closer.

39
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,356
Mr. Kim, scan
the surface.

40
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,155
Captain, this used to be
a major trading spot.

41
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,449
How long ago?

42
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,158
I'm not sure exactly.

43
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,452
If I had to guess...

44
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,245
KIM:
EM signature
indicates

45
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,415
that a major solar flare
occurred here 19 years ago.

46
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,501
I'd say about 19 years...

47
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,711
more or less.

48
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,922
Looks like a glacial freeze.

49
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,339
Caused by a solar flare

50
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,092
that radically changed
the weather patterns.

51
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,010
KIM:
It did a lot
more than that.

52
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,346
They were hit by magnetic storms
and extreme levels of radiation.

53
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,265
Those glaciers are receding.

54
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,810
KIM:
The biosphere seems
to be recovering.

55
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,686
Did anyone survive?

56
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,730
KIM:
I'm scanning
the settlement.

57
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,482
There's evidence of
advanced technology--

58
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,776
warp reactors,
subspace transmitters--

59
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,320
but no life signs.

60
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,573
Maybe they saw it coming
and evacuated the planet.

61
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,118
TUVOK:
Indications are that any
attempt at an evacuation

62
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,703
would have been prevented
by the atmospheric disturbances.

63
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,456
What was
the estimated population?

64
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,458
TUVOK:
Approximately
400,000.

65
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,835
KIM:
Captain.

66
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,462
I'm picking up something
from the surface.

67
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,548
I think we're being hailed.

68
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,844
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

69
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,559
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

70
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,789
I thought you said
there weren't any life signs.

71
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,040
There aren't.

72
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,584
I scanned the entire surface.

73
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,003
Must be an automated signal.

74
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,671
Let's hear it.

75
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:01,176
<i>I am Viorsa, planner</i>
<i>for the Kohl settlement.</i>

76
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,971
<i>Your sensors have activated</i>
<i>this message.</i>

77
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,724
<i>By now, you must be aware</i>
<i>of the catastrophic disaster</i>

78
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,851
<i>that has destroyed our home.</i>

79
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,395
<i>A few of us</i>
<i>have managed to survive</i>

80
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,356
<i>in a state</i>
<i>of artificial hibernation,</i>

81
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,442
<i>programmed to end in 15 years</i>

82
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,820
<i>from the date</i>
<i>this was recorded.</i>

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,198
<i>At that time, when</i>
<i>the eco recovery has begun,</i>

84
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,743
<i>we will attempt</i>
<i>to rebuild our settlement.</i>

85
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:32,791
<i>Please do nothing</i>
<i>to interrupt our timetable.</i>

86
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,418
Their timetable was supposed
to end four years ago.

87
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,587
Looks like they didn't make it.

88
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,008
Mr. Kim, wouldn't your scans
have picked up

89
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,010
suppressed metabolic activity?

90
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,678
I would think
so, Captain.

91
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,180
Unless...

92
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,975
Checking below the surface.

93
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,519
Nothing one kilometer down.

94
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,728
Two kilometers...

95
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,022
( console beeps )

96
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,273
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,858
I think I've got something.

98
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,360
2.3 kilometers down--
extremely faint bio-signatures.

99
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,779
Three humanoids.

100
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,364
Can you detect a malfunction
in their systems?

101
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,868
Something to explain why they
didn't wake up on schedule?

102
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,536
Not at this distance.

103
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,913
But I am picking up
two more humanoids

104
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,875
at the same location
who are dead.

105
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,085
Are there any
automated security systems?

106
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,837
We triggered
a "do not disturb" sign.

107
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,547
I don't want
to set off anything worse.

108
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,632
No weapons
of any kind, Captain.

109
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,426
It is safe to transport
the hibernation pods to<i> Voyager,</i>

110
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,678
if that is your intent.

111
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,846
It is.

112
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,057
Prepare to beam them
to Cargobay 1.

113
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,266
Mr. Kim, you're with me.

114
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,018
Janeway to Kes,
report to Cargobay 1.

115
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,228
Bring your medical gear.

116
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,562
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

117
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,856
(<i> soft theme playing</i> )

118
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,406
Two humanoids dead.

119
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,408
Three humanoids in deep stasis.

120
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,083
Life signs
apparently stable.

121
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,712
Our messenger.

122
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,308
Did the system break down?

123
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,437
Not that I can see.

124
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,522
I'm not reading
any pathway failures

125
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,815
in the hibernation pods.

126
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,279
The circuitry all seems
to be functioning.

127
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,744
It looks like their brains
are interconnected

128
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,913
in a complex
sensory system

129
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,831
controlled by this computer.

130
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:41,378
( beeping )

131
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,213
According to these
indicators, Captain,

132
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,714
their minds
are active.

133
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,174
Active?
What do you mean?

134
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,467
The encephalographic
reading

135
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
suggests they're dreaming,

136
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,597
but there's some kind of
interactivity with the computer.

137
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,849
It's not just scanning
their brain functions.

138
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,477
It's sending a data stream
back to them, as well.

139
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,521
Could it be generating

140
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,191
an artificial environment
of some sort?

141
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,444
Artificial
environment?

142
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:09,906
Years ago, Starfleet
used a technology

143
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:14,077
to assist deep space travel
that kept the body in stasis,

144
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,371
but provided a mental landscape

145
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,082
to keep the mind
active and alert.

146
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,417
That sounds like
a pretty good way

147
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,085
to wait out
a planetary disaster.

148
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,297
For the moment,
it's as good a theory as any.

149
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,257
So, what went wrong?

150
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,259
Why are they
still in there?

151
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,969
KIM:
The system was supposed

152
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,804
to bring these people
out of hibernation

153
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,555
four years ago.

154
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,143
However, it wasn't left
entirely to the computer.

155
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,479
The programmers
obviously wanted

156
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,730
the people in the system
to decide for themselves

157
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,774
when it would be safe
to come out.

158
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,901
This was accomplished
by a subroutine

159
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,488
that periodically displayed
atmospheric conditions to them.

160
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,947
So, they should've known
years ago

161
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,449
that the biosphere
had recovered.

162
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,034
Exactly.

163
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,786
This subroutine has remained
available to these people

164
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,913
since it was activated
four years ago.

165
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,999
It's literally
an escape hatch.

166
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,209
Perhaps it has malfunctioned.

167
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,129
No. That's what's so odd
about this.

168
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,882
As far as I can tell,
it's working perfectly.

169
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,633
Then why don't they
get themselves out?

170
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,801
I don't know.

171
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,261
Maybe they like
it in there.

172
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,804
DOCTOR:
<i>I don't think so.</i>

173
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,223
Doctor?

174
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,142
<i>The two victims died</i>
<i>from massive heart failure,</i>

175
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,478
<i>and there was evidence</i>
<i>of prior neural trauma.</i>

176
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,522
I'm sorry.
What does that mean?

177
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:27,526
<i>It could be evidence</i>
<i>of extreme...fear.</i>

178
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,529
Maybe it was caused by the panic
that accompanies a heart attack.

179
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,490
The readings suggest an extended

00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,927
All right.

362
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,178
I'm going to try to bring them
out with our backup systems.

363
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,931
KES:
Initiating
resuscitation.

364
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,978
The body temperature is rising.

365
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,023
( medical tricorder beeps )

366
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,901
JANEWAY:
What happened?

367
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,278
Their bodies are returning
to stasis condition, Captain.

368
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,281
Someone is terminating
the recall command

369
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,991
from inside the system.

370
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,204
CLOWN:
Very wise of you,

371
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,415
my technically
minded fellow.

372
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,750
Now, get rid of it completely.

373
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,001
It's an intrusion.

374
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,294
It's ruining the party.

375
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,088
That would be a mistake.

376
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,465
No mistake.
A mistake if you refuse.

377
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,216
You'd be missing an opportunity.

378
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,803
Trying to get the better of me?

379
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,471
Trying to trick me?

380
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,181
I know everything you know,
Harry Kim.

381
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,892
I know how much you miss Libby.

382
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,978
I know how you can never hit
that G-sharp

383
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,687
in the Mozart concerto.

384
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,189
Do you think I don't know
you're trying to defeat me?

385
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,110
Fine. So you know.

386
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,446
You'll also know that what I'm
about to tell you is the truth.

387
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,740
You'd be smart
to let one of us go.

388
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,408
Would I?

389
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,120
This is your chance to send
the outside world a message--

390
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,122
to tell them your demands.

391
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,873
I have only one demand--

392
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,125
to exist.

393
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,835
Then you'd better let us
tell them.

394
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,670
Otherwise, you run the risk

395
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,505
of our people
shutting down the whole system,

396
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,840
because I promise you,

397
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,967
they won't let us stay
in here for long.

398
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,221
( waltz playing over speakers )

399
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,769
How did this happen?

400
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,063
The system was designed
to be adaptive,

401
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,315
to observe and respond
to our thoughts

402
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,442
and adjust the environment
to our wishes.

403
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,862
Who wished<i> him</i> up?

404
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,279
It happened
over months

405
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,865
without our even realizing it.

406
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,283
All of us had fears
about survival, recovery.

407
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,827
We never anticipated

408
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,829
the computer would manifest
those fears into<i> him.</i>

409
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,789
Our only hope was
that someone like you

410
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,374
would come along and find us.

411
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,793
KIM:
It's almost as though
he can read our minds.

412
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,461
He seems to know
what we're thinking.

413
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,130
He's generated by the system,

414
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,423
and our brains are monitored
by the system,

415
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,384
so, yes, in a manner
of speaking, he can.

416
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,053
VIORSA:
But there is a delay

417
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,514
before he becomes aware
of what we're thinking.

418
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,100
It takes a few minutes
for our brain activity

419
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,561
to be processed by the system.

420
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,981
Well, I've come to a decision,
with the help of my friends.

421
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,026
You, leave. You, stay.

422
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,986
And tell your beloved
Captain Janeway

423
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,238
that if we die,<i> they</i> die,

424
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,532
including you, dear Harry--

425
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,077
you who becomes my best friend
as of today.

426
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,080
Because she would never
kill<i> you,</i> would she, Harry?

427
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,540
No. Why, she's like a dear
old mother to you, isn't she?

428
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,833
( chuckles )

429
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,126
Go!

430
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,094
Someone's activated
the recall subroutine.

431
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,929
KES:
Captain, it's
Lieutenant Torres.

432
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,475
Her body temperature is rising.

433
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:12,354
She should regain consciousness
in about...12 minutes.

434
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,232
At least, we'll finally
get the answers

435
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,566
to a few questions.

436
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,032
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

437
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,328
Well, let's start
with the obvious question.

438
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,540
If they're demanding
to exist,

439
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,918
can we find a way
to let them exist

440
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,670
in this artificial world
of theirs?

441
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,214
Not unless you're prepared

442
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,549
to leave one person
in stasis permanently.

443
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,760
DOCTOR:
<i>I concur</i>
<i>with Lieutenant Torres.</i>

444
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,762
<i>The computer uses</i>
<i>bioneural feedback</i>

445
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,640
<i>from the participants' brains</i>
<i>to create the environment.</i>

446
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,309
Doctor, is there a way
to speed up resuscitation?

447
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,728
<i>Only by a few minutes.</i>

448
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,106
<i>Anything more, we'd be risking</i>
<i>serious brain damage.</i>

449
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,900
<i>Ten minutes would be</i>
<i>about the best we could do.</i>

450
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,820
Ten minutes and all
the hostages could be killed.

451
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,322
Then it seems to me
our first order of business

452
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,658
should be to reduce
the number of hostages.

453
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,661
All we have to do now

454
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:12,206
is decide
how to negotiate with...

455
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,541
an emotion.

456
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,796
With a manifestation...

457
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,090
of fear.

458
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,718
Fear is the most primitive,
the most primordial

459
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,095
of biological
responses.

460
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,347
The ability
to recognize danger--

461
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,557
to fight it or run away from it.

462
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,767
That's what fear gives us,

463
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:36,689
but...when fear
holds you hostage...

464
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,988
how do you make it let go?

465
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,115
Maybe we should try
to make them laugh.

466
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,451
A good joke just...

467
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,412
uh, seems to make
fear dissolve.

468
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,082
Well, it does in me, anyway.

469
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,458
I think something

470
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,377
a little more responsive
to The Clown's demand.

471
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:03,883
B'Elanna, maybe you can come up

472
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,676
with a way
to modify the system

473
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,762
so it can run
without bioneural interaction.

474
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,097
How do we negotiate

475
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,308
without sending in
another hostage?

476
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,727
Good question.

477
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:19,148
We have to come up with
a safer method of communication.

478
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,151
VIORSA:
I regret very much
what has happened to you.

479
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,444
You came to help.

480
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,488
You didn't deserve this.

481
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,076
( haunting synth music
playing over speakers )

482
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:33,620
I regret so many things.

483
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,173
Look.

484
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,800
We don't have time
for regret.

485
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,678
My people are working
on a way, right now,

486
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,138
to get us out of here,

487
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,099
and we have to help
them if we can.

488
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,477
You'll leave hope behind
after a few months of this.

489
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,688
( maniacal laugh )

490
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,194
Why does he do it?

491
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,239
We're his canvas...

492
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,616
his blocks of marble.

493
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,620
With us, he practices
his ghastly art.

494
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,622
CLOWN:
Thinking about escape,
are we, Harry?

495
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,292
Naughty, naughty.

496
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,294
I don't like those thoughts.

497
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,545
We're going to have to do
something about them.

498
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,715
He's new. He can't help
thinking about getting out.

499
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,883
He can!

500
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,718
You don't think
about it anymore.

501
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,305
Oh, but he's new...

502
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,764
and you're old.

503
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,724
New and old...

504
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,684
old and new.

505
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,604
Well, then, the answer
is to simply...

506
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,856
make<i> you</i> old, Harry.

507
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,733
( laughs )

508
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,112
Are you afraid of
growing old, Harry?

509
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,656
Is that
what you fear--

510
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,409
being cared for by nurses?

511
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,995
Time for your medicine.

512
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,750
You don't like
being helpless, do you, Harry?

513
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,171
You like to take care
of yourself.

514
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,631
Yes, I know
how you hate

515
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,343
to feel
like the baby on the crew.

516
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,303
( laughing maniacally )

517
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,973
( crying )

518
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,224
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

519
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,310
Oh, what's
the matter, Harry?

520
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,562
Ooh, does my costume
frighten you, huh? Ooh!

521
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,772
Coochie-coo.

522
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,816
( Clown laughs )

523
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,734
Yeah. Oh, look
at little Harry fly!

524
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,986
Whoo!

525
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,737
Whoo! There he goes!

526
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,239
Whoo!

527
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,116
Whee! Ha-ha-ha.

528
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,409
All right, that's enough.

529
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,952
( crying continues )

530
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,831
( chuckling
maniacally )

531
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,509
This is not reality.

532
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,177
It's an illusion.

533
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,679
When your only reality
is an illusion,

534
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,306
then illusion<i> is</i> a reality.

535
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,144
Like the man said:

536
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:07,400
"The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself."

537
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,528
Oh, I thought we were
gonna be friends.

538
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,946
Didn't want to do
this, Harry.

539
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,407
No, I didn't want
to bring this up

540
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,615
in front of the others,

541
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,077
but I know what
really scares you.

542
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,162
I know when you were nine

543
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,415
and your parents took
you to that colony--

544
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,083
the radiation disaster?

545
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,126
Humanitarian mission?

546
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,003
You visited a hospital!

547
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,255
You remember.

548
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,964
( laughs )

549
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,132
No.

550
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,093
You wandered off
by yourself

551
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,720
where you weren't
supposed to be.

552
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,472
The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

553
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,807
You saw people
and things

554
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,893
you weren't
supposed to see--

555
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,978
sick and dying...

556
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,313
Keep repeating:

557
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,940
"The only thing we
have to fear

558
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,649
is fear itself!"

559
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,194
ALL:
"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself."

560
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,071
And how about:
"There's no place like home!

561
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,822
There's<i> no</i> place
like home!"

562
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,491
( laughing maniacally )

563
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,952
Try clicking your heels
together three times.

564
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,829
Oh, but your legs
are restrained, aren't they?

565
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,874
Just like that little girl
you saw on the operating table?

566
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,086
The doctor called
for a scalpel...

567
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,964
She looked at you,

568
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,008
her face filled
with fear.

569
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,261
Fear...

570
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,054
fear.

571
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,056
Fear.

572
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,142
( shouting ):
Do you remember?

573
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,811
( screaming ):
No!

574
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,563
DOCTOR:
Excuse me.

575
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,565
You're not holding
that properly.

576
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,358
Correct positioning
of the index finger

577
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,693
is necessary
for optimal dexterity.

578
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,987
( scalpel clatters )

579
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,238
Who are you?

580
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,865
I'm Captain Janeway's
representative.

581
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,993
I'm here to negotiate
with you.

582
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,078
Are you well, Mr. Kim?

583
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,205
I'm starting
to feel better.

584
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,582
CLOWN:
You're different.

585
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,542
I don't know anything about you.

586
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,960
You're not on the system.

587
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,630
I would be pleased to tell you
all about myself

588
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,880
at a more appropriate time.

589
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,257
For now, suffice it to say

590
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,468
that I am here
by a miracle of technology.

591
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,761
Now, let's get down
to the issues, shall we?

592
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,514
How am I supposed to negotiate

593
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,557
if I don't know
what you're thinking?

594
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,725
I have a very trustworthy face.

595
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,436
My Captain
is prepared

596
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,355
to give you exactly
what you ask for

597
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,857
under the condition you release
all the hostages.

598
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,108
( spluttering laugh )

599
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,818
Release the hostages?

600
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,196
We would provide continuing
input from a simulated brain.

601
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,323
A computer model
that would generate...

602
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,033
Simulated brain? Simulated?

603
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,493
I myself have a com---

604
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,204
It won't work.
It's a lie. Tell 'em, Harry.

605
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,955
I don't know that
for sure.

606
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,875
Liar! Viorsa! Get over here.

607
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:32,794
Tell him.

608
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,754
It might require
a recalibration

609
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,465
of the optronic pathways.

610
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,091
Liar! After all this time,

611
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,511
do you think
I can't<i> tell</i> when you lie?

612
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,139
The simulated brain...

613
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,683
Would leave me at your mercy!

614
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:48,435
No. They stay.

615
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,646
The Captain is prepared
to risk the lives

616
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,398
of the hostages
rather than leave them

617
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,773
under your control.

618
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,360
Who is<i> she</i> to tell me
what I have to do?

619
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,613
She's the one out there with
the "off" switch in her hand.

620
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,407
She would never kill Harry.

621
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,410
I'd rather die than spend
my life in here with you.

622
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,745
She knows that.

623
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,247
I won't let them go.

624
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,040
A compromise.

625
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,250
Let some of them go.

626
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,501
No.

627
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,211
We've studied your system.

628
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,504
You only need one to survive.

629
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,006
And if that one gets sick
and dies?

630
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,550
No! I need them all.

631
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,051
Now go away!

632
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,596
And tell your Captain Janeway
I'm disappointed.

633
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,055
I expected more from her.

634
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,306
If we could just--

635
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,641
CLOWN:
Go away!

636
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,142
CROWD:
Go away! Go away!

637
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,519
( sighs )

638
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,480
I'll be back.

639
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,023
Go away!

640
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:40,779
CROWD:
Go away! Go away! Go away!

641
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,074
Well, I'm sorry I don't live up
to his expectations.

642
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,909
What's your opinion
of him, doctor?

643
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,202
Unstable...

644
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,704
unpredictable.

645
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,289
Everything you'd
expect from "fear."

646
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,708
Captain, the longer
we allow this to continue,

647
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,084
the more likely it is
that he

648
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,086
will take his frustrations
out on the hostages.

649
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,463
I agree.

650
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,423
And I can't allow that
to happen.

651
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,635
We're going to have to mount
some kind of rescue mission.

652
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,894
Doctor, if we do simply
disconnect the hostages...

653
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,772
There would certainly
be brain damage.

654
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,273
How much damage?

655
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,650
Could you possibly
repair it?

656
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,900
Possibly? Yes.

657
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,360
Would Mr. Kim still be able

658
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,154
to hold his clarinet
when I was done?

659
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,363
Possibly.

660
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,949
The brain is such
an interesting organ.

661
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,785
Could we switch over
to a simulated brain

662
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,119
without The Clown
noticing it?

663
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,704
Oh, he'd notice.

664
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,080
He was very smart to reject

665
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,832
the whole notion
of a simulated brain.

666
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,167
It just wouldn't be the same.

667
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,419
There is no way
an artificial intelligence

668
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,046
can replace actual
brain functions.

669
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,716
I'll choose not to take
that personally, Lieutenant.

670
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,469
For what it's worth, Mr. Viorsa
suggested there would be a way

671
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,138
to make a simulated brain
function in this system.

672
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,683
He suggested it would take...

673
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,769
a "recalibration
of the optronic pathways."

674
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,439
I don't know what he could
have been talking about.

675
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,898
The optronic pathways

676
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,734
have nothing to do
with the neural interface.

677
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,944
It doesn't make any sense.

678
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,237
TUVOK:
Then, perhaps he had

679
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,781
another reason for saying it.

680
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,074
How<i> do</i> the optronic
pathways function

681
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,493
in this system, B'Elanna?

682
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,952
They-- They control

683
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,246
the basic elements
of the environment,

684
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,415
access data banks
that were programmed

685
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,125
when the system
was created.

686
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,049
If we interrupt
the optronic pathways,

687
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,302
we could disassemble
that entire world

688
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,556
and its characters,
piece by piece.

689
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:35,018
If we can't remove the hostages
from the environment,

690
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,521
then we might be able
to remove the environment

691
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,315
from the hostages.

692
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,108
How did Viorsa manage
to communicate this

693
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,736
without The Clown
knowing about it?

694
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,488
Perhaps it was because
The Clown's attention

695
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,906
was divided at the time.

696
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,282
And you're going
to continue

697
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,535
to provide him with
distractions, doctor.

698
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,204
B'Elanna, how long will it take
to block these pathways?

699
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,373
I'm not sure how many there are,
Captain.

700
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,875
And I'll have to do it manually,

701
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,877
because we don't know
how to deprogram the system.

702
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,961
You'll only have
a few minutes at best.

703
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,464
Once "fear" knows
what we're up to,

704
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,174
it'll be a race against time

705
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,510
to save the lives
of those hostages.

706
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,262
Bravo! Bravo!

707
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,513
Go away!

708
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,014
I want to be alone.

709
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,683
You're ruining the festival.

710
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,976
Don't be a poop!

711
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,437
I can't help it.

712
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,938
I'm feeling sorry
for myself.

713
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,190
Well, don't
take it out on us.

714
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,983
Take it out on<i> them.</i>

715
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,362
You people--

716
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,239
you wonderful
people--

717
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,490
my friends...

718
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,658
( sniffles )

719
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,992
You do know
how to make a man

720
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,202
feel better, don't you?

721
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,080
Okay, then, what
shall we play?

722
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,583
The insect game.

723
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,959
Yes, yes.
The insect game.

724
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,172
You again?

725
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,174
You're the one
who ruined my mood.

726
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,135
You and your sweet Captain.

727
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,012
My sweet Captain
has a new offer to make.

728
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,681
No simulated brains.

729
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,266
I want real brains.

730
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,394
The Captain is prepared to give
you...a cloaking device.

731
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,229
I already have
a cloaking device.

732
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,981
Thank you anyway.

733
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,317
DOCTOR:
I'm talking about a device
that would shield you

734
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:09,112
from being detected by any
other interstellar visitors.

735
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,366
(<i> soft theme playing</i> )

736
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,411
( instrument whirring )

737
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,168
There are almost 40 pathways
to disable, Captain,

738
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,837
but I should be able
to get it done

739
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,004
in under two minutes.

740
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,966
Good.
Let's get started.

741
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,050
We will return
your entire computer system

742
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,345
to the subterranean locale
where we found it.

743
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,180
With the help
of Mr. Kim,

744
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,849
and a team of
Starfleet engineers,

745
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,141
it will be
an easy matter

746
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,852
to install
the cloaking device,

747
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,186
which will ensure
your safety

748
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,729
for the foreseeable future.

749
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,397
Harry, is this possible?

750
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,149
Yes.

751
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,985
I don't know
if I believe you.

752
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,653
I don't know<i> yet...</i>

753
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,905
but I'll know soon
if you're telling the truth.

754
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,490
You can't fool me.

755
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,825
( chuckles )

756
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,788
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

757
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,001
What does she want in return?

758
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,460
And don't say the hostages,

759
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,879
because I'm not
giving them up.

760
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,213
You have to understand

761
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,673
that the Captain's
primary concern

762
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,132
is the safety of the hostages.

763
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,552
She's such a warm
and noble person.

764
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,137
I'd love her to come
to one of my parties someday.

765
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,228
What if I promise to take
really good care of my guests?

766
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,230
We could be more
than friends.

767
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,357
We could be...colleagues.

768
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,901
( chuckles )

769
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,152
I'm really not
such a bad fella.

770
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,696
What's happening?

771
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,072
CLOWN:
You tricked me!

772
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,826
It's an attack!
It's an attack!

773
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,119
Red Alert! Red Alert!

774
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,206
You-- You warned them.

775
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,958
You told them how
it could be done!

776
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,126
Take him!

777
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,219
No, please! No!

778
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,020
Twenty-two.

779
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,521
More than halfway
there, B'Elanna.

780
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,481
KES:
Captain, it's Viorsa.

781
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,483
His norepinephrine levels
are rising sharply.

782
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,027
No, please!

783
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,989
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

784
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,078
What is it?

785
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,204
Some kind of
protection device.

786
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,706
I'm locked out.

787
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,374
I'll have to disable it.

788
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:32,213
( taunting shouts and laughter )

789
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,467
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

790
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,848
( grunts )

791
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,642
( growling )

792
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,364
Viorsa's norepinephrine
levels are critical.

793
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,575
Just ten more pathways.

794
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,537
( piercing scream )

795
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:10,418
( all screaming )

796
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,925
( wailing )

797
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,222
( woman screaming )

798
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,058
( steady tone sounds )

799
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,309
He's dead!

800
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,978
Massive heart failure.

801
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,479
( insistent beeping )

802
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,691
Captain, this one's
norepinephrine levels

803
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,775
are approaching critical.

804
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,779
CLOWN:
You're next! You're next!

805
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,072
( Clown laughing )

806
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,782
Restore the entire program.

807
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,286
We've lost.

808
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:49,833
We've won.
We've won. We've won!

809
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,293
Start the music.
Start the music.

810
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:57,549
Celebration.
Celebration. Celebration.

811
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,097
Your decision
to capitulate

812
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,558
saved the lives of the other
hostages, Captain.

813
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,894
You should take some
comfort from that.

814
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,187
I don't.

815
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,858
Have I misjudged him somehow?

816
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:18,987
Is there another way
to reach him?

817
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:25,077
Isn't there more to "fear"
than a simple demand to exist?

818
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,040
Why do people enjoy
dangerous sports

819
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,459
or holodeck adventures
with the safety off?

820
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,546
Why, after all these centuries,

821
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,049
do children still ride
on roller coasters?

822
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,467
Fear can provide
pleasure.

823
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,261
To seek fear is to seek

824
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,598
the boundaries of one's
sensory experience.

825
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,643
But what does fear seek...

826
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,813
at the end of the ride?

827
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,733
( raucous music
playing over speakers )

828
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,243
You understand,
don't you, Harry,

829
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,660
that we will have
to punish you

830
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,162
for your Captain's
little trick?

831
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,663
To the winner go the spoils,

832
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,208
and you are the spoils,
after all.

833
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,500
We can talk
about that later.

834
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,502
For now, enjoy yourself.

835
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,089
( music and laughter stop )

836
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,339
Well, you
certainly know

837
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,674
how to bring
a party to a halt.

838
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,635
I don't get out very much.

839
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,053
CLOWN:
I bet.

840
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,805
The Captain has sent me
with an ultimatum.

841
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,766
Ultimatum? Ultimatum.

842
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,726
<i>She</i> would give<i> me</i> an ultimatum?

843
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,645
( all laughing heartily )

844
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,481
Did Napoleon give an ultimatum
<i>after</i> Waterloo?

845
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,858
Did Chulak of Romulus
give an ultimatum

846
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,401
after his defeat
at Galorndon Core?

847
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,322
<i>We</i> won. We give
the ultimatums around here.

848
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,449
The Captain is prepared
to shut down the system

849
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,409
one minute from now,
if you don't agree to her terms.

850
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,996
And scramble the brains of all
my guests, including Harry?

851
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,330
I don't think so.

852
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,873
Fifty-two seconds.

853
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,125
She is willing
to risk

854
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,876
brain damage
to the hostages,

855
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,629
but she will end this, and end
this now, one way or another.

856
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,923
What are her-- her terms?

857
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,758
Forty-three seconds.

858
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,760
She will allow you to keep
one person on the system.

859
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,345
The other hostages
must be released.

860
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,554
One?

861
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,931
Never! I won't agree.

862
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,267
You have 30 seconds
to avoid termination.

863
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,687
I need more time...
time to think.

864
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,730
Two. Let me keep two.

865
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,692
Twenty seconds.
There is another provision.

866
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,443
The one hostage
you will be allowed to keep

867
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,279
is Captain Janeway herself.

868
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,033
She...would choose
to be with me?

869
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,284
Your time is up.

870
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,618
Your answer, please.

871
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,205
Yes.

872
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,915
<i>Captain, this is the doctor.</i>

873
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,834
<i>I've returned to Sickbay.</i>

874
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,545
<i>Please turn to your emergency</i>
<i>medical holographic channel.</i>

875
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,921
Did he accept?

876
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,131
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

877
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,008
Perfect. Good
work, doctor.

878
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,510
<i>Would you like me</i>
<i>to return and supervise</i>

879
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,387
<i>the evacuation of the hostages?</i>

880
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,223
I don't think that'll be
necessary, but you could

881
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,350
help with the preparations
at this end. Janeway out.

882
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,976
B'ELANNA:
We're finished here, Captain.

883
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,186
Initiate the recall subroutine

884
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,729
and prepare to begin
resuscitation.

885
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,481
Kes, give me a hand
getting hooked up to all this.

886
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:04,777
( haunting music playing
over speakers )

887
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,154
CLOWN:
Sparkling.

888
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,406
I want everything sparkling
for her arrival.

889
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,657
Sparkling. Ha-ha-ha.

890
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,492
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

891
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,119
Harry, not so fast.

892
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,621
They can't have<i> you</i>
until I have<i> her.</i>

893
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,915
No more tricks.

894
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,759
She's coming.

895
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,846
I can feel the system
beginning to scan her brain.

896
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,472
Hmm...this really

897
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,809
is such an extraordinary
gesture she's making.

898
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,937
I am so moved.

899
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,313
( blows nose )

900
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,816
You don't quite believe it
yourself, do you?

901
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,985
The Captain would
sacrifice herself

902
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,028
to save the hostages.

903
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,780
<i>Sacrifice</i>
herself?

904
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,532
You can be so cruel, Harry.

905
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,451
You don't appreciate
my hospitality.

906
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:58,123
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

907
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,092
You're here.

908
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,136
You're actually here.

909
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,012
I don't believe it.

910
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,391
The arrangement was that
the others would be released.

911
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,059
You show remarkable trust,
Captain.

912
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,228
How could you be so sure
I would keep my word?

913
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,355
I've known fear.

914
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:25,024
It's a very healthy thing
most of the time.

915
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,235
You warn us of danger,

916
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,569
remind us of our limits,

917
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,696
protect us
from carelessness.

918
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,950
I've learned
to trust fear.

919
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,413
Finally, someone
who appreciates me.

920
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,664
Am I blushing?

921
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,124
Let them go.

922
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,792
Yes. Yes, of course.

923
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,169
You may depart.

924
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,962
Farewell, my friends.

925
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,131
Do come back
and visit.

926
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,383
I'll always be here.

927
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,845
( gasps )

928
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,888
The recall subroutine
has been activated.

929
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,307
Body temperatures
are rising.

930
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,392
Initiating
all backup systems.

931
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,478
The hostages should
regain consciousness

932
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,687
in less than ten minutes.

933
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,730
We'll get you out
of here, Captain.

934
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,898
I promise.

935
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,193
That won't be
necessary, Mr. Kim,

936
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,527
but thank you.

937
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,991
I can't wait
to get to know you...

938
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,493
to make you a part of me.

939
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:19,620
As I understand it,
it takes a few minutes

940
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,580
before you become aware
of my thoughts.

941
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,166
Is that true?

942
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,210
An eternity of anticipation.

943
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,919
And then what happens?

944
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,005
And then the fun begins.

945
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,383
All systems functioning
as anticipated.

946
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:34,093
Resuscitation
entering final warming.

947
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,262
Bio-functions
are returning to normal.

948
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,014
Their own hearts
are taking over.

949
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,975
They don't need supplemental
life support any longer.

950
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,186
Would you be
honest with me?

951
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,980
Fear is the most honest
of all emotions, Captain.

952
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,192
You really want
this to end

953
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,943
as much as I do,
don't you?

954
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,447
Now, now, don't even think
about leaving.

955
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:57,409
I'm not going to let you go--
not after all this.

956
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,744
Mirror?

957
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,747
Don't we make a beautiful
couple, Captain?

958
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,707
I'm not Captain Janeway.

959
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,835
Could have fooled me.

960
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,462
I'm afraid I did.

961
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,381
Pardon?

962
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,798
I'm nothing more

963
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,717
than a holographic image
of Captain Janeway,

964
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,470
sent here by the same
technique they used

965
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,055
to send their doctor.

966
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,099
I've been programmed
to respond to you

967
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,600
as Kathryn Janeway would.

968
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,728
But-- But-- I-I feel you.

969
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,188
Y-you're on the system.

970
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:33,027
She is on the system,
yes, but not in stasis.

971
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,988
Captain Janeway and her
crew modified the pods,

972
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,740
so that she could be
connected to the system

973
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,452
without having to enter
this environment.

974
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,828
The goal was to let you
sense her brain activity

975
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,457
without putting her
in actual jeopardy.

976
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:46,916
You will be able
to confirm

977
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,293
what I'm telling you

978
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,336
as soon as you become
aware of her thoughts.

979
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,315
You know as well as I do

980
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,443
that fear only exists
for one purpose--

981
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:14,693
to be conquered.

982
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,279
She tricked me.

983
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,822
Did she?

984
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:21,742
Or was a part of you actually
hoping to be defeated?

985
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,579
Isn't that why you allowed
Captain Janeway to come here?

986
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,913
Because you sensed

987
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,458
she had the power
to subdue you?

988
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,543
No.

989
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,128
She lied.

990
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,422
It was very un-Starfleet of her.

991
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:38,384
Starfleet Captains
don't easily succumb...to fear.

992
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:44,974
What will become of us?

993
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,435
Of me?

994
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:53,024
Like all fear,
you eventually...vanish.

995
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,777
I'm afraid.

996
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,447
I know.

997
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,200
Drat.

998
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,251
