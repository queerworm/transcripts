00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,090
[Janeway] <i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54208.3.</i>

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,344
<i>Last month's datastream</i>
<i>from Starfleet never arrived,</i>

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,095
<i>so the crew is looking</i>
<i>forward to this one</i>

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,348
<i>with even more anticipation</i>
<i>than usual.</i>

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,725
<i>We could all use</i>
<i>some news from home.</i>

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,523
Ah. There he is,
the man of the hour.

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,107
You sure are in a good mood.

8
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,653
Well, rumor has it you snared
the latest datastream last night.

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,614
Technically, it was this morning--
0200 to be exact.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,909
- So where's my mail?
- Hmm?

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,911
Oh. Don't tell me
you lost another one.

12
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,038
I didn't lose
last month's datastream.

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,289
It never arrived.

14
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,958
- So what's the holdup this time?
- [sighs]

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,752
The transmission was
a little larger than usual.

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,003
It's jammed the transceiver.

17
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:48,006
Seven and I have been up
all night trying to download it.

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,174
Harry...

19
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,093
we can't go another month
without mail.

20
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,845
Oh, you won't. Trust me.

21
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,015
[sarcastic chuckle]

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,103
Any luck?

23
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,772
I've determined why
we've been having difficulties.

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,192
[beeping]

25
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,027
A hologram.

26
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,490
The transceiver wasn't designed
to store photonic data.

27
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,368
We have to get it out of there
before it degrades.

28
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,620
What are you doing?

29
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,123
Tying the transceiver into
the holodeck's pattern buffer.

30
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,167
Those systems aren't compatible.
You'll depolarize the relays.

31
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,754
Starfleet wouldn't have sent
this hologram if it weren't important.

32
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,132
I'm sure it's worth
a few burnt-out relays.

33
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,342
[electricity snaps]
[alerts bleeping]

34
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,637
You've overloaded
the transceiver.

35
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,682
But I saved the hologram.

36
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,438
Okay, ready when you are.

37
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,028
Lieutenant Barclay?

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,447
Uh, no, but he did design me.

39
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,199
I'm a walking, talking,
problem-solving interactive hologram.

40
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,327
You can call me Reg.

41
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,203
It's nice to meet you, Reg.

42
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,872
The pleasure's mine, Captain.

43
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,665
Harry, Seven...

44
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,500
I've been looking forward
to working with you.

45
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,793
- You have?
- I know--

46
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,296
You were expecting letters
from your friends and families.

47
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,715
But with any luck,
in a few days,

48
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,344
you'll be seeing them
face-to-face.

49
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,704
In three days' time,

50
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,082
Voyager is going to be
passing through Grid 898--

51
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,669
a sector of space occupied
by a red giant star.

52
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,546
Sensors detected it
a few days ago.

53
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,798
At this very moment,
a team of Federation scientists

54
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,843
is orbiting another red giant
in the Alpha Quadrant.

55
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,181
In 72 hours, they will target
its magnetic field

56
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:29,102
with a verteron beam,
creating a geodesic fold.

57
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,855
As a result,
a corresponding fold will open here

58
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,525
in the magnetic field of the red giant
that Voyager is approaching.

59
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,446
Space will be punctured...
these two points

60
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,033
creating a gateway
between the quadrants.

61
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,203
Our shields are useless
against geodesic radiation.

62
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,206
We toyed with the idea
of opening a fold ourselves,

63
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,917
but it didn't take us long to realize
we wouldn't survive the trip.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,629
A lot's happened in geodesic research
since you've been gone.

65
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,380
I've brought schematics
for shield upgrades

66
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,758
to deflect the radiation
from the fold,

67
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,969
medical technology to provide
additional protection for the crew.

68
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,262
We've thought of everything.

69
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,432
Starfleet never mentioned you
in any of the previous datastreams.

70
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,477
Well, Lieutenant Barclay
didn't want to raise your hopes,

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,646
in case the plan
didn't live up to expectation,

72
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,773
but lucky for you,
it surpassed them.

73
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,900
What about
last month's datastream?

74
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,527
Why didn't we receive it?

75
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,364
Pathfinder tried sending
an unabridged version of my program.

76
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,782
It overloaded the MIDAS Array.

77
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,368
And the only casualty this time
was our transceiver.

78
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,079
If everything goes according to plan,
you won't need it anymore.

79
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,000
If we were to attempt this,

80
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,378
you'd need access
to areas of this ship

81
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,296
that aren't equipped
with holo-emitters.

82
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,968
Not to worry, Captain.
We've thought of that, too.

83
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,679
My emitter is your emitter.

84
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,141
Computer, transfer the Barclay
hologram to the mobile emitter.

85
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,936
- [beeping]
- [Computer] Transfer complete.

86
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,981
On Lieutenant Barclay's
behalf, I thank you.

87
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,900
Just make sure to return it
when we get to Earth. [chuckling]

88
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,194
[Chakotay] We're ready for you
in the briefing room, Captain.

89
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,238
Excuse us, Doctor.

90
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,867
I'm sure you have a full day planned,
but if you have time,

91
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,367
I'd like to get
better acquainted.

92
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,704
I'll stop by
the first chance I get.

93
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,913
You'll know where to find me.

94
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,750
This is our destination--
Red Giant 23139.

95
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,461
The geodesic fold
will open here,

96
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,297
adjacent to the giant's
northern pole.

97
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,134
We'll have exactly 16 seconds
to take Voyager through.

98
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,927
Reg has prepared
a list of assignments.

99
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,387
I expect you to give him
your full cooperation.

100
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,558
Mr. Paris, you have the honor
of plotting our course to Big Red 2.

101
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,768
Lieutenant Torres,
Commander Tuvok,

102
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,563
I'd like you to start working
on shield modifications.

103
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,523
And in the meantime,
I've asked the Doctor

104
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,066
to prepare a series
of inoculations

105
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,277
that will protect the crew
from the radiation.

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,778
We should discuss
the possibility

107
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,405
of applying Borg technology
to Starfleet's plan.

108
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,159
It could increase
our chances of success.

109
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,453
I look forward to hearing
your thoughts.

110
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,288
How long before
the transceiver's back on line?

111
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,956
No more than two hours.

112
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,667
Then we'll still have time
to transmit a response to Starfleet.

113
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,085
Keep us posted.

114
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,419
I'd like to send
Lieutenant Barclay

115
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,255
a little thank-you note
for all his hard work.

116
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,799
Um, uh, is there...

117
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,384
is there anything
I can do, Reg?

118
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,387
Your job might be
the most important one of all.

119
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,097
The next few days
will be difficult.

120
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,892
The crew will be working
extremely long hours.

121
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,769
They're going to need an
experienced Morale Officer

122
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,103
to keep their spirits high.

123
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,813
You can count on me.

124
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,567
If this were any other ship...

125
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,112
I'd have my doubts.

126
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,782
But this is Voyager,
"the miracle ship."

127
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,827
You've survived six years
in the Delta Quadrant.

128
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,706
You've evaded the Kazon,
the Vidiians, the Hirogen.

129
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,375
You've even faced down the Borg.

130
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,419
I think, with a little teamwork,

131
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,090
we can pull off one more miracle
and take Voyager home.

132
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,635
I can taste
my mom's cooking.

133
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,221
Don't forget what
the hologram said, Harry:

134
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,974
- "This is Voyager".
- "The miracle ship"!

135
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,226
Uh, not when it comes
to getting us home.

136
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,354
Our shortcuts have a tendency
to blow up in our faces.

137
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,106
Well, that's looking
on the bright side.

138
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,443
Well, remember Arturis
and his quantum slipstream drive?

139
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,614
Or, um, or how about
the telepathic pitcher plant

140
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,574
that made us think
we were on our way home

141
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,243
right before it tried
to eat the ship.

142
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,912
This is the best opportunity
we've had.

143
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,373
Yeah, which is why we'll probably
end up in the Gamma Quadrant.

144
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,458
I'll remind you of that
when we get back to Earth.

145
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,918
Don't say I didn't warn you.

146
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,546
[Seven] When a Borg cube
enters a transwarp conduit,

147
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,423
it's subject to extreme
gravimetric shear.

148
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,260
To compensate, the Borg project
a structural integrity field

149
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,636
ahead of the cube.

150
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,221
By modifying
Voyager's deflector,

151
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,181
we may be able
to do the same.

152
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,726
No one at Starfleet
would have thought of this.

153
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,688
So, what's the first thing

154
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,356
you're going to do
when you get back?

155
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,150
Begin repairs to Voyager.

156
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,027
Even with the structural
integrity field,

157
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,446
it's likely the ship
will suffer significant damage.

158
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,449
Yes, but, I mean, there are
people at Utopia Planitia

159
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,867
who will take care of that.

160
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,285
There are engineering crews
and technicians...

161
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,454
Are you implying that
I am superfluous?

162
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,955
Of course not.

163
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,291
I only meant that if
you're too busy working,

164
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,669
you're going to miss all
the "welcome home" hoopla.

165
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,297
Starfleet's planning parties.

166
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,715
They'll have ceremonies
and speeches.

167
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,677
There, there's a ticker-tape
parade down Market Street.

168
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,763
I won't be attending
any of those events.

169
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,932
But you'd be
the guest of honor.

170
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,978
When I first arrived
on Voyager,

171
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,315
it was difficult
for the crew to accept me.

172
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,484
I'm anticipating
a similar welcome on Earth.

173
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,532
You don't have
any idea, do you?

174
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,744
I didn't mention this earlier.

175
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,954
I didn't want to hurt
anybody's feelings...

176
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,206
but you are the one

177
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,000
who people are most
looking forward to seeing.

178
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,877
That's difficult to believe.

179
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,338
- Why?
- I was Borg.

180
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,756
Exactly.

181
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,009
You <i>were </i>Borg,
but you escaped.

182
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,011
And despite incredible odds,

183
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,098
you managed to reclaim
your humanity.

184
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,683
No one's ever done that before.
You're famous.

185
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,936
Fame is irrelevant.

186
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,896
Maybe...

187
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,523
but you've given hope

188
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,150
to everyone who's ever
lost somebody to the Borg.

189
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,530
You've inspired millions.

190
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,620
If you think my participation
in the "hoopla"

191
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,207
would be beneficial to others,
then I'll comply.

192
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,515
Is this going to take
much longer, Reg?

193
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,851
Well, the computer
is still inputting data.

194
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,936
That should do it.

195
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,315
All right. Computer,
display the intended trajectory

196
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,734
of the datastream transmitted
at 0600 this morning.

197
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,659
Now, display the actual trajectory
and identify the termination point.

198
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,829
[Computer] <i>The trajectory</i>
<i>ends in Sector 395...</i>

199
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,497
42, Grid 8.

200
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,916
[sighs]
Does that sound familiar?

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,586
That's exactly where the datastream
dissipated last month.

202
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,005
There <i>is </i>something there.

203
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,592
There is something preventing
the datastream from reaching Voyager.

204
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,469
Uh, a micro-wormhole,
a radiogenic field...

205
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,181
Long-range scans
didn't pick up anything unusual.

206
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,351
Well, still, we could send
a ship to investigate.

207
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,811
We could confirm my theory.

208
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,605
What about <i>my </i>theory, Reg?

209
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,899
The hologram
was too complex.

210
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,650
It caused the data streams
to degrade

211
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,485
before they reached
their destination.

212
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,154
Well, to be honest,

213
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,741
I... I don't agree.

214
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,203
The truth is, we don't know
what happened to my hologram.

215
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,788
Then let's stick
to what we do know.

216
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,665
For the second month
in a row,

217
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,834
we tried sending
your hologram to Voyager.

218
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,337
And for the second month
in a row, it failed to get there.

219
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,422
And I want to know why,
so it doesn't happen a third time.

220
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,050
It won't happen a third time.

221
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,429
Next month, we go back
to standard transmissions.

222
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,057
But a holographic matrix
carries twice the information,

223
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,433
interact with the crew...

224
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,019
Admiral Paris wants us
to send more practical data,

225
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,688
like tactical upgrades,
letters from the crew's families.

226
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,814
But, Pete...

227
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,733
Sending a hologram to Voyager
was a good idea,

228
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,361
but it didn't work.

229
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,030
It's time to move on.

230
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,082
And this is
the research lab,

231
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,877
where most of Pathfinder's
homework gets done.

232
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,338
All the datastreams
are compressed here

233
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,925
and then transmitted all the way
to the Delta Quadrant.

234
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,677
Your teacher tells me
you've been studying

235
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,262
some of the Delta
Quadrant races

236
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,180
that Voyager
has described to us.

237
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,682
Who can name one for me?

238
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,267
The Talaxians.

239
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,393
Very good.

240
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,644
The Ocampa.

241
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,812
That's right. Who else?

242
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,356
[Barclay]
The Borg! The Borg!

243
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,817
They assimilated my hologram.
That's how it disappeared.

244
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,026
Reg, now isn't the time.

245
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,528
Look at this-- last month,

246
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,447
a spacecraft passed within 20 meters
of the MIDAS Array,

247
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,408
just hours before
we sent the first hologram.

248
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,743
- What is your point?
- 20 meters.

249
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,412
It's awfully close,
don't you think?

250
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,163
- Ensign--
- Look, the Borg must have sent

251
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,916
a transwarp probe
to steal my hologram.

252
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,086
Maybe because they-- they thought
that it was carrying

253
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,338
anti-Borg technology
to Voyager.

254
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,299
It wasn't the Borg, Reg.

255
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,634
Then it was the Romulans
using a cloaked ship.

256
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,636
They've been curious
about Voyager for years...

257
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,929
- That is enough.
- But, you...

258
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,349
I am sorry your idea
didn't work,

259
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,184
but I can't have you
going off on a tangent.

260
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,894
Not again.

261
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,897
You'll be no good
to Pathfinder or Voyager.

262
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,569
How much leave
do you have saved up?

263
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,530
Not that much.

264
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,949
50... maybe 60 days.

265
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,368
Take a week, go home.
Try to relax.

266
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,329
- But, Pete...
- No.

267
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,372
That was not a request, Lieutenant.

268
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,546
Maybe I'll go somewhere...

269
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,258
take a vacation.

270
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,096
Now that is the most sensible thing
I've heard you say all day.

271
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,683
My cousin has
a beach house in Malaysia.

272
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,769
She'd be happy
to lend it to you.

273
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:19,525
Thanks, um, but I have
someplace else in mind.

274
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,036
You, you wanted to see me?

275
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,122
I've been going over
the instructions from Starfleet Medical.

276
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,585
As far as I can tell, their "new"
inoculations aren't much different

277
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,088
from run-of-the-mill
radiogenic vaccines.

278
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,298
I don't think
they'll protect the crew.

279
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,550
Did you try incorporating
a synthetic antigen?

280
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,054
Yes, but it only improved
the resistance by 10 percent.

281
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,514
That should be enough.

282
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,101
[sighs] We can't afford
to be cavalier, Reg.

283
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:57,105
If these treatments don't work,
the crew will wind up liquefied.

284
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,940
You're forgetting
that the inoculations

285
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,358
aren't designed
to work alone.

286
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,193
They were intended to work
in combination

287
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,903
with the shield modifications.

288
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,572
It's the medicinal "ying"
to the shields' "yang."

289
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,742
A-and what if the "yang"
doesn't work?

290
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,285
That's not going to happen.

291
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:15,998
Now, listen, Lieutenant Barclay
has a special affinity for this crew.

292
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,125
So do I.

293
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,002
I promise you,
we won't let them down.

294
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,672
Of course you won't.

295
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,798
Tell me...

296
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,218
do you also share
Lieutenant Barclay's affinity for golf?

297
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,511
[laughs]

298
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,138
We have identical handicaps.

299
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,181
Well, if you're not busy later,

300
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,392
perhaps we could play nine holes
on the holodeck.

301
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,602
Eh, it's tempting, but I still have

302
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,521
a few dozen
progress reports to look over.

303
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,064
Well, in that case,

304
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,816
maybe you could
look over them here,

305
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,527
so that I could borrow
the mobile emitter.

306
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,196
Providing that the rest
of the day's work goes smoothly,

307
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,198
- consider it yours.
- I...

308
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,619
I thought it <i>was </i>mine.

309
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,956
Commander Chakotay tells me

310
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,083
that you finished
repairing the transceiver.

311
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,336
We were just about to send
the Captain's reply to Lieutenant Barclay.

312
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,089
Do you have enough room
to include a progress report from me?

313
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,091
I think we can squeeze that in.

314
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,806
Computer, download Barclay Hologram
File 01 to the data block.

315
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,184
[Computer]
<i>Download complete.</i>

316
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,936
Transmitting.

317
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,339
[beeping]

318
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,926
It's about time.

319
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,470
[Janeway] <i>Greetings from</i>
<i>the Delta Quadrant, Lieutenant.</i>

320
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,389
You'll be happy to know that
your hologram reached us safely...

321
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,558
Get to the important part.

322
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,356
In accordance with the
74th Rule of Acquisition,

323
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,815
"Knowledge Equals Profit",

324
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,902
I've enclosed the specifications
you've requested.

325
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,028
See you soon.

326
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,907
Oh, look at those hands.

327
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,784
I bet she gives great oo-mox.

328
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,495
Too bad she'll be dead
when she gets here.

329
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,705
Forget the hands.

330
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,791
Show me the nanoprobes.

331
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,837
How many are there?

332
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,464
3.6 million.

333
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,634
That's 20 percent more
than we predicted.

334
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,721
3.6 million nanoprobes
at six bars of latinum per unit.

335
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,223
Uh, that comes to...

336
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,810
More profit than
we ever dreamed of.

337
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,063
[all laughing]

338
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,533
[laughing and conversing]

339
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,752
Your drink, sir.

340
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,754
Thank you.

341
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,840
Thank you.

342
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,558
Something to drink,
ma'am?

343
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,811
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Are you sure?

344
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,231
I've got a chocolate passion punch
with your name on it.

345
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,399
[laughing]

346
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,358
Reg?

347
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:30,985
Surprise.

348
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,822
Where's Commander Riker?

349
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,284
- He doesn't arrive until Friday.
- Oh.

350
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,161
The question is,
what are you doing here?

351
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,996
Just had some time off.

352
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,749
Your letter made this place
sound fun,

353
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,001
and just thought I'd join you.

354
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,212
Do you have any idea
how inappropriate it is

355
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,298
to follow your therapist
on vacation?

356
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,300
Please.

357
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,593
They might be watching.

358
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,428
Who?

359
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,515
The Borg, the Romulans.
I'm not sure yet.

360
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,309
Please...

361
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,646
Deanna, I need your help.

362
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,192
Commander Harkins is usually
willing to hear me out,

363
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,235
but this time, he wouldn't even
look at my evidence.

364
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,239
I'm not sure any of this
qualifies as evidence, Reg.

365
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,824
You don't believe me, either.

366
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,409
You think I'm imagining this?

367
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,953
Just like Pete?

368
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,335
The last time I saw you,
you were laughing, telling jokes.

369
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,129
You even sang a duet
with Data.

370
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,714
[laughing]

371
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,050
That was Commander La Forge's
birthday party.

372
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,720
You were a completely
different Reg that night.

373
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,390
Oh... things were better then.

374
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,392
- How?
- Well, for one thing

375
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,769
I had just finished the matrix
for my hologram,

376
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,772
and I showed Geordi
some of the specs that night.

377
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,691
He said he was proud of me.

378
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,817
What else?

379
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,738
Oh... the Dragons
had just won the pennant,

380
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,992
and I was still seeing Leosa.

381
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,953
You mentioned her at the party.

382
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,079
A teacher, right?

383
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,626
Everything was going so well--
my job, my personal life.

384
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,714
I started to think
maybe my luck was changing.

385
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,676
- And then you lost your hologram.
- [yells]

386
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,931
Admiral Paris was furious.

387
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,268
He said we'd-- we'd wasted
a transmission to Voyager.

388
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,437
Pete talked him into
giving us another chance,

389
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,439
but there was so much
pressure after that.

390
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,899
Did it put a strain
on your relationship with Leosa?

391
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,026
- She left me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

392
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,237
I went to her apartment.
She was gone.

393
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,531
There was no furniture,
no forwarding address,

394
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,700
not even a "Dear Reg" letter.

395
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,577
That must have been
very upsetting.

396
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,579
Mmm.
It's just my luck, right?

397
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,789
Lose the hologram
and the girl.

398
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,667
[Troi]
Tell me more about Leosa.

399
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,627
Oh. You would have
liked her.

400
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,672
She was sweet,
she was thoughtful

401
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,508
and such
a wonderful listener.

402
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,469
She would let me--
let me go on for hours.

403
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,595
[chuckles]

404
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,180
What did you talk about?

405
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,225
Oh. She was fascinated
by my work at Pathfinder

406
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,351
and, uh...

407
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,813
she didn't, uh...

408
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,108
she didn't find
any of it boring.

409
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,488
She made me feel...
interesting.

410
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:24,158
What do you feel
when we talk about her now?

411
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,871
Um, sadness, I suppose.

412
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,248
A little confusion.

413
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,044
I'm sensing
something else...

414
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,379
something beneath
the surface.

415
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,506
What?

416
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,342
I think you might be
sensing it, too.

417
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,468
What?

418
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,261
Suspicion, Reg.

419
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,514
You suspect her of something.

420
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,392
I suspect that she's happier
without me, if that's what you mean.

421
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:55,147
You think Leosa had something to do
with your disappearing hologram,

422
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,733
but you can't bring yourself
to admit it.

423
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:02,154
That's why you're projecting
your suspicions onto others.

424
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,739
You're in denial.

425
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:11,163
If there's any chance Leosa
did breach Pathfinder security,

426
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,040
you need to tell
your superiors.

427
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,876
I-- I'd be humiliated... again.

428
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,921
I'll go with you.

429
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,257
What about your vacation?

430
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,510
I'll be back here
before Will arrives.

431
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,055
Do you really think it's possible

432
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:32,685
that Leosa stole my hologram?

433
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,146
Why would she do that?

434
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,527
Maybe... maybe she wanted
something to remember me by.

435
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,532
[Janeway]
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

436
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,701
<i>With the help</i>
<i>of the Barclay hologram,</i>

437
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,745
<i>we've nearly completed</i>
<i>the modifications to Voyager.</i>

438
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:56,500
<i>As for Reg, he's becoming</i>
<i>extremely popular with the crew.</i>

439
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,252
[Janeway's voice]
Imagine my disappointment

440
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,006
when I discovered that Lieutenant Paris
had eaten all the scrambled eggs.

441
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,132
[laughter]

442
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,801
It was pure,
unadulterated gluttony,

443
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,013
gastronomic conduct
unbecoming a Starfleet officer.

444
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,808
He knows it's my favorite breakfast,
but he ate them anyway.

445
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,352
We have an egg-mergency
here, people.

446
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,148
I want to know
what you plan to do about it.

447
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,693
Maybe I can replicate
some more, Captain.

448
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,445
Do it.

449
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,447
[applause and laughter]

450
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,868
[normal voice] Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

451
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,331
He's not only programmed
to get us home, he does impressions.

452
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,124
You see, it's always bothered
Lieutenant Barclay

453
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,918
that he was uncomfortable
in large groups.

454
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,755
So he designed me
to be the life of the party.

455
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,298
[laughter]

456
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,633
I hope he's not too shy.

457
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,968
He's going to have 150 new friends
when we get back home.

458
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,347
If we get home, Harry, if.

459
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,932
Pardon my friend here.

460
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,099
He's convinced we're destined

461
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,477
to live out our days
in the Delta Quadrant.

462
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,146
[Tuvok's voice]
Your pessimism is illogical.

463
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,191
Perhaps a mind-meld would help
to alleviate your concern.

464
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,484
[laughter]

465
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,569
[Doctor]
<i>Sickbay to Reg.</i>

466
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,154
<i>Please report to Holodeck 2.</i>

467
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,323
On my way.

468
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,957
I was starting to think
you'd forgotten our tee time.

469
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,292
So, what'll it be?

470
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,796
Pebble Beach at sunset?
The back nine at Gedi Prime?

471
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,922
Actually, Doctor...

472
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,424
I'm afraid
something's come up.

473
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,176
I'm going to meet
with Seven of Nine.

474
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,386
Oh, really?

475
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,888
She's going to teach me
to play Kadis-Kot.

476
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,765
Uh, Reg...

477
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,392
when I agreed
to lend you my emitter,

478
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,228
I did it with the understanding
that you needed it for official business.

479
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,604
What's your point?

480
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,692
My point is that board games
aren't exactly crucial to your mission.

481
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,861
And I suppose golf is?

482
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,364
Reg...

483
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,202
I'll tell you what.

484
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,870
When we get back home,

485
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,956
we'll play as much golf
as you like.

486
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,418
Until then, let's try to keep out
of each other's hair.

487
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,336
What do you say?

488
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,220
[Admiral Paris]
State your name for the record.

489
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,265
Leosa.

490
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,307
L-e-o

491
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,434
s-a.

492
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,436
Occupation?

493
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,271
Dabo girl.

494
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,897
[Paris]
Dabo?

495
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,441
It's a Ferengi game.

496
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,735
I work aboard
one of their casino ships.

497
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,154
You-- You told me
you were a teacher.

498
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,197
Is this true?

499
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,659
Sometimes I'm a teacher.

500
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,704
Sometimes I'm a Bajoran vedek.
[laughs]

501
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,581
Whatever the customer wants.

502
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,958
Lieutenant Barclay tells me
that the two of you

503
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,711
have spent a significant amount
of time together.

504
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,756
Did he ever discuss his work
at Pathfinder with you?

505
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,508
Oh. Wouldn't talk about
anything else.

506
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:56,597
It was always holograms this
and cyclic pulsars that.

507
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,349
And who did you share
that information with?

508
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,685
Nobody.

509
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,896
I have a theory.

510
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,690
Would you like to hear it?

511
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,651
Why not?

512
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,779
I think that some
of your Ferengi friends

513
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,448
found a way to profit
from Lieutenant Barclay's work.

514
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,785
I think you were encouraged

515
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,453
to get close to him,

516
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,998
and when you had all
the information you needed,

517
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,500
you left him.

518
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:28,170
I left Reg
for one simple reason.

519
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,214
He's boring.

520
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,969
[door opens, closes]

521
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,806
Don't tell me you never noticed.

522
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,684
With the Admiral's permission,

523
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,853
I'd like a moment alone
with Leosa.

524
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,399
I don't think therapy is what
this woman needs, Counselor.

525
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,318
Five minutes, Admiral.

526
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,696
Five minutes.

527
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,242
[door opens]

528
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,413
[door closes]

529
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,800
Did you know
I'm a Betazoid?

530
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,468
I'm empathic,

531
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:20,139
which means I know
when people are lying.

532
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,435
Tell me, what's the longest
you've ever been incarcerated?

533
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,896
[laughs]

534
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,899
You can't send me
to prison, Counselor.

535
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,734
I didn't do anything wrong.

536
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:38,740
Maybe not, but I can order you
held for psychiatric observation.

537
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,869
Extended observation.

538
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:47,332
I may not be a Betazoid
but I work a dabo table,

539
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,878
and I know
when somebody's bluffing.

540
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,258
Try me.

541
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,518
You were correct, Admiral.

542
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,189
The Ferengi did steal
Reg's hologram-- twice.

543
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,941
This is the ship
you need to look for.

544
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,203
[Leosa]
That's it.

545
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,080
That's Nunk's ship.

546
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,754
- Nunk?
- My... employer.

547
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,423
Scans indicate they've been
in the vicinity

548
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,967
of that star
for the last 43 hours.

549
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,093
Why?

550
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,221
I don't know.

551
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,556
She's telling
the truth...

552
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,974
for once.

553
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,060
The Ferengi wouldn't
have stolen the hologram

554
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,103
if they didn't think
it was valuable.

555
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,106
They're probably waiting
to rendezvous with a buyer.

556
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,193
Are there any Starfleet ships
in that area?

557
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,403
The Carolina is
.7 light-years away.

558
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,822
At maximum warp,
it could reach them in two hours.

559
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,616
Open a channel.

560
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,037
Computer, open a secure channel
to the Carolina.

561
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,124
[Paris] Tell Captain Peterson
to adjust his course immediately.

562
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,172
Was everything that happened
between us a lie?

563
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,050
Not everything.

564
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,594
Just the parts where I expressed
affection for you.

565
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,720
[groans]

566
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,139
Oh...

567
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,811
if it makes any difference,
it wasn't personal.

568
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,938
It was just... business.

569
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,150
What exactly is a broken heart
worth these days, hmm?

570
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,779
Ten percent.

571
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,906
Of what?

572
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,033
Profits from
the nanoprobes.

573
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,661
- Nanoprobes?
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,038
- Borg nanoprobes?
- Yeah.

575
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:54,126
Gegis says they're worth
two billion times their weight in latinum.

576
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,460
Oh.

577
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,637
I don't think I quite understand
the problem, Doctor.

578
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,807
Are you aware that he's been
doing impressions of you?

579
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,976
You should hear
his Tuvok-- it's eerie.

580
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,102
It's disrespectful.

581
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,854
What do you want me
to do, deactivate him?

582
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,189
Just long enough to run
a diagnostic of his program.

583
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,151
His recent behavior may be indicative
of a more serious problem.

584
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,861
I haven't seen
any evidence of that.

585
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,197
Of course not.
In front of you, he's all smiles,

586
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:29,077
but I've seen him be...
rude and careless,

587
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,580
two traits the real
Lieutenant Barclay never exhibited.

588
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,458
I know the real Barclay
is a friend of yours,

589
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,418
and I'm sorry
if the holographic version

590
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,961
hasn't lived up
to your expectations,

591
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,339
but that's hardly reason
to deactivate him.

592
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,258
Are the lives of 150 crewmen
reason enough?

593
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,634
Maybe you're right.

594
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,261
Maybe I am overreacting,

595
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,263
but what if I'm right?

596
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,060
We're less than a light-year away
from the geodesic fold.

597
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,605
Do you want to risk
being led through it

598
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,107
by a malfunctioning hologram?

599
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,236
Captain, you saved us
a com call.

600
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,489
We're ready to bring the
enhanced shielding on line.

601
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,283
Good work.
I need a moment alone with Reg.

602
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,661
Your program has been
running continuously

603
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,413
for how many hours now?

604
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,874
56 hours, 11 minutes
and 21 seconds.

605
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,418
I'd like to run
a diagnostic of your matrix,

606
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,295
make sure you haven't
suffered any degradation

607
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,880
over the last few days.

608
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,883
This isn't the, uh...

609
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,551
Doctor's idea, is it?

610
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,597
He expressed some concern
for your well-being, yes.

611
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,973
I bet he did.

612
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,519
Believe me, Reg, the crew and I
are grateful for everything you've done,

613
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,479
but we need to take
every precaution.

614
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,605
I understand perfectly.

615
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,148
And if the ship's Doctor thinks

616
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,068
I need a checkup,
who am I to argue?

617
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,132
Why are you hiding
in the corner?

618
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,508
I'm not hiding.

619
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:10,971
I'm working on a way
to foil the Ferengi's plans.

620
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,056
Reg, there's nothing
left to foil.

621
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,976
The Carolina will have them
in custody within the hour.

622
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,811
Leosa said the Ferengi

623
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,522
were going to be selling
Borg nanoprobes.

624
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,234
What does that have to do
with Voyager?

625
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,111
They have a Borg crewman.

626
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,737
Think about it.

627
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,366
The Ferengi stole the original
Barclay hologram a month ago.

628
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,286
That gave them time
to reprogram it

629
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,913
and then smuggle it to Voyager
in the next transmission.

630
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,707
Reprogram it to do what?

631
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,960
Steal Seven of Nine's
nanoprobes.

632
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,506
For all we know, he could be
dissecting her right now.

633
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,845
What would the Ferengi want
with assimilation technology?

634
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,473
Oh, nanoprobes
aren't just for assimilating.

635
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,017
They can reanimate
necrotic tissue,

636
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,602
slow down the aging process.

637
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,021
They'd be priceless
for the Ferengi.

638
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,399
Reg, even if the Ferengi

639
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:08,487
did reprogram your hologram
to steal the nanoprobes,

640
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,989
how would they get
their hands on them?

641
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,700
Voyager's
30,000 light-years away.

642
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,453
I haven't figured
that part out yet.

643
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:21,500
Maybe they discovered a--
a wormhole or a subspace corridor.

644
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,546
Have you mentioned any of this
to Commander Harkins?

645
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,507
Not yet. I can't.

646
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,343
If I don't bring him
hard evidence,

647
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,220
he'll just think
that I'm fantasizing.

648
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,726
For the time being, we need
to keep this between us.

649
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,277
That tickles, Lieutenant.

650
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,447
Sorry, Reg,
we're almost finished.

651
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,408
Have you identified
any problems yet?

652
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,118
I've gone over
his entire matrix.

653
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,662
He's working perfectly.

654
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,791
Maybe I'm not the one
who needs a diagnostic, hmm?

655
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,461
I'm a big enough hologram
to admit when I'm wrong.

656
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,837
I'm sorry I doubted you.

657
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,507
Well, if anyone is owed
an apology, it's you.

658
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,092
I should've been more sensitive.

659
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,468
Friends?

660
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,428
Friends.

661
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,972
Now that that's
out of the way, Captain,

662
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,266
what do you say we get
this ship back to Earth?

663
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,398
[beeping]

664
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,732
It's time.

665
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,527
Initiate the geodesic pulse.

666
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,544
[Admiral Paris] Would someone care
to tell me what that is?

667
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,388
It's a geodesic fold, Admiral.

668
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,807
That's how they're going
to get the nanoprobes.

669
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,688
Two million kilometers
and closing, Captain.

670
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,732
Take us to
one-quarter impulse.

671
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,191
Bridge to Astrometrics.

672
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,736
Bring the enhanced
shielding on line.

673
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,820
Aye, Commander.

674
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,946
[alarm sounds]

675
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,364
What's wrong?

676
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,454
The fold contains three radiation types
we didn't account for.

677
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,165
The shield modifications
are not enough.

678
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,374
Well, the shields
were modified

679
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,084
to work in combination
with the inoculations.

680
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,210
We'll be fine.

681
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,796
If the shields fail,
the inoculations will be irrelevant.

682
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,840
- Astrometrics to the Bridge.
- [Janeway] <i>Go ahead.</i>

683
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,009
[electrical crackling]

684
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,263
<i>What is it, Seven?</i>

685
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,266
[Seven's voice]
There was a problem, Captain,

686
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,559
but I've corrected it.

687
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,479
[beeping]

688
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:57,238
I'm using the MIDAS Array to tap
into the Ferengi ship's sensors.

689
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,115
They're receiving telemetry
through the fold.

690
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,910
If I'm reading this correctly,
Voyager's headed right for it.

691
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,370
Captain Janeway knows better

692
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,705
than to take her ship
into such a dangerous anomaly.

693
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,459
If the Ferengi did alter
my hologram, then...

694
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,505
it might... might be possible
for him to have taken over the ship.

695
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,715
One hologram
against an entire crew?

696
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,093
He may have found a way
to incapacitate the crew

697
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,761
or to commandeer
the ship's systems,

698
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,264
but either way, we've got to get
the Carolina to close the fold.

699
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,225
The Carolina isn't
equipped to do that.

700
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,852
Then they'll have to commandeer
the Ferengi ship and do it from there.

701
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,521
The Carolina's still
half a light-year away.

702
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,272
They won't make it in time.

703
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,401
Can we transmit a message,
warn Voyager?

704
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,320
Not through
a geodesic fold.

705
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,456
Our own starship,
with multiphasic shielding

706
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,043
and a gold-pressed
latinum hull.

707
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:55,296
We'll have enough left over
to buy a fleet of casino ships!

708
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,967
I have a better idea--
lobe enlargements!

709
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,970
- [console beeping]
- Shh!

710
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,722
Ooh, someone's
hailing us.

711
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,848
Who?

712
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,434
I can't tell.
There's too much interference.

713
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,893
Answer it.

714
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,565
It's the hologram.

715
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,276
You said it was impossible
to communicate through the fold.

716
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,569
I thought it was.

717
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,029
I guess I did a better job

718
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,157
of reprogramming the hologram
than I thought.

719
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,408
<i>[static]</i>

720
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:27,495
We must close
the geodesic fold immediately.

721
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,540
<i>Captain Janeway</i>
<i>has found out about our plan.</i>

722
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,333
If that's true,

723
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,502
then why is she still
headed for the fold?

724
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,588
Because she...

725
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,966
found a way
to protect her ship.

726
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,176
Impossible.

727
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,469
You don't know Janeway.

728
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,805
She's uncanny
when it comes to shields.

729
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:46,931
She's furious.

730
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,728
She said she was going to kill
whoever tried to harm her crew.

731
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,898
I strongly suggest
you abort the mission.

732
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,233
What should we do?

733
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,487
Go to warp before Janeway
makes it through.

734
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,780
<i>No, you mustn't!</i>

735
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,282
Voyager has Borg interquadrental

736
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:08,661
warp drives and...
Hirogen hunting sensors

737
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,288
and Vidiian phase torpedoes.

738
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,708
No matter where you run,
Voyager will find you.

739
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:18,213
Your only hope...
is to close the fold.

740
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,432
Harkins to Holodeck 1.

741
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,142
[Barclay]
<i>Go ahead, Pete.</i>

742
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,811
It worked, Reg.

743
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,562
<i>They've started</i>
<i>to close the fold.</i>

744
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,439
[sighs]
Computer, end program.

745
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,693
<i>[console beeping]</i>

746
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,445
Something's wrong, Captain.

747
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,823
[Barclay]
<i>Astrometrics to the Bridge.</i>

748
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,115
<i>Why are we stopping?</i>

749
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,660
The fold's collapsing, Reg.

750
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,411
<i>We didn't make it in time.</i>

751
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,664
It's not too late
if we remodulate the shields.

752
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,333
I appreciate your determination,
but we can't risk it.

753
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,001
You did everything you could.

754
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,127
<i>[console beeping]</i>

755
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,507
Captain, someone just initiated
a site-to-site transport.

756
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,883
Who?

757
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,009
Seven and Reg.

758
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,553
They've beamed
to an escape pod.

759
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,596
Bridge to Seven of Nine.
What's going on?

760
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,726
The pod's been launched.

761
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,228
Put a tractor beam on it.

762
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,941
There is too much interference
from the fold.

763
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,860
Harry, can you get
a transporter lock?

764
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,196
[beeping]

765
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,322
What now?

766
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,533
There's something
coming through the fold.

767
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,035
- Voyager?
- No, it's too small.

768
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,287
A phase torpedo!

769
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,707
Raise shields!
Brace for impact!

770
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,044
[muffled crash]

771
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,923
It's an escape pod.

772
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,474
Maybe the hologram
sent us the drone.

773
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,059
Ooh...!

774
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,686
Check what's in there.

775
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,523
Nothing.

776
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,445
No Borg corpse,
no nanoprobes.

777
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,822
No profit.

778
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,117
[all sigh]

779
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,620
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

780
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,747
<i>Seven of Nine has recovered</i>
<i>from her injuries</i>

00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,082
<i>and "Reg" has been deactivated.</i>

<i>Until we finish</i>
<i>analyzing his program,</i>

<i>his motivations</i>

Making first contact
with a new life-form?

785
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,182
"Mom's apple pie."

786
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,061
Neelix thought a little home cooking
might cheer me up.

787
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,978
And...?

788
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:42,148
I haven't worked up the courage
to taste it yet.

789
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,442
Have you figured out
what went wrong with Reg?

790
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,029
Well, Seven thinks our proximity
to the fold degraded his matrix,

791
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,491
but if you ask me, it was
a recursive error in his logic subroutine.

792
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,368
[sighs]

793
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,832
Not bad...

794
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,418
but it would have tasted better
in San Francisco.

795
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,591
If it'll make you
feel any better,

796
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,760
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

797
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,262
I was on the Bridge
this morning

798
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,265
when we received a hail
from an Iconian scientist.

799
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,477
He claims to have
a transdimensional gateway

800
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,604
that can take us anywhere
in the galaxy.

801
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,857
I'm not <i>that </i>gullible.

802
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,193
It's true. I was there.

803
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,779
The Captain doesn't want us
to get our hopes up,

804
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,074
but personally, I think we'll
be home by the end of the week.

805
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,829
Are you serious?

806
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:38,955
[chuckles]

807
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,748
You were right about him.

808
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:53,678

00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,853
C-computer, deactivate

812
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,522
I'm sorry.

813
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,234
I-- I've been programming him
with new security precautions

814
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,069
s-so he can't be stolen again.

815
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,904
You seem to be off
to a good start.

816
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,990
I thought you'd, uh,
be back at the beach.

817
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,660
Will and I decided to spend
the rest of our vacation in Tiburon.

818
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,246
We were wondering
if you're free for dinner tonight.

819
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,623
Uh, I, oh...

820
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,460
Oh, I, uh, I-I wouldn't want
to be a "third nacelle."

821
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,586
Not possible.

822
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,963
Will's bringing
a friend for you.

823
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,840
Her name's Maril.

824
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,217
You're going to adore her.

825
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,888
I'd like to,
but I-- I still have, uh...

826
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,515
dozens of protocols to install.

827
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,683
Maybe next time.

828
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,978
Look, Reg,
I know Leosa hurt you,

829
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,190
but hiding inside a hologrid
isn't the answer.

830
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,109
You need to get out,
meet new people.

831
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,572
This Maril wouldn't happen to be
a dabo girl by any chance?

832
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,825
She's a teacher, actually--
a real one.

833
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,328
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry, Reg.

834
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,122
We've taken
security precautions.
