1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:04,713
( rock theme playing )

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,091
( tools clanking )

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,261
( clanking )

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,018
( blows horn )

5
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,901
What do you think
you're doing, Doc?

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,277
An impromptu
auditory exam.

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,529
Did I pass?

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,822
With flying colors,

9
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,740
which leads me to believe
you did hear me

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,575
when I requested
you meet me this morning.

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,785
( embarrassed chuckle )

12
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,077
You're right.

13
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,287
I forgot.

14
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,331
I see.

15
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,792
I realize your sick bay
training is purely voluntary,

16
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,336
but you haven't spent any
time there in several weeks

17
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,380
and when I...

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,883
try to find you, you're
always in the holodeck.

19
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,343
Correct me if I'm wrong, Doc,
but we haven't been treating

20
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,595
anything more serious
than an ingrown toenail.

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,763
That's beside the point.

22
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,181
If an emergency
were to happen,

23
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,641
you must be prepared.

24
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,476
You're too far behind
in your medical texts

25
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,270
to be wasting your time
in the holodeck!

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,189
If it's any consolation,

27
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,274
I have spent most
of the morning immersed

28
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,027
in a complicated
surgical procedure.

29
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,277
Really?

30
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,612
A classic case

31
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,197
of atrophied shocks.

32
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,325
They needed to be extracted
to prevent chrome abrasion.

33
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,202
It was touch and
go for a while,

34
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,580
but the prognosis
is excellent.

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,374
You'll be ready for
neurosurgery in no time.

36
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,585
Take a look at this, Doc.

37
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:29,048
This is a fully stock
1969 Chevy Camaro,

38
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,759
one of the earliest
muscle cars ever made.

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,887
Imagine, Northern California,

40
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,346
late 20th century.

41
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,682
You're cruising up
Highway 1.

42
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,183
The woofers are pounding.

43
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,227
The wind is whipping
through your hair.

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,859
Medieval safety constraints,

45
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,070
internal combustion system,

46
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,239
producing lethal levels
of carbon monoxide.

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,575
Hmm. I stand corrected.

48
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,201
This may be just
what you need

49
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,079
to get you back
to Sick Bay.

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,539
I should have known
this wouldn't interest you.

51
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,791
It's too much fun.

52
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,459
This isn't about fun, Mr. Paris.

53
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,461
Serving in Sick Bay
is a privilege.

54
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,963
I'd expect you to realize that.

55
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,006
Oh, I do.

56
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,134
I'll be there. Soon.

57
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,392
JANEWAY:
<i>Lieutenant Paris, report</i>
<i>to the Bridge immediately.</i>

58
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,436
( sighs )

59
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,313
I'm on my way.

60
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,030
Somebody call
for a driver?

61
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,074
Take your
station, Tom.

62
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,617
Anything on
scans, Harry?

63
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,285
KIM:
I'm picking up

64
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,038
another spatial distortion
2,000 kilometers away.

65
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,247
CHAKOTAY:
Source?

66
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,624
KIM:
I have no idea.

67
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,751
It looks like
space is folding in on itself.

68
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,711
Shields to full.

69
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,051
It's an alien vessel.

70
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,886
One occupant aboard.

71
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,638
Captain, it looks like

72
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,265
that ship is being powered
by a coaxial warp drive.

73
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,059
Coaxial what?

74
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,227
It's a hypothetical
propulsion system.

75
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,564
Starfleet engineers have been
dreaming about it for years.

76
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,442
In theory, it can literally fold
the fabric of space

77
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,070
allowing a ship
to travel instantaneously

78
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,530
across huge
distances.

79
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,619
The alien warp drive
is overloading.

80
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,247
In theory,
a coaxial drive explosion...

81
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,749
could collapse space

82
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,752
within a radius
of a billion kilometers.

83
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,172
In theory.

84
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,507
Well, let's keep theory
from becoming reality.

85
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,884
Red alert.

86
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:47,895
( title theme playing )

87
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,580
PARIS:
Scan the vessel.

88
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,916
Can we beam the pilot out?

89
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,251
Too much interference.

90
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,211
The ship's about had it,
Captain.

91
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,046
The coaxial core is breaching.

92
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,008
We should vacate this
area of space at once.

93
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,884
PARIS:
We can't just leave
him like this.

94
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,343
Try one more hail.

95
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,345
Nothing.

96
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,848
Maybe he's ignoring us.

97
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,391
Or maybe he's unconscious. We've
got to do something.

98
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,061
JANEWAY:
Suggestions?

99
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,774
A symmetric warp field.

100
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,152
That should contain
any instabilities

101
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,903
in his space
folding core.

102
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,155
How can you be sure?

103
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,157
Advanced subspace geometry.

104
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,326
It's the one course
at the academy

105
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,452
where I actually paid attention.

106
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,746
We'll tractor him in
to kill his momentum,

107
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,999
and generate a warp field
around his ship.

108
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,543
His flight path is erratic.

109
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,586
We'd be risking
collision.

110
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,714
Captain, I can make this work.

111
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,090
Do it.

112
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,809
Passing through
the residual folds in space.

113
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,353
Steady.

114
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,900
Got him!

115
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,568
TUVOK:
I've extended
our warp field

116
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,944
around his vessel.

117
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,905
His core is powering down.

118
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,656
Nice flying, Tom.

119
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,034
My pleasure.

120
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,370
We're finally receiving a hail.

121
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,580
Open a channel.

122
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,332
Captain Janeway
of the Federation

123
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,624
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

124
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,085
Do you need medical attention?

125
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,502
<i>I'm fine, Captain.</i>

126
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,089
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>my ship is not.</i>

127
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,259
If you need to make repairs,
we might be able to help.

128
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,219
<i>That's very generous.</i>

129
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,679
We'll beam you aboard
in a few minutes. Stand by.

130
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,181
STETH:
Thank you.

131
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,225
CAPTAIN:
Tuvok.

132
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,107
Energize.

133
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,614
Welcome.
STETH: Captain.

134
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,950
I know you put yourselves
in danger to rescue me.

135
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,201
I want to thank you.

136
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,078
I'm glad we could help.

137
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,122
I was so eager to
test my new engine,

138
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,749
I pushed it
beyond its limits.

139
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,793
Coaxial warp
doesn't seem to be

140
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,836
the smoothest way
to travel.

141
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,589
It's a violent procedure,
but it allows a ship

142
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,508
to travel through space
at incredible speeds.

143
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,843
Considering the dangers

144
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,430
this method of travel
hardly seems logical.

145
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,764
That's probably true,

146
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,849
but if I were
worrying about danger,

147
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,977
I wouldn't have
become a test pilot.

148
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,270
Where are you from?

149
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,355
The fourth planet
in the Benthan system.

150
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,108
That's about 20 light
years from here.

151
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,734
I'll speak to my engineers

152
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,569
about helping you
with repairs.

153
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,156
Without your coaxial drive,
it's a long way home.

154
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,955
( door beeping )

155
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,624
Come in.

156
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,750
( short exhale )

157
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,670
I'd like to ask
you a favor.

158
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,672
I need a change of pace.

159
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,757
I'd like to help Steth
repair his ship.

160
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,884
This isn't
a good time to ask.

161
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,553
What do you mean?

162
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,848
I've been reading a report
from the doctor.

163
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,308
You didn't show up today.

164
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,269
Well, I was a little
busy this morning...

165
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,022
saving someone's life,
as I recall.

166
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,898
Is there something wrong, Tom?

167
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,566
Anything bothering you?

168
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,943
Nothing is wrong.

169
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,945
Since when is not
wanting to spend

170
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,281
time with the doctor
a capital offense?

171
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,534
You'd have to throw the whole
crew in the brig for that one.

172
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,871
Maybe. I was wondering if
there's something on your mind.

173
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,706
You're showing up
for your duty shifts,

174
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,999
you do what's required,

175
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,959
but your heart doesn't seem
to be in it.

176
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,421
You seem preoccupied.

177
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,424
Like I said,
I think I need a change of pace.

178
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,176
You're a different man

179
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,803
from the one that came
on board four years ago.

180
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,848
You've taken charge of your
life, turned yourself around.

181
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,892
I'd hate to see you ruin it.

182
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,398
I won't.

183
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,859
With your permission,
I'll report to Sick Bay.

184
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,488
Permission denied.

185
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,825
Report to Steth's
ship instead.

186
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,702
Assist in the repairs.

187
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,247
We need our best
man on the job.

188
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,880
And on my way back,

189
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,924
I made the mistake
of flying the prototype

190
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,717
through restricted
Entaban territory.

191
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,968
And?

192
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,303
And, uh...

193
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,765
the Entabans weren't
too pleased to see me.

194
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,185
I limped back to the engineers
on Benthos with phaser holes

195
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,645
through their brand-new
exatanium fuselage.

196
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,606
I think they would
have been happier

197
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,233
to see phaser holes
through me.

198
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,650
( chuckles )

199
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,696
When I was 16, I followed
an ancient human custom.

200
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,657
I took my father's shuttle
out for a joyride,

201
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,952
and proceeded to
fry all the relays.

202
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,248
STETH:
I'm guessing he wasn't happy
about getting it back.

203
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,499
Actually, he didn't.

204
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,959
As far as I know,

205
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,794
it's still at the
bottom of Lake Tahoe.

206
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,045
Here it is.

207
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,922
The coaxial induction drive.

208
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:34,217
It draws in subatomic particles
and reconfigures

209
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,594
their internal geometries.

210
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,678
And this is what makes
folding space possible?

211
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,722
At least in spurts.

212
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,266
Unfortunately,

213
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,394
particle instabilities
keep overloading my engines,

214
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,147
but I'm gonna to make it work.
I have to keep in motion.

215
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,317
I don't like the
thought of settling down.

216
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,861
Too many new ships to drive,
too many intriguing women.

217
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,780
Yeah. I guess so.

218
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,532
When I get this ship back,

219
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,618
I'm going to be doing
the first test

220
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,828
on a new mithran-class
fighter.

221
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,330
I'm told it's more advanced

222
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,915
than any warship
in the quadrant.

223
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,251
Why don't you
come with me?

224
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,628
We'd have a great time,

225
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,630
you can meet up with
<i>Voyager</i> afterwards.

226
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,801
I-I'd love to do that.

227
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,677
It sounds very exciting...

228
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,057
but I have
responsibilities here,

229
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,892
people who count on me,

230
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,521
and B'Elanna
would be furious.

231
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,567
B'Elanna.

232
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,279
I have to go.

233
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,047
So, you started without me.

234
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,424
I finished without you.

235
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,468
You're a little late.

236
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,679
Uh, sorry.

237
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,307
I was helping Steth
repair his ship.

238
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,518
How's it going?

239
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,853
Um...pretty slow.

240
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,397
We're both stuck on
how to prevent

241
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,358
the particle overloads
in his propulsion system.

242
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,069
Have you tried an isokinetic
containment field?

243
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,864
Yeah. That's the first
thing we tried.

244
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,242
How long do you think these
repairs are going to take?

245
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,285
I don't know.

246
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,581
I was just hoping
that maybe you could help me

247
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,124
recalibrate
the plasma manifolds tonight.

248
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,128
Uh...I, uh...

249
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,965
I probably should
go help Steth.

250
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,263
Tom, is there something wrong?

251
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,182
Why are you interrogating me?

252
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,808
I didn't think I was.

253
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,728
It sounds more like
you want me to account for

254
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,354
every minute that
I'm not with you.

255
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,731
That's ridiculous.

256
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,232
Can't I have some
time to myself?

257
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,234
Can't I do what I want
without having to report

258
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,736
every detail of it to you?

259
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,987
Tom, you can do
whatever you want.

260
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,282
I just wanted to know if
there was something wrong.

261
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,158
I mean lately you've
been canceling dates,

262
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,827
you hide out for hours
in the holodeck...

263
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,995
I am not hiding anything.

264
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,830
That is ridiculous.
Is it?

265
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,083
You haven't even told me
what holodeck program this is

266
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,418
that has you
so fascinated.

267
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,503
( scoffs )

268
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,714
"The Dancing Girls
of Ninipia Prime."

269
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,257
It's very entertaining.

270
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,592
Very funny.

271
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,884
You're overreacting.

272
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,763
I am not overreacting.

273
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,431
There is obviously
something going on,

274
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,308
and you're refusing
to admit it.

275
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,726
Good evening,
Lieutenants.

276
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,603
I see you don't have
dinner yet, Tom.

277
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,980
Can I get you something?
I'm really not hungry.

278
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,107
Excuse me. Are you going
to talk to me about this?

279
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,151
Because if not, I don't want
to sit here anymore.

280
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,860
If you can carry on
an adult conversation

281
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,404
without all
the histrionics...

282
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,739
Good night, Tom.

283
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,491
( sighs )

284
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,063
Computer, run a DNA
stability analysis.

285
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,233
How long before my genome
reverts to its previous form?

286
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,822
COMPUTER:
<i>Time to reversion,</i>
<i>three hours, 13 minutes.</i>

287
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,157
<i>Complete genome recovery</i>
<i>is imminent.</i>

288
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,083
So I was lying
in bed last night

289
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,418
when it hit me.

290
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,505
What you need
is a carburetor.

291
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,964
A carburetor?

292
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,843
Yes. It's a device that's
hundreds of years old.

293
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,470
I can't believe I didn't
think of it yesterday.

294
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,888
Wait. Hundreds
of years old?

295
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,474
Surely that couldn't be
of any use to us now.

296
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,226
It all goes
back to basics.

297
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,435
You would
be surprised

298
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,479
at how often I
find solutions

299
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,525
to 24th century problems
in 20th century technology.

300
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,694
Computer, access
Paris program

301
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,320
alpha one,
"Grease monkey."

302
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,364
( computer beeps )
Grease monkey?

303
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,032
Mechanic lingo.

304
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,664
A car's engine can't
run on pure fuel

305
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,416
so the carburetor
supplies it

306
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,626
with a mixture of
vaporized fuel and air.

307
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,086
And you think we need

308
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,922
a device like that
to dilute the particle stream

309
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,799
as it enters the coaxial drive.

310
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,259
Exactly, and a spare

311
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,720
polaric modulator
from<i> Voyager's</i> impulse drive

312
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,970
should do the trick.

313
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,472
Subatomic dilution!

314
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,058
It never would have
occurred to me.

315
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,602
I think you've solved it.

316
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,229
Well, we can run a few
simulations on the holodeck

317
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,606
before we actually try it.

318
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,608
Oh...I owe you a lot.

319
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,526
You can thank
my lucky toolbox.

320
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,112
It's gotten me out of
hot water more than once.

321
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,405
Mmm.

322
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,620
You're lucky to be stationed
on a ship like this.

323
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,581
Replicators
to feed and clothe you,

324
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,667
holo-technology to
cater to every whim,

325
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,920
hallways filled
with women.

326
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,212
Yeah.

327
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,632
It's great.

328
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,007
You don't sound convinced.

329
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,427
Aren't you
happy here?

330
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,678
Of course I'm happy.

331
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,430
I'm very happy.

332
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,849
I mean...I pilot

333
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,184
one of the most advanced
ships in Starfleet.

334
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,853
I have a beautiful girlfriend.

335
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,855
I'm respected.

336
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,356
I have everything

337
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,317
that I've ever wanted.

338
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,986
You're lucky.

339
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,114
You're part of a family,
part of a structure.

340
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,325
You have rules to guide you.

341
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,661
You don't have to worry about
making a lot of choices.

342
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,329
I usually go
to bed at night

343
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,706
not knowing what the
next day has in store...

344
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,917
what trouble I might get into.

345
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,293
( laughs )

346
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,712
You don't have to
worry about those things.

347
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,255
You're very settled.

348
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,343
I remember those days.

349
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,636
I used to be

350
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,387
a lot like you,

351
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,140
going anywhere...

352
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,017
Doing whatever I wanted.

353
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,770
Making my own rules,
living life my own way.

354
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,482
Well, then there's hope
for me yet.

355
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,276
Maybe someday
I'll settle down too.

356
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:12,198
But...for now...
I prefer to stay on the move.

357
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,741
( sighs )

358
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,536
Sometimes...I wish
that's what I was doing.

359
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,998
Things'll turn
around for you.

360
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,834
I've always found that
change is inevitable.

361
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,127
It comes when you
least expect it.

362
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,379
( laughs )

363
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,588
Yeah, I suppose.

364
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,882
Now, are we ready

365
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,800
to try this carburetor
idea on my ship?

366
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,427
Just give me five more
minutes to finish up here,

367
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,804
and I'll be right with you.

368
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,096
Five minutes.

369
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,391
And, Tom...

370
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,434
don't dismiss
the suggestion

371
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,061
I made...

372
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,439
about coming with me
to fly the new ship.

373
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,527
It might be fun to escape
the shackles for a while.

374
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,313
Computer, access all files

375
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,983
pertaining
to Lieutenant Tom Paris.

376
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,860
Download into memory core alpha.

377
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,487
COMPUTER:
<i>Please enter</i>

378
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,617
<i>Access granted.</i>

379
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,953
<i>Commencing download.</i>

380
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,678
Hello.

381
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,555
I'm Steth...

382
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,974
a guest of your captain.

383
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,684
I have been apprised
of your presence on<i> Voyager.</i>

384
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,687
You are not authorized
to access the ship's computers.

385
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,188
You must be Seven of Nine.

386
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,565
That is correct.

387
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,067
Tom mentioned you.

388
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,277
He thinks you're
extremely intelligent.

389
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,154
Lieutenant Paris'
opinion of me

390
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,239
is irrelevant to your
being in this room.

391
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,408
Oh, well...Tom felt
we needed some files

392
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,910
for polaric modulators

393
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,579
but he was called away
before we could access them.

394
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,915
I thought I'd find them
myself and help out.

395
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,291
You were mistaken.

396
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,293
He must be present
to download these files.

397
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,586
Oh, I'm about to meet him

398
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,838
at the holodeck.

399
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,506
We can find the files there.

400
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,717
<i>Voyager's</i> hierarchy
is complex.

401
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,637
See that you familiarize
yourself with it.

402
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,972
Good advice.

403
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,264
I'll do that.

404
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:53,151
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51762.4.</i>

405
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,903
<i>The repairs</i>
<i>to Steth's coaxial drive</i>

406
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,781
<i>have been completed</i>
<i>well ahead of schedule.</i>

407
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,741
Everything here looks good.

408
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,202
Just give me one more second
to check the flow field

409
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,453
parameters.

410
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,746
Go ahead.

411
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,185
It's my box wrench.

412
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,062
I've been looking
all over for this.

413
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,230
I know. I should've
asked you, Tom,

414
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,192
but I needed it
for an experiment.

415
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,609
( chuckles )

416
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,612
To, uh...check
your new carburetor?

417
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,532
Not quite.

418
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,493
You're the first humans
I've met and that wrench

419
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,247
had enough cellular residue on
it for me to check your DNA.

420
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,290
I have good news.

421
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,710
( groaning )

422
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,670
We're compatible.

423
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,643
Consider this a favor.

424
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,022
I know how unhappy you've been
with this dreary, settled life,

425
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,233
so I'm taking it off your hands.

426
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,860
I'm betting there's still
some fun to be had here.

427
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,655
<i>Voyager</i> is
a great ship, Tom.

428
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,824
I'll take good care of it.

429
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,377
Sorry I'm late.

430
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,048
We were beginning to wonder
if you were ever coming back.

431
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,719
KIM:
His ship is powering engines.

432
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,021
Something wrong, Tom?

433
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,442
It's nothing.

434
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,283
( sighs )

435
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,410
I'm just really going
to miss that guy.

436
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,259
Mind if I join you?

437
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,677
Not at all...

438
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,886
Commander.

439
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,387
Chakotay will do, Tom.

440
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,431
You don't have to carry this
rules thing too far.

441
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,185
I've been discussing
your engineering report

442
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,686
with the captain.

443
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,688
She was wondering
if we could implement

444
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,731
some of Steth's technology
here on<i> Voyager.</i>

445
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,441
Really?

446
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,944
We thought maybe
you could start on a shuttle.

447
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,570
Do you
think you can do it?

448
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,324
I'm sure I can.

449
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:49,660
Great. You can start right after
you finish with the doctor.

450
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,745
The doctor?

451
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,371
He needs your help in Sick Bay.

452
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,665
I told him you'd be there.

453
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,917
Of course.

454
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,627
( clearing throat )

455
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,133
Lieutenant.
Hi.

456
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,265
( sighing )

457
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,965
KIM:
I know you've been
avoiding the doctor,

458
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,844
but don't tell me you've
forgotten where Sick Bay is.

459
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,637
( Laughing ):
Oh...not yet.

460
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,472
I was just trying
to figure out

461
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,474
if there's a more
efficient route

462
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,727
between Sick Bay
and my quarters.

463
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,437
I didn't realize you were
that eager to get there.

464
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,148
( chuckling )

465
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,525
So tell me,
are they ready yet?

466
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:08,072
Uh...not yet.
But they will be soon.

467
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,699
Great. Hey, let me know
if you have any problems.

468
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,119
Polyduranide can be
tough to replicate.

469
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,828
Oh, it sure can be.

470
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,873
I can't wait to get my hands
around one of those clubs.

471
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,542
Ensign Kaplan won't
know what hit her.

472
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,086
What?

473
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,338
We're going to play
golf with her.

474
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,299
We scheduled a
rematch, remember?

475
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,716
Oh, of course.

476
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,302
I can't wait.

477
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,469
Have you been working
on your putting?

478
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,806
You missed both those
two-footers last time.

479
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,349
I won't let it
happen again.

480
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,143
( sighing ):
All right.

481
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,478
Give the doc my best.
I will...

482
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,648
if I ever find him.

483
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,946
You're early,
Mr. Paris.

484
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,283
I see some good came from my
report to Commander Chakotay.

485
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,952
Let's put these extra
few minutes to good use.

486
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,495
Begin with a thorough
bio-bed diagnostic.

487
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,957
I want you to recalibrate
each physiosensor

488
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,751
making sure to enter every
metabolic referent precisely.

489
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,462
Okay.

490
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,214
When you're through there, run
a protein structure analysis,

491
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,425
and then continue your
review of the 37 steps

492
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,635
of a cardiopulmonary
reconstruction procedure.

493
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,720
I'll leave you
to your bio-beds.

494
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,557
( electronic screech )

495
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,144
Did you forget to disengage
the scan emitters?

496
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,770
Sorry.

497
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,022
( electronic screech )

498
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:27,360
Mr. Paris!

499
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,195
I don't know what's wrong.

500
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,863
I realize
it's complicated,

501
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,073
but you must try again.

502
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,034
Actually,
I'm not feeling so well.

503
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,869
How fortunate you're
already in Sick Bay.

504
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,663
I'll run a few scans.

505
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,539
Uh, no, no, Doc.
That's all right.

506
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,502
To be perfectly
honest with you,

507
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,838
uh...this is so
frustrating for me.

508
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,840
I usually pick things up
a lot faster than this.

509
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,800
You're here to learn,
Mr. Paris.

510
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,635
It will get easier with time.

511
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,804
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

512
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,056
Excuse me?

513
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,765
No offense, Doctor,

514
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,934
but you were programmed
to be a medical genius.

515
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,520
Things always
come easy to you.

516
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,023
Me, I'm just a pilot,
a...grease monkey,

517
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,816
and as hard
as I might try

518
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,403
to become a better
assistant to you,

519
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,071
it's clear to me now

520
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,408
that I'll never be half
the healer that you are.

521
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,035
Do you mean to tell me,

522
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:21,414
you've been trying
to live up to my standards?

523
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,082
( sighing )

524
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,542
I'm afraid I have.

525
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:27,753
It all makes sense now.

526
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,671
The misplaced aggression,

527
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,632
the shirking
of responsibilities...

528
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:37,388
all classic signs of
an inferiority complex.

529
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:41,392
I had no idea my
superior abilities

530
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,811
were affecting your
psyche so strongly.

531
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,064
Take the rest
of the day off.

532
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:51,444
Reflect on your strengths.
Realize your worth.

533
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,365
I'll do that, Doctor.

534
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,908
Thank you.

535
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,498
( sighing )

536
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,052
( sighing )

537
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,721
B'Elanna.

538
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,141
What do you think you're doing?

539
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,352
Putting.
In my quarters?

540
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,771
I can't putt in your quarters?

541
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,148
No.

542
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,566
Since when?

543
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,318
( exasperated sigh )

544
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,944
Tom...

545
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,616
what is this?

546
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,242
That is...

547
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,785
a sand wedge.

548
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,497
It's used for getting
out of traps.

549
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,624
Why is it here?

550
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,041
I replicated it for you.

551
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,918
I thought we could play
a little game of golf

552
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:54,340
on the holodeck before dinner.
So this is your idea...

553
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,009
of an adult conversation?

554
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,469
( exasperated sigh )

555
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,679
I don't know what
you are trying to accomplish

556
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,474
with this little stunt,

557
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,018
but let me assure you,
it is not working.

558
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,979
I am sorry if you are bored
because Steth is gone,

559
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,106
but that doesn't mean
that you can just walk in here,

560
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,443
and pretend like you
haven't been shutting me out.

561
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,863
You're being a little hard
on Steth.

562
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,450
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.

563
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,994
Really?

564
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:29,707
I mentioned to him that we were
having some problems,

565
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,461
and he urged me to...

566
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,796
come and talk to you,

567
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,424
to try to work things out,

568
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,093
to admit I was wrong.

569
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,683
I made a mistake, B'Elanna,

570
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,893
and I'm sorry.

571
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:55,817
I won't shut
you out anymore.

572
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,946
In fact, I went to
the doctor and begged

573
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,366
to be excused
from my duties.

574
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:06,328
I realize it's only
a few extra hours,

575
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,873
but they're hours I
wanna spend with you.

576
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:24,137
Steth...turned out to be
a positive influence on you.

577
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,866
( groaning )

578
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,297
Computer, where...

579
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,551
com-computer, where are we?

580
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:08,557
COMPUTER:
<i>Navigation Mmatrix 171,</i>
<i>the Kotaba expanse.</i>

581
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,142
<i>Coaxial leap complete.</i>

582
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,186
How far are we from<i> Voyager?</i>

583
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,981
( sighing )

584
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,359
Computer, lock in<i> Voyager's</i>
last known coordinates,

585
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,403
and activate
differential induction drive.

586
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,363
COMPUTER:
<i>Unable to execute command.</i>

587
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,783
Why not?

588
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,535
COMPUTER:
<i>The differential induction</i>
<i>drive has been secured.</i>

589
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,831
<i>A security access code is</i>
<i>required for coaxial leap.</i>

590
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,713
AVIK:
<i>This is Commander Avik</i>
<i>of the Benthan Guard.</i>

591
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,548
<i>We're taking you into custody.</i>

592
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,634
<i>Prepare to surrender the vessel</i>
<i>to us at once.</i>

593
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:49,264
Benthan? I need a second
to explain, Commander.

594
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,724
I'm not who you think--

595
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,810
AVIK:
<i>We do not negotiate</i>
<i>with thieves.</i>

596
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,772
No...you don't understand!

597
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,566
I-I need this ship
to get back to<i> Voyager.</i>

598
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,902
AVIK:
<i>Surrender the vessel peacefully</i>
<i>or we will use force.</i>

599
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,423
Why is everybody trying
to shoot me today?

600
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,717
You know what I'm here for.

601
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,885
I don't know
what you're talking about.

602
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,136
Who are you?

603
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,763
I'm Steth.

604
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,056
What?

605
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,349
Look at me.

606
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,476
You did wear this body
for nearly a year,

607
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,270
before you switched
it with mine.

608
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,189
That's my body you're in now.

609
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,691
I want it back.

610
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,193
Bear with me
for...for a second.

611
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,653
We have more

612
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,573
in common than you might think.

613
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,832
This better be good, Tom.

614
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,125
I left Vorik right
in the middle

615
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,086
of an E.P.S.
Recalibration.

616
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,214
( sighs ):
You can thank me later.

617
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:07,050
So what's my big surprise?

618
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,305
What would you say...
to 24 glorious hours

619
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,350
on the famed fourth planet
of the Kendren System?

620
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,353
You mean the planet where Neelix
is gathering food samples?

621
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,648
Mm-hmm. I ran a few scans and
found the most incredible beach

622
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,609
on one
of the smaller continents.

623
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:27,279
I replicated
a picnic lunch for us.

624
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,156
<i>Voyager</i> isn't leaving orbit
until tomorrow.

625
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,451
We'd have an entire day.

626
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,828
( laughs )

627
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,288
Only a day?

628
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,751
Oh, I think that we would
need at least a week.

629
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:44,546
Oh, I wish we could,
but we've only got a day.

630
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,340
You're serious, aren't you?

631
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,801
Completely.

632
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,386
Do you know how much
trouble we would be in?

633
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,055
What could Janeway
do, execute us?

634
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,599
Tom, I am swamped.

635
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,101
I can't get away for
an hour, let alone 24.

636
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,436
B'Elanna...

637
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,814
I have responsibilities here.
We both do.

638
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,483
Responsibilities?
I don't care!

639
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,943
Tom, you're hurting me.

640
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,861
You're a real
disappointment to me.

641
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,404
Do you know that?

642
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,491
I don't know what
I ever saw in you.

643
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,542
( sighs )

644
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,926
Seven.

645
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,261
What brings you
here at this hour?

646
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,977
We were supposed to meet in
the shuttle bay at 2100 hours.

647
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,353
Did you forget?

648
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,896
I did.

649
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,940
I got so caught up
with my reading,

650
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,525
I guess it slipped my mind.

651
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,401
Sorry.

652
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,363
The capillaries in your eyes
are swollen, Lieutenant,

653
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,658
and I see signs of vascular
congestion in your cheeks.

654
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,117
Are you intoxicated?

655
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,453
No, not at all.

656
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,707
I was just exploring
the replicator,

657
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,834
trying some alien beverages.

658
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,044
Only a few were alcoholic.

659
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,797
You are not officially off duty
for another 78 minutes.

660
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,924
I'm on break.

661
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,467
Would you like to join me?

662
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,554
I could replicate another
trakian ale for you.

663
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,556
That will not be necessary.

664
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,016
Oh, relax, Seven.

665
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,894
You're not on the
borg cube anymore.

666
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,688
We could finish our work
on the shuttle tomorrow.

667
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,482
That would be an
inefficient use of our time.

668
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,150
I will complete
the work myself.

669
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,402
( sighs )

670
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,695
Fine.

671
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,990
Before I leave,
I would like to know

672
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,158
why you were reading the
captain's personal logs.

673
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,831
I wasn't.
I saw the pad.

674
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,083
It was unmistakably
the captain's logs.

675
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,253
You're wrong.

676
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,880
You're...confused.

677
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,131
You couldn't possibly
have seen anything.

678
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,467
You know I possess
an eidetic memory.

679
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,720
I require only seconds
to commit what I see to memory.

680
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,014
Would you like me to quote
the passage you were reading?

681
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,599
I'm warning you,
stay out of my way.

682
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,643
Don't interfere in things
that don't concern you.

683
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,771
If you bother me again,

684
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,940
I will make things very
unpleasant for you.

685
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,944
Remove your hand from my arm.

686
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,194
Don't be foolish.

687
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,613
You'll regret it.

688
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,049
( door beeping )

689
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,634
Enter.

690
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,306
You wanted to see me, Captain.

691
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,726
Yes.

692
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,815
I received a rather disturbing
report from Seven of Nine

693
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,692
regarding
your conduct last night.

694
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,028
She claims you were
drinking on duty.

695
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,280
( scoffs )

696
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,698
She's mistaken, Captain.

697
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,158
Don't lie
to me, Tom.

698
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,452
I checked the computers.

699
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,038
You replicated
five alcoholic beverages

700
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,706
in the mess hall.

701
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,209
She also said
you threatened her.

702
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,419
( sighs )

703
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,671
I'm sorry, Captain.

704
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,464
B'Elanna and I had an argument.

705
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,008
I was upset.

706
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,885
And is that why you were reading
my personal logs?

707
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,428
I wasn't.

708
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:24,474
Seven recited a passage I'd
written word for word.

709
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,893
She probably accessed
those files herself.

710
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,771
Captain, you can't take
the word of a borg over mine.

711
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,440
This has to stop, Tom.

712
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,567
Your conduct lately
has been bizarre,

713
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,820
and I've heard far
too many complaints

714
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,114
from far too many
people to dismiss it.

715
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,324
Chakotay, the doctor,
Seven of Nine.

716
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,869
They're all worried
about you, and so am I.

717
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,080
You're right, Captain.
I need some rest.

718
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,957
I'll go right to my quarters.

719
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,917
Tom...

720
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,919
as your captain
and as your friend...

721
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,588
I want you to report to
Sick Bay for some tests.

722
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,049
We have to find out

723
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,508
if there's
something physical

724
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,385
that's causing
this behavior.

725
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,345
This is crazy.

726
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,681
I don't need any help.

727
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,683
It's an order.

728
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,479
JANEWAY:
<i>Security, I need you</i>
<i>in the ready room now!</i>

729
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,323
( coughing )

730
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,242
Are you hurt, Captain?

731
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,079
No. Take him
to Sick Bay.

732
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,164
Keep security with him.

733
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,083
( coughing )

734
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,260
The coaxial drive will be
online in a few minutes.

735
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,555
Good. I've just about overridden
all the lockout commands.

736
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,016
No offense, but I'd like
to get out of your body

737
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,267
as soon as possible.

738
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,643
The alien seems capable

739
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,812
of some sort of
selective DNA exchange.

740
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,355
He absorbs new DNA

741
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,649
while depositing his
current genetic material

742
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,151
into his victims.

743
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:02,363
Let's hope he can
reverse that process.

744
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,990
That's the last
lockout command.

745
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,618
We're set for
coaxial warp.

746
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,245
Let's find<i> Voyager.</i>

747
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,962
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

748
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,422
<i>The doctor has treated</i>
<i>Mr. Paris' phaser wounds</i>

749
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,300
<i>but has been unable to</i>
<i>wake him.</i>

750
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,011
<i>The motive for his attack</i>
<i>remains a mystery.</i>

751
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,055
Neurological scans
yielded very little,

752
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,474
but I did find something
very interesting

753
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,018
in his blood analysis.

754
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,729
There are traces of
a second DNA pattern

755
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,189
in his nucleotide structure.

756
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,357
Possibly the result
of a genetic virus.

757
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,153
Could this be the cause
of his recent behavior?

758
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,362
I don't know, but
I'm running more scans

759
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,448
to see how this
might have affected

760
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,200
his neurological
functions.

761
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,327
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Captain, a vessel just emerged</i>

762
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,830
<i>from coaxial space</i>
<i>off our starboard bow.</i>

763
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,790
Keep me informed, Doctor.

764
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,302
Hail them.

765
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,138
STETH:
<i>Captain Janeway.</i>

766
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,182
Oh, welcome back,

767
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,808
Mr. Steth.

768
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,978
<i>I know this sounds crazy,</i>
<i>Captain, but I'm not Steth.</i>

769
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,354
<i>I'm Tom Paris.</i>

770
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,982
I beg your pardon?

771
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:22,694
<i>We're dealing with an alien</i>
<i>who's an identity thief.</i>

772
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,404
<i>He traded places with me.</i>

773
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,573
<i>Please beam us aboard.</i>

774
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,787
Maintain your position
while we consider your request.

775
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,413
End transmission.

776
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,083
Hold him in a tractor beam
until you hear from me.

777
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,127
I have a feeling Steth
and his new friend

778
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,213
are behind whatever's
happened to Tom.

779
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,421
Captain?

780
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,507
No time to explain.
I'll be in Sick Bay.

781
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,980
( clattering )

782
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,565
Captain?

783
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,532
Commander, I'm reading
an unauthorized shuttle launch.

784
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,785
It's the captain.

785
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,996
She's in the shuttle
Tom's been working on.

786
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,873
Try hailing her.

787
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,166
She's not
responding.

788
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,792
Hail Steth's ship.

789
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,338
Look, I don't
know who you are,

790
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,548
but I want to know
what's happening here.

791
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,841
<i>Who's on that shuttle?</i>

792
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,218
Captain Janeway.

793
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,719
<i>No. I'm betting the alien</i>

794
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,055
<i>switched my body...</i>
<i>Tom's body for hers.</i>

795
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,515
<i>You've got to let us out</i>
<i>of this tractor beam.</i>

796
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:39,354
<i>We can catch her</i>
<i>with this ship.</i>

797
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,398
<i>Chakotay...it's me.</i> 
How do I know that?

798
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,110
<i>The other day in your office,</i>

799
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,153
<i>you told me</i>
<i>I'd turned my life around.</i>

800
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,488
<i>Well, give me the chance</i>
<i>to prove it.</i>

801
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,032
<i>Let me go after the shuttle.</i>

802
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,575
<i>It is the only way</i>

803
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,787
<i>we can get everybody</i>
<i>back into the right body.</i>

804
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:59,665
Harry...
disengage the tractor beam.

805
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,467
<i>Twenty thousand </i>
<i>kilometers and closing.</i>

806
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,219
<i>Has he detected us yet?</i>

807
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,722
<i>I'd say he has.</i>

808
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:21,479
Gentlemen, I'd advise you
to reconsider this pursuit.

809
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,857
Killing me will only keep you
trapped in those bodies.

810
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,067
He's right.

811
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,693
We can't risk killing him.

812
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,447
Yeah, but nothing's keeping
him from killing us.

813
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,783
Damn! The ship's not nearly
as maneuverable as a shuttle.

814
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,201
Shields are down.

815
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,619
I'm surprised you're so eager

816
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,205
to reclaim your life
on Voyager, Tom.

817
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,916
I was just as disappointed
with it as you were.

818
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,043
Then I guess we were both wrong.

819
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,671
It's time to move on again.

820
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,633
Oh, Tom...be sure to send
my best regards to B'Elanna.

821
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,010
Hmm?

822
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,719
( chuckling )

823
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,473
He's charging
the coaxial drive.

824
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,475
Set the sensors to track him.

825
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,477
I can't. He's blocking us.

826
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,438
We won't be able to follow him
once he goes

827
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,564
into coaxial warp.

828
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,362
We're losing him!

829
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,238
The carburetor!

830
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,490
We added

831
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,782
a polaric modulator

832
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,950
to the coaxial drive.

833
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,203
If I can target
the modulator,

834
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,621
hit it with a
chromo electric pulse,

835
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,874
that'll disrupt
his engines.

836
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,501
Here goes.

837
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,008
( alarm blaring )

838
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,510
( engines revving )

839
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,137
PARIS:
<i>I hope you still have</i>
<i>my box wrench.</i>

840
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,973
<i>Faulty carburetors</i>
<i>can be a pain to fix.</i>

841
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:45,563
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51775.2.</i>

842
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,399
<i>While the alien intruder</i>

843
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,527
<i>remains trapped in the body</i>
<i>of his last victim,</i>

844
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,862
<i>the doctor has found a way</i>
<i>to return Tom, Steth and me</i>

845
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,947
<i>to our own bodies.</i>

846
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,242
Doctor,
I can't thank you enough.

847
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,494
You've given me my life back.

848
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,371
DOCTOR:
All in a day's work.

849
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,373
There were times
when I thought

850
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:05,458
I would be stuck
in that body forever.

851
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,959
And believe me

852
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,628
I'm just as happy to be back
to the old Tom Paris.

853
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,214
What do you
plan to do now?

854
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,258
I'm going to take
her back to Bentha.

855
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,884
I hope to find
the person

856
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,428
who belongs
to that body.

857
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,346
But who knows
if that's the end of it?

858
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,307
We have no idea
how long she or he

859
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,560
has been switching
identities.

860
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,103
It may take a while...

861
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,231
but I will do
whatever I can

862
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:31,901
to find everyone
you've violated.

863
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,862
A security team will
escort her to your ship,

864
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,698
and erect a force field
to contain her.

865
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,502
( rock theme playing )

866
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,300
So this is where
you've been hiding?

867
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,176
A garage?

868
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,929
It's more than
just a garage.

869
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,223
This is a monument

870
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,477
to hundreds and
hundreds of hours...

871
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,313
that I probably should
have spent with you.

872
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,398
Probably?

873
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,484
Definitely.

874
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,946
It's a lovely garage, Tom,

875
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,074
but I still don't understand
why you brought me here.

876
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:24,621
Well, consider it
a symbolic gesture.

877
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:30,209
It's my less than subtle attempt
to...let you in.

878
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,836
I see.

879
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:36,841
To make it clear, that I mean
almost as much to you as a...

880
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,259
a Cam-a-ro.

881
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,053
It's a mint condition,

882
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,181
1969...

883
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,559
Ca-mare-oh.

884
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,230
And yes...you mean
a lot more to me.

885
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:14,045
( title theme playing )
