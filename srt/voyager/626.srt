1
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:26,294
Four of Twelve,
Subjunction of Unimatrix 525.

2
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,797
You have a disease.

3
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,299
You're one of many
with this sickness.

4
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,301
We want to cure you.

5
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,803
But we need a better way

6
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,389
to identify those
with the mutation.

7
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,474
Our testing method is too slow.

8
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,228
It could take centuries
to identify everyone.

9
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,533
Help me find
the interlink frequency

10
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,036
that binds
all of you together.

11
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,413
Then we can put an end
to this,

12
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,541
quickly, efficiently.

13
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,169
Comply.

14
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,258
(<i> gasping wheeze</i> )

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,804
I've disconnected you
from the hive mind.

16
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,309
You're alone.

17
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,147
I know how
uncomfortable
that can be.

18
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,112
Tell me what
I want to know,

19
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,864
then you can
rejoin us.

20
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,909
I... don't... know.

21
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,745
You must
remember something.

22
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,163
I don't... remember.

23
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,207
The frequency.
I don't remember!

24
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,335
Deactivate him.

25
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,379
Wait.

26
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,883
Dismantle him.

27
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,637
Bring me his
cortical array.

28
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,023
(<i> birds chirping</i> )

29
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,153
(<i> inhales</i> )

30
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,446
(<i> laughter</i> )

31
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,406
That reminds
me of the time

32
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,575
my mother caught me
feeding lerraberries

33
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,702
to my younger brother.

34
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,746
MALE:
What's a lerraberry?

35
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,081
We'll save that
for next time.

36
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,499
Until then.

37
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,460
MALE:
Annika.

38
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,099
(<i> gasps</i> )

39
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,192
Another
milestone.

40
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,777
You've had your
first dream.

41
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,612
I felt awake.

42
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,531
Dreams can often
seem quite real.

43
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,533
Tell me more
about this forest.

44
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,909
(<i> sighs</i> )

45
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,163
It was... familiar.

46
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,414
Perhaps your
unconscious mind

47
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,084
was drawing on a
childhood memory.

48
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,128
I spoke to someone.

49
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,339
He called me
by my human name.

50
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,882
Did you recognize him?

51
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,468
He seemed... familiar.

52
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,470
This could give us a
fascinating glimpse

53
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,306
into your
unconscious mind.

54
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,891
Any one of those images

55
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,851
might have a
symbolic meaning.

56
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,270
The mysterious stranger,
for example--

57
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,065
is he a father figure,
or does he represent

58
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,525
a repressed desire
for male companionship?

59
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,485
I don't wish
to dream again.

60
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,030
Please repair
my cortical array.

61
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,367
This isn't
a malfunction, Seven.

62
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,661
It's a natural step
in your human development.

63
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,831
It might seem unsettling now,
but you'll get used to it.

64
00:06:54,873 --> 00:07:00,419
Before you know it,
you'll look forward to climbing
into your alcove each night.

65
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,257
This will keep a record
of your REM cycles.

66
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,813
You're late,
Mr. Paris.

67
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,232
Ma'am?

68
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,524
According to the ship's
chronometer,

69
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,193
by 22 seconds.

70
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:26,154
I'll make it up
at the end of my shift.

71
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,781
See that you do.

72
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,408
Take your station.

73
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,384
Open it.
That's an order.

74
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,849
Not only late
but improperly dressed.

75
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,726
That belongs
on your collar, Mr. Paris.

76
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,728
JANEWAY:
Allow me.

77
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,565
As ship's Captain,

78
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,777
I hereby reinstate you
to the rank of Lieutenant,

79
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,448
with all the privileges
and responsibilities therein.

80
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,284
Your performance on this ship
over the past year

81
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,078
has been exemplary.
I expect more of the same.

82
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,788
You won't
be disappointed.

83
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,418
Congratulations...
Lieutenant.

84
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,753
I didn't notice a little box
on<i> my</i> chair.

85
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,464
(<i> helm beeping</i> )

86
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,133
Hiding a cake
in the console?

87
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,179
Looks like a distress call.

88
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,680
Put it through.

89
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,849
I'm getting a carrier wave,

90
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,184
but no message.

91
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,353
Origin?
TUVOK: An asteroid,

92
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,771
approximately two light-years
from here.

93
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,441
Yellow Alert.
Set a course.

94
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,327
We're in range.

95
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,578
Drop to impulse.
On screen.

96
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,874
JANEWAY:
Magnify.

97
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,170
I am reading
artificial structures.

98
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,339
It's a colony of some kind.

99
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,383
Open a channel.

100
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,052
This is Captain Janeway
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

101
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,013
We've received
your distress call.

102
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,027
Life signs?
None.

103
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,863
I'm detecting residual
weapons signatures.

104
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,490
They're Borg.

105
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,326
Any vessels?

106
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,785
One.

107
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,579
A cube at the edge
of this system.

108
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,374
Resume our previous course,
Mr. Paris. Warp 6.

109
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,751
Make a note
in the ship's record:

110
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,463
We responded to a distress call
at 0900 hours,

111
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,508
arrived at the colony
two hours later.

112
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,760
No survivors.

113
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,804
We don't know
who these people were,

114
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,474
but we know
the Borg destroyed them.

115
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,837
(<i> gasps</i> )

116
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,303
Come with me.

117
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,221
I'm regenerating.
This is only a dream.

118
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,973
You're not dreaming.
I brought you here.

119
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,975
This is Unimatrix Zero.

120
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,401
There is no Unimatrix Zero.
Who are you?

121
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,902
Five of Twelve--

122
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,239
Secondary Adjunct
of Trimatrix 942.

123
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,867
But when I'm here,
my name is Axum.

124
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,328
Axum.

125
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,579
Sound familiar?

126
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,247
Yes.

127
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,583
Good. It's starting
to come back to you.

128
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,543
CHILD:
Is anyone here?

129
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,766
Hello.

130
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,603
I think I'm lost.

131
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,188
I'm Axum.

132
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,231
This is Annika.

133
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,986
My father's ship
started shaking.

134
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,865
Men came aboard.
They looked like machines.

135
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,242
Will you help me
find my father?

136
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,702
I'll see what I can do.

137
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,164
There are
other children here.

138
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,458
Would you like
to meet them?

139
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,210
I just got here, too.

140
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,253
This environment
is intimidating,

141
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,214
but I believe it's safe.

142
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,182
He was just assimilated.

143
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,726
He's probably still
in a maturation chamber.

144
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,104
Are you telling me
this isn't a real place?

145
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,731
It's some kind of
virtual construct?

146
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,569
We come here during
our regeneration cycles.

147
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,196
We can exist
as individuals here.

148
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,497
Unimatrix Zero.

149
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,957
You used to come here,

150
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,792
before you escaped
the collective.

151
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,005
You have the recessive
mutation, too.

152
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,301
Don't you remember
any of it?

153
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,555
No. What mutation?

154
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,933
Only one out of a
million drones has it.

155
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,187
Why did you
bring me here now?

156
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,691
The collective has
found a way to detect us.

157
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,445
It's a lengthy procedure,
but they've managed to identify

158
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,907
and deactivate nearly 200 of us
over the last few months.

159
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,077
It's only a matter of time
before they find enough of us

160
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,829
to isolate
the interlink frequency.

161
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,666
Once they've done that...

162
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,919
You can help us stop them.

163
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,713
Clarify.

164
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,132
We've designed
a nanovirus

165
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,551
that should mask
the biochemical signature

166
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,262
of the mutation,
but we need someone

167
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,889
to release it into
the collective.

168
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,644
You're already
on a Borg vessel.
Why don't you do it?

169
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,771
When we've completed
our regeneration cycles,

170
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,982
we have no memory
of this place.

171
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:39,944
But you're not a part of
the collective anymore.

172
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,740
You're our only
connection to
the real world.

173
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,754
Scan the node
for residual harmonics.

174
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,718
It's a shame you're not alive
to experience disembodiment.

175
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,013
It's the epitome of perfection.

176
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,515
Give it to me.

177
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,604
We have isolated
the carrier band,

178
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,566
but it's useless to us
without the precise frequency.

179
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,154
We need additional data.

180
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,657
Two more of the mutations
have been discovered

181
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,659
in Spatial Grid 649.

182
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,911
Have their cortical nodes
removed and analyzed.

183
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,039
Bring me the results.

184
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,632
(<i> children laughing</i> )

185
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,760
AXUM:
Unimatrix Zero
is our sanctuary.

186
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,929
When we're here,
our thoughts are our own.

187
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,598
What was my function?

188
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,600
You're thinking like a Borg.

189
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,687
Our only function here
is to try and regain

190
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:59,899
a fragment of the
lives we lost when
we were assimilated.

191
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,860
Mr. Axum?

192
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,403
Go introduce yourself.

193
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,738
They won't mind.

194
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,988
Hello.

195
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,990
Do you want to play?
Sure.

196
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,201
FEMALE:
Siral. Over here.

197
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,871
Ah.
I was hoping
you'd come.

198
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,081
It's great to see you.

199
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,458
SIRAL:
It's always
good to be back.

200
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,544
I remember him.

201
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,045
You were friends.

202
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,257
You knew a lot
of people here.

203
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,010
You were part of our
lives for 18 years.

204
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,934
I'm willing to help...

205
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,686
but I can't
do it alone.

206
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,688
I'm part of a
starship crew now.

207
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,440
I'll have to
inform my Captain.

208
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,150
I told you
not to bring her here.

209
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,111
We can't do this
by ourselves.

210
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,696
It's too great a risk.

211
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,197
We don't have
a choice.

212
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,617
You do not speak
for all of us!

213
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,702
What would you
rather do?

214
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,246
Have us wait until
we're all discovered?

215
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,706
You disappoint me.

216
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,165
Where's your
warrior spirit?

217
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,876
<i>pahtk!</i>

218
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,837
I'll rip your
heart out.

219
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,839
Go ahead.

220
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,800
Kill me.

221
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,010
I'll be back when I begin
my next regeneration cycle.

222
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,430
You can't stop me, Korok.

223
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,059
If you come here again...

224
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,646
you'll be putting
your starship at risk

225
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,773
and all of us as well.

226
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,525
Shouldn't you be off
sharpening your teeth?

227
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,277
(<i> growls</i> )

228
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,907
I know you.

229
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,367
Your name is Laura.

230
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,828
You're human.

231
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,581
I was assimilated
at Wolf 359.

232
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,083
It's good to see you again.

233
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,544
But you look out of place.

234
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,880
Your cybernetic implants...

235
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,800
Our Doctor was unable to remove
all of my Borg components.

236
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,803
You don't have to
look that way here.

237
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,096
My appearance
is irrelevant.

238
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,015
No, it's not.

239
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,976
They may have turned
us into drones,

240
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,228
but they can't change
the essence of who we are.

241
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,982
My cycle is about to end.
Talk to your Captain.

242
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,108
We can't do this without...

243
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,253
PARIS:
<i>Another round with the Borg?</i>

244
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,464
We'd only need to infiltrate
a single vessel.

245
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,466
Oh. Just one?

246
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,302
I am prepared to take a
shuttle and do this alone.

247
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,179
No offense,
but how do you know

248
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,973
that this wasn't
some kind of a dream?

249
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,850
Seven was wearing
a cortical monitor.

250
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,644
She never reached REM sleep.
She wasn't dreaming.

251
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,897
Unimatrix Zero
is real,

252
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,148
and so are the people
who go there.

253
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,275
They need our help.

254
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,945
What else can you tell
us about this place?

255
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,573
How many drones?
No one is certain.

256
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,157
Axum told me
there could be tens of...

257
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,245
Axum?
He's... someone
I used to know.

258
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:03,332
He told me there could be
tens of thousands,
perhaps more.

259
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,501
How was it created?

260
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,046
Some of them believe
it began as a random malfunction

261
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,214
during the assimilation
of a single drone

262
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,966
and eventually spread
to the others.

263
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,052
Well, this is all
very interesting,

264
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,721
but are we sure it's worth
putting our lives on the line?

265
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,558
It's my understanding
that when we receive
a distress call, we respond--

266
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,727
Starfleet protocols.

267
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,229
She's right.
This is no different.

268
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,315
I understand
your reluctance,
but Seven's discovered

269
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,359
a potential weakness
in the collective.

270
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,236
Before we decide
how to proceed,

271
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,447
I'd like to learn
as much about it as we can.

272
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,324
Too bad you don't
have the luxury
of an interlink node.

273
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,660
There is another
possibility.

274
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,622
A Vulcan technique known
as "the bridging of minds."

275
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,206
Go on.

276
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,292
I would need to
initiate a mind-meld

277
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,921
with both you and
Seven, acting as a
telepathic conduit.

278
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,131
You make it sound
like a conference call.

279
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,508
Captain, it is my
professional opinion
that we wait until...

280
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,218
Objection noted.

281
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,388
I think you'll be
turning in early tonight.

282
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,981
Stay at Yellow Alert.
Maintain long-range scans
for Borg vessels.

283
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,899
Any sign of trouble,
you know where to find me.

284
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,526
This will be one
away mission for
the record books.

285
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,989
Mind-melds. The last time
I heard the words
"my mind to your mind,"

286
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,198
I had a headache
for two weeks.

287
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,409
I'm willing to volunteer
if you'd rather
hold down the fort.

288
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,286
I appreciate
your trying to protect me,

289
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,957
but a chance
to see this place...
it's worth a headache.

290
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,752
How many times
have you actually performed
this "bridging of heads"?

291
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,671
"Minds." Never.

292
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,422
Then how can you be
certain it'll work?

293
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,091
Nothing is certain, Doctor.

294
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,343
However, I once observed
a Vulcan master

295
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,178
perform the technique.

296
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,430
I am reasonably confident
I can duplicate his success.

297
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,307
Watching and doing
are two different things.

298
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,476
As always, your
logic is impeccable.

299
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,686
What a comfort.

300
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,062
We're ready,
Captain.

301
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,981
Let's do it.

302
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,494
As the conduit,
I'll be aware

303
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,245
of both your
perceptions.

304
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,124
If something goes wrong,
I'll break the meld.

305
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,709
Understood.

306
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,592
Your minds
to my mind.

307
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:23,263
Your thoughts
to my thoughts.

308
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,767
Your minds
to my mind.

309
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,480
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

310
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,864
Welcome to
Unimatrix Zero.

311
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,615
Seven?

312
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,410
Annika.

313
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,537
That's what I'm called here.

314
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,789
(<i> laughter</i> )

315
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,499
(<i> laughing and talking</i> )

316
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,294
Drones?

317
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,924
Come on, let's find Axum.

318
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,390
We're close.

319
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,560
I can almost hear them.

320
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,939
Bring us closer.

321
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,038
There.

322
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,623
Amplify.

323
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,923
Disrupt the frequency.

324
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,471
It's not working.

325
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,933
They're using
a triaxialating modulation.

326
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:54,188
You're making this
very difficult.

327
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,483
If we can't terminate
their link...

328
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:03,489
then we'll simply
have to pay them a visit.

329
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,783
You can see why we want
to protect this place.

330
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,952
We're prepared
to help you,

331
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,122
but I'm concerned that we'd
only be putting
off the inevitable.

332
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,832
Even if we succeeded,

333
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,960
and you could remain hidden
for a year, ten years,

334
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,587
the Borg would eventually
find you again.

335
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,423
Have you ever considered
a more permanent solution?

336
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,301
More permanent?

337
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,594
You've got a remarkable
sanctuary here,

338
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,638
but that's all it is.

339
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,976
Maybe it's time to stop hiding
and find a way to fight back.

340
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,520
That's not possible.

341
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:38,524
If you could find a way
to carry your individualities
into the real world--

342
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,776
to wake up from
your regeneration cycles

343
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,653
with your memories
intact--

344
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,447
you could begin to undermine
the Borg's control over you.

345
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,951
That sounds like
you're suggesting a civil war.

346
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,037
I'd prefer to call it...

347
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,747
a resistance movement.

348
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,917
That's very
ambitious, Captain,

349
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,086
but we can't retain
our memories.

350
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,798
Not yet,
but we know a good deal
about Borg technology.

351
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,926
Maybe we could...
(<i> shouting</i> )

352
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,638
(<i> gasping</i> )

353
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,640
(<i> panicked yelling</i> )

354
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,571
(<i> panicked yelling</i> )

355
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,542
(<i> gasping</i> )

356
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,631
We've found another.

357
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,633
Spatial Grid 326.

358
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,802
Cube 1184.

359
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,346
Continue.

360
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,773
(<i> gasping</i> )

361
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,942
(<i> screaming</i> )

362
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,153
(<i> groaning</i> )

363
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,909
Welcome back.

364
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,535
Spatial Grid 982.

365
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,371
Cube 461.

366
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,214
No.

367
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,258
(<i> panting</i> )

368
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,343
(<i> warlike roar</i> )

369
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,677
(<i> grunting</i> )

370
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,901
(<i> Klingon gagging</i> )

371
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,615
Janeway.

372
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,075
(<i> grunts</i> )

373
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,218
How's your headache?

374
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,354
I'm guessing
it didn't go well.

375
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,397
Let's just say
we ran into a little trouble.

376
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,941
Have a seat, Commander.
I prefer to stand.

377
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,113
The collective's found a way
to infiltrate Unimatrix Zero.

378
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,199
It won't be long
before they learn enough

379
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,201
to destroy it
from the inside out.

380
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,911
I plan to stop them.

381
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,705
What have you got
in mind?

382
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,249
The people there
are vulnerable.

383
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,001
They don't have
the ability

384
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,212
to take action
in the real world.

385
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,339
We're going to give
them that ability.

386
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,883
How?

387
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,469
The Doctor and B'Elanna
are working on it.

388
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,388
I know what you're thinking.

389
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,391
We'd be violating
half a dozen
Starfleet protocols,

390
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,435
and if the collective ever
learned we were involved,

391
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,896
we'd be putting<i> Voyager</i>
<i>in the middle of a civil war.</i>

392
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,605
Valid objections.

393
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,942
Chakotay...

394
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,529
we've had our disagreements,

395
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,198
and there have been times
when I've chosen to proceed

396
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,991
without your support.

397
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,785
But this can't be
one of those times.

398
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,665
I won't do this
without my First Officer.

399
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,834
The way I see it,

400
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,170
risking the safety
of<i> Voyager</i> is a small
price to pay.

401
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,172
If we help these people,

402
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,508
this could be the turning point
in our battle against the Borg.

403
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,427
I'm glad we agree,

404
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,803
because I almost talked myself
out of it.

405
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,223
Somehow, I don't think

406
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,850
you were ever in danger
of doing that.

407
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,186
You'll inform the crew?

408
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,111
DOCTOR:
This is the nanovirus
Axum designed to prevent

409
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,947
the Borg from detecting those
with the genetic mutation,

410
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,698
but I've modified it
to nullify

411
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,409
their cortical inhibitors
instead.

412
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,202
Once they're infected,
they should retain

413
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,954
their memories
of Unimatrix Zero

414
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,956
after they leave
their alcoves.

415
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,333
Does that mean they'll be able
to function as individuals?

416
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,876
Stand up to the collective?

417
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,336
There's no way to tell.

418
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,088
This is highly
experimental.

419
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,590
How do we deploy it?

420
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,091
TORRES:
Correct me
if I'm wrong,

421
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,968
but each Borg vessel
has a device

422
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,304
that links it
to every other Borg ship.

423
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,679
The central plexus.

424
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,432
If we can gain access

425
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:24,226
to one of those
and release the virus there,

426
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,019
it should be transmitted
throughout the collective...

427
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,480
instantly.

428
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,690
Any Borg activity
in the region?

429
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:37,364
They just dropped out of
transwarp 3.6 light-years
from here.

430
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,784
This is a class-4
tactical vessel, heavily armed.

431
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:45,038
The central plexus is protected
by multiregenerative
security grids.

432
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,082
We'd be detected
long before we could reach it.

433
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,126
Meet me
in Engineering.

434
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,628
We're going
to find a way in.

435
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,172
Prepare the virus.
Aye, Captain.

436
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,806
I think it's time for you
to take another nap.

437
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,058
Pay a visit
to Unimatrix Zero.

438
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,685
Tell our friends
we haven't forgotten them.

439
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,687
I couldn't help
but notice

440
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,982
you were a little different
in Unimatrix Zero,

441
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,734
and I don't mean
your lack of Borg implants.

442
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,321
You seemed more...
Human.

443
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,658
If you don't mind
my saying so, it suited you.

444
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,494
I've been told
I spent a great
deal of time there,

445
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,703
but since I don't
remember Unimatrix Zero

446
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,123
any more than
I remember Earth,
it's irrelevant.

447
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:31,544
To you, maybe,
but if what I saw
was any indication,

448
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,629
Annika would disagree.

449
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,552
AXUM:
<i>The Klingons</i>
<i>have banded together,</i>

450
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,638
and they're giving
<i>bat'leths</i> to anybody
who can handle one.

451
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,306
Hirogen hunters
are moving

452
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,016
through the forest,
targeting drones,

453
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,310
but we're losing
people every hour.

454
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,729
Captain Janeway intends
to keep her promise.

455
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,772
This isn't your battle.

456
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,733
You don't owe us anything.

457
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,319
<i>Voyager</i> won't abandon you.

458
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,991
A gift from Korok.

459
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,161
Takes some
getting used to.

460
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,330
I'm sure you'll adapt.

461
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,709
11 more drones.

462
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,168
300 meters.

463
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,671
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

464
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,055
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

465
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,548
Sorry.

466
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,888
That felt... familiar--

467
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,890
our touching.

468
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,935
I told you, we were friends.

469
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,937
Elaborate.

470
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,857
Now is not the best time.

471
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,415
We were more than friends...

472
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,042
weren't we?

473
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,798
Why didn't you tell me?

474
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,467
You'd forgotten.

475
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,927
It wasn't my place.

476
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,516
How long?
Six years.

477
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:54,102
Only while we were
regenerating.

478
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:58,565
A very memorable six years.

479
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,609
For me, anyway.

480
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,570
I should return
to<i> Voyager.</i>

481
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,532
Annika...

482
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,326
My name is Seven of Nine.

483
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,340
DOCTOR:
Can't we find another Borg ship?

484
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,509
A sphere, maybe?
Something less
imposing?

485
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,928
I rechecked
long-range sensors.
There's nothing.

486
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,514
This is our target.

487
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,599
You'll keep a transporter
lock on me.

488
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,393
Once I make it
to the central plexus

489
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,228
and release the virus,
you can beam me back.

490
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,647
In how many pieces?
It's ridiculous!

491
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,315
Agreed.
I should go.

492
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,150
I'm the only one
with experience.

493
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,444
You're our only connection
to Unimatrix Zero.

494
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,945
You're needed here.

495
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,741
It was my decision
to help these people.

496
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,325
This is
my responsibility.

497
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,745
Starfleet Tactical
Directive 36:

498
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,747
"The Captain
will not engage
a hostile force

499
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,957
without the protection
of a security officer."

500
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,336
The probability of
success is greater
if there are two of us.

501
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,130
Make that three.
If you're going
to pull this off,

502
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,674
you'll need an engineer
in there.

503
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,843
B'Elanna...
Tactical Directive 36-A.

504
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,303
There is no
Directive 36-A.

505
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,971
There is now.

506
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,891
I appreciate the offer,

507
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,726
but if that cube attacks
<i>Voyager,</i>

508
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,060
you'll be needed here.

509
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,729
Now you have
your orders.

510
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,980
Set a course, Mr. Paris.

511
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,656
Remember when I said
I didn't have
any objections?

512
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,909
Can't this wait
till I get back?

513
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,244
I realize I'm not going
to talk you out of this,

514
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,580
but I'll be damned
if you're going
in there alone.

515
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,832
We've got a lot of
work to do, Commander.

516
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,834
You said you
wanted my support.

517
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,253
Then take Tuvok and
B'Elanna with you.

518
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,755
And if I don't?

519
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,299
I may only be First Officer,

520
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,384
but I still pull a few
strings around here.

521
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,886
The Doctor could be persuaded

522
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,846
to question your
medical fitness.

523
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,892
I was hoping for
your unconditional support.

524
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,894
This is the best I can do.

525
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,564
Tell them to pack light.

526
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,400
Janeway to Bridge. Report.

527
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,736
Someone's trying to tap
into the main computer.

528
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,488
Source?

529
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,866
It's some kind
of transwarp signal.

530
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,452
It's activating the com system.

531
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,959
(<i> pressing buttons</i> )

532
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,671
Captain...

533
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,381
I think it's for you.

534
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,770
Captain.

535
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,064
It's been a long time.

536
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,944
How are things
in the collective?

537
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,445
Perfect...

538
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,322
for the most part.

539
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,073
<i>Voyager?</i>

540
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,034
Never better.

541
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,329
I understand
you've established contact
with Starfleet.

542
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:03,000
Perhaps you'll be getting home
sooner than you expected.

543
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,584
Perhaps.

544
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,879
We could help you.

545
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,672
How so?

546
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,966
Transwarp technology.

547
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:14,135
You'd find that we can
be quite accommodating...

548
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,262
but we'd expect the same
in return.

549
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:20,141
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

550
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,688
You know exactly what I mean.

551
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,439
Tend to your own crew.

552
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,275
Stay away from things
that don't concern you.

553
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,696
I'm afraid I can't do that,
but thanks for the offer.

554
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:37,075
I won't be as accommodating
next time.

555
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,452
Reconsider.

556
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,329
I'm sorry.

557
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,836
We'll see you soon, Harry.

558
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,842
What does she
mean by<i> that?</i>

559
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,221
Why this stab
at diplomacy?

560
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,891
She's trying to find
out what we're up to.

561
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,809
She's worried.

562
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:06,271
Have B'Elanna and Tuvok
meet me in Sick Bay.

563
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,201
Watch the starboard
plasma injectors.

564
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,788
They tend to run
a little hot at
high impulse.

565
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,372
I'll keep an eye on it.

566
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,000
And the warp matrix
is out of alignment.

567
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,127
By .3 microns.

568
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,963
Since when are you
so meticulous?

569
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,549
Since you volunteered
for this insane mission.

570
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,552
You know...
(<i> chuckles</i> )

571
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,345
I could sabotage
the helm.

572
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,139
You'd never make it
out the launch doors.

573
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,141
And I'd have to put you
on report.

574
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,102
You might lose
that new pip of yours.

575
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,938
It'd be a small
price to pay.

576
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,321
TUVOK:
We're in visual range.

577
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,239
On screen.

578
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,492
Magnify.

579
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,538
Torres to Bridge.

580
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,165
Go ahead.

581
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,209
The<i> Delta Flyer</i>
<i>is ready for launch.</i>

582
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,962
On my way.

583
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,842
(<i> sighs</i> )

584
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,969
Guess I'd better be going, huh?

585
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:22,014
Anything you'd like done
around here while you're gone?

586
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,558
Gravity plating recalibrated,
carpets cleaned?

587
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,814
Surprise me.

588
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,778
You have the Bridge.

589
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,833
You need to prepare
the others.

590
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,417
When they leave
their alcoves,

591
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,837
they may be startled,
disoriented.

592
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,048
But they have to behave
like drones,

593
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,841
or we could all be exposed.

594
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,343
Our ships are scattered
across the galaxy.

595
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,470
Most of us will be
the only drone on board

596
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,181
who knows about
this place.

597
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,516
She's right.
What can we hope to achieve?

598
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,186
We should each gather as much
tactical data as we can--

599
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,772
what kind of ship we're on,
its armaments, location.

600
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,775
Then we'll coordinate
our efforts from here.

601
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,073
If all goes well,

602
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,491
we'll be working
very closely together.

603
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,660
As colleagues.

604
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,662
Nothing more.

605
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,126
Our previous...

606
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,753
friendship...

607
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,505
Yes?

608
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,425
It's irrelevant.

609
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,468
"Irrelevant."

610
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,889
Well, now that I'll be able
to retain my memory,

611
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,974
I'll keep that in mind.

612
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:12,207
Report!
Direct hit to their
shield emitters! No damage!

613
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,959
Increase phaser yield.

614
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,501
Where's the<i> Flyer?</i>

615
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:20,006
They're approaching.
Heading 017 mark 3.

616
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,476
Status?

617
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,103
<i>Voyager</i> has sustained damage,

618
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,230
but they are continuing
their assault.

619
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,899
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Come on, Chakotay.

620
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,652
One of the cube's shield grids
is fluctuating--

621
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,155
ventral axis,
secondary emitter.

622
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,906
Cut primary power.

623
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,033
Thrusters only.

624
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,708
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

625
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,377
Tactical Cube 138
is under attack.

626
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,594
Our forward shields
are down!

627
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,887
The<i> Flyer.</i>

628
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,181
They're closing.

629
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,515
50 kilometers.

630
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,309
Maintain fire.

631
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,937
30 kilometers.
Twenty.

632
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,231
They're in range.

633
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,735
Enhance Grid 6119.

634
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,865
Captain...

635
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,243
I expected something
more cunning from you.

636
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,786
TORRES:
It's time.

637
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,332
Their ventral shield grid?

638
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,002
Still fluctuating at
a rate of .06 terahertz.

639
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,879
Align our transporters to match.

640
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,255
Aye.

641
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,800
They've detected them.

642
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,860
They're inside.

643
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,696
Direct hit to the port nacelle!
We're venting plasma!

644
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,740
Should I back off?

645
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,991
No.

646
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,452
We need to stay close.

647
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,568
They've adapted.

648
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,172
Hull breach! Deck 11!

649
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,967
Aah! They're targeting
our warp core.

650
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,095
No change yet.

651
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,278
We'll have to take
the long way around.

652
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,739
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Tuvok.

653
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,351
(<i> grunts in pain</i> )

654
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,818
(<i> yells</i> )

655
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,494
(<i> inhales deeply</i> )

656
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,169
Their life signs
are destabilizing.

657
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,755
So far, so good.

658
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,010
You can take us
out of here now, Tom.
