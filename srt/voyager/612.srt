1
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,056
That's one planet
that never showed up
on the multiple choice exam.

2
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,726
TUVOK:
Its gravimetric readings
are similar

3
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,895
to that of a collapsed
dwarf star.

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,858
It also resembles a quasar
in that it has a high rate
of rotation--

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,234
approximately 58 revolutions
per minute.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,111
Shall we take
a closer look?

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,488
That's what we're here for.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,281
Tom, put us
in a high orbit.

9
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,700
Aye.

10
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,748
(<i> console beeping</i> )

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,417
Our warp drive
is off-line.

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,504
Why?
Unknown.

13
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,172
Back us off.

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,090
Our impulse engines
aren't responding.

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,134
Then use
the auxiliary thrusters.

16
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,263
We're in some kind
of gravimetric gradient.

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,265
It's pulling us
toward the planet.

18
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,594
The new one
is brighter than Tahal

19
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,972
or any of his brothers
in the sky.

20
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,807
What does he want from us?

21
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,475
SHAMAN:
To answer that,

22
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,644
we must learn
the nature of this god.

23
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,856
We must understand
the reason for his arrival.

24
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,527
You were making
an offering to Tahal.

25
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,905
I placed the fire-fruit
on his altar.

26
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,948
Then the ground shook.

27
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,161
I looked up...
and the new one was there.

28
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,664
The fire-fruit-- where is it?

29
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:21,845
The new one doesn't want Tahal
to have the fire-fruit.

30
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,641
Make an altar for him...
as big as Tahal's.

31
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,270
The fire-fruit
is only for the new one.

32
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,397
No more for the people!

33
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,315
It is his alone.

34
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,904
Ground Shaker...

35
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,531
Light Bringer...

36
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,243
take this today and every day!

37
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,620
Accept our offering!

38
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,039
Do not harm us.

39
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,587
Report.
We're in synchronous orbit,

40
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,298
57,000 kilometers
above the planet's equator.

41
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,259
Good work, Tom.
Now let's see...

42
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,927
You're patting the wrong guy
on the back.

43
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,887
Explain.

44
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,224
Our thrusters went off-line
halfway through our descent,

45
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,351
and then we just stopped,
like we were caught
in something.

46
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,396
I'm picking up a strong
tachyon field along the hull.

47
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,107
It could be
what's holding us.

48
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,316
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

49
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,818
Go ahead, Seven.

50
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,486
Please report to Astrometrics.

51
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,446
There's something you must see.
On my way.

52
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,115
Chakotay.

53
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,702
SEVEN:
This planet has a tachyon core.

54
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,122
It's produced a subspace
particle field

55
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,873
which runs between the poles.

56
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,542
<i>Voyager's</i> arrival
disrupted that field.

57
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,336
It looks like
the ship's been caught
in an eddy of some kind.

58
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,006
It's worse than that.

59
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,841
<i>Voyager</i> seems
to have become

60
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,550
the planet's
third pole.

61
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,637
The imbalance is affecting
the outer crust.

62
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,473
I've picked up indications of
high-frequency seismic activity.

63
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,434
Caused by our presence?
Possibly.

64
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,104
Does anybody
live down there?

65
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,857
SEVEN:
The atmosphere is having
a scattering effect

66
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,275
on our sensors.

67
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,526
Is that vegetation?

68
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,402
According to sensors, yes.

69
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,239
The tachyon core has created
a space-time differential

70
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,616
between the planet
and the surrounding space.

71
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,911
We're watching the seasons
change in a matter of seconds.

72
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,664
For each second
that passes on<i> Voyager,</i>

73
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,791
nearly a day goes by
on the planet.

74
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,045
Scan for inhabitants.

75
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,256
I can't isolate
individual life-forms.

76
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,134
It'll take time to correct
for the space-time differential.

77
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,636
A couple of hundred
years, maybe?

78
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,680
If our orbit starts to decay,

79
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,849
<i>Voyager</i> will begin to feel
the effects of the differential,

80
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,392
and we'll begin aging
hundreds of times faster

81
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,312
than we would in normal space.

82
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,273
Unless we want to live our lives
in the blink of an eye,

83
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,775
I suggest we find
a way out of here.

84
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,241
How's our warp core?

85
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,701
The matter/antimatter reaction
is still active,

86
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,954
but this field we're stuck in
is raising hell
with the nacelles.

87
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,041
Until we break orbit,
warp drive is off-line.

88
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,126
And without warp drive,
we'll never leave orbit.

89
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,255
It does pose a bit
of a problem,
doesn't it?

90
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,091
Maybe the key is to learn
more about this planet,

91
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,009
in case we're
missing something.

92
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,511
The sensors aren't having
an easy time of it, either.

93
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,890
Then let's modify
a class-5 probe
for low orbit.

94
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,393
See what
we can pick up.

95
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,228
Configure the program

96
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,314
to scan along all subspace
bands, and set it

97
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,108
for visual images
every ten milliseconds.

98
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,860
Snapshots.

99
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,322
Why do I get the feeling
you're not just interested
in tachyon fields?

100
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:31,118
This could be the greatest
anthropological find
of my career.

101
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,161
If there's an intelligent
species down there,

102
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,163
we'll be able to track
their development--

103
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,291
not just for days or weeks,
but for centuries.

104
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,833
Watch them discover
new and better ways

105
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,585
of beating each other
over the head.

106
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,089
They won't necessarily
follow the Klingon model.

107
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,133
As opposed to the human model?

108
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,177
It'll take a few hours
to make the adjustments.

109
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,971
A few hours.

110
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,556
We might miss the rise
and fall of a civilization.

111
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,351
So we'll watch the next one.

112
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,998
(<i> coughs</i> )

113
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,170
Oh. Oh, Protector.

114
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,587
You're late.

115
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,631
Well, the hill
is steep, and I...

116
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,549
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

117
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,178
More heat.
Yes, Protector.

118
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,848
There are grave
matters of state here
that cannot be delayed.

119
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,310
Oh, Protector,
what exactly are you doing?

120
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,270
PROTECTOR:
I'm sending
him a letter.

121
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,314
Him?

122
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,233
S-S-Sending who a letter?

123
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,736
The Ground Shaker.
The Light Bringer.

124
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,365
Well, had you been
more attentive to my lessons

125
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:55,452
when you were a boy,
you would not be
so gullible as a man.

126
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,121
On the contrary--
you taught me well.

127
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,875
Our ignorant ancestors believed
every star was a deity.

128
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,710
You taught me
how foolish that was.

129
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,087
Superstition,
you called it.

130
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,798
And that's exactly what it is.

131
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,847
Hungry?

132
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,934
Well, it's, uh, bad fortune
to eat the fire-fruit.

133
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,936
According to whom?

134
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,022
Our ancestors?

135
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,649
Don't tell me you believe
that old superstition.

136
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,612
Perhaps we shouldn't
completely ignore
the old beliefs,

137
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,367
no matter how strange
they may seem today.

138
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,617
Ground Shaker...

139
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,495
Ground... Shaker.

140
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,831
Isn't it possible the name
was not given arbitrarily?

141
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,209
That this star
is indeed responsible

142
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,793
for knocking down our walls

143
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,088
and making us stumble
as we walk?

144
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,924
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Oh, yes, I heard about that--
my condolences.

145
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,926
You heard what?

146
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,262
Well, that you stumbled
in front of several
important people

147
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,099
uh, d-d-during
the last ground shake.

148
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,642
Uh, very embarrassing, I'm sure.

149
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,478
I did nothing of the sort.

150
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,105
Well, my, uh...

151
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,357
uh, uh...
my hearing is not as good

152
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,317
as it used to be,
nor my memory, either.

153
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,946
Now, uh... uh,
what were we talking about?

154
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,657
We were talking
about ancient superstitions.

155
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,952
Now, I don't believe
for a moment

156
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,581
that the stars are gods,
but then, what are they?

157
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:27,335
A great mystery
to which there is no answer.

158
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:31,298
I believe the sky
is full of people
just like ourselves.

159
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,840
(<i> gasps</i> ):
Wha...?

160
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,426
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Oh, nonsense.

161
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,969
Prove me wrong.

162
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,763
I say each star
encompasses a city,

163
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,391
and the Ground Shaker rules
one of these cities--

164
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,310
a fellow Protector.

165
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,895
If I'm correct, then
he'll listen to me,

166
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,648
one Protector to another.
Your pen.

167
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,330
I, Kelemane...

168
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,664
"Kelemane..."

169
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,500
son of Kelemane,

170
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,002
ruler of the good people
of the land below you,

171
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,046
demand that you stop
what you're...
"Demand"?

172
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,215
"Would hope"?

173
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,925
Ah, better. Much better.

174
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,928
...would hope that
you might consider

175
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,930
putting an end to whatever it
is you're doing

176
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,224
that shakes our ground.

177
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,226
If this causes
you inconvenience,

178
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,895
I'm willing
to offer a recompense.

179
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:34,110
"...a recom... pense."

180
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,155
I await your reply.

181
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,371
The next series of scans
is coming through.

182
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,789
I'm downloading them
into the display buffer.

183
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,210
No doubt about it.

184
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,878
There's a city down there.

185
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,548
Elevated levels of
carbon monoxide, ammonium--

186
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,717
that's progress, all right.

187
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,968
They've developed
internal combustion technology

188
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,138
since the last few scans.
Look at those radial lines.

189
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,182
It looks like
a system of roads.

190
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,268
Well, one thing hasn't changed.

191
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,521
The geological disturbances
that<i> Voyager</i> seems
to be causing.

192
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,232
The probe recorded
half a dozen each month.

193
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,526
Still no way to tell
how severe they are.

194
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,903
Look at the amount of iron
being used in that city.

195
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,697
That's ten times
what you'd expect to see

196
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,781
in a culture
at this stage of development.

197
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,201
Do you think they're using it
to support their buildings?

198
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,078
If you lived on a planet
that wouldn't stop shaking,

199
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,330
you might be doing
the same thing.

200
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,125
If they've reached this stage
of industrial development,

201
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,085
they must be observing us.

202
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,836
(<i> console beeps</i> )

203
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,050
The probe's impulse thrusters
are starting to fail.

204
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,178
At its present altitude,
it's been operating
for over 200 years.

205
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,264
Its orbit
is becoming decayed.

206
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,391
Initiate self-destruct.

207
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,897
It disintegrated
in the upper thermosphere.

208
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,359
If they saw anything, it just
looked like a shooting star.

209
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,090
Any response
to our transmission?

210
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,425
Nothing.

211
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,970
No visual change either.

212
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,806
Surprised?

213
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,434
Send it again.

214
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,645
The entire sequence?

215
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,522
How about
just the prime numbers?

216
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,565
You're tired.

217
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,609
So are you.

218
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,364
The prime numbers
and the elemental constants.

219
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,740
Then we'll stop.

220
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,826
An acceptable compromise.

221
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,371
It's not as if
they're going anywhere,

222
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,498
if they even exist
in the first place.

223
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,082
Do you doubt that?

224
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,585
I doubt everything.

225
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,963
So you weren't one
of those children

226
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:45,635
that had the entire series
of Sky Ship Friends, hmm?

227
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,388
Actually, I had them all,
even the duplicates.

228
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,432
You couldn't walk into my home
without tripping over
a friend or two.

229
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,060
Not in our home.

230
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,604
My grandfather
wouldn't allow it.

231
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,066
He told us that the Sky Ship
was a palace

232
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,443
where an evil Protector
lived.

233
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,946
He said that bad children
were sent there to be punished.

234
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,745
At this point,
I'd be happy to see anything...

235
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,165
evil or not.

236
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,210
Can you boost
the signal?

237
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,838
We're already at maximum.

238
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,631
Maybe if we
switched

239
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,008
to a different
carrier wave...

240
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,802
(<i> rumbling</i> )

241
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,058
If there is somebody up there,
they don't like us very much.

242
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,977
Any beings capable
of building that Sky Ship

243
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,980
could have destroyed
our world long ago.

244
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,234
They're not causing
the tremors on purpose.

245
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,697
What if they're all dead?

246
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,785
If you truly believe that,
why did you join this project?

247
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,078
Well, I doubt everything,
remember?

248
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,996
Even my own doubts.

249
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,626
I hope someone is up there.

250
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,419
So do I.

251
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,258
If they won't respond
to mathematics,

252
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,596
perhaps we should try
a more personal approach.

253
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,265
Here.

254
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,145
Say hello.

255
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,148
How could they possibly speak
our language?

256
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,400
There's only one way
to find out.

257
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,613
What... what
should I say?

258
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,282
Oh, "Glad
to meet you.

259
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,033
Where are you from?

260
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,286
Please stop
shaking our planet."

261
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,004
(<i> console beeping</i> )

262
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,965
An ultrahigh frequency signal

263
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,342
is being transmitted
from the surface.

264
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,304
The modulation
is unfamiliar.

265
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,640
Its Doppler
component is...

266
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,100
Any signal from the surface
will be accelerated.

267
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,102
When it reached
our time frame,

268
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,814
the frequency would be
thousands of times
higher than normal.

269
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,649
I'll attempt to
slow it down.

270
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,359
(<i> high tones</i> )

271
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,568
Again.

272
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,987
(<i> lower tones sound</i> )

273
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,155
Amplitude modulation.

274
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,949
It's a radio transmission.

275
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,659
(<i> signal beeping</i> )

276
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,953
It's a numerical
sequence.

277
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,164
Prime numbers.

278
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,583
They're sending
a list of prime numbers.

279
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,336
Followed by a sequence
of mathematical constants

280
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,714
and what appears
to be a vocal modulation.

281
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,007
Slow it down again.

282
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,843
(<i> squeaking</i> )

283
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,887
A little more.

284
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,931
Good friends in the Sky Ship--

285
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,058
I call you that,

286
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,144
hoping at least
you're not enemies.

287
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,271
There's nothing on our world

288
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,691
that resembles your technology,

289
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,818
so we assume you came here

290
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,112
from a nearby planet
or a distant star.

291
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:57,035
Our ancient mythology describes
your arrival centuries ago

292
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,995
coinciding with the tremors

293
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,330
that continually
shake our planet

294
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:05,292
and destroy so many
of our accomplishments.

295
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,462
I hope that was never
your intention.

296
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,632
But the result is the same.

297
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,844
Respond if you can,
or if you wish,

298
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,014
come down from your Sky Ship
and visit us.

299
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,516
Well, we've got to let them know
we're not doing it on purpose.

300
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,226
TUVOK:
Inadvisable.

301
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,270
The Prime Directive
still applies.

302
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,815
This transmission was made
with primitive radio technology.

303
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,192
They are not
a warp-capable civilization.

304
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,569
To hell with the
Prime Directive.

305
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,571
That man deserves an answer.

306
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,281
Don't forget
the temporal differential.

307
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,825
That<i> man</i> has been dead
for a long time.

308
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,744
Nearly a century by now.

309
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,039
Okay, so we send a message
to his great-grandchildren.

310
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,624
I'll gladly do the honors.

311
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,250
Ancient mythology--

312
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,168
that means we've already
insinuated ourselves

313
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,420
into their culture.

314
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,213
Why not take the next step?

315
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,634
First contact
with the pre-warp society.

316
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,761
We've already made
first contact.

317
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,178
They know we're up here.

318
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,223
They've known
for hundreds of years,

319
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,477
which means our presence
has been tempered by time.

320
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,106
We've gradually become
part of their mythos.

321
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,567
Meeting us could
throw that belief
system into chaos.

322
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,528
But we're destroying
their planet.
You heard him.

323
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,239
A first contact, face-to-face,

324
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,367
might give us information
we could use to leave orbit.

325
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,245
That would stop the damage.
It's worth the risk.

326
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,123
We don't even know
if an away team

327
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,458
could survive the transition
to their time frame.

328
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,836
Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong,

329
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,130
but the physiological stress
could be fatal.

330
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,008
For one of you, perhaps,
but not for me.

331
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,259
My holo-matrix
would be unaffected.

332
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,436
You'd be going
only as an observer.

333
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,983
You're not to
make contact.

334
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,276
I localized the source
of the transmission

335
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,779
to a subcontinent
in the southern
hemisphere.

336
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,490
The Central Protectorate.
How do you know that?

337
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,076
I've been looking at the data
from Astrometrics.

338
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,871
Seven's picked up a few
of their local transmissions.

339
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,957
I can tell you the names
of all 26 states on the planet.

340
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,417
And all the best places to eat?
Just about.

341
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,378
So, is this Central
Protectorate

342
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,421
a good place to
send the Doctor?

343
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,507
Probably. Judging
from the transmissions,

344
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,052
they seem to have
a tolerant society.

345
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,387
Hmm. Well, just to
be on the safe side,

346
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,765
I'll find him
an isolated spot.

347
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,894
I'm giving you access
to your facial
and epidermal parameters.

348
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,937
You should be able
to mimic the appearance

349
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,439
of whoever is down there
in a matter of seconds.

350
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,359
What if they're big
purple blobs of protoplasm?

351
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,486
Then you'll be the best-looking
blob on the planet.

352
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,364
I'm keeping you down there
for three seconds, Doctor.

353
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,992
That'll be almost two days
in their time frame.

354
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,618
Gather whatever data you can--

355
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,913
seismic charts,
meteorological records,

356
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,916
anything that might give us
a clue about how to break orbit.

357
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,417
Understood.

358
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,835
This will speed up
the scanning rate

359
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,336
of your program...

360
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,589
allow you to make
the transition.

361
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,299
(<i> sighs</i> )

362
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,552
See you soon.

363
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,641
Energizing.

364
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,897
One...

365
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,815
two...

366
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,400
three.

367
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,824
The confinement beam
is destabilizing.

368
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,494
It's the temporal field.
We'll have to recalibrate.

369
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,789
Every second he's down
there, he's in danger
of being discovered.

370
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,832
Locking on again.

371
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,465
We've lost him.

372
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,847
I'm scanning within
a 100-kilometer radius

373
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,891
of where we sent
him-- nothing.

374
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,435
He could've moved
across the continent by now

375
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,146
or to the other side
of the planet.

376
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,355
Increasing radius
to 1,000 kilometers.

377
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,485
Chakotay to Seven of Nine.

378
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,070
SEVEN:
Go ahead, Commander.

379
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,738
Have you picked up
any information

380
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,616
regarding opera houses
or concert halls?

381
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,367
The cultural center
of the state runs

382
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,870
along the shore
of the eastern lake.

383
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,835
Got him.

384
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,419
B'Elanna, stand by

385
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,504
for the coordinates.

386
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,422
Acknowledged.

387
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,842
I've reinitialized
the confinement beam.

388
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,427
It's holding.
Locking on.

389
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,352
Captain!

390
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,855
Lieutenant!

391
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,439
(<i> grunts</i> )

392
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,900
I thought I'd never
see you again.

393
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,735
Are you all right?

394
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,779
Oh, I-I've had
a few close calls
over the years,

395
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,447
but all in all...
"Years"?

396
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,241
It's been over three.

397
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,743
But at least I knew you
hadn't left me behind.

398
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,620
All I had to do was look
up, and there you were,

399
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,289
the brightest
star in the sky.

400
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,124
Well, what do they
know about us?

401
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,584
Only that we arrived here
centuries ago.

402
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,545
They blame us for
the seismic tremors,

403
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,755
but everything else
is pure speculation.

404
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,257
And let me tell you,

405
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,009
they like nothing better

406
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,969
than to speculate
about<i> Voyager.</i>

407
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,096
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Doric would go
on and on--

408
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,016
"Sky Ship this,
Sky Ship that."
Doric?

409
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,851
The owner of the
building I lived in,

410
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,311
until the war started.

411
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,812
There was a war?

412
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,981
Oh... the neighboring
state decided

413
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,817
to lob a few cannon
shells at us.

414
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,861
Our tactical air
command responded,

415
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,572
and a new treaty
was signed...
in a matter of weeks,

416
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,574
but not before my
apartment was in ruins.

417
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,868
Oh, so they have
aviation technology?

418
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,995
They're hardly
savages, Captain.

419
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,497
In fact, they're
making great strides
technologically,

420
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,624
thanks, in part,
to<i> Voyager.</i>

421
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,252
What do you mean?

422
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,461
From the moment our ship
arrived in the sky,

423
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,463
they've been trying
to make contact.

424
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,675
Our presence...
has encouraged invention,

425
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,426
religion,
science, art,

426
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,096
even children's toys.

427
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,223
They're all variations
on a single theme--

428
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,933
<i>Voyager.</i>

429
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,893
Mariza even composed an aria

430
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,937
based on
the Sky Ship.

431
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,563
I sang the lyric.

432
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,981
Mariza?

433
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,317
She was my...

434
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,069
roommate.

435
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,447
(<i> sighs</i> )

436
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,243
Three years is a long time,
Captain.

437
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,453
One needs...

438
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,497
companionship.

439
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,666
You'll get no argument from me.

440
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,629
But did you learn anything

441
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,756
that might help
us break orbit?

442
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,133
It's all in here.

443
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,634
(<i> sighs</i> )

444
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,178
Meteorological
records

445
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,638
for the last 300 years--

446
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,098
I've committed them all
to memory.

447
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,724
Some are
inaccurate almanacs,

448
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,017
but the more
recent ones include

449
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,727
detailed seismic analyses.

450
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,562
Get that information
to Astrometrics.

451
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,606
See if you can find any
pattern to the quakes.

452
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,691
Might help us figure
a way out of here.

453
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,527
See you in Sick Bay.
I'll download the data
from your program,

454
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,405
and we'll do
a little cosmetic surgery, too.

455
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,948
Lieutenant?

456
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,409
Unless you prefer
looking like that.

457
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,621
Of course-- I completely forgot.

458
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,124
(<i> chuckles</i> )
I must tell you,

459
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,084
if some of the people
on the planet had their way,

460
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,337
those weapons would
be pointed at<i> Voyager.</i>

461
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,173
Luckily, the ship is still
out of range-- for now.

462
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,841
I guess I can't
blame them.

463
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,676
There's something
of a space race going on

464
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,345
between the various states.

465
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,973
Who can get to the starship
first with a rocket?

466
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,600
Are we talking about a
capsule with an astronaut

467
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,727
or a missile
with a warhead?

468
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,648
I can't answer that.
But at their present rate
of development,

469
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,234
we won't have to wait
very long to find out.

470
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,113
How does this sound?

471
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,115
"The Weird Planet
Where Time Moved Very Fast

472
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,493
and So Did the People
Who Lived There,"

473
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,577
by Naomi Wildman.

474
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,414
That's what I'm calling my
report for astronomy class.

475
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,209
Neelix said I should choose
a planet to write about.

476
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,627
So I picked this one.

477
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,381
Your title is...
verbose.

478
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,133
I suggest you try
to condense it.

479
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,344
"The Weird Planet."

480
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,763
Better,
but it lacks precision.

481
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,308
"The Weird Planet
Displaced in Time."

482
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,559
Perfect.

483
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,479
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

484
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,273
I'm transmitting my calculations
directly to the helm.

485
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,401
JANEWAY:
Acknowledged.
What's happening?

486
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,985
The Doctor brought back data

487
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,196
regarding the planet's
graviton field.

488
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,490
We're using it
to realign our thrusters.

489
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,033
That'll be great for my report.

490
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,868
All hands, this is the Captain.

491
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,079
Secure your stations
and prepare to break orbit.

492
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,455
Brace yourself.

493
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,295
Our altitude
is increasing.

494
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,005
50 meters...

00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,173

498
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:37,804
Our attempt
to leave orbit

499
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,681
is increasing
the seismic activity.

500
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,560
We must abort.

501
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,562
JANEWAY:
Agreed.

502
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,398
Is the planet okay?

503
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,608
Minimal damage along
the equatorial coastline--

504
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,403
nothing serious.

505
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:56,031
Seven... do you think
we'll ever be able to leave?

506
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,367
Eventually.

507
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,119
I hope so.

508
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,788
I need a way to end my report.

509
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,377

Everything else
is working perfectly.

Ignite the final stage.

00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,750
We have to proceed
with the mission.

Correcting.

530
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,403
Distance check.

531
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,489
We're in rendezvous range.

532
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,534
Rendezvous sequence...
locked in.

533
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,994
Moving into final position.

534
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,496
Distance check.

535
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,457
We're within scanning range.

536
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,376
Let's take a look.

537
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,962
(<i> beeping</i> )

538
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,590
The scans won't penetrate
their hull.

539
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,717
I guess we'll
have to go inside.

540
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,511
We're not authorized to do that.

541
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,804
Our orders were to learn
as much as possible

542
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,932
about the Sky Ship.
That's my intention.

543
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,935
I saw something
that looks like
a transfer port.

544
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,146
It might be a
place we can dock.

545
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,441
Move in closer.

546
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,540
Wait, wait.

547
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,626
Are you all right?

548
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,128
A little...
disoriented.

549
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,131
Let's keep going.

550
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,386
I don't understand.

551
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,319
Her skin feels warm.

552
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,826
It might be some sort
of metabolic stasis...

553
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,620
but then,
why does it look like

554
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,622
they're just going
about their business?

555
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,874
(<i> sighs</i> ):
This isn't right.

556
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,669
We shouldn't be here.

557
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,462
We were never
meant to be here.

558
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,879
Try and stay calm.
We've seen enough.

559
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,507
Please, we
have to leave.

560
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,091
You're the best pilot
we have.

561
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,968
That's why you're
on this mission.

562
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,928
This is no different
than flying your favorite...

563
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,347
Oh, it's different.

564
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,725
I can't argue with that.

565
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,436
Another few minutes,
then we'll go back.

566
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,111
This looks like
their command center.

567
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,636
This is not
metabolic stasis.

568
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:30,305
Could the laws of physics
be different here?

569
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,058
Maybe they're just
a little slower.

570
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,476
(<i> gasps and groans</i> )

571
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,103
What's wrong?
(<i> groaning</i> )

572
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,648
(<i> both gasping and groaning</i> )

573
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,866
Intruder alert.
Security Team to Deck 1.

574
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,243
Captain, I'm picking up a ship
at Docking Port 1.

575
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,870
It just appeared there.

576
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,788
Bridge to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

577
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,126
What can you tell me?

578
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,795
The transition
to our time frame

579
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,839
was a little
rough for them.

580
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,965
I'm afraid his colleague
didn't make it.

581
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,427
How is he?
Recovering.

582
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,179
Lucky for him, I'm as good
as his family doctor.

583
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,848
After three years

584
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,683
of poring over their
medical journals,

585
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:18,353
I know as much about their
physiology as I do yours.

586
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,984
Easy.

587
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,574
Where's Terina?

588
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,410
She didn't survive
the transition.

589
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,662
I'm very sorry.

590
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,497
Transition?

591
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,374
To your time frame?

592
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,254
You understand
what's happened to you.

593
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,005
I'm beginning to.

594
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,676
<i>Voyager</i> exists
in the same space-time

595
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,887
as the rest of the galaxy.

596
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:54,013
Your planet is different.

597
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,560
So you really haven't been
watching us for centuries.

598
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,647
Actually, we just got here...

599
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,484
and we're hoping you can help us
find a way to leave.

600
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,825
So, if what you're
saying is true,

601
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:17,370
everyone I know...
everyone I<i> knew</i> is gone.

602
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,206
That's correct.

603
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,295
Captain, I'm an
accomplished pilot.

604
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,339
That's why they chose me
for this mission.

605
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,885
I don't have the courage
of the others.

606
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,720
They made a mistake
choosing me.

607
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,347
I have to disagree.

608
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,182
For someone whose
life has just been

609
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,852
turned upside down, I
think you're doing fine.

610
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,147
When I was a young child,

611
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,818
the toys hanging above my crib
depicted the Sky Ship.

612
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,236
It's the first thing
I ever remember seeing,

613
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,906
even before my mother's face...

614
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,701
and now I'm the only one
that knows its name--

615
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,495
<i>Voyager.</i>

616
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,083
I suppose it'll be
the last thing I see as well.

617
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,252
Well, that's up to you.
I have no intention

618
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,214
of keeping you here
against your will.

619
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,591
The Doctor spent some
time on your planet

620
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,803
collecting data that
we hoped would help us
find a way to leave orbit.

621
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,304
We need you
to assist us

622
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,098
in interpreting
that information.

623
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,687
However...
the longer you stay on board,

624
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,814
the more difficult it will be
for you to go home.

625
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,607
Your culture
is changing

626
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,401
every second
you're here.

627
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,403
By the time you go back,

628
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,531
you might find it
more alien than ours.

629
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:43,164
♪ Star of the night,
star of the day ♪

630
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,877

♪ Make my life

632
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,845
It's a child's prayer.

633
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,805
To<i> Voyager?</i>

634
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,391
Yes.

635
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,936
I hope you're not disappointed.

636
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:09,816
How often does your
very first dream come true?

637
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,070
Of course I'll help you.

638
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,743
The information I brought back
is in<i> Voyager's</i> database.

639
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,037
Seven of Nine has been trying
to make sense of it.

640
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,496
She'll welcome
your assistance.

641
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,040
Mountain or Lakeside?

642
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,583
Mountain, of course.

643
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,167
Don't tell me you're
a Lakeside supporter.

644
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,836
You really were
on the surface.

645
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,212
How are they doing
this season?

646
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,632
Not good-- five
wins, 12 losses.

647
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,968
I don't believe it.
Who's guarding for them?

648
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,177
Torelius.
Any relation
to<i> the</i> Torelius?

649
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,679
His grandson.

650
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,807
I saw the original
defend for Mountain

651
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,600
in the playoffs
against Red River.

652
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,184
That was before
I was born.

653
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,104
He would have gone
into voluntary exile

654
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,939
after a 5-12 season!

655
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,484
This information
is out of date.

656
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,070
We were far more advanced
than this when I left.

657
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,990
I can help you correct it.
Very well.

658
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,075
Let's start
with the geological data.

659
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:04,037
The seismic detectors back then
were off by a variance of 3.8.

660
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,331
A simple conversion will
compensate for that.

661
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,837
Does every planet
look like ours?

662
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,173
None that I've seen.
Your world appears to be unique.

663
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,510
If we're so out of step
with everything else,

664
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,304
we'll never be able to explore
space the way you have.

665
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,641
You're a highly
adaptable species.
Your scientists will find a way

666
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,643
to compensate
for the temporal differential.

667
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,562
They'd better do it
before you leave.

668
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,858
Without the Sky Ship
up above them,

669
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,443
my people might lose interest
in progress.

670
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,570
There wouldn't be anything left
to reach for.

671
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,115
Perhaps they'll
miss<i> Voyager</i> so much,

672
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,450
they'll do everything they can
to follow us.

673
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:43,869
Maybe so.

674
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,412
(<i> console beeping</i> )

675
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,622
What was that?

676
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,249
An antimatter implosion.

677
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,170
Your world is experimenting
with warp technology.

678
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,047
Sensors detected
an early test.

679
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,715
(<i> beeping</i> )

680
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,967
Another test--
six weeks later.

681
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,677
(<i> beeping</i> )

682
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,388
And a third-- more
controlled each time.

683
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,182
They're learning quickly.

684
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,476
(<i> explosion</i> )

685
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,853
Too quickly.

686
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,563
What was that?

687
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,524
Unknown, but our shields
are down to 82 percent.

688
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,027
(<i> explosion</i> )

689
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,071
64 percent.

690
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,031
I don't know what's causing it.
There's nothing on sensors.

691
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:24,034
Janeway to Seven of Nine.
Go ahead, Captain.

692
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,994
Are you picking up anything
in Astrometrics?

693
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,620
The inhabitants
appear to have

694
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,165
developed antimatter
torpedo technology.

695
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,042
I believe we're under attack.

696
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,762
TUVOK:
Another direct hit.
Shields at 49 percent.

697
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,890
Captain, I apologize
for this attack.
They have no right.

698
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:50,227
Unfortunately,
they've got every right.
Let me talk to them.

699
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,437
We've already tried
to hail them. It doesn't
look like they're able

700
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,272
to receive
our transmissions.

701
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,858
They still don't know
about the time differential.

702
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,401
A logical assumption.

703
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,780
Shields down
to 34 percent.

704
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,199
The torpedoes are being fired
at three-day intervals.

705
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:07,285
They're making
refinements each time,
increasing the detonation yield.

706
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,537
Captain, isn't it time
we returned fire?

707
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,665
We've done enough damage
to these people over
the last thousand years.

708
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,798
You've got to go back.
It's the only way.

709
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,633
Make them understand who we are.

710
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,052
You have the specifications
of this ship.

711
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:27,264
Your scientists might be able
to use them to help free us.

712
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,474
At the very least,
get them to hold their fire.

713
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,559
KIM:
Captain, the transporters
are off-line.

714
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,019
Is his vessel still intact?

715
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,230
The docking port
hasn't been hit yet.

716
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,983
Good luck.

717
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:47,033
This will accelerate your
metabolic functions--

718
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,910
help you make
the transition.

719
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,662
Thank you
for everything, Doctor.

720
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,248
It was a pleasure to
treat a fellow citizen.

721
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,001
Would you
do me a favor?
Certainly.

722
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,171
Find out what
happened to a boy
named Jason Tabreez.

723
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,214
He lived in the
Central Protectorate.

724
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,008
Jason? An unusual name.

725
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,927
Yes. He was my...

726
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,304
son.

727
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,139
But you're a hologram.

728
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,640
It's a long story.

729
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,600
He's dead by now,

730
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,312
but perhaps you could
discover what happened to him.

731
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,063
Maybe he had children

732
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,773
or grandchildren.

733
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,483
You could tell them about me.

734
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,110
I will.

735
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,247
Orbital 1 to Launch Control.

736
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,124
Please respond.

737
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,502
Launch Control, please respond.

738
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,213
FEMALE (<i> over radio</i> ):
<i>Who is this?</i>

739
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,215
Pilot First Rank Gotana-Retz.

740
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,133
<i>Clear this channel,</i>

741
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,926
<i>or I'm going to report you</i>
<i>to the Command Center.</i>

742
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,678
Is this Launch Control?

743
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,181
<i>I'm the Weather Coordinator</i>
<i>for Station 004.</i>

744
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,641
<i>You're in violation</i>
<i>of transmission regulations.</i>

745
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,393
Please, listen to me.

746
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,478
I'm trying
to reach Launch Control.

747
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,981
<i>Let me guess. You finally</i>
<i>decided to come home.</i>

748
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,483
<i>You're Gotana-Retz?</i>
Gotana-Retz. Yes.

749
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,777
Now, please transfer me
to Launch Control.

750
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,197
<i>Launch Control became</i>
<i>the Tactical Command Center</i>

751
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,866
<i>50 years ago.</i>
<i>You're dead.</i>

752
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,202
I've been inside the Sky Ship.

753
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,329
<i>Then it's a good thing</i>
<i>you decided to leave.</i>

754
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,788
<i>They're about to shoot it down.</i>

755
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,540
I've got to speak with them!

756
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,959
<i>Tactical Command frequencies</i>
<i>are classified.</i>

757
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,379
<i>Now, get off this channel.</i>

758
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,672
If you've ever wanted
to report more than the weather,

759
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,465
now is your chance.

760
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,927
Tell them to clear Central Lake
of all traffic.

761
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:33,098
Orbital 1 is coming in
for a landing.

762
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,605
Shields at 23 percent.

763
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,565
17 percent.

764
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,944
Shields are down.

765
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,570
What was that last one?

766
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,406
A tricobalt
device.

767
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,157
What'll they think of next?

768
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,159
Damage reports coming in--
imminent hull breaches

769
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,203
on Decks 8, 9 and 10.

770
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,829
Life support
is failing.

771
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,124
Our astronaut should
have made it by now.

772
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,709
KIM:
Based on his descent velocity,
he landed about ten minutes ago.

773
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,211
That's a year
and a half.

774
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,297
Then he must have failed.

775
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,965
I'm picking up
another launch--

776
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,716
two massive
energy signatures.

777
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,051
Tricobalt devices?

778
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,345
Unknown.
Brace yourselves.

779
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,728
We're in some kind
of tractor beam.

780
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,647
PARIS:
Captain...

781
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,065
if I alternate thrusters,

782
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,775
I might be able
to break us free.

783
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,526
No. Let's give our friends

784
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,321
the benefit of the doubt.

785
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,578
They're pulling us away
from the planet.

786
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,750
We've broken orbit.

787
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,461
Try hailing them.

788
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,551
It's good to see you all again.

789
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,554
Looks like somebody down there
listened to you.

790
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,349
I'm sorry it took so long.

791
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,851
And now we can make first
contact the proper way.

792
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,603
Unfortunately,
that won't be possible.

793
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,563
A temporal compensator.

794
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,565
It allows me to exist
in your time frame

795
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,318
without actually leaving my own,

796
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,653
but, uh, only for a few minutes.

797
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,114
I'm afraid it'll be a while
before my people

798
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,116
actually join
the rest of the galaxy.

799
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,076
TUVOK:
Captain, we'll
be able to bring

800
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,578
the warp drive back on line
in approximately two hours.

801
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,081
Very good.

802
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,793
Thank you.

803
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,795
I feel like
I'm saying good-bye

804
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,255
to an old friend.
