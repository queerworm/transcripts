Annoyed. In the future,

00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,905
Sorry. I guess
I should have knocked first.

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,242
Yes. According to sensors,

on this mission?

19
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,725
My function
is to study

Oh, that's
what Starfleet cadets

used to call
these class-2 shuttles--

You did not want

up that airlock.

50
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,333
Perhaps you should design
a new shuttle--

51
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,710
larger, more efficient.

52
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,462

clears that nebula--

It won't. They've
lost propulsion.

182
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,629
Commander, the force field
has a Borg signature.

183
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,881
Red Alert.
Captain to the Bridge.

184
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,800
Tuvok, take a security team
to the science lab.

185
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,051
Chakotay to Seven of Nine.

186
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,677
It looks like you were right.

187
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,973
<i>We've detected Borg on</i>
<i>the ship-- Deck 8, science lab.</i>

188
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,308
How many drones?

189
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,226
<i>Unknown.</i>
<i>Tuvok's headed there now.</i>

190
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,103
I will join him.

191
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,522
The science lab?

192
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,940
My mobile emitter's in there.

193
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,735
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

194
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,790
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

195
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:22,182
This technology resembles
a Borg maturation chamber,

196
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,352
but many of the components
are unfamiliar.

197
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,727
MALE:
Commander!

198
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,445
He was punctured by
an extraction tubule.

199
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,156
It removed a tissue sample.

200
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,075
There are residual nanoprobes
surrounding the wound.

201
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,290
Their encoding sequences
are identical to my own.

202
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,668
Your nanoprobes? How?

203
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,463
I don't know.

204
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,256
Take him to Sickbay.

205
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,805
( men grunting )

206
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,649
What are you doing?

207
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,443
I will be recognized
as Borg.

208
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,077
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

209
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,890
A drone...

210
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,602
but unlike any
I've ever seen.

211
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,688
It appears to be
in the fetal stage.

212
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,815
I don't understand.

213
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,276
The Borg assimilate.

214
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,903
They do not reproduce
in this fashion.

215
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,996
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

216
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,753
( liquid bubbling,
equipment humming )

217
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,713
( muted ):
Where did it come from?

218
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,383
I believe it was created here
in the science lab.

219
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,927
When the away team
beamed back to<i> Voyager,</i>

220
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,803
there was a transporter
malfunction.

221
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,057
Our patterns merged briefly.

222
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,184
It is possible that
some of my nanoprobes

223
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,103
infected the doctor's
mobile emitter.

224
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,396
They began to assimilate.

225
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,648
Yes.

226
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,441
Nanoprobes are encoded

227
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,943
to utilize any technology
they encounter.

228
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,612
Once it assimilated
the emitter, it began

229
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,405
to transform this
diagnostic station.

230
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,615
When Ensign Mulcahey

231
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,618
entered the room,
they sampled his DNA.

232
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,411
Using his genetic code
as a template

233
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,246
to create a life-form.

234
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,462
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

235
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,046
The drone has
increased in mass

236
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,548
by 17 percent.

237
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,801
SEVEN:
Its maturation rate
is 25 times

238
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,678
that of
a conventional Borg.

239
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,096
Tuvok, erect a level-10

240
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,390
force field around
this section.

241
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,352
Post round-the-clock
security.

242
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,896
You intend
to let it mature?

243
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,856
The alternative is
to pull the plug,

244
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,609
and I'm not prepared
to do that--

245
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,027
not unless I have to.

246
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,529
Resume your analysis.

247
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,863
I want to know

248
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,699
exactly what we're
dealing with here.

249
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,908
Or should I say whom?

250
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,619
Yes, Captain.

251
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,790
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

252
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,710
I've adapted
the astrometric sensors

253
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,294
to penetrate
the Borg force field.

254
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,338
I thought you said
this thing was a fetus.

255
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,132
An hour ago, it was.

256
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,594
The drone has entered
the fourth phase of gestation.

257
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,929
In human terms, it is
a child of six years.

258
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,474
DOCTOR:
<i>You mean a boy</i>
<i>of six years.</i>

259
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,227
<i>From what I can tell,</i>
<i>the drone is male.</i>

260
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,604
<i>Seven, route your sensor data</i>
<i>to Sickbay.</i>

261
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,732
<i>I want to run</i>
<i>a few medical scans.</i>

262
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,817
Stand by.

263
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:07,114
Well, he appears to be human
for the most part.

264
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,450
Borg implants
comprise approximately

265
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,245
<i>27 percent of his body.</i>

266
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,996
Curious.

267
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,750
His body plating is composed
of poly-deutonic alloy.

268
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,335
<i>Just like my mobile emitter.</i>

269
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,129
The nanoprobes must have
extrapolated that technology.

270
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,757
It could explain
his unique design.

271
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,258
Wait a second.

272
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,052
The doctor's emitter came
from the 29th century.

273
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,471
It's 500 years more advanced
than anything we've got.

274
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,682
It is logical to assume
this drone

275
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,308
will be equally advanced.

276
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,728
A 29th-century Borg.

277
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,978
In essence.

278
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,147
<i>I've located my mobile emitter.</i>

279
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>It's embedded</i>
<i>in his cerebral cortex.</i>

280
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,571
The emitter has been
adapted to function

281
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,281
as part of his
central nervous system.

282
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,783
It controls
all autonomic functions.

283
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,159
<i>That means</i>
<i>we can't remove it...</i>

284
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,787
<i>not without killing the drone.</i>

285
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,830
Has it contacted
the Borg collective?

286
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,792
No. I have dampened
its proximity transceiver.

287
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,251
For now.

288
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,045
What about
when it grows up?

289
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,339
(<i> suspenseful theme fades</i> )

290
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,967
( sighs )

291
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,720
Reactive body armor?

292
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,680
Multidimensional adaptability?

293
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,932
Internal transporter nodes?

294
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,768
The drone possesses
superior technology.

295
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,061
It will fully mature
in less than two hours.

296
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,188
However, its Borg shielding
is not yet active.

297
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,190
We can still terminate it,
but we must act quickly.

298
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,400
Hold on a minute, Seven.

299
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,653
I want some answers first.

300
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,571
What normally happens
when a drone

301
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,657
disengages from the
maturation chamber?

302
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,617
It awaits instructions
from the collective.

303
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:36,537
So without those instructions,
it has no designation, right?

304
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,831
No purpose.

305
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,749
Correct.

306
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,542
If we can keep him

307
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,920
from interfacing
with the collective,

308
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,339
maybe<i> we</i> can give
him a purpose.

309
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,299
Captain...
This is the most

310
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,051
advanced drone
ever to exist.

311
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,137
We could teach him
our values, Seven.

312
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,139
Ah.

313
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,391
We could show him what it
means to be an individual.

314
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,059
If we fail...

315
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,354
if the drone were
to be assimilated,

316
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,356
the collective would
become far more powerful.

317
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,942
What I'm proposing is
the only defense we have

318
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,110
against that possibility,
short of murder,

319
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,866
and that's an order
I'd prefer not to give.

320
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:17,036
As I recall, Seven,
there were a few crew members

321
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,956
who had similar doubts
about you.

322
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,791
The situation is different.

323
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,668
Is it? A Borg?

324
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,503
Disconnected from
the collective?

325
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,839
Unsure of its identity.

326
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,089
A potential threat.

327
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,968
But we succeeded.

328
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,136
We're going to pull
the same trick again.

329
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,764
Only this time, you're
going to be the teacher.

330
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,393
<i>I</i> am to instruct the drone
in the ways of humanity.

331
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,897
Think of it as
first contact...

332
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,524
and you are our ambassador.

( equipment powers down )

336
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,273
We are Borg.

337
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,691
State our designation.

338
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,693
Designation is irrelevant.

339
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,236
You are not part
of the collective.

340
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,529
You are an individual.

341
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,365
You will receive
your instructions from me.

342
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,825
Insufficient.

343
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,119
You must comply.

344
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,872
Insufficient.

345
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,541
We are Borg.

346
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,420
My designation is Seven of Nine,

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,757
Tertiary Adjunct of

But you may call me
Seven of Nine.

You will comply
with my commands.

Seven of Nine.

00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,933
Yes.

We are<i> not</i> Borg.

We are individuals.

State our designation.

357
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,152
Apparently not.

358
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,154
The drone's responses
are programmed.

359
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,239
It doesn't understand
what I'm saying.

360
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:21,035
I must initiate
a direct neural interface.

361
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,536
Are you sure that's wise?

362
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,748
There is no other way
for me to communicate with it.

363
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,667
Proceed.

364
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,714
You will not be harmed.

366
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,385
Resistance is futile.

367
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,729
I am providing it
with instructions.

368
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,609
It understands.

369
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,696
( grunts )

370
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,239
The drone is probing
my neural pathways.

371
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,911
It is trying to assimilate
all of my knowledge.

372
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,288
I cannot disengage
the link.

373
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,043
Terminate interface!

374
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,174
You must comply.

375
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,842
You are hurting me.

376
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:21,470
( gasping )

377
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,640
I will comply.

<i>Daily Log, Seven of Nine.</i>

380
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,322
<i>I've activated the drone's</i>
<i>linguistic database.</i>

381
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,408
<i>It is now capable</i>
<i>of assimilating information.</i>

382
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,203
<i>A direct neural link</i>
<i>is too dangerous.</i>

383
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,914
<i>So I've decided to use</i>
<i>Borg data nodes.</i>

384
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,541
Special delivery--
two Borg data nodes.

385
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,292
More?

386
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,213
Link them to the data port.

387
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,797
How many Borg hitchhikers

388
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,299
are we going to pick up
on this trip?

389
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,385
Maybe this is
the collective's new strategy.

390
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,137
They don't
assimilate anymore.

391
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,014
They just show up
and look helpless.

392
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,306
Now, B'Elanna...

393
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,642
We don't know what
this drone will turn into.

394
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,062
It's gone from infant
to adult in one day.

395
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,940
It will become what
we help it to become.

396
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,649
How Starfleet of you.

397
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,984

State our designation.

405
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,969

00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,973
We do not understand.

408
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,767
You will, but first
you must assimilate this data.

409
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,227
Come here.

410
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,313
Comply.

00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,485
Give me your arm.

412
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,828
Inject the data node
with an assimilation tubule--

00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,247
this access port.

414
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,082

Yes.

419
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,079
Your designation is Neelix--
Talaxian.

420
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,873
That's me.

421
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,545
This is a laboratory
on a vessel.

422
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,839
The Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

423
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,883
I am traveling through
interstellar space.

424
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,301
Yes.

425
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,470
Why?

426
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,057
This is a ship
of exploration.

427
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,268
I am an explorer.

428
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,519
We all are.

429
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,770
We are Borg.

430
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,480
Well, no.

431
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,191
You are a unique individual,

432
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,901
one of many on<i> Voyager.</i>

433
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,610
This is not a Borg collective.

434
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,612
Do you understand?

435
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,033
Individual.

436
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,408
My thoughts are my own.

437
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,619
Precisely.

438
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,621
I wish to assimilate
more information.

439
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,249
Not yet.

440
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,833
Your neural pathways
require time

441
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,377
to process
the information.

442
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,587
You will need
to regenerate soon.

443
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,756
I will adapt
one of the alcoves

444
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,300
in our cargo bay
to your technology.

445
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,928
Take the drone to the doctor
for medical analysis.

446
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,304
Go with him.

DRONE:
Duranium hull.

454

Plasma-based

455
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,834
Tricylic life-support

Artificial
gravity plating.

457
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,671
Oh, right on all counts.

458
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,174
Systems analysis
appears to be your forte.

459
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,675
You should think
about a future

460
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,094
in starship operations.

461
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,596
Human female.
Very good.

462
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,681
She was
frightened by me.

463
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,225
Why do you say that?

464
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,186
I detected an elevation
in her pheromonal response.

465
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,272
Well, you're new
around here.

466
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,732
An unfamiliar face takes
some getting used to.

467
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,110
I remember when I first
came aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

468
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,279
I provoked a few
strange reactions myself.

469
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,030
I still do
from time to time.

470
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,032
I mean, just look at me--
whiskers and spots.

471
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,909
Were people afraid
of you as well?

472
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,453
Well, no.

473
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,663
Do they fear me
because I am Borg?

474
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,582
Sometimes Borg can be
a little intimidating.

475
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,126
Don't take it personally.

476
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,128
I want to know more
about the collective.

477
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,213
You do?
Well, of course you do.

478
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,505
Tell me about the Borg.

479
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,882
Oh, what's to tell?

480
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,427
You've seen one cybernetically
enhanced species,

481
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,845
you've seen them all.

482
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,597
You'll have plenty of time
to learn all about them,

483
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,975
but first, you have
to give yourself a chance

484
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,893
to adapt to life
here on<i> Voyager.</i>

485
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,312
Now, Mister...?

486
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,562
Gosh, I'm sorry.

487
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,231
In all the excitement,
I forgot your name.

488
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,108
I do not have a name.

489
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,901
Well, every individual
needs a name.

490
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,612
We can't just run around
calling you "the drone."

491
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,281
That's not very
interesting, is it?

492
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,531
Seven of Nine
tells me

493
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,117
my designation
is irrelevant.

494
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,452
I disagree.

495
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,536
You should choose
a name for yourself,

496
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,414
something that defines
who you are.

497
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,124
After all,
there's only one of you.

498
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,625
One.

499
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,378
Oh, here we are-- Sickbay.

500
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,132
Good morning.

501
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,592
You are the Emergency
Medical Hologram.

502
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,220
And you are
very observant.

503
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,138
Step this way, please.

504
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,724
I have to get back
to Mess Hall.

505
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,518
There's nothing
to worry about.

506
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,311
The doctor is going
to run a few scans.

507
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,188
You'll be finished
before you know it.

508
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,856
I will comply.

509
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,529
It's a noninvasive
biomedical scan.

510
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,239
You won't feel a thing.

511
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,535
Your central nervous system
is functioning normally,

512
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,203
but I'm picking up
some degradation

513
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,746
in your neural pathways.

514
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,165
You'll need
to regenerate soon.

515
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,334
My central nervous
system is regulated

516
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,626
by your mobile emitter.

517
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,629
That's right.

518
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,340
Your mobile emitter
is more advanced

519
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,716
than these
diagnostic tools.

520
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,718
Far more advanced.

521
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,304
It's technology that came
from the 29th century,

522
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,889
400 years in the future.

523
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,849
I am an advanced
form of life.

524
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,101
Yes.

525
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,477
I am unique.

526
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,728
Mm-hmm.

527
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,188
Describe my origins.

528
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,356
Oh, it's a long story.

529
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,191
I wish to hear it.
Another time.

530
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,901
I wish to hear
the story<i> now.</i>

531
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,029
Mm.

532
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,283
In a nutshell, there was
a transporter malfunction.

533
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,327
My emitter fused with several
of Seven of Nine's...

534
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,079
nanoprobes.

535
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,331
I was an accident.

536
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,585
Call it "a random convergence
of technologies."

537
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,878
Am I unwelcome here?

538
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,383
On the contrary.

539
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,677
Our primary mission is to
explore new forms of life.

540
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,555
You may have been unexpected,

541
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,141
but, given time,
I am sure you'll make

542
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,809

Fueled by a matter-
antimatter reaction,

00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:01,972
Correct.

This isn't

Klingon-human hybrid.

563
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,522
She possesses

of this vessel's systems

"at low temperature,

574
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,917

576
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,754

Unh. Do you mind?

580

If you apply
a multispatial algorithm,

581
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,182
it will accurately predict
the rate of expansion.

He requested

594
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,933

47 billion teraquads

Mr. Neelix. They've been

Is your assessment

Why, yes.

607
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,007
More than sufficient.

608
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,093
In fact, I'd say you were
making excellent progress,

609
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,553
but this isn't

00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,971
I simply wanted to meet you.

611
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,390
With your permission,
I would like to be excused.

Thank you.

Not only has he absorbed

00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,286
an incredible amount of
knowledge in a matter of days,

620
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,997
but he seems to be
fitting in with the crew

621
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,249
and developing
a distinct personality.

622
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,669
He is adapting quickly.

623
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,045
Then why do I get the feeling
something's bothering you?

624
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,592
He has been expressing
curiosity about the Borg.

625
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,594
Ah...

626
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,263
and you're worried that
if he learns about them,

627
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,223
he may be drawn
to the collective.

628
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,517
Yes.

629
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,688
Maybe we should tell him
what he wants to know.

630
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,356
I'd rather he learn
about the Borg from us

631

than the collective.

632
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,819
The lure of perfection
is powerful, Captain.

633
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,697
He may be tempted
to seek out the Borg.

634
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,865
That would pose
a grave tactical risk.

635
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,953
Well, we can delay
telling him for now,

636
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,497
but keep in mind,

637
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,833
the drone is becoming
an individual.

638
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,877
Seven, he has
the right to know.

639
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,129

to answer his questions.

were insufficient.

00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,485
Yes.

726
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,489
You call the Borg
destructive.

727
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,907
Seven of Nine is not.

728
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,785
That's because she's regained
her individuality.

729
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,495
But if the Borg
had the chance,

730
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,455
they'd take it away
from her again.

731
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,500
They'd assimilate
everyone on<i> Voyager.</i>

With your
advanced technology...

733
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,758
the collective would become
even more destructive.

734
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,011
We have to prevent that
from happening,

00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,887
but we can't do it
without you.

736
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,348
We need your abilities

Will you help us resist them?

We just ran out of time.

Seven of Nine,
I'm detecting irregularities

749
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,395
in my autonomic

vasoconstriction...

751
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,442
You're experiencing
an emotion-- anxiety.

752
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,861
It is only temporary.

753
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:21,322
Anxiety: A state
of apprehension caused by fear.

754
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,909
The Borg usually elicit
this response in others.

755
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,994
Are you experiencing
anxiety as well?

756
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,246
Yes. Along with every
crew member on<i> Voyager.</i>

757
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,622
Because they fear
assimilation?

758
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,749
Correct.

759
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,333

Will<i> Voyager</i> be destroyed?

766
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,812
The Borg are powerful,

767
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,356
but Captain Janeway
is a resourceful leader.

768
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,942
We will resist.

769
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,402
Resistance is futile.

770
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,073
Perhaps.

You must help us

This station will give you
access to the shield generators.

781
