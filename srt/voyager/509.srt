I hereby reduce you

Take Ensign Paris

did you ask the warden
about those holodeck privileges?

35
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,344
Uh, she said,
and I quote:

36
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,514
"Tell Mr. Paris this is
punishment, not shore leave."

a few things I wanted to say.

First of all...

61

Wait! Keep listening.
Don't turn this off.

I want you to know
how I ended up in here...

65

because...

66
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,340
it's not what you think.

67

It all started on a morning

Captain Proton

I've destroyed Dr. Chaotica's
mind control machine

72
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,527

Who is this?

75
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,826
An old friend.

at the moment.

81

Don't worry about me, Captain. I
can handle myself.

82
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,052
We'll see

Oh, right.

Your wish is
my command.

88
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,606
Sorry, Harry.

we're through with you,

you'll be<i> begging</i> to tell us
everything you know.

It's a shame
we'll have to kill him.

I've got everything
under control, Proton.

107

will have to wait.

Any progress
on those star charts?

You need some help?

I'm not on duty again
till tomorrow morning.

I think Jenny
really likes you.

Yeah, I know.

129
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,905
I thought the
feeling was mutual.

I have to tell you?

Ha, ha. What
is the difference?

You can't
be serious.

134
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,665
They're the Delaney sisters,
Harry. They're twins.

135
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,250
Are you kidding?
They're nothing alike.

136
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,669
Jenny's aggressive,
and sometimes annoying,

137
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,005
but Megan--
she's quiet, artistic,

138
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,841
and she's got that cute little
dimple in her right cheek.

139
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,551
Jenny doesn't have the dimple?

140

No dimple.

then a Borg,

At least I'm consistent.

They're hailing.

187
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,585
I guess we got their attention.

193
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,764
Consul, we could have destroyed

194
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,308
We have no interest in a fight.

195
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,059
<i>Then why are you here?</i>

196
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,436
Because we're explorers

197
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,647
and we're fascinated
by your ocean,

198
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,898
and we'd like to learn
more about it

199
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,942

<i>And if we are not?</i>

201
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,989
We'll be disappointed,

Forgive our

205

Over the years,
my government

206
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,959

protect our ocean

207
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,461

hostile species.

208
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,129
I understand.

209
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,423
We're also very protective
of our own natural resources.

211
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,301

And this is<i> Voyager's</i>

213
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,720
Feel free to have
a look around.

214
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,557
NEELIX:
I'm curious, Consul.

215
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,724
Have your people
always lived here?

216
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,268
Our ancestors
were nomadic.

217
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,188
They only discovered
the waters 300 years ago.

218
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,148
I'll bet they were
as stunned as we were

219
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,275
to find this huge ball of
water floating in space.

220
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,486
Yes. Mister...?

221
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,238
Paris. Tom Paris.

222
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,323
JANEWAY:
My First Officer,
Commander Chakotay.

223
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,367
They realized they could
farm sea vegetation,

224
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,868
extract oxygen
from the ocean

225
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,414
for their ships...
create a permanent home.

226
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,956
What's your population?

227
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,167
More than 80,000.

228
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,003
And you all
live underwater?

229
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,089
TUVOK:
Lieutenant,
we do have

230
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,674
other business
to attend to.

231
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,593
Mr. Tuvok, escort our guests
to the briefing room.

232
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,802
(<i> soft theme playing</i> )

233
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,304
Care to join us,
Mr. Paris?

234
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,014
How could you tell?

235
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,397
Do you still live
aboard your ships?

236
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,441
We've built an industrial
infrastructure

237
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,983
and undersea dwellings,

238
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,319
but yes, most of our people
still choose to live

239
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,696
as our ancestors did.

240
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,115
Any idea how the ocean
came into existence?

241
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,075
In my experience,
it's a unique phenomenon.

242
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,368
Riga?

243
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,662
There are
several theories.

244
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,748
Our clerics teach
that the ocean

245
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,874
was a divine gift
from the creators

246
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,418
to protect
and sustain us,

247
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,795
but, in my opinion, the most
plausible explanation is

248
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,716
that the ocean formed naturally,
much the same way

249
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,302
that a gas giant does.
Makes sense.

250
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,137
RIGA:
Unfortunately,
our limited knowledge

251
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:28,266
of the phenomenon has created
a few problems.

252
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,850
What do you mean?

253
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,394
BURKUS:
I'm not sure

254
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,646
this is
an appropriate topic.

255
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,648
But they might be able
to help us.

256
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,399
JANEWAY:
We'll do anything we can.

257
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,485
The ocean's losing
containment.

258
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,780
Hydro-volume has decreased
more than seven percent

259
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,989
in the last year alone.

260
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,491
Any idea what's causing it?

261
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,701
No. To make a thorough study,

262
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,203
we'd need to explore
the ocean's center

263
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,289
where I believe
the gravitational currents

264
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,999
are fluctuating.

265
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,710
But that's more than
600 kilometers deep.

266
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,213
Our best research vessel
can only go 100 kilometers.

267
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,258
Beyond that,
the pressure's too great.

268
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,884
Well, we could
take you there.

269
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,262
Captain?

270
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,975
(<i> serene theme playing</i> )

271
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,687
I had no idea you were
such an old salt.

272
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,938
Ha. When I saw
that ocean today,

273
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,857
it reminded me of the first
time I read Jules Verne.

274
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,401
<i>20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.</i>

275
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,820
Mmm!

276
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,364
I must have read it
20,000 times.

277
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,033
I was<i> obsessed</i>
with stories about the ocean.

278
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,910
All of my friends were busy
with their holo-programs.

279
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,121
I had my head buried
in<i> Captains Courageous,</i>

280
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,414
<i>Moby Dick...</i>

281
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,833
So your interest
in history includes

282
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,376
the<i> 19th</i> century, as well.

283
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,713
Ancient sailing ships
were always my first love.

284
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,422
I had it all planned.

285
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,760
Finish high school, join
the Federation Naval Patrol...

286
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,888
but my father had other ideas.

287
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,682
You'd think<i> Admiral</i> Paris

288
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,642
might have understood
his son's passion.

289
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,061
Hmm...

290
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,855
As far as he was concerned,

291
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,023
the only ship
I was going to serve on

292
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,859
had to have
a Starfleet insignia on it.

293
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,529
So now you have an opportunity
to make up for lost time.

294
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,155
Captain...

295
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,074
with a few simple
thruster modifications

296
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,493
to the<i> Delta Flyer,</i> she will
be seaworthy in no time.

297
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,745
Good.

298
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,287
It'd take at least a week

299
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,874
to make the necessary
modifications to<i> Voyager.</i>

300
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,667

And so, I thought to myself,

who better than Harry
to be my first mate?

306
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,514
First mate?

00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,558
Oh. Sailor talk. You'll
get the hang of it.

308
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,768
Ah.

309
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,227
I'm telling you, Harry,

310
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,062
I have been dreaming
about something like this

311
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,606
for as long as
I can remember.

312
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,023
Correct me if I'm wrong,

313
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,817
but there<i> is</i> a mission
involved here, right?

314
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,068
Of course!

315
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,319
But there's no law that says

316
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,154
we can't have a little
fun along the way.

317
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,489
Ah, bosun.

00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,742
Ready to shove off?

319
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,535
What are you talking
about, Lieutenant?

320
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,870
Call me Skipper.

You'll get used to it.

322
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,831
I think not.

of the people on that shuttle

540
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,862
or your political career?

541
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,657
What's that?

542
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,284
SEVEN:
A gravimetric discharge.

543
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,244
The reactor's core is unstable.

544
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,537
You'd be unstable, too, if you
were as old as this thing.

545
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,123
Age has nothing to do with it.

546
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,541
The reactor's diverting
massive amounts of power

547
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,169
to its structural
integrity field,

548
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,130
power normally reserved
for oceanic containment.

549
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,923
That would explain why
containment is weakening.

550
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,468
KIM:
Looks like the density
of the water's been increasing

551
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,635
over the past few years.

552
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,012
It seems the reactor's
just trying

553
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,472
to keep itself
from being crushed.

554
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,724
( rumbling )

555
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,977
Can we initiate a power
transfer, stabilize the core?

556
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,147
I believe so, but it would be
a temporary solution.

557
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,816
It's better than nothing.

558
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,694
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

559
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,077
Captain, full containment
has just been re-established.

560
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,370
The deflector beam.

561
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,871
Negative. The ocean appears

562
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,748
to have been stabilized
from within.

563
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,376
It looks like our
team has succeeded.

564
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,962
I'm picking up an object
on a slow ascent.

565
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,839
It's the<i> Flyer.</i>

566
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,593
You found something?

567
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,347
I've been studying
the generator's database.

568
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,349
You're not going
to believe this,

569
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,019
but apparently, your ocean
used to be part of a landmass.

570
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,521
Really?

571
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,772
As far as I can tell,

572
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,066
it was part
of a planetary ecosystem

573
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,609
inhabited by
a very advanced civilization.

574
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,986
What happened
to them?

575
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,530
That's a good question.

576
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,989
All I know is they launched

577
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,908
this reactor
into orbit.

578
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,410
They used
some kind

579
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,787
of elaborate
kinetic transfer system

580
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,458
to draw the water and everything
in it up to the reactor.

581
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,753
Extraordinary.

582
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,629
Why would anyone want to move

583
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,299
an entire ocean?

584
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,760
Maybe there was some kind
of disaster on the planet,

585
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,138
or maybe it was
just an experiment.

586
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,681
That must have been
a massive undertaking.

587
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,350
Took them almost 200 years.

588
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,895
I wonder what they'd think
if they knew we settled here

589
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,646
and built another civilization.

590
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:32,151
Actually, I think
they'd be pretty concerned.

591
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,860
Oh?

592
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,406
This field reactor
that they designed--

593
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,494
it's a pretty amazing piece
of technology-- durable...

594
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:45,205
I don't think it's responsible
for the loss of containment.

595
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,584
But as soon as we made
the recalibration,

596
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,918
the water stabilized.

597
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,753
I don't see what
else it could be.

598
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:56,758
Riga, your mining operations
are destroying the ocean.

Yeah. I know
the feeling.

628

So, what have you been doing
to pass the time?

629

and...

thinking. Ha.

Trying not to think.

632
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,931
Actually, I started recording
a letter to my father.

633
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,516
Really?

634
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,809
Yeah.

635
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,354
For some reason, I...

636

I wanted to explain to him
how I ended up in here.

I didn't want
him to think...

Well, anyway, I realized
how ridiculous it was.

good reason.

I've also drawn up some designs

for an oxygen
replication system.

672
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,788
It'll allow you to
create free oxygen

673
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,707
without extricating
it from the water.

674
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,501
It won't solve your problems
overnight,

675
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,960
but it's a start.

676
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,046
I'm sure it'll be
very helpful.

677

are still dangerously high.

like you're just trying
to sidestep the issue

700
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,849

With all due respect,

702
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,603
who are you
to tell us what to do

703
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,145
with our ocean?

704
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,398

706
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,943
It's all right, Captain.

707
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,320
I'd like to respond,
but not as a diplomat

708
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,864
as a Monean.

709
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,157
You came here claiming
you wanted to learn

710
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,409
about our way of life,

711
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,536
and now, having spent
three days here,

712
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,079
you're suggesting
we abandon it.

713
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,123
We have an expression--

714
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,918
brine in the veins.

715
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,252
Tell him what it means.

to the waters.

My family has lived here

but when you're
in a room with me,

734
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,055
you check that attitude
at the door. Understood?

735
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,516
Captain--

736
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,351
We can't expect
an entire society

737
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,187
to change because we
think they should.

738
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,314
Then you agree with me.
Yes.

739
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,191
And we gave them the
help they asked for.

740
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,442
We told them what we know.

741
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,610
Now it's up to them to do

742
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,403
what they think
is appropriate.

743
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,655
You heard that consul.

744
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,990
They're not going to do

745
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,616
Maybe not, but that's
their prerogative.

End of discussion, Lieutenant.

747

At 1400 hours,
we'll resume a course

749
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,167
Is that clear?

750

761

when I realized that ocean
would just be...gone one day...

762
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,933
it started
to matter to me.

764
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,521
Sounds pretty stupid, huh?

No.

00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,862
No, it sounds like you've
found yourself a cause.

768
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,826
I never thought of myself
as a<i> cause</i> kind of guy.

Well, for what it's worth,
I'm proud of you.

what do you think's
going to happen now?

781
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,368
I think the bureaucracy

more than token changes.

786
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:16,133
What would happen--

787
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,176

788

if someone<i> were</i> to shut down
the refineries?

789
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:25,684
Well, I suppose
they'd have to be rebuilt.

790
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,478
Yeah, and they'd probably
be more willing

791
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,522
to redesign them
while they're at it.

792
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,732

( rumbling )

896
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,763
The<i> Flyer</i> has
been disabled.

897
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,432
Their missile?

898
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,891
Deflected.

899

JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 52179.4.</i>

900
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,363
<i>After salvaging</i>
<i>the</i> Delta Flyer,

901
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,241
<i>we've resumed our course</i>
<i>toward the Alpha Quadrant.</i>

902
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,328
<i>I now have to turn my attention</i>
to a matter of discipline.

903
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,915
Lieutenant Thomas
Eugene Paris,

904
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,042
you are guilty
of insubordination,

905
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,128
unauthorized use
of a spacecraft,

906
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,379
reckless endangerment

907
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,381
and conduct unbecoming
an officer.

908
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,800
Do you have
anything to say?

909
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,177
Riga needed my help.

910
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,053
In doing so, you disobeyed
my direct orders.

911
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,472
Yes, ma'am.

912
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,515
You violated the protocols
that govern this crew.

913
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,058
Yes, ma'am.

914
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,394
You nearly caused an armed
conflict with the Moneans.

915
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,646
And frankly, you're lucky to
be standing here right now.

916
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,690
I would have destroyed
your shuttle if necessary.

917
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,733
Yes, ma'am.

918
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:11,321
Permission to speak freely.

919
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,576
Riga's people
weren't going to listen.

920
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,287
They were going
to ignore our warnings.

921
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,872
You don't know that.

922
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,875
Riga knew, and I was the only
one who could help them.

923
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,293
I understand your passion,

924
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,086
but passion alone
doesn't give you the right

925
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,629
to take matters
into your own hands.

926
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,423
Four years ago,
I released you

927
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,384
from prison and gave
you a fresh start.

928
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,386
Until now, you've been
a fine officer.

929
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,679
Your service on this ship
has been exemplary.

930
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,265
I really believed you were
past this kind of conduct.

931
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,977
I've never been very good
at playing by the rules.

932
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:46,481
That doesn't mean
that serving under your command

933
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,150
hasn't changed me--
for the better.

934
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,653
At least this time,
I broke the rules for a reason,

935
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,073
for something I believed in.

936
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,158
I admire your
principles, Tom,

937
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,745
but I can't ignore
what you've done.

938
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:04,040
I hereby reduce you
to the rank of Ensign.

939
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,585
And I sentence you
to 30 days solitary confinement.

940
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,379
Take Ensign Paris
to the brig.

941
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,175
I know the way.

942
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,305
Rise and shine, Ensign.

943
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,224
Your 30 days
have been served.

944
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,107
You may want
to shave first.

945
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,442
Yes, sir.

946
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,914
<i>Torres to Paris.</i>

947
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,583
Go ahead.

948
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,543
<i>Rumor has it that</i>
<i>you're free for dinner.</i>

949
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,170
Ha. Gee, I don't know.

950
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,840
Are you sure you want to be seen
associating with an ex-con?

951
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,301
<i>My quarters, 0700.</i>

952
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,470
<i>That's an order, Ensign.</i>

953
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,597
Yes, ma'am.

954
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,022
Resume recording.

955
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,113
Well, I'm out now
and back to my duties.

956

(<i> soft theme playing</i> )

957
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:27,582
I honestly don't know
if I'll ever understand you,

958
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:31,794
or what went wrong between us,

959
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:36,841
but I hope this letter helps you
understand me a little better.

960
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:49,979
Computer, file letter
in my personal database...

961
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,568
and transmit when we're
within range of Earth.
