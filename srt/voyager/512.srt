00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:06,507
ANNOUNCER:
The Adventures of Captain Proton

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,050
<i>Chapter 18:</i>
<i>"Bride of Chaotica."</i>

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,929
<i>The evil Dr. Chaotica</i>
<i>kidnaps Constance Goodheart</i>

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>and plans to sacrifice her</i>

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,683
<i>to Arachnia,</i>
<i>Queen of the Spider People.</i>

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,726
(<i> screaming shrilly</i> )

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,436
(<i> laughing</i> )

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:23,315
<i>Captain Proton travels</i>
<i>millions of miles to Planet X,</i>

9
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,860
<i>where he will invade</i>
<i>the Fortress of Doom.</i>

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,612
<i>Chaotica fires</i>
<i>his fiendish death ray--</i>

11
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,405
<i>certain death for Proton,</i>

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>as his rocket ship</i>
<i>bursts into flames.</i>

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,285
We didn't burst into flames
in the last chapter.

14
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,120
Why are these recaps
always so inaccurate?

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,206
Well, they brought people
back to the theaters.

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,749
Cliffhangers.

17
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,126
The lost art
of hyperbole.

18
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,795
You ready?

19
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,296
Aye, Captain.

20
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,131
Let's get this
show on the road.

21
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,925
Computer...

22
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:50,885
begin Chapter 18.

23
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,594
(<i> computer beeping</i> )

24
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,805
We're receiving a transmission.

25
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,390
It's Chaotica.

26
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,894
Imagizing.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,023
(<i> screaming shrilly</i> )

28
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,483
<i>Captain Proton...</i>

29
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,486
<i>surrender!</i>

30
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,821
Not a chance.

31
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,447
Release
Miss Goodheart

32
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,033
and we'll be
on our way.

33
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,201
<i>I'm afraid your "secretary"</i>

34
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,496
<i>has already been promised</i>
<i>to Queen Arachnia</i>

35
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,916
<i>as a supreme sacrifice.</i>

36
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,959
(<i> screaming</i> )

37
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,794
You'll never
get away with this.

38
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,254
<i>Oh, ho-ho-ho!</i>

39
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,881
But I shall!

40
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,884
<i>You escaped</i>
<i>from my death ray once,</i>

41
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,887
<i>but you won't survive this!</i>

42
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,890
He's charging the weapon.

43
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,851
Brace for impact.

44
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,978
(<i> rumbling</i> )

45
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,187
Direct hit!

46
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,147
We lost
<i>both</i> engines!

47
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,275
PARIS:
Steering jets
are on the fritz!

48
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,201
We're going down!

49
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,040
The landing gear
is jammed!

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,499
Hang on!

51
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,171
(<i> crashing and thumping</i> )

52
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,553
Opening hatch.

53
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,020
Welcome to Planet X.

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,521
What's the plan?

55
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,982
This is the part

56
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,733
where we defeat
Chaotica's soldiers,

57
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,110
steal their uniforms,

58
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,528
and make our way
through the underground caverns.

59
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,738
Hey, I thought you said

60
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,490
there were slave girls
in this chapter.

61
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,242
After we infiltrate
the Fortress of Doom,

62
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,120
we'll free
Chaotica's harem.

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,704
Let's go.

64
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,331
I'm right behind you.

65
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,087
Planet X looks
kind of familiar.

66
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,547
What was the last
place we went to?

67
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,092
The Mines of Mercury.

68
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,718
They're identical.

69
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,720
Sets were expensive.

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,766
At least there's no
erupting volcano this time.

71
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:07,146
Ah, behold the Fortress of Doom.

72
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,606
And how are we supposed
to get up there?

73
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,190
I told you-- the...

74
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,485
underground caverns.
Underground caverns.

75
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,987
Right.

76
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,949
I thought you said
there was no volcano.

77
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,159
I did.

78
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,372
Uh...

79
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,790
Tom.

80
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,799
Definitely
not Chaotica.

81
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,078
Computer,
end program.

82
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:32,124
<i>Unable to comply.</i>
<i>Holodeck controls are off-line.</i>

83
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,875
Paris to Bridge.

84
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,752
Bridge, respond.

85
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,714
We need to find
the manual overrides.

86
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,591
There's an access port
on the rocket ship.

87
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,759
Come on.

88
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,064
Report.

89
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,316
We dropped
out of warp.

90
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,399
We're at
a dead stop.

91
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,400
Cause?

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,401
Unknown.

93
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,778
Engines are operational.

94
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,821
(<i> rumbling</i> )

95
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,239
CHAKOTAY:
I'm reading

96
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,365
gravimetric forces
around the ship.

97
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,327
They're disrupting
our power flow.

98
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,912
Control systems
are going off-line.

99
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,289
I no longer
have access

100
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,125
to communications,
deflector, weapons...

101
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,418
Scan for vessels,
tractor beams...

102
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,463
anything that might explain
what's holding us here.

103
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,012
Halt in the name
of Chaotica!

104
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,974
Proton!

105
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,391
Buddy of yours?

106
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,852
Surprised?

107
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,437
You thought I perished
in the Den of Crocodiles.

108
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,273
We don't have time
for this.

109
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,941
I survived...

110
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,985
clinging to the thought
that I would

111
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:42,986
one day...

112
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,240
(<i> melodramatic groaning</i> )

113
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,748
Oh! Oh.

114
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,793
I believe I have an explanation.

115
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,462
Sensors show that we've
entered a layer of subspace.

116
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,964
It's disrupting our warp field.

117
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,799
Do we have impulse?

118
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,093
Yes.

119
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,302
Engage at full.

120
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,561
No change in our position.

121
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,980
Route all available power
to the engines.

122
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,441
We're not moving.

123
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,151
The impulse reactor
is running hot.

124
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,652
We're heading
for an overload.

125
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,820
Give it all she's got.

126
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,488
Full thrusters.

127
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,117
No effect.

128
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,618
Reactor's
at critical.

129
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,287
Abort.

130
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,209
Increase power to
the structural integrity field.

131
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,295
We may be here awhile.

132
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,506
It's no use.

133
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,634
I can't disengage
the program.

134
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,429
Well, you better think
of something fast, Proton.

135
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,643
A second distortion
just appeared.

136
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,812
Whatever they are,
they're getting bigger.

137
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,815
Hold on.

138
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,858
I've got access
to the transporter.

139
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,444
I'm going to try
a site-to-site.

140
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,611
There's a third one.

141
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,086
SEVEN:
I've run
a transpectral analysis.

142
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,546
The barrier between normal space
and subspace is unstable

143
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,090
throughout
this region.

144
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,301
Basically, we've run aground
on a subspace sandbar.

145
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,969
I've tried realigning
the warp field,

146
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,512
reversing hull
polarity...

147
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,222
Maybe we should just
get out and push.

148
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,682
SEVEN:
The gravimetric forces

149
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,476
are disrupting
our control systems.

150
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,102
As long as
we're trapped here,

151
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,271
we won't have access
to the computer core,

152
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,690
tactical, holodecks,
and all but six replicators.

153
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,733
What about those distortions
on the holodeck?

154
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,693
What's the connection? 

155
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,986
Random
energy fluctuations.

156
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,570
I don't believe
they pose a threat.

157
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,989
Let's keep an eye
on them, anyway.

158
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,116
And evacuate that deck
just to be safe.

159
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,870
A few years back,

160
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,165
when I was a science
officer on the<i> Al-Batani,</i>

161
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,250
we tried to navigate
a dense protonebula.

162
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,751
It stopped us
dead in our tracks.

163
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:08,089
For three days, we attempted
to force our way out

164
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,550
until we realized
we were trying too hard.

165
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,634
Captain?

166
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,094
Every time we engaged
the engines,

167
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,679
we were increasing
the resistance

168
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,223
of the nebula's
particle field.

169
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,849
We may be facing
a similar situation.

170
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,309
SEVEN:
Our own warp field

171
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,144
may be increasing
the gravimetric forces.

172
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,396
If we power
down the core

173
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,688
and use minimal
thrusters,

174
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,148
we might be able
to break free.

175
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,317
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

176
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,069
Your plan
could work.

177
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,530
Now that we
have your blessing...

178
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,407
Let's give it a try.

179
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,308
(<i> instruments beeping</i> )

180
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,313
Halt, in the name
of Chaotica!

181
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,732
We intend no harm.

182
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,317
Seize them!

183
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,072
Lower the drawbridge.

184
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,783
We are bringing prisoners.

185
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,164
(<i> door opens</i> )

186
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,750
CHAOTICA:
Yes, yes, yes, Lonzak.

187
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,586
What do you want?

188
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,963
Your Majesty.

189
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,299
Where's Proton?

190
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,009
He, uh... escaped.

191
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,678
Fool!

192
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,932
You will pay
for your incompetence!

193
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,559
Seize him!

194
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,102
(<i> mechanical voice):</i>
Surrender.

195
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,686
But, Majesty...

196
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,730
I have brought prisoners.

197
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,442
More Earthlings?

198
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,859
No!

199
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,821
They claim
they're from another dimension.

200
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,825
The fifth dimension.

201
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,161
Bring them to me.

202
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,878
Identify yourself.

203
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,214
(<i> laughing</i> )

204
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,342
You insult me!

205
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,804
I am Chaotica,
Ruler of the Cosmos!

206
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,557
Kneel before
his Majesty!

207
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,144
I said kneel!

208
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,523
You...

209
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,609
have invaded my planet.

210
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,319
Why?

211
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,738
To contact other
photonic life-forms...

212
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,407
to learn from them.

213
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,576
Are you alone

214
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,662
or are you
the vanguard

215
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,997
of an invading army?

216
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,832
We are explorers.

217
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:52,170
I am growing weary
of this charade.

218
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,132
Your armies will be no match
for my space force.

219
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,343
We'll crush you like insects!

220
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,053
They are hostile.

221
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,597
This contact should
be terminated.

222
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,307
CHAOTICA:
Indeed.

223
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,476
Lonzak, execute them!

224
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,728
(<i> shrill screaming</i> )

225
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,107
Coward.

226
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,902
He'll learn there's
no escape from Chaotica.

227
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,278
Gather my space force.

228
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,530
Power the death ray!

229
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,907
At once, Majesty.

230
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,371
Take Miss Goodheart
to Arachnia.

231
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,584
Invite the queen
to join me in battle.

232
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,835
Together,

233
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:37,173
we will rain destruction
on the fifth dimension!

234
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,426
(<i> screaming shrilly</i> )

235
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,348
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

236
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,392
<i>We've been spinning our wheels</i>

237
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,520
<i>for three days now,</i>
<i>and still no progress</i>

238
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,314
<i>in breaking free</i>
<i>of the subspace layer.</i>

239
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,858
Look on the bright side--

240
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,318
there's only
three meals a day.

241
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,698
Coffee. Black.

242
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,990
Uh, sorry, Captain.

243
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,743
We lost two more
replicators this morning.

244
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,244
Listen to me
very carefully,

245
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,121
because I'm only going
to say this once.

246
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,624
Coffee. Black.

247
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,292
Yes, ma'am.

248
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,422
Coffee. Black.

249
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,049
While I've got your
attention, there are...

250
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,134
Coffee first.

251
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,227
Now, what's the problem?

252
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,853
It's a... it's a
delicate matter.

253
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,732
I don't have time to play
20 questions, Neelix.

254
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:40,487
Replicators aren't the only
systems of convenience off-line.

255
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,907
We've only got four
functioning lavatories

256
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,534
for a ship of 150 people.

257
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,369
I see.

258
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,039
Needless to say, lines
are beginning to form.

259
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,832
If we don't get
unstuck soon,

260
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,252
we may have a serious
problem on our hands...

261
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,547
uh... especially
with the Bolians.

262
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,009
All but three sonic
showers are off-line, too.

263
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,719
In another
couple of days...

264
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,012
I get the idea.

265
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,597
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Captain to the Bridge.</i>

266
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,432
On my way.

267
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,143
I'm going to leave these
problems in your capable hands.

268
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,645
Yes, ma'am.
Now, I was thinking,

269
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,895
if we drew up a schedule...

270
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,481
Whatever it takes.

271
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,199
Status.

272
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,660
The warp core
has been powered down.

273
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,161
Thrusters at standby.

274
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,832
Okay. Let's
give it a try.

275
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,042
Take us out, Tom, nice and slow.

276
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,094
PARIS:
We're moving.

277
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,805
Two meters per second.

278
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,848
Three meters.

279
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,683
Steady.

280
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,893
Nine meters.

281
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,395
Ten...

282
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,355
Increase power
to the thrusters by 50 percent.

283
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,898
TORRES:
We're approaching

284
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,274
the subspace boundary.

285
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,443
25 meters per second.

286
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,073
Wait a minute.

287
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,449
We're slowing down.

288
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,703
19 meters per
second... 18...

289
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,454
Captain,
I'm reading power surges.

290
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,372
Source?

291
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,456
Unknown,
but they look

292
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,957
like weapons signatures.

293
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,918
I'm not reading
any other ships in the area.

294
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,962
(<i> sighs</i> )

295
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,464
We've stopped.

296
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,675
TUVOK:
I've localized
the weapons fire.

297
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,386
It's emanating
from within the ship--

298
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,430
Deck 6,
Holodeck 2.

299
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,890
Who's still
on that deck?

300
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,308
No one. No life signs.

301
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,685
There's a program running.

302
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,853
It's<i> Captain Proton.</i>

303
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,187
<i>Proton?</i>

304
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,606
CHAKOTAY:
Can you shut it down?

305
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,981
KIM:
Negative.

306
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,109
Control system
still malfunctioning.

307
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,153
Tuvok, get down there and
find out what's happening.

308
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,196
Well, join him.

309
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,489
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,088
It appears that
a battle took place.

311
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,842
Believe me, it wasn't
like this when I left.

312
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,136
I must have missed
a few chapters.

313
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,013
Holodeck programs don't
normally run by themselves.

314
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,390
No kidding.

315
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,774
She's dead.

316
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,525
Who is she?

317
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,110
Constance Goodheart.

318
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,737
My secretary.

319
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,280
This doesn't make sense.

320
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,657
She isn't supposed to die.

321
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,533
She's one of the good guys.

322
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,535
I'm sure you two
were very close,

323
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,704
but she is a
holodeck character.

324
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,873
A character
from 1930s Hollywood.

325
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,667
The good guys
never get killed.

326
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,252
Something's wrong here.

327
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,256
ROBOT (<i> slow and distorted):</i>
Invaders from
the fifth... dimension.

328
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,008
Satan's robot.

329
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,593
Naturally.

330
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,680
Queen Arachnia...
is on her way.

331
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,891
Invaders from
the... fifth dimension.

332
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,892
Give me a hand.

333
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,393
If we can repair
his vocalizer,

334
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,479
he might be able to tell us
what's been going on.

335
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,273
Destroy Proton.

336
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,443
It looks like...
he burned out a resistor.

337
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,236
A what?

338
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,823
That's a few centuries
before deutronic circuitry.

339
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,951
I see. How do you propose
we repair him?

340
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,746
Well, first of all,
we've got to remove

341
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,331
this damaged tube.

342
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,918
No problem.

343
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,796
Just a few crossed wires.

344
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,341
Your knowledge of this
technology is most impressive.

345
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,092
Oh... thanks.

346
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,346
There. Got it.

347
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:41,143
(<i> still distorted):</i>
Intruders... Intruders...
Intrude...

348
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,813
(<i> clearly</i> ):
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!

349
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,105
Tell us
what happened.

350
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,274
Invaders from
the fifth dimension!

351
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,943
Invaders from
the fifth dimension!

352
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,069
Hey, calm down!

353
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,571
How did these
invaders get here?

354
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,072
A portal.

355
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,657
The fifth dimension...

356
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,284
There's not supposed to be
alien invaders in this story.

357
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,329
That's in "Captain Proton
Versus the Cosmic Creature."

358
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,374
Invaders
from the fifth dimension!

359
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,045
Those subspace distortions.

360
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,923
Take us to this... portal.

361
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,150
There.

362
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,909
Photonic charges--

363
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,327
the same signatures
as the weapons fire we detected.

364
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,537
The fifth dimension!

365
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,997
We must report this
to the Captain.

366
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,125
Wait. I want to check
my rocket ship first.

367
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,209
Excuse me?

368
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,336
It's got sensors.
Sort of.

369
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,922
Maybe they can
tell us something

370
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,924
<i>Voyager's</i> sensors can't.

371
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,265
I've established a visual link
with the holodeck.

372
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,230
The attack appears to be
originating from subspace.

373
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,232
Can you tell where
it's coming from?

374
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,943
No.

375
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,654
(<i> burst of static</i> )

376
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,199
What was that?

377
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,618
Chaotica's
death ray.

378
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,995
Excuse me?

379
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,537
Let's see if we can

380
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,581
get a look inside
his fortress,

381
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,583
find out what
he's up to.

382
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,211
<i>Full power to the death ray!</i>

383
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:38,177
<i>Arachnia,</i>
<i>Queen of the Spider People...</i>

384
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,764
you have not responded
to my summons. Don't...<i> </i>

385
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,390
(<i> shuts off sound</i> )

386
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,143
I don't get it.

387
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,519
Chaotica was
supposed to be

388
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,937
fighting Earth
in this chapter.

389
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,314
Apparently,
he's found a new enemy.

390
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,691
The fifth
dimension.

391
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,818
It seems
your infantile scenario

392
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,444
now poses a security risk.

393
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,196
It was just
supposed to be

394
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,281
a little harmless
entertainment.

395
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,327
Entertainment-- another
frivolous human endeavor.

396
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,496
TUVOK:
<i>These</i> are your sensor readings?

397
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,165
Telegram.

398
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,291
It's a message
to Captain Proton

399
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,044
from the President
of Earth.

400
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,087
"Intercepted
communications

401
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:17,717
"between Dr. Chaotica
and Arachnia. Stop.

402
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:22,429
"Chaotica at war with aliens
from fifth dimension. Stop.

403
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,099
Must strike now
to disable death ray."

404
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,392
Stop.

405
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,352
Please summarize
the message.

406
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,649
Well, it looks like...
Chaotica has captured

407
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,735
a couple of aliens
from the fifth dimension.

408
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,695
An alternate universe.

409
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,198
Could be. Maybe they wandered
into the holodeck

410
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,908
through one
of those distortions.

411
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,617
To participate
in a game?

412
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,452
Intruder!

413
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,416
TUVOK:
I assume

414
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,459
there's no locking mechanism
on the hatch.

415
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,087
It was a
simpler time.

416
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,466
Is he part
of the program?

417
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,552
I don't
recognize him.

418
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,058
Invaders!
Inv...

419
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,184
(<i> loud clank</i> )

420
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,143
Quiet!

421
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,269
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Invaders.

422
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,437
Look,

423
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,272
there's been a
misunderstanding.

424
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,110
I'm Ensign Paris
from the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

425
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,736
This is Lieutenant Tuvok.

426
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,571
You have killed 53 of my people.

427
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,115
We haven't
killed anyone...

428
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,033
Ensign.

429
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,036
Everything you see here
is a simulation.

430
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,121
None of it's real.

431
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,789
Simulation?

432
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,540
A photonically-based projection.

433
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,375
All life is photonic.

434
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,752
We are not.

435
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,712
We are biochemical life-forms.

436
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,673
I'm not familiar
with biochemical.

437
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,467
We are carbon-based.

438
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,136
We live aboard a starship.

439
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,180
I believe we have become trapped
in a region of space

440
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,723
that intersects your own.

441
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,767
We've detected no starship...

442
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,435
only this planet.

443
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,312
This planet isn't real.

444
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,730
As I told you,

445
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,690
it's part of
a simulation.

446
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,401
Maybe we can help you
adjust your sensors.

447
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,863
You don't register
as a life-form.

448
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,492
You are the illusion.

449
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,494
We're as real as
you are. Listen...

450
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,205
Citizen of the fifth dimension,

451
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,457
you will be destroyed.

452
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,879
PARIS:
Wait!

453
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,048
Wait!

454
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,969
Damage. Damage.
Require maintenance. Help.

455
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,054
Help.

456
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,056
Help.

457
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,604
Let me get
this straight.

458
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,315
Transdimensional aliens

459
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,900
have mistaken
your<i> Captain Proton</i> simulation

460
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,319
for reality.

461
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,653
Yes, ma'am.

462
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,155
And now an
armed conflict

463
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,032
has broken out
between these aliens

464
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,867
and Chaotica's
holographic army.

465
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:48,993
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,287
His Army of Evil.

467
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,998
Will someone explain why we
haven't shut down the holodeck?

468
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,083
We've tried. The controls
are still off-line.

469
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,335
We're going to have

470
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,045
to get through to
these aliens somehow

471
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,921
and explain that they're
fighting shadows.

472
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,840
We've tried,
but they don't believe us.

473
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,301
They think
that<i> we're</i> not real.

474
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,137
They can't detect<i> Voyager,</i>

475
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,555
so every time they scan us,

476
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,848
we seem as
artificial to them

477
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,060
as holographic
characters do to us.

478
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,395
That explains why they
haven't answered our hails.

479
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,564
The Doctor
is photonic.

480
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,940
He may be able
to persuade them.

481
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,275
It's worth a try.
Brief him.

482
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,693
In the meantime,

483
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,737
I think we should let
the program play out.

484
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,322
You're not
suggesting we wait

485
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,115
until this Chaotica
defeats the aliens?

486
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,867
No, no. I'm suggesting

487
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:33,287
that we help the aliens
to defeat Chaotica.

488
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,872
They think that
he's leading

489
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,333
some kind of hostile
invasion force.

490
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,085
Once that threat is
gone, it's a good bet

491
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,088
that they will leave and
close up their portals.

492
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,798
How do you propose
to defeat Chaotica?

493
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,301
Well, he's been
attacking the aliens

494
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,802
with his death ray.

495
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,763
It's a shame
we don't have one.

496
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,391
No. Forget about what
it's called, Tuvok.

497
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,226
In the world of
<i>Captain Proton,</i>

498
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,644
it's the most powerful
weapon that there is

499
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,355
and because
it's photonic,

500
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,481
it's lethal
to these aliens.

501
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,984
Now, in Chapter 18,

502
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,486
Captain Proton
disables this weapon

503
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,698
just before Chaotica can use it
to destroy Earth.

504
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,117
And you think
that Proton,

505
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,660
namely you of course,
could still do that?

506
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,956
Well, we'd have to knock out
the lightning shield first.

507
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,165
A force field.

508
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,708
Yeah. Now you're catching on.

509
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,585
The destructo beam
on my rocket ship

510
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,129
can disable the death ray,

511
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,298
but only if someone gets inside
the Fortress of Doom

512
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,133
and can shut down
the lightning shield.

513
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,508
And who's supposed
to do that?

514
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,262
Arachnia,
Queen of the Spider People.

515
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,638
Charming.

516
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,349
Chaotica thinks so.

517
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,184
In the story,
he's in love with her.

518
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,811
He's been trying
to form an alliance

519
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,313
since Chapter Three.

520
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,814
She's the only one
that he trusts,

521
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,441
the only one
who can get close enough

522
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,277
to disable
the lightning shield.

523
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:50,197
Somebody is going to have
to take on her character.

524
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,907
Who'd you have in mind?

525
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,620
Oh, no.

526
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,622
It's the role
of a lifetime.

527
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,124
Captain, need I remind you

528
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,168
that we have exhausted
all other possibilities

529
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,877
of escaping
this layer of subspace.

530
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,045
Until we
can eliminate

531
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,089
those distortions,
we're trapped.

532
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,299
Think of it
as Starfleet's

533
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,883
first encounter
with Planet X.

534
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,051
Thanks.

535
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,304
Captain, it won't
be so bad.

536
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,139
I can explain to you
what you can expect.

537
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,514
I can tell you...

538
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,975
All right, all right!

539
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,730
I'm a size four.

540
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,361
What's the emergency?

541
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,487
I've been enlisted.

542
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,988
I'm supposed to make contact

543
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,157
with our photonic friends
from the fifth dimension

544
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,034
and convince them
to call off their attack.

545
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,453
Congratulations.
Why do you need me?

546
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,996
It's an undercover mission.

547
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,873
I'll need a bit
of cosmetic surgery.

548
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,709
These are the parameters
for my new costume.

549
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,835
What are you
going as--

550
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,753
the Emperor of
the Universe?

551
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,007
Well, I've been forced
to scale back my role

552
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,051
in the interest
of credibility.

553
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:55,346
I'll be President
of Earth.

554
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:58,182
I must say, the idea
of an entire universe

555
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,060
populated by photonic beings
is rather appealing.

556
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,978
Well, if your
mission fails,

557
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,689
you could be taking up
permanent residence.

558
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,775
<i>Kim to Sick Bay.</i>
<i>Report to Holodeck 2, Doctor.</i>

559
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,027
You're all set.

560
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,778
The new parameters
will activate

561
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,447
as soon as you
enter the holodeck.

562
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,490
Thank you.

563
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,326
Break a leg.

564
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,747
So all I have to do

565
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,749
is find the controls
of this death ray

566
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,042
and deactivate it.

567
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,127
Well, it's not as
simple as it sounds.

568
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,547
Now, Chaotica might be
a 1930s villain,

569
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,881
but he's very clever.

570
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,799
It'd help if you
knew some of the rules.

571
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,759
I'm listening.

572
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,302
All right. Well...

573
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,595
first of all,
he's a megalomaniac,

574
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,681
so it's a good idea
to appeal to his ego.

575
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,933
Right.

576
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,227
And, um, use
grandiose language.

577
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,187
He likes to be
called "Sire,"

578
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,898
and it helps to
say things like

579
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,360
"The clever fiendishness
of your evil plan

580
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,652
is brilliant."

581
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,614
Deck 4.

582
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,615
Now, remember:

583
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,786
It's ray gun, not phaser,

584
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,414
um, imagizer,
not viewscreen,

585
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,915
Earthlings,
not Terrans.

586
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:05,999
Got it.

587
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,460
And another thing...

588
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,669
these villains always have
a trick up their sleeve--

589
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,380
trapdoors,
secret weapons...

590
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,465
It's the holodeck.

591
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,091
I can't be hurt
by weapons.

592
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,343
Well, that doesn't mean
that you can't be restrained

593
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,886
or thrown into
the Dungeon of Pain.

594
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,305
Noted.

595
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,141
Now, as soon as you get
the death ray shut down,

596
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,476
call me in my rocket ship

597
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,977
and give me
the signal to fire.

598
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,479
You'll have to use

599
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,439
Chaotica's broadcast
microphone.

600
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,441
This is how you've been
spending your free time?

601
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,733
Well, I've
been studying

602
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,569
how past generations
viewed the future.

603
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,612
And...?

604
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,905
Well, it didn't work out

605
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,991
quite as black-and-white
as they imagined.

606
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,494
Now, the specifications
for Arachnia's costume.

607
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,744
One more thing...

608
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,871
if you have trouble
with Chaotica

609
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,832
or you can't get
to the death ray,

610
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,293
you can always uncork
the pheromones.

611
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,669
I beg your pardon.

612
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,422
Uh, Chapter 16.

613
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,132
"Spell of the Spider."

614
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,718
Arachnia sends Chaotica a vial
of her irresistible potion.

615
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,679
Now, whenever he gets a whiff,
he's under her spell.

616
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,641
I get the picture.

617
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,310
Yeah, well, my point is,
is that these pheromones

618
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,604
seem to throw
Chaotica for a loop.

619
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,439
Well, it worked in
Chapter 16 anyway.

620
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,275
Now, the vial is sitting
on a small pedestal

621
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,443
next to the throne.

622
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,486
I'll keep an eye out.

623
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,363
Okay.
Thanks for the briefing.

624
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,573
I'll see you
at the Fortress of Doom.

625
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,409
And remember-- you're the queen.

626
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,295
Sire!

627
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,172
Three more
of our space ships

628
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,882
have been destroyed.

629
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,425
(<i> growling</i> )

630
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,555
Full power to
the death ray.

631
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,730
Citizens of the fifth dimension,

632
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,026
your feeble attacks
are nothing but pinpricks to me.

633
00:28:56,026 --> 00:29:00,656
Surrender now
and I will be merciful.

634
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,824
We're receiving
a transmission.

635
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,826
They are surrendering.

636
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,579
No.

637
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,414
It's Queen Arachnia.

638
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,709
She wishes to cross
the drawbridge.

639
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,502
Ah...

640
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,879
What are you
waiting for?

641
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,548
Show her in.

642
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:31,144
I present
her Royal Highness...

643
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,896
Arachnia.

644
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,947
Ah...

645
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,457
At last...

646
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,378
At last... my queen.

647
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,395
This is an historic
occasion.

648
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:17,316
Kindred souls
meet at last.

649
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,569
It's an honor to be in
your presence, Majesty.

650
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,571
I've always
admired your...

651
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,241
clever fiendishness.

652
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:34,207
Ah, your taste is exceeded
only by your beauty.

653
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,795
This must be
your death ray.

654
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:41,923
That, my dear,
is the Cradle of Persuasion.

655
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,550
It's fully equipped--

656
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,552
a brain probe,

657
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,970
pain modulator.

658
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,597
Impressive.

659
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,141
It's good you have
the lightning shield

660
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,976
to protect your equipment.

661
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,647
Yes, as long as
it's electrified,

662
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,440
I am invincible!

663
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,818
But my greatest achievement

664
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,528
is there.

665
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,114
Behold-- the death ray.

666
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,284
Oh, it looks like a...

667
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,453
formidable weapon.

668
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,955
The most powerful
in the cosmos.

669
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,379
There is so much more
I want to show you.

670
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,593
My throne, for example.

671
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,345
The seat...

672
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,971
of my Empire.

673
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,059
Ah!

674
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,396
I see you've
kept my pheromones.

675
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,442
I didn't realize

676
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,529
you were the
sentimental type.

677
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:49,115
Your perfume
inspires me.

678
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,703
Would you mind?

679
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:53,912
Please.

680
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,590
Somehow I feel comfortable here.

681
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,759
Join me...

682
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,177
and you will have
your own chair--

683
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,180
one adorned with the
most precious jewels

684
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,515
and the softest silk.

685
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,226
Your Majesty seems
overly concerned

686
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,561
with romantic matters

687
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,897
when there's
a battle to be won.

688
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:22,232
That is why
you asked me here.

689
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,359
Of course, my dear.

690
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,985
Forgive me.

691
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,988
It's just that
the air itself

692
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,826
seems to vibrate
in your presence.

693
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,120
We can't be slaves
to our passion...

694
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,748
not when your Empire
is threatened.

695
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:42,168
I have assembled
my fleet of... Spider Ships.

696
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,087
However, the lightning shield

697
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,590
prevents them from
approaching your fortress.

698
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,467
We'll send them
directly into battle

699
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,010
alongside my
space force.

700
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,140
My soldiers wish
to pay homage to you.

701
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,851
Gratifying.

702
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:01,563
Of course, if
I lower the shield,

703
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,149
my fortress will
be defenseless.

704
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,110
Even an ally might
choose such a moment

705
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,279
to seize my throne.

706
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,197
You don't trust me.

707
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,659
There is a way you could
convince me of your loyalty.

708
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,952
Oh?

709
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,787
I'll lower my
lightning shield,

710
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:20,373
but first, you must
become my queen!

711
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,417
Gather my
courtiers!

712
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,419
Prepare for
the ceremony!

713
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,965
And don't forget to deactivate
the lightning shield

714
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,884
so my subjects may witness
the blessed event.

715
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,218
Very well.

716
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,179
Do as she says,

717
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,431
once her guests
have arrived.

718
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,517
Yes, Sire.

719
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,855
And so, my dear...

720
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:47,400
the day you have always
dreamed of has arrived...

721
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,156
the day you become
Bride of Chaotica!

722
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,618
(<i> laughing</i> )

723
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,753
(<i> instrument beeping</i> )

724
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,554
Welcome.

725
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,728
You are photonic.

726
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,688
Guilty as charged.

727
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,524
You signaled me
across the threshold.

728
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,859
How?

729
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,611
I believe you dropped
your calling card.

730
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,363
I return it to you...

731
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,866
as a sign of good faith.

732
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,577
Identify yourself.

733
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,662
I am the President of Earth.

734
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,955
Earth?

735
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,416
A planet
some distance from here.

736
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,960
I've come on a mission of peace.

737
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,336
Elaborate.

738
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,838
Your people

739
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,964
and the people of Earth

740
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,215
have a common enemy.

741
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,133
Chaotica.

742
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,176
The one and only.

743
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,469
He threatens

744
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,430
to invade our realm,
destroy our people.

745
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,806
Join the club.

746
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,475
Chaotica has designs
on Earth, too,

747
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,270
but we've withstood
countless attacks

748
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,022
all thanks to one man--

749
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,690
Captain Proton.

750
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,358
Captain Proton?

751
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,946
Defender of the Universe,
Scourge of Intergalactic Evil

752
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,406
and...
a competent medic to boot,

753
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,033
but don't say I said so.

754
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,910
Even as we speak,
he's preparing

755
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,828
to destroy Chaotica's death ray,

756
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,246
but he needs your help.

757
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,248
Explain.

758
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:29,086
Your weapons pose a threat
to Proton's rocket ship.

759
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,754
You must cease firing

760
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,923
while he mounts his attack.

761
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,634
Once Chaotica's death ray
is destroyed,

762
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,594
you can return to your realm,

763
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,847
confident that you'll never
hear from him again.

764
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,642
Captain Proton...

765
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,105
may proceed.

766
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,524
On behalf of
the citizens of Earth,

767
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,652
I thank you.

768
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,160

769
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,202
Check.

770
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,454
Check.

771
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,538
Destructo beam.

772
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,539
Check.

773
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,833
Check.

774
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,461
If I could access
holodeck controls,

775
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,546
the first thing I'd do
is delete this guy.

776
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,007
ROBOT:
Delete this guy.

777
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,175
As a matter of fact,
as soon as this is all over,

778
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,637
I think I'm going to delete
the whole program!

779
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,056
What about your
historical study?

780
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,766
Class dismissed.

781
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,770
No more robots,
no more mad scientists,

782
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,814
no more death rays.

783
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,483
I am retiring
my rocket pack, Harry.

784
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,736
Someone else can save
the universe from now on.

785
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,530
The final chapter, huh?

786
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,823
The end.

787
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,574
(<i> door squeaks open</i> )

788
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,370
Isn't anyone going to sing
"Hail to the Chief"?

789
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,246
KIM:
Mr. President,
how'd it go?

790
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,124
My performance
was unimpeachable.

791
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,625
He agreed?

792
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,128
Let's just say I'm considering
running for office

793
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,504
when we get back to Earth.

794
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,214
(<i> chuckles</i> )

795
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,383
All right, then. Let's get
this thing in the air

796
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:04,305
and hope Captain Janeway
is giving a command performance.

797
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,310
Queen Arachnia.

798
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,981
Don't tell me...

799
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,108
my wedding ring.

800
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,194
Doctor Chaotica's
wedding ring.

801
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,321
You will present it to him
at the end of the ceremony.

802
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,700
Your Majesty,

803
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,494
perhaps we should lower
the lightning shield

804
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,371
in anticipation of my guests.

805
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,624
Why this preoccupation
with the shield?

806
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,126
Oh, forgive me.

807
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,129
It's just that, as
a fellow ruler of the cosmos,

808
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,464
I often have
to do things myself.

809
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,926
Ah. Because of
the incompetence

810
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,553
of your inferiors,
no doubt.

811
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,138
Something like that.

812
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,974
Oh, Arachnia,
my love, my life...

813
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,352
how well you
understand our plight.

814
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,814
If it weren't beneath my
dignity, I... I would weep.

815
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,984
How I've longed for someone
who would understand.

816
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,029
We have a saying
on Arachnia:

817
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,740
"It's lonely at the top."

818
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,325
Hmm. No longer, my dear.

819
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,953
Majesty!

820
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,080
Proton is preparing
to attack.

821
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,372
Wha...?

822
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,044
Ah!

823
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,046
Target his rocket ship.

824
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,718
(<i> grunts</i> )

825
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,643
You have betrayed me.

826
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,187
You are in league with Proton.

827
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,314
Impetuous harlot!

828
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,776
Tell me how to deactivate
the lightning shield

829
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:43,238
or I'll show you just
how impetuous I can be.

830
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,448
What are you waiting
for, you great lummox?

831
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,408
Kill her!

832
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,120
Ha! You're no match
for Arachnia.

833
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,623
Now, tell me
how to shut down the shield.

834
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,750
The confinement rings!

(<i> laughing</i> )

00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,847
Oh, don't worry.

837
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,390
I wouldn't kill my bride...

838
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,811
not until after

839
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,021
our wedding night.

840
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,065
Reactivate the death ray.

841
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,733
Destroy Proton!

842
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,449
We've been hit.

843
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,994
Well, I guess the Captain
ran into some trouble.

844
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,121
We're not going down
without a fight.

00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,105
<i>The aliens have retreated</i>

911
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,981
and they've closed
the distortions.

912
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,567
We've cleared
the subspace layer.

913
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,859
Secure all systems

914
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,652
and organize
damage repair teams.

915
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,113
<i>Understood.</i>

916
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,031
<i>We're preparing</i>
<i>to shut down the holodeck.</i>

917
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,033
<i>Chakotay, give me a minute.</i>

918
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,794
(<i> sighs</i> )

919
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,630
I was about to say,
"Captain Proton to the rescue,"

920
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,716
but I see you have
everything under control.

921
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,719
I'm the queen, remember?

922
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,679
CHAOTICA:
Arachnia.

923
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:05,977
Death, as you know it,
has no hold on me.

924
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:10,315
My defeat
is but a temporary setback.

925
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:15,194
I shall return
to seek my revenge.

926
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,862
He doesn't give
up, does he?

927
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,364
They never do.

928
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,826
Our love was not
meant to be, my queen,

929
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,454
but be warned.

930
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,415
You have not seen the last of...

931
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,669
Chaotica.

932
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,385
The end of
a twisted madman.

933
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,304
And you're going
to miss him.

934
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,764
A little.

935
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,225
(<i> '30s serial music playing</i> )

936
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,321
(<i> Chaotica laughing</i> )
