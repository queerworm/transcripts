hallucinations.

372
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,902
The same symptoms as Chakotay
but a different cause.

373
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,862
Exactly. In this case,
the gene responsible

374
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,447
for producing
protein insulation

375
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,740

hallucinations using

384
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:54,216

but, unless I can find

719
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,173
Success seems to be
in short supply lately.

720
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,808
Impossible.

721
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,101
Captain?

722
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,439
And to think...

723
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,567
that kept me
from getting an "A."

724
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,318
It was the only
question I missed

725
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,904
in exo-genetics
my senior year.

726
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,031
The nucleotide
resonance frequency.

727
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,075
That signal was designed
to activate DNA.

728
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,826
It realigned his
molecular bonds.

729
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,244

730
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,371
They're the ones
who scheduled the fight.

731
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,539
They're promoting it.

732
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,999
They're putting
up the purse.

733
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,542
His sensory cortex
is hyperactive.

734
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,835
He's still
hallucinating.

735
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,169
It's not an hallucination,

736
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,964
not a vision quest,
it's a prizefight!

737
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,214
Chakotay, do you know me?

738
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,382
Do you know where you are?

739
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,675
I know you,
Captain,

740
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,969
but you stopped
the fight.

741
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,470
You ruined my career!

742
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,430
Nobody is going to put me
on the card after this!

743
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,140
It's better for you
to rest, Chakotay,

744
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,434
until we can figure out
why this is happening to you.

745
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,685
They want to contact me.

746
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,895

747
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,563
The people who live here.

748
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,773
This will sedate him.

Wait a minute.

750
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,860
You believe somebody
lives here, in chaotic space?

751
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,029
And they're trying
to communicate with you?

752
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,239
Yes! I saw him!

753
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,658
Tell me about him.

754
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,242
What does he look like?

755
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,744
He's got a couple
of kilos on me,

756
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,996
a few centimeters
in height,

757
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,538
but I can take
him, Captain!

758
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,126
I just have to stay
off the ropes.

759
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,963
The holodeck boxing simulation
is still strong in his memory.

760
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,090
Obviously, it's the
primary source of imagery

761
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,883
for his hallucinations.

762
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,052
What if those
hallucinations

763
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,262
are being induced...
for a purpose?

764
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,891

on some perceptual wavelength

765
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,102
that our senses can't detect,

766
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,896
and the only way for them
to communicate

767
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,150
with us is
to alter our senses.

768
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,527
Chakotay's bad gene
gave them the opportunity.

769
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,029

770

771

Two of their crew members
claimed they were seeing things.

772
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,661
Was somebody trying
to communicate with them?

773
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,705
Was somebody trying
to warn them, help them?

774
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,998
Or trying to destroy them,

775
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,624
just as they're trying
to destroy us.
