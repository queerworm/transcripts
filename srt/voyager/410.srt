00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,050
<i>We've spent the last three days</i>
<i>on the Mari homeworld.</i>

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,094
<i>It's been a while since</i>
<i>we've had the opportunity</i>

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,721
<i>to make new friends,</i>

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,599
<i>and the crew seems to be making</i>
<i>the most of our stay.</i>

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,559
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,936
Neelix.

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,647
Tom. You've been doing
a little shopping.

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,857
It's a present
for B'Elanna.

10
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,191
What is it?

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,694
Well, it's sort
of personal.

12
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,028
Of course.
Say no more.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,363
I'm on my way

14
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,657
for a little romantic
rendezvous myself.

15
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,159
( sniffing )

16
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,290
Neelix...

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,417
are you wearing
cologne?

18
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,836
Oh.

19
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,713
Talchok musk.

20
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,256
Very enticing scent,
don't you think?

21
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,050
Well, uh, it
certainly is...

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,260
musky.

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,930
I'm going
to see Talli again.

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,474
Ooh, that was fast work.
Where're you taking her?

25
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,810
Well, actually, I haven't
gotten that far yet.

26
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,729
I'm going to visit her shop,

27
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,314
under the pretext of buying
some produce for the ship,

28
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,193
and then I thought I'd just
sort of segue smoothly

29
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,695
into some dinner
and dancing.

30
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,822
Ha, ha. Sounds like
a good strategy.

31
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,074
You really think so?

32
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,952
I mean, you used to be quite
the ladies' man.

33
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,495
"Used to be"?

34
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,415
Well, I mean, you're involved
now, so, of course,

35
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,624
you won't be availing yourself

36
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,125
of all the beautiful,
fascinating

37
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,419
and very open-minded Mari women.

38
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,713
Neelix, are you<i> trying</i>
to depress me?

39
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,339
I just...

40
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,717
I haven't been with anyone
since Kes,

41
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,719
and I'm feeling a little rusty.

42
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,971
I could use some advice.

43
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,976
The best advice I can give you
is to just be yourself.

44
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,519
Right.

45
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,022
Be myself.

46
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,402
Actually, that's the
second-best piece of advice.

47
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,030
What's the first?

48
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,032
Go a little easier on the musk.

49
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,242
(<i> soft theme playing</i> )

( crowd chattering )

52
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,132
I'm sorry, Mr. Guill,
but that's my final offer.

53
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,969
Actually, Captain,
I sense you'd be willing

54
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,805
to raise your price
to 300 renns.

55
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,974
Lieutenant Torres needs
this resonator coil to upgrade

56
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,809
<i>Voyager's</i>
communications systems.

57
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,977
Telepaths.

58
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,269
JANEWAY:
Wait a minute.

59
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,438
I sense you'd
be willing to...

60
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,107
settle for 250.

61
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,691
( chuckles )

62
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,610
You must have read my mind.

63
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,154
Aah! Unh. Hey!

64
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,405
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,907
Are you hurt?

66
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,868
No, no, I'm fine.

67
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,329
I just wish people would
look where they're going.

68
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,873
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

69
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,459
I'll finish up here.
Why don't you go get Neelix?

70
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,088
All right.

71
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,758
This is some
of the loveliest fruit I've--

72
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,468
I've seen
in a long time.

73
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,886
Actually, it's been

74
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,888
one of our worst
waterplum seasons in years.

75
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,682
I don't think you'll
find them very sweet.

76
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,354
Mmm. Mmm.

77
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,773
Oh, how wonderfully tart.
( chuckling )

78
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,233
Mmm. They'll make
excellent preserves.

79
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,696
Neelix?
Hmm?

80
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,239
Why do you want me
to tug on your whiskers?

81
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,784
Excu-- Excuse me?

82
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,162
That is what you're thinking,
isn't it?

83
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,914
That you'd like me
to tug on your whiskers?

84
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,250
Well, as a m-matter of fact...

85
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,128
I'd love to.

86
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,005
Do you have time
to wait until I close?

87
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,009
Yes, I think
I can rearrange my schedule.

88
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,726
I guess you could say
I'm becoming obsolete.

89
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,144
In what sense?

90
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,898
There's virtually no crime
left in our society.

91
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,566
It took many years,

92
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,526
but just walk
through our streets.

93
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,819
Look around.

94
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,738
Violence no longer exists.

95
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,156
Impressive.

96
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,658
I'm one of the last officers
still working

97
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,910

98
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,745
And no doubt
one of the best.

99
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,329
I'm curious to know more

100
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,665
about your
crime-prevention methods.

101

I want to see<i> Voyager.</i>
<i>Learn about your</i> methods.

103
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,090
I'm about to perform
my daily security rounds.

104
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,674
Join me.

105
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,384
They are routine
but informative.

106
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,761
Wonderful.

107
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,554
The transport
site is this way.

Whatever you prefer.

Neelix.

114
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,779
Ready to leave?

115
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,321
Uh, no, uh,

116
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,657

examining the produce.

Why? Why were you
beating that man?

130
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,189
I don't know.

00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,446
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

132
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,637
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

133
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,435
Your "brig."
It's a puzzling concept.

134
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,772
Shutting someone
away as punishment.

135
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,441
Do you find that it
rehabilitates the prisoner?

136
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,402
The brig is primarily used

137
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,695
as a means of ensuring
the safety of others.

138
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,072
In what sense?

139
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,907
For example,
if we find ourselves

140
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,867
with a hostile alien
in our custody,

141
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,827
we may need
to confine the individual

142
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,579
until we can locate
the proper authorities.

143
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,872
I see.

144
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,540
And on rare occasions,
we have been forced

145
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,959
to incarcerate a crew member

146
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,835
who has committed
a serious infraction.

147
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,755
I'm surprised that
one of your people

148
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,174
could be capable of doing
something serious enough

149
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,550
to warrant imprisonment.

150
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,136
It's extremely rare.

151
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,054
In any case,
the brig has been occupied

152
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,140
for less than one percent
of our journey.

153
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,352
Forgive me, Tuvok,
but it seems...

154
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,229
barbaric.

It's all right.

I heard about someone
getting beaten once

167
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,046
when I was a little girl.
It's all over now.

168
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,340
I had nightmares
for weeks.

169
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,425
It's okay.
It's all right.

170
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,719
He was confused.

171
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,930
He said he didn't realize
what he'd done.

172
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,932
I don't understand
why nobody tried to help him.

173
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,851
People were shocked.

174
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,978
Violence is
almost unheard of here.

175
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,063
But when it does occur,

176
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,606
we like
to investigate thoroughly.

Yes. I would like
you, Mr. Neelix,

Well, you have
our complete cooperation.

00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,742
Chief Examiner,
are you suspicious

182
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,411
of my colleagues
for some reason?

183
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,747
No, Lieutenant. I'm simply
conducting an investigation.

184
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,709
Please.
Follow me.

185
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,129
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

186
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
Please have a seat.

187
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,687
I will be monitoring
your thoughts telepathically

188
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,022
during the interview.

189
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,648
This transcription device

190
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,526
will log your
engramatic activity,

191
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,528
so I can review
your statement later.

192
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,987
Let me get this straight.

193
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,324
Not only are you going
to read my mind,

194
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,034
you're going
to record my thoughts.

195
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,785
Yes.

196
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,415
I guess it'd be pretty tough
to keep a secret from you, hmm?

197
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,925
( exhales )

198
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,552
How long had you been
in the marketplace

199
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,719
when the attack occurred?

200
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,472
One hour--
maybe a little longer.

201
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,849
And exactly where
were you standing?

202
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,227
Directly across the square.

203
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,812
From where you were, did you
have a clear view of the attack?

204
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,482
Uh, not at first.

205
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,775
We just heard yelling.

206
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,984
Then, as we got closer,

207
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,819
we saw
what was happening.

208
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,029
What exactly brought you

209
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,406
to the market
in the first place?

210
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,657
Captain Janeway and I

211
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,118
had an appointment
with Mr. Guill.

212
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,411
For what purpose?

213
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,162
We'd met him the day before.

214
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,540
He said he could get
a spare resonator coil for us.

215
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,127
I see. And the two men involved
in the altercation.

216
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,587
Had you seen either of them
before?

217
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,214
I'd never seen the victim...

218
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,800
but the attacker...

219
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,178
I think he was the same man
who bumped into B'Elanna.

220
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,223
Bumped into her? Are you
certain?

221
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,016
Yes. They collided accidentally.

222
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,229
When exactly did
this happen?

223
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,565
Just as we'd settled
on the price.

224
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,400
He seemed to be
in quite a hurry.

225
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,111
Do you recall what you
were thinking at the time?

226
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,404
What I was thinking?

227
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,780
What does it matter?

228
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,576
Please, try to remember.
It may be important.

229
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,495
I didn't think about it much,

230
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,413
and no one was hurt,
and I was busy

231
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,081
<i>trying to sort out the coins.</i>

232
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>I'm not used</i>
<i>to handling currency.</i>

233
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,003
What was I thinking? Ha.

234
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,089
<i>I was thinking how I could bake</i>
<i>a delicious pie</i>

235
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,633
<i>with those waterplums.</i>

236
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,302
NIMIRA:
<i>Are you sure that's all,</i>
<i>Mr. Neelix?</i>

237
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,179
NEELIX:
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

238
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,557
<i>What else would</i>
<i>I</i> <i> be thinking about?</i>

239
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,435
I suppose I was
a little annoyed.

240
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,437
NIMIRA:
<i>Can you be more specific?</i>

241
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,397
All right.

242
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,984
I guess I was thinking
my foot hurt.

243
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,611
I mean, the idiot stepped
right on it.

244
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,572
Did you call him an idiot?
Of course not.

245
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,032
But you<i> thought</i> it?

246
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,992
I guess so.

247
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,952
Did you also think
about retaliating?

248
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,871
It was an accident.

249
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,789
But you said he hurt you.

250
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,791
It didn't occur to you
to hurt him back?

251
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,043
I'd never do that.

252
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,046
But you thought about it.

253
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,508
How am I supposed to remember?

254
00:11:56,508 --> 00:12:00,094
Yes or no, did you think about
hurting him?

255
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,764
Yes or no?

256
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,020
Well, maybe for a split second.

257
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,398
Aah! Hey!

258
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,024
( grunting )

259
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,109
B'ELANNA:
<i>I mean, he should</i>
<i>have been watching</i>

260
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,570
<i>where he was going,</i>

261
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,321
but I realized
that he didn't do it on purpose

262
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,366
so I shook it off and I left.

263
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,701
Why?

264
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,286
What does it matter
what I was thinking?

265
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,500
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres,
you are under arrest.

266
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,793
On what charge?

267
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:37,215
Aggravated violent thought
resulting in grave bodily harm.

268
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:47,308
Are you saying it's a crime
to<i> think</i> about violence?

269
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,560
Yes.

270
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,810
That's ridiculous.

271
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,272
I assure you, it's
quite necessary.

272
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,609
We were once a society
plagued by violence.

273
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,611
When we prohibited
hostile thought,

274
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,571
crime began to drop
immediately.

275
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:03,450
Over the past three generations,
it's all but disappeared.

276
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,159
So you believe
that it's all right

277
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,704
to tell people what they
can and cannot think?

278
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,539
It's an irrefutable fact

279
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,832
that violent thoughts
from others

280
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,294
can lead to violent actions.

281
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,004
Even if B'Elanna had
a violent thought,

282
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,133
it was Frane who
attacked that man.

283
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,843
Which he only did because he
telepathically

284
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,554
received that thought
from B'Elanna.

285
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,432
His mind was contaminated
by the image,

286
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,934
and it resulted in
a loss of control.

287
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,810
He may have committed
the physical act,

288
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,481
but it was instigated by you.

289
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,814
Where we come from,

290
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,734
people are responsible
for their own actions.

291
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,487
And here,
people are responsible

292
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,781
for their own thoughts.

293
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,992
I'm sure you can understand
how that's necessary for a race

294
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,868
of telepaths.

295
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,828
Yes, I can.
Captain!

296
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,498
I'll accept
that your people

297
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,874
can be influenced by
the thoughts of others,

298
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,003
but there were dozens
of people in that square.

299
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,880
How can you be certain
it came from B'Elanna?

300
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,176
The Mari no longer have
violent thoughts.

301
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,843
It's unlikely
any of them

302
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,971
could have been
responsible.

303
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,099
Besides, the evidence
against B'Elanna is clear.

304
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,893
She thought about
committing a hostile act.

305
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,479
I'd like to review
that evidence myself,

306
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,397
if you don't mind.
Certainly.

307
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,732
( device beeping )

308
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,026
But I'm afraid
you'll be disappointed.

309
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,738
What happens to B'Elanna now?

310
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,949
We have an enlightened
penal system here.

311
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,829
Unlike some, we don't lock
people away to punish them.

312
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,872
You'll be released.

313
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,583
Once you've undergone
the engramatic purge.

314
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,210
The what?

315
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,004
It's a medical procedure that
will identify and remove

316
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,131
the offending images
from your mind.

317
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,508
Captain!

318
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,553
Once identified, the images can
be removed

319
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,929
from Frane's mind as well.

320
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,598
Memory extraction.

321
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,600
That's a dangerous
procedure.

322
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,270
There is a risk
of neurological damage,

323
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,734
but it's necessary
for us to treat Frane.

324
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,984
( beeps )

325
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,111
Will you at least
delay the procedure

326
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,656
until we've had a chance
to review the evidence?

327
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,282
Will you?

328
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,081
It'll take us about a day
to reconfigure our instruments.

329
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,251
That's all the time
I can give you.

330
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,088
That's all the time
I'll need.

331
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,759
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

332
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,563
( computers beeping )

333
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,824
Captain, we've got to get
B'Elanna out of there.

334
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,075
You know the rules, Tom.

335
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,368
We can't pick and choose

336
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,621
which laws we'll respect
and which we won't.

337
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,123
Nobody can be expected
to control their thoughts.

338
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,374
Tell that to the Mari.

339
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,918
Are you just gonna
let them

340
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,252
put her through
this process?

341
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,170
I'm doing everything
I can to stop it.

342
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,214
Neelix is going to file
a diplomatic protest,

343
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,716
and Tuvok and I
will be going over

344
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,050
the witness statements.

345
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,594
Maybe we can poke
a few holes

346
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,137
in the Chief
Examiner's case.

347
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,305
And if you can't?

348
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,765
( sighs )

349
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,600
Then let's hope
the doctor can figure out

350
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,351
how to reverse
an engramatic purge.

351
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,062

352
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,564

to return to the ship
as soon as possible.

354
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,692
So much for R&amp;R.

355
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,571
Chakotay, we've
got to talk.

356
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,823
Have a seat.

357
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,866
Here?

358
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,160
I'm sure the Captain
wouldn't object.

359
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,537
What's on your mind?

360
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,789
While Tuvok
and the Captain

361
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,248
are reviewing
the evidence,

362
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,542
B'Elanna's sitting
in a Mari jail cell waiting

363
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,628
for some sort of lobotomy.
We can't let that happen.

364
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,004
What did you
have in mind?

365
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,464
Break her out.

366
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,175
And risk an all-out
confrontation with the Mari?

367
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,718
They're a bunch of pacifists.

368
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,928
They're no match for us.

369
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,805
You're probably right,

370
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,932
but before we start resorting
to extreme measures,

371
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,976
don't you think we should give
the Captain a chance

372
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,435
to find a legal solution?

373
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,938
By the time that happens,
it may be too late.

374
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,857
I'll tell you what.

375
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,900
Why don't you come up
with a rescue plan--

376
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,067
one that minimizes

377
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,736
the possibility
of violence,

378
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,196
and I'll review it.

379
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,156
You're just trying
to keep me busy, aren't you?

380
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,241
Can you blame me?

381
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,118
I'm serious about this,
Chakotay.

382
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,121
So am I.
If your plan is sound,

383
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,207
and the Captain doesn't have
any luck on her end,

384
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,709
I'll recommend we attempt
the rescue.

385
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,920
Thanks. I'll
get right on it.

386
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,799
Tom, I may have let you sit
in the Captain's chair,

387
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,092
but remember,
she's still the boss.

388
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,473
Then you don't accept

389
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,350
the Chief Examiner's
conclusion?

390
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,768
I'm not dismissing it,

391
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,145
but I'm not going
to accept it blindly either.

392
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,189
I've spent
a great deal of time

393
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,567
with Nimira over
the past few days.

394
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,611
She clearly is
a very skilled investigator.

395
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,863
I'm sure she is.

396
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,239
And this isn't
the first time

397
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,115
Lieutenant Torres'
violent proclivities

398
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,743
have created problems.

399
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,202
No argument there.

400
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,496
But I have
a hard time buying

401
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,083
that one fleeting thought
makes her responsible

402
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,626
for a vicious attack.

403
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,961
From what I've learned,

404
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,462
crime here is a result

405
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,464
of exposure
to violent thought,

406
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,341
much as it was on Vulcan

407
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,969
before my people learned
to control their emotions.

408
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,722
In my opinion,
the Mari should be

409
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,599
applauded
for their efforts.

410
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,184
Oh, I'm sure their intentions
are admirable, but, uh...

411
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,729
I'm not about to let them
scramble B'Elanna's brain

412
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,146
without a fight.

413
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,566
But we must prepare ourselves
for the probability

414
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,234
that she will turn out
to be culpable

415
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,736
for the crime.

416
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,529
Maybe so...

417
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,698
and then again...

418
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,617
maybe not.

419
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,285
Take a look at this.

420
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,456
I don't mean to accuse
your friend Nimira

421
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,374
of being less than
thorough, Tuvok, but...

422
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,836
don't you find that
just the least bit curious?

423
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,008
"New evidence"?
( computer beeping )

424
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,970
It concerns the attacker,
Mr. Frane.

425
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,221
According to your own
security records,

426
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,099
he was arrested
on four previous occasions

427
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,516
for harboring
violent thoughts.

428
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,018
You classified him

429
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,480
as an "habitual perpetrator
of hostile images."

430
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,940
True.

431
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,359
But those thoughts
were purged each time.

432
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,696
He spent years
in neurogenic restructuring.

433
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,783
The records also
say he was cured.

434
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,785
Still, it is possible

435
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,703
that Frane had
a relapse...

436
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,204
that he alone
is responsible

437
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,915
for his actions
at the marketplace.

438
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,127
Possible, but unlikely.

439
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,588
Our engramatic
scans of Frane

440
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,883
show that Lieutenant
Torres's thought

441
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,886
was prevalent in his
mind during the attack.

442
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,555
And you are certain

443
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,641
no other violent
thoughts were present?

444
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,726
I'm beginning to feel

445
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,812
like<i> I'm</i> the one
being investigated.

446
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,773
I am simply exploring
all logical options.

447
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,566
As a fellow
law enforcement officer,

448
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,901
you should
understand that.

449
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,403
I do.

450
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,407
And I'm willing to share
my findings with you.

451
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,284
But if you're
trying to prove

452
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,831
your crewmate's innocence,
you're too late.

453
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,917
The case is closed.

454
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,423
Do you think
that this is easy for me?

455
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:20,511
I don't want to harm B'Elanna,
but I don't have a choice.

456
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,847
That thought has
to be contained.

457
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,307
Otherwise, we risk
further violence, maybe even

458
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,060
a citywide panic.

459
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,896
You told me your people
spent centuries

460
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,232
learning how to control
their violent impulses.

461
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,069
I know we haven't achieved
your level of discipline,

462
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,987
but we're trying.

463
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,407
I thought you'd understand.

464
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,661
I am not judging
your culture.

465
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,372
In fact, I admire it.

466
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,959
I have enjoyed
your company in particular,

467
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,794
but I cannot abandon

468
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,547
my responsibility
to B'Elanna.

469
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,926
I must continue
my own investigation.

470
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,553
Go right ahead.

471
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,182
But I intend to proceed
with the engramatic purge.

472
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,185
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

473
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,145
Telepathy...

474
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,439
I don't like it.
Never have.

475
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,399
It's bad
for negotiations,

476
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,110
it's bad
for relationships,

477
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,029
and it's certainly
been bad for B'Elanna.

478
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,073
The fault was her own.

479
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,824
What are you
talking about?

480
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,077
She was careless
with her thoughts.

481
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,037
The result
was violence.

482
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,082
B'Elanna's not used
to being around telepaths.

483
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,792
That doesn't make
her guilty.

484
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,044
Then her crime
was ignorance.

485
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,255
A common affliction
among your crew.

486
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,715
What's that supposed to mean?

487
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,968
You make contact
with alien species

488
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,804
without sufficient understanding
of their nature.

489
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,724
As a result,<i> Voyager's</i> directive
to "seek out new civilizations"

490
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,101
often ends in conflict.

491
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:57,357
What you call "ignorance,"
we call "exploration."

492
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,694
And sometimes it means
taking a few risks.

493
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,156
But it's certainly better
than assimilating

494
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,406
everything in your path.

495
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,993
Your goal is to share knowledge.

496
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,703
Assimilation is the perfect
means of attaining that goal.

497
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,457
"Perfect."

498
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,084
Good morning,
Miss Tembit.

499
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,376
Your usual selection?

500
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,586
Yes, please.

501
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,506
Okay. Oh, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

502
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,216
Aah! Hey!

503
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,260
Idiot! Watch what
you're doing!

504
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,304
( grunts )

505
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,638
( Talli screams )

506
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,808
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

507
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,852
( crowd chattering )

508
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,117
She's dead.

509
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,416
I can't believe
she's dead.

510
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,878
I know this is difficult
for you, Mr. Neelix,

511
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,547
but try to recount for me
everything that happened.

512
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,341
Seven and I
were packing

513
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,051
to return to the ship.

514
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,426
We heard a scream.

515
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,012
I went running...

516
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,973
The old lady was just
standing over Talli's body,

517
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,475
holding the bloody
knife in her hand.

518
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,562
I didn't even get
a chance to say good-bye.

519
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,731
Did the old woman
say anything?

520
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,440
Not that I remember.

521
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,985
She was as shocked and
confused as anyone else.

522
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,989
Do you think this
is somehow connected

523
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,615
with the other attack?

524
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,159
I'm not certain,

525
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,578
but it strikes me
as more than coincidence

526
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,455
that two violent altercations
have occurred within two days,

527
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,874
in a city which purports

528
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,667
to have eliminated
virtually all crime.

529
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,878
MAN ( on communicator ):<i> </i>
<i>Bridge to Commander Tuvok.</i>

530
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,255
Tuvok here.

531

<i>Chief Examiner Nimira</i>

00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,637
Have her escorted
to the briefing room.

535
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,972
Tuvok out.

536
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,724
We will continue later.

537
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,642
Commander.

538
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,397
She was a wonderful young woman.

539
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:03,317
Whoever's responsible
for her death. Find them,

540
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,985
and see that they're
brought to justice.

541
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,697
I will do my best, Mr. Neelix.

542
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,285
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

543
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,094
( door closes )

544
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,929
Thanks for seeing me.

545
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,680
I heard what happened.

546
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,433
Do you have any idea
what caused

547
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,850
this latest attack?

548
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,519
I just finished interviewing
the old woman.

549
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,980
And?

550
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,522
She attacked the victim

551
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,691
in response to the same
violent thought

552
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,610
that motivated
the previous beating.

553
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,029
B'Elanna's thought?

554
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,449
But both she and Frane
are in custody.

555
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,784
How could the thought
have been passed to anyone else?

556
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,702
I don't know.

557
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,871
That's why I'm here.

558
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,833
I need your help.

559
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,919
Then you shall have it.

560
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,172
Thank you.

561
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,381
I don't know
why that thought

562
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,591
is still
contaminating people,

563
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,760
but I have<i> got</i>
to put a stop to it.

564
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,429
I've never dealt
with a murder before,

565
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,181
but you've had experience

566
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,016
with homicide
investigations?

567
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,434
I have.

568
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,269
I thought I would
start by tracing

569
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,271
the old woman's whereabouts
for the past few days

570
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,648
to see where she might have
encountered the thought.

571
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,066
A wise choice.

572
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,985
In the meantime,
I would like

573
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,945
to interview B'Elanna
more extensively.

574
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,447
Perhaps a fresh
perspective

575
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,531
might uncover facts
you hadn't considered.

576
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,451
I'll arrange it immediately.

577
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,414
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

578
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,294
I'm not sure I like
the idea of a mind-meld

579
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,087
any better
than an engramatic purge.

580
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,215
It will be
a limited meld.

581
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,425
I will focus exclusively
on your memories

582
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,677
of the events
surrounding the crime.

583
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,929
It poses no danger.

584
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,515
Are you ready?

585
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,191
Your mind to my mind.

586
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,819
Your thoughts
to my thoughts.

587
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,407
Recall your encounter
with Mr. Frane.

588
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,075
<i>He bumped into you.</i>

589
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,659
<i>What happened next?</i>

590
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,745
B'ELANNA:
<i>I guess that's when</i>
<i>I had the thought</i>

591
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,871
<i>about hitting him.</i>

592
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,540
TUVOK:
<i>And after that?</i>

593
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,791
B'ELANNA:
<i>Guill came over</i>
<i>and asked if I was hurt.</i>

594
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,545
TUVOK:
And what were you
thinking at that moment?

595
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:28,962
Why?

596
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,882
I'm sensing something
more to the encounter

597
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,259
than what you've told me.

598
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,012
Try to recall.
It may be important.

599
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,764
Well, he was just holding me

600
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,224
<i>by the shoulders.</i>

601
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,184
TUVOK:
<i>You said he'd been</i>
<i>reading your mind</i>

602
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,144
<i>during the negotiation.</i>

603
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,521
<i>Was he still doing it?</i>

604
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,939
B'ELANNA:
<i>I don't know.</i>

605
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,483
You experienced
negative feelings about him.

606
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,360
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

607
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,861
He gave me the creeps.

608
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,530
In what sense?

609
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,158
He, uh, wanted something.

610
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,660
<i>Something terrible.</i>

611
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,455
What the hell?

612
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,164
( gasps )

613
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,959
Why didn't
I remember<i> that</i> before?

614
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,335
You may be recalling

615
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,379
an unconscious thought
you had at the time

616
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,922
or an intuition.

617
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,259
Perhaps I should
ask Mr. Guill.

618
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,685
Mr. Guill.

619
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,982
I'm Commander Tuvok,

620
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,525
<i>Voyager's</i> Chief of Security.

621
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,570
My children get upset
when I'm late for supper.

622
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,988
If you're here
to do business,

623
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,697
we could make an appointment
for tomorrow.

624
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,326
I'm here to talk to you
about the attack.

625
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,035
Why me?

626
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,246
My crewmate, Lieutenant Torres
has been charged

627
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,539
with the crime.

628
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,207
I believe
you're acquainted with her.

629
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,084
Lieutenant Torres, yes.

630
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,752
She was arrested?

631
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,713
The Chief Examiner believes
it was her violent thought,

632
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,382
which prompted
the beating.

633
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,759
She seemed like such
a pleasant young woman.

634
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,722
Apparently, she was
almost knocked over

635
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,141
while doing
business with you.

636
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,767
Do you recall that?

637
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,311
Yes.

638
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,146
A man accidentally
ran into her and...

639
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,861
You're not like the others
from your ship, are you?

640
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,530
You're a telepath.

641
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,324
That is correct.

642
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,034
Why are you so curious
about what happened?

643
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:26,038
I am conducting my own
investigation of the crime.

644
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,705
I see.

645
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:31,293
For a moment, I thought you had
another reason for asking.

646
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,881
You...struggle
with violent thoughts as well.

647
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,967
Terrible images,
but they're hidden

648
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,177
deep within your mind.

649
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,096
I am in control
of those images.

650
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,517
All members of the Vulcan race
learn to inhibit emotions.

651
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:49,019
If my unconscious thoughts
are disturbing you,

652
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,812
I will attempt to suppress
them further.

653
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,690
No, please.

654
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,275
Don't trouble yourself.

655
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,194
I can't see them clearly enough
to be affected.

656
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:03,033
I sense that you are fascinated
with my unconscious thoughts.

657
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,744
That you would like to see
more of them if you could.

658
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,787
No.

659
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,582
I was just thinking

660
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,584
maybe I could help you.

661
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:12,876
Help me?

662
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,337
In learning how to deal
with these...

00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,258
No, thank you.

665
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,218
I have sufficient means
of controlling them.

666
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,262
I'm sure you do.

(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

668
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,229
Any other questions?

669
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,772
No.

670
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,899
Then, if you'll excuse me,

671
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,110
I really can't be late
for the table.

672
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,765
Do you have the money?

673
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,057
3,000 renns.

674
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,442
I have something
exciting for you tonight.

Why are you
following us?

676
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,589
I was thinking
about what you said...

677
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,342
your interest
in my unconscious thoughts.

678
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,761
Perhaps we could
help each other.

679
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,929
How would we do that?

680
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,350
By telepathically exchanging
violent images.

681
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,520
That<i> is</i> what
you want, isn't it?

682
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,522
To see what's buried
in my unconscious?

683
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,981
Who is he?

684
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,650
Quiet.

685
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,777
Why should I trust you?

686
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:06,239
Because you know
we are very much alike.

687
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,119
Perhaps I was mistaken.

688
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,454
Wait.

689
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,045
Maybe we<i> can</i>
be of use to each other.

690
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,963
But you'll have
to get rid of this.

Come back later,

693
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,101
If I'm right,
I'll have thoughts to share

694

than anything you can imagine.

I'll need a few
moments to recover.

I'm surprised
you're so easily tired.

706

Your telepathic abilities
are strong.

707
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,613
It is not often that
I exercise those skills.

708
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,616
There must be violent thoughts
to be had from your shipmates,

709
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,952
whether they want
to share them or not.

could they?

Is that how you acquire
your merchandise?

00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,881
Sometimes I buy.

714
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,549
Sometimes I find
a person like you

715
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,884
who's willing to share,

716
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,844
and, yes, when the opportunity
presents itself,

717
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,471
I take what I need.

718
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,265
Which is what you did
to Lieutenant Torres.

719
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:59,311
Frane took her thought,
not me.

720
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,063
So, you know Mr. Frane.

721
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,107
Only casually.

722
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,901
Well enough
to be in business with him?

723
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,569
Why do you ask?

724
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,822
I am interested in the thought
he acquired from B'Elanna.

725
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,533
Her violent tendencies
have always fascinated me,

726
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,995
yet I've never succeeded
in probing her mind.

727
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,958
If you could help me purchase
that thought...

728
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,250
It's impossible.

729
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,878
Frane's already
had it purged.

730
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,255
Odd.

731
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,591
I was certain
you possessed it.

732
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,426
Me?

733
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,808
Didn't you extract the thought
from B'Elanna as well,

734
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,768
just after she
collided with Frane?

735
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,353
What?

736
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,523
I reevaluated B'Elanna's
memories of the incident.

737
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,984
She remembers that
you probed her mind.

738
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,861
She remembers
incorrectly.

739
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,487
Perhaps...

740
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,865
or perhaps you did
extract that image,

741
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,407
which would explain

742
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,451
why that same thought
is still in circulation.

743
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,077
Why it prompted
a murder this morning.

744
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,371
Enough!

745
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,625
It's time you gave me
what you promised.

746
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,920
The only person you'll be
sharing thoughts with tonight

747
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,588
is the Chief Examiner.

748
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,888
Where are you going?

749
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,723
Stand aside.

750
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,183
Tuvok's taking
me into custody.

751
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,727
No!

752
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,102
( all grunting )

753
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:36,491

( computer beeping negative )

755
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,121
Still no sign of him.

756
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,165
Try a multiphasic bio-scan.

757
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,919
We're being hailed, Captain.
It's Nimira.

758
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,879
On screen.

759
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,090
Chief Examiner, have you
had any luck locating Tuvok?

760
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,175
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

761
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,135
I'd like to send a search party.

762
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,512
<i>I can't allow that.</i>

763
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,014
Why not?

764
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,516
<i>We can't risk further</i>
<i>violations of our laws.</i>

765
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,684
That's ridiculous.

766
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,770
Tom.
I really don't think

767
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,187
we pose
a serious threat.

768
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,648
<i>There's nothing more</i>
<i>to discuss.</i>

769
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,150
<i>Lieutenant Torres</i>
<i>will be purged</i>

770
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,569
<i>then returned to you.</i>

771
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,738
Oh. Captain, you can't
let them do that.

772
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:18,784
<i>The decision's been made.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

773
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,035

777
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,336
Let go of me!

778
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,964
B'Elanna, please.

779
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,548
Try to relax.

780
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,800
Oh, you have got
to be kidding!

781
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,135
Sedate her.
No. Wait!

782
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,511
( gasping )

783
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,988
Proceed.

784
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,002
You won't escape punishment
for your crimes.

785
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,461
Quiet!

786
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,839
( panting )

787
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,842
You are responsible
for a death.

788
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,510
I never meant
that to happen.

789
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,762
The old woman begged me for
that thought. I had to help her.

790
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,263
Here.

791
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,808
( grunts )

792
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,810
You are justifying murder.

793
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,604
Enough.
Malin, hold him still.

794
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,318
Now...

795
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,070
show me.

796

798
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,249
You're holding back.

799
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,879
I haven't seen
the best of it yet, have I?

800
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,380
No.

801
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,382
Then show me.

802
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,717
( gasps )

803
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:02,804
If I show you,
will you let me go?

804
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,431
Yes.

805
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,975
Come closer.

806
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,062
( both grunting )

807
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,604
Don't be alarmed.

808
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,523
This will
allow you to see

809
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,275
the deepest recesses
of my mind.

810
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,654
My mind...to your mind

811
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,198
and my thoughts...

812
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,408
to your thoughts.

813
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,372
Yes.

814
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,498
Good.

815
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,251
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

816
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,673
This is the side of you
I wanted to know.

What's...happening?

820
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,736
We are locked
in a Vulcan mind-meld.

821
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,447
You don't understand
the truth of violence.

822

( groans )

823
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,825
Its darkness...

824
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,326
its power!

825
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,996
( whimpering )

826
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,916

828
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,763
Please. Stop.

829
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,478
Increase the electrochemical
displacement,

830
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,564
but be very careful
with the synaptic potentials.

831
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,691
One miscalculation
and we could permanently damage

832
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,860
her cerebral cortex.

833
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,114
MARI ( on communicator ):
<i>Communications Center</i>
<i>to Chief Examiner Nimira.</i>

834
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:45,573
Nimira.

835
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,700
<i>Captain Janeway insists</i>
<i>on speaking with you.</i>

836
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,744
<i>She says it's extremely urgent.</i>

00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,123
Relay her signal.
What is it, Captain?

838
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,834

<i>Lieutenant Torres' engramatic</i>
<i>extraction immediately.</i>

840
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,380
Commander Tuvok
has found new evidence,

841
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,134
which proves her innocence.

842
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:07,345
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

843
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,695
( door opens )

844
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,241
I hope this interruption
is justified.

845
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,952
Suspending an engramatic purge
once it's begun

846
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,829
is highly irregular.

847
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,081
Then let's not waste
any more time. Commander.

848
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,002
I have discovered

849
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,628
that Guill and Frane
are responsible

850
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,214
for the beating
in the marketplace,

851
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,632
and consequently,
for Talli's murder.

852
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,634
Guill, the merchant?

853
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,094
That is correct.

854
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,263
What possible involvement
could he have?

855
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,058
It was Frane who acted
on the violent thought.

856
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,018
That is not in dispute.

857
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,478
However,
Lieutenant Torres' thought

858
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,772
was not transferred
accidentally.

859
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,066
I don't understand.

860
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:04,443
When Guill first met
Lieutenant Torres,

861
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,947
he sensed strong, violent
tendencies within her,

862
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,700
a potential
for mental imagery

863
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,160
which interested him.

864
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,495
In order to exploit
that potential,

865
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,582
he conspired with Frane
to provoke B'Elanna.

866
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,335
They wanted to trigger
a violent thought,

867
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,129
so they could telepathically
draw it from her mind.

868
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,049
I can't believe that.

869
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,593
It is precisely
what happened.

870
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,845
Unfortunately,
they underestimated

871
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,597
the intensity of the thought.

872
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,140
It was more powerful

873
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,684
than anything either of
them had ever experienced.

874
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,354
As a result,
Frane lost control

875
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:40,813
and attacked
the victim.

876
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,776
Why would peaceful men
like Guill and Frane

877
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,321
want to subject themselves
to such hostile images?

878
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,282
My investigation has uncovered

879
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,867
a rather disturbing side
of Mari society.

880
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,412
A black market,
if you will,

881
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,996
in which many
of your citizens

882
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,831
trade in illicit
mental imagery.

883
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,960
Guill is a very prominent figure
in this underground,

884
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,879
or was, until I brought him
into custody.

885
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,345
Why would any of my people

886
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,014
want to indulge
in that kind of behavior?

887
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,767
Apparently, outlawing
violent thought

888
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,518
hasn't made it go away.

889
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,729
All you've done
is force people

890
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,564
to share it
in back alleys.

891
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,067
TUVOK:
It seems you have
a somewhat more...

892
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,446
serious problem than the random
thoughts of a single alien.

893
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,618
Even if I believed you,

894
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,578
I'm not sure anyone else would.

895
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,581
Then I suggest you interrogate
Guill yourselves.

896
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,000
His engramatic record

897
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,252
will undoubtedly confirm
what I've told you.

898
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,004
Where is he now?

899
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:49,590
We have him confined.
In our brig.

<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

902
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,352
<i>Chief Examiner Nimira has</i>
<i>taken custody of Mr. Guill.</i>

903
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,312
<i>Whether his arrest</i>
<i>will lead to reforms</i>

904
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,605
<i>in the Mari justice system</i>
<i>is anyone's guess.</i>

905
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,066
<i>In the meantime, the doctor</i>
<i>is treating Lieutenant Torres</i>

906
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,068
<i>and Commander Tuvok.</i>

907
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,903
Fortunately, the Mari
didn't get very far

908
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,155
with the procedure.

909
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,449
You can return to duty,
Lieutenant,

910
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,701
though perhaps with one
or two fewer violent engrams

911
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,203
in that fiery head
of yours.

912
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,620
It's all right, Doc.

913
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,580
There are plenty more
where those came from.

914
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,582
Duly warned.

915
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,543
Thanks for getting me
out of there.

916
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,879
I was merely
pursuing the truth.

917
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,590
Ah. So if
I was responsible

918
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,176
for passing that thought,

919
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,719
you would have let them
lobotomize me?

920
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,055
It is incumbent upon us
to respect the laws

921
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,431
of the societies
we visit.

922
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,725
Ah. So...

923
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:45,188
you still a fan
of the Mari legal system?

924
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:48,316
My views have been
somewhat modified.

925
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,527
Then you're not
going to lecture me

926
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,195
about losing my temper?

927
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,531
If you must know,
investigating this case

928
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,741
has given me a new respect
for your inner struggle.

929
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:57,992
Really?

930
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,119
Burdened as you are

931
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,579
by your primitive
Klingon psyche,

932
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,872
it is a wonder
you are able to keep

933
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,416
your violent thoughts
under control

934
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,917
as much as you do.

935
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,128
Thanks...I think.

936
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,588
You're welcome.

937
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,259
Of course, there are
various Vulcan techniques

938
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,511
which could help you
increase your self-control.

939
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,346
You don't say.

Come in.
I must speak with you.

944
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,859
Of course.
Have a seat.

945
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,903
I prefer to stand.
I keep forgetting.

946
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,114
You once encouraged me
to express my opinions

947
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,157
if I had something
relevant to say.

948
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,909
Go right ahead.

949
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,745
You wish to return this vessel
to the Alpha Quadrant,

950
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,622
and yet you are following
Starfleet protocol

951
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,249
regarding first contact.

952
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,251
The two objectives
are incompatible.

953
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,668
How so?

954
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,297
Your philosophy of exploration

exposes<i> Voyager</i>
to constant risk.

956
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,259
If you maintain
a direct course,

957
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,094
to Earth and avoid
all extraneous contact

958
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,345
with alien species,

959
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,930
it will increase
your chances of survival.

960
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,475
Well, that would make
a dull ride home.

961
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,809
Captain?

962
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,563
We seek out new races
because we want to,

963
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:11,107
not because we're
following protocols.

964
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:14,068
We have an insatiable curiosity
about the universe.

965
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,780
Your Chief Engineer and Security
Officer were nearly lost today.

966
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,073
That is unacceptable.

967
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,118
To you, maybe,
but not to me or my crew.

968
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,912
Our experience with the Mari
gave us an insight

969
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,872
into a culture
we've never encountered.

970
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,460
But that is irrelevant.

971
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,338
No.
It's how we gain knowledge.

972
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,715
Then we are in disagreement.

00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,259
Good. I dread the day

974
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,637
when everyone on this ship
agrees with me.

975
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,305
I thank you for your opinion,

976
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,016

is not going to change.
