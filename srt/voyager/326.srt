MALE:
The cardinal...is a thief.

9
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:16,095
I delivered two portraits
of his mindless nephew

10
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,221
more than three months ago

11
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,933
to be depicted
in the heroic mode

12
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,435
of an Hercules or an Achilles.

13
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,646
So specified our contract.

14
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,064
I complied...

15
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,357
making that young fool
of a nephew

16
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,820
look far more heroic
than nature ever intended,

17
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,114
an act on my part far greater

18
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:39,159
than anything accomplished
by Hercules or Achilles.

19
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,912
And what have I,
the divine Leonardo da Vinci,

20
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,371
received in payment?

21
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,206
The cardinal's
eternal gratitude?

22
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,459
Ha-ha!
<i>Esatto!</i>

23
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,421
In other words,<i> signorina...</i> 
less than nothing.

24
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,675
All the more reason why
you should accept my proposal.

25
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,303
Money is beside the point,<i> </i>
<i>signo--</i> Catarina, is it?

26
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,683
Yes. I'm only asking for
a corner, one bench--

27
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,685
A place to work
on my own projects...

28
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,770
paintings, sculptures.

29
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,272
Just being here
in your company

30
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,316
is inspiring to me.

31
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,277
Flattery, Catarina,
is also beside the point.

32
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,782
Besides, I prefer
my solitude.<i> Scusami.</i>

33
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,035

00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,870
( laughs )

35
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,287
<i>Meraviglioso.</i>

36
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,289
What will you
call it?

37
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,458
"The Arm of Hephaestus."

38
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,460
The god of the forge.

39
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,629
Every blacksmith who
has ever swung a hammer

40
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,340
will thank me
for this creation.

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,591
Someone once said:

42
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,969
"All invention
is but an extension

43
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,804
of the body of man."

44
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,974
Do not think

45
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,977
that just because I have
enjoyed your visit today,

46
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,396
that I am prepared
to turn my workshop

47
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,315
into a traveler's inn.

48
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,942
<i>Che cazzo!</i>

49
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,402
Here, let me
help you.

50
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,655
You will get your hands
covered in goose grease.

51
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,074
It's good
for the skin.

52
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,412
DA VINCI:
Let us see if we can find
his big brother.

53
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,956
Hopefully,
he will be stronger.

54
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,337
( church bells ringing )

55
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,014
This looks like
a flying machine.

56
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,599
I thought that
because my imagination

57
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,227
took flight so easily,
my body could do the same.

58
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,603
I was wrong.

59
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,983
It's this...
flapping approach.

60
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,902
You've designed your machine

61
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,613
to mimic the way
a bat or a sparrow flies.

62
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,323
Yes, yes. So?

63
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,034
So what if you based it...

64
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,122
on the hawk instead?

65
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,459
The hawk.

66
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,713
A creature that
glides through the air.

67
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,632
<i>Esatto.</i>

68
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,639
We will design
a new machine...

69
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,308
and, you, Catarina,
will help me fly it.

70
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,018
I'll need someplace to work.

71
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,230
A corner?
One workbench?

72
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,773
That will be fine.

73
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,399
( laughing )
Ten scudi a week,

74
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,152
and you provide
your own materials.

75
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,653
Seven...

76
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,239
and I might need to borrow
a few things on occasion.

77
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,032
Then we have an agreement.
( com-link beeps )

78

CHAKOTAY:
<i>Chakotay to Janeway.</i>

79
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,743
Go ahead.

80
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,245
<i>Captain, we need you</i>

81
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,913
<i>There's something here</i>

82
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,498
On my way.

83
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,959
Computer, end program.

84
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,920
What have you got?

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,421
CHAKOTAY:
Some bad news.

86
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,299
The long-range probe
we sent out two months ago

87
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,883
has stopped transmitting.

88
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,927
I thought it was a problem with
the communications grid,

89
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,971
then I cleared up the last few
seconds of telemetry.

90
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,098
Take a look at this.
( console beeping )

91
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,149
This could be it,
Captain.

92
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,944
Borg space.

93
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,905
We don't know exactly
how many vessels are out there,

94
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,325
but their space
appears to be vast.

95
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,161
It includes thousands
of solar systems--

96
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,787
all Borg.

97
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,665
We are, no doubt, entering
the heart of their territory.

98
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,458
There's no going around it.

99
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,253
But there may be a way
through it.

100
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,050
Before the probe was disabled,

101
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,094
it picked up
a narrow corridor of space

102
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,888
devoid of Borg activity.

103
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,182
We've nicknamed it
"The Northwest Passage."

104
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,809
Unfortunately,
the passage is filled with

105
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,728
intense
gravimetric distortions

106
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,022
probably caused by a string
of quantum singularities.

107
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,816
Better to ride the rapids
than face the hive.

108
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,609
Exactly. We're going
to set a course

109
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,571
for that corridor
and go into full tactical alert.

110
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,073
Where do we stand with weapons?

111
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,824
I have reprogrammed
the phaser banks

112
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,243
to a rotating modulation,

113
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,870
but I suspect the Borg
will adapt quickly.

114
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,830
We can use every edge.
Ensign?

115
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,790
I've already configured
the long-range sensors

116
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,625
to scan for transwarp
signatures--

117
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,086
an early-warning
system.

118
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,587
Good work.

119
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,463
Doctor, how are you coming
on the medical front?

120
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,216
I've analyzed every
square millimeter

121
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,634
of the Borg corpse
we recovered three months ago.

122
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,095
I'm closer to understanding

123
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,305
how their assimilation
technology works,

124
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,681
and I might
be able to create

125
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,058
some sort of medical defense.

126
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,268
Redouble your efforts.

127
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,852
This is your top priority.

128
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,356
Neelix, I doubt we can
resupply the ship any time soon.

129
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,607
No problem, sir.

130
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,234
I'm working on a plan
to extend our food

131
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,568
and replicator rations.

132
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,362
We have to act fast.

133
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,116
The Borg have captured
one of our probes.

134
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,367
They know we're out here.

135
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,744
We'll do everything
in our power

136
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,913
to avoid a direct
confrontation,

137
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,040
but, if and when
we do engage the Borg,

138
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,001
I'm confident
that we'll be ready.

139
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,838
I have faith in each
and every one of you.

140
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,384
Let's do it.

141
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,386
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

142
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,554
( people chattering orders
indistinctly )

143
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,647
Coming through.

144
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,565
Open!

145
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,781
I want to cut down the time
it takes to seal off the decks.

146
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,532
In case we take on
some uninvited guests.

147
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,034
Exactly. And I want

148
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,036
to increase the magnitude
of the force fields.

149
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,040
These injection tubules
are the first step

150
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,834
in the Borg
assimilation process.

151
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,085
Once inside the skin,

152
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,338
they release
a series of nanoprobes

153
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,713
into the bloodstream.

154
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,257
Maybe we can
develop some type of

155
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,217
protective shielding
against them.

156
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,593
Unlikely.

157
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,553
The tubules are capable
of penetrating

158
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,056
any known alloy
or energy field...

159
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,642
which means our battle
must be waged

160
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,019
inside the body itself.

161
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,024
The first tissue to be
attacked by the nanoprobes

162
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,359
is the victim's blood.

163
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,068
Assimilation
is almost instantaneous.

164
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,154
They take over
the blood cell functions,

165
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,364
like a virus.

166
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,199
Which suggests to me
that we should try

167
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,741
to enhance
the immune system.

168
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,370
Create an "assimilation
antibody," as it were.

169
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,831
I doubt we can actually
destroy the nanoprobes,

170
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,792
but we might be able
to slow them down.

171
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,212
( PADD beeps )
Let's try a submicron

172

dissection on the probes
we've collected so far,

173
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,384
see if we can discover
the assimilation mechanism.

Kes, is
something wrong?

177
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,522
Kes.

178
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,065
I saw Borg.

179
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,236
You've had a
telepathic experience?

180
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,904
There were bodies...

00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,240
dozens of them dead.

182
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,545
How's Kes?
Unsettled and uncertain.

183
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,962
Over the past two hours,

184
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,465
she has experienced
several telepathic visions

185
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,801
about the death of Borg
and the destruction of<i> Voyager.</i>

186
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,345
Some sort of premonitions?

187
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,555
Possibly.

188
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,765
We can't just ignore
her intuition,

189
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,184
but I see no reason
to alter our plan.

190
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,727
Tuvok, I want you
to keep an eye on her--

191
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,937
Captain...

192
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,355
long-range sensors
are picking up

193
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,898
transwarp signatures...

194
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,733
5.8 light-years
distant...

195
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,277
closing from behind.

196
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,445
Red Alert.

197
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,363
JANEWAY:
Evasive maneuvers.

198
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,324
( rumbling )

199
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,327
What's happening?
We've dropped out of warp.

200
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,371
Bridge to Engineering.
What's going on down there?

201
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,039
TORRES:
I'm not sure, Captain.

202
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,999
Some kind of subspace turbulence
is preventing us

203
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,043
from creating
a stable warp field.

204
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,711
Turbulence is increasing.

205
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,965
I'm reading two Borg vessels.
Make that three.

206
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,967
Four.

207
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,136
No, five.

208
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,889
Fifteen Borg vessels.

209
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,601
Distance--
2.1 light-years and closing.

210
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,186
Shields to maximum.
Stand by all weapons.

211
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,563
They're in visual range.

212
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,897
JANEWAY:
On screen.

213
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,024
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

214
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,694
My God.

215
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,206
Captain...

216
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,544
KIM:
I'm picking up
a polaron beam.

217
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,505
We're being scanned.

218
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,219
Think good thoughts.

219
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,683
The last cube
has rejoined the others.

220
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,902
Did we sustain any damage?

221
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,030
KIM:
No. Shields held.

222
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,948
Warp engines are
coming back on line.

223
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,201
All primary systems
are stable.

224
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,743
Stand down Red Alert.

225
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,247
Harry...maintain
a long-range sensor lock

226
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,706
on that Borg armada.

227
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,708
They seemed to be in quite
a hurry, didn't they?

228
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,461
I'd like to know
what they're up to.

229
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,046
KIM:
Yes, ma'am.

230
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,382
JANEWAY:
I'll take this near-miss
as a good omen.

231
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,842
Resume our course,
Mr. Paris.

232
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,594
If we needed
any more evidence

233
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,928
that we've entered
Borg space,

234
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,222
I think we just got it.

235
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,307
I'll be in my ready room.

236
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,113
( door chimes )

237
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,615
Yes. Come in.

238
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,453
We've just completed
the latest sensor sweep.

239
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,664
So far, so good.
The Northwest Passage

240
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,290
is still clear
of Borg activity.

241
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,418
I'd like to see
a tactical update.

242
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,380
According to
my calculations,

243
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,756
neither of us has eaten
since last night.

244
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,009
Join me for dinner?

245
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,428
No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

246
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,346
I've got a lot of work to do.

247
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,763
I see.

248
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,559
I've been looking through
the personal log entries

249
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,103
of all the Starfleet Captains
who encountered the Borg.

250
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,063
I've gone over every engagement,

251
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,941
from the moment
Q flung the<i> Enterprise</i>

252
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,277
into the path of that first cube

253
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,696
to the massacre at Wolf 359.

254
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,364
Every battle,
every skirmish,

255
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,823
anything that might
give me an insight

256
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,868
into the mind of the Collective.
And?

257
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,037
In the words
of Jean-Luc Picard...

258
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,332
"In their Collective state,

259
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,793
"the Borg are utterly
without mercy,

260
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:18,548
"driven by one will alone--
the will to conquer.

261
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:23,261
They are beyond redemption,
beyond reason."

262
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,764
And then there's Captain Amasov
of the<i> Endeavor.</i>

263
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,561
"It is my opinion that the Borg
are as close to pure evil

264
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,938
as any race we've ever
encountered..."
( chuckles )

265
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,356
What's so funny?

266
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,275
Uh, nothing.
You're smiling.

267
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,110
Obviously, I've said
something amusing.

268
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,071
You sounded
just like Amasov.

269
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,364
What?

270
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,949
Just now, while you
were reading his log,

271
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,576
you were using
his inflections.

272
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,453
I did not.
Yes, you were.

273
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,747
And before that, you were
doing a pretty good Picard.

274
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,165
Was I?

275
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,375
It's nothing to be
ashamed about,

276
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,419
echoing the greats.

277
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,212
Ensign Hickman
in Astrophysics

278
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,631
does a passable Janeway.

279
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,510
If we manage to survive
the next few days,

280
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,553
I'm going to have a little
chat with Ensign Hickman.

281
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,555
Imitating the Captain, huh?

282
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,100
Surely that violates some kind
of Starfleet protocol.

283
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,483
This day was inevitable.

284
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,653
We all knew it,
and we've all tried

285
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:25,114
to prepare ourselves
for the challenge ahead.

286
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,203
But at what point
is the risk too great?

287
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,373
At what point do we come about

288
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,500
and retreat to
friendly territory?

289
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,669
Could the crew
accept living out

290
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,171
the rest of their lives
in the Delta Quadrant?

291
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,715
I keep looking
to all these Captains,

292
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,133
my comrades in arms.

293
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,386
But the truth is...

294
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,137
I'm alone.

295
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,682
If that moment comes...

296
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,350
we'll face it together,

297
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,935
and we'll make
the right decision.

298
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,522
You're not alone,
Kathryn.

299
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,149
Hm.

300
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,611
Three years ago,
I didn't even know your name.

301
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,905
Today, I can't imagine
a day without you.

302
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,156

303
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,825

<i>Captain Janeway to the Bridge.</i>

304
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,499
JANEWAY:
Gentlemen?

305
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,334
Something strange
is going on.

306
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,837
The power signatures of those
Borg vessels have terminated.

307
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,129
All of them?

308
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,339
They're dead
in the water,

309
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,341
about 5.2 light-years
from here.

310
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,843
Cause.
Unknown.

311
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,179
Mr. Paris...

312
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,724
Captain?

313
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:36,310
Set a course
for their position, warp 2.

314
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,483
We're approaching
the ships.

315
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,902
Slow to impulse.

316
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,152
On screen.

317
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,362

00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,531
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

319
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,579
Life signs.

320
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,373
A few,
but they're erratic.

321
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,083
TUVOK:
Captain,

322
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,754
I'm detecting two residual
weapon signatures in the debris.

323
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,840
One is Borg.

324
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,051
The other is of unknown origin.

325
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,720
Who could do this to the Borg?

326
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,849
(<i> dramatic theme continues</i> )

327
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,274
Someone more powerful
than the Borg?

328
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,400
It's hard to imagine.

329
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,860
KIM:
But they did it--

330
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,987
Fifteen cubes.

331
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,030
We might have just
found our ticket

332
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,658
through Borg space--
An ally.

333
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,910
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

334
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,872
Scan the vicinity
for other vessels.

335
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,123
There are none.

336
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,500
Hold on.

337
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,543
I'm picking up some
sort of bio-readings.

338
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,920
They're coming
from the outer hull

339
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,130
of one of the Borg ships.
Let's see it.

340
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,260
Magnify, Mr. Kim.

341
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,430
KIM:
It's definitely organic,

342
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,390
but our sensors can't
penetrate its surface.

343
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,017
Send a standard
greeting.

344
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,645
No response.

345
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,772
This could be
a space-dwelling organism

346
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,440
or a biological weapon.

347
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,067
I'd like to know what kind of
weapon could destroy the Borg.

348
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,945
Can we beam it
away from the ship?

349
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,738
I can't get
a lock on it.

350
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,072
Tractor beam?

351
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,534
No effect.

352
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,870
KIM:
Whatever that thing is,

353
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,038
it's impervious
to our technology.

354
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,957
Tuvok...

355
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,377
are you reading an atmosphere
in the cube?

356
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,920
TUVOK:
Affirmative.

357
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,588
Commander Chakotay.

358
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,593
I want you to take
an away team inside.

359
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,596
Try to get a short-range scan
of the bio-mass.

360
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,349
There are still Borg life signs,
but they're unstable.

361
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,019
We'll keep an open com-link
and an active transporter lock,

362
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,605
and we'll pull you out of there
at the first sign of trouble.

363
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,776
Tuvok, Harry,
you're with me.

364
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,906

366
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,517
This way.

367
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,066
( electrical static,
deep booming )

368
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,734
( instrument whirring )

369
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,952
TUVOK:
Lower your phasers.

370
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,495
If we don't appear threatening,
they should ignore us.

371
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,582
Looks like they're
a little preoccupied.

372
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,548
( loud, erratic whirring )

373
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,514
( beeping )

374
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,651

375
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,277
( beeping continues )

376
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,907
The alien bio-readings
are getting stronger.

377
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,366
We're close.

378
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,463
Commander?

379
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,595
TUVOK:
Curious.

380
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,764
That's not the word
I had in mind.

381
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,223
Those bodies
are reminiscent

382
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,476
of one of the premonitions
Kes described.

383
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,562
Didn't Kes say we were
all going to die?

384
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,274
Let's keep moving.

385
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,443

( electricity pops )

( beeping continues )

389
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,975
CHAKOTAY:
It looks like the bio-mass

390
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,768
dissolved right
through the Borg hull.

391
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,187
TUVOK:
This Borg

392
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,480
is attempting
to assimilate it.

393
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,274
Doesn't look like
he's having much luck.

394
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,323
There's a chamber
beyond this opening,

395
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,700
40 meters wide,

396
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,036
high concentrations
of antimatter particles.

397
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,414
It looks like a warp propulsion
system of some kind.

398
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,707
It's a ship?

399
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,500
Starfleet has
encountered species

400
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,252
that use
organic-based vessels--

401
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,545
The Breen, for example.

402
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,216
There doesn't seem to be
anybody inside.

403
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,383
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

404
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,552
JANEWAY:
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

405
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,931
Captain, we've found
an entrance to the bio-mass.

406
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,100
We think it might be
a ship of some kind.

407
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,392
Permission to go inside.

408
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,810
JANEWAY:
<i>Granted.</i>

409
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,980
Harry, that's a Borg
distribution node.

410
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,523
See if you can download

411
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,942
their tactical database.

412
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,860
It might contain a record
of what happened here.

413
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,987
Aye, sir.
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok.

414
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,744
( beeping )

415
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,829
( ominous theme continues )

416
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,023
CHAKOTAY:
They seem to be
organic conduits.

417
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,858
They're carrying
electrodynamic fluid.

418
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,693
TUVOK:
It may be an energy source.

419
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,154
Maybe.

420
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,658
This looks like
a binary matrix,

421
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,827
but it's laced
with neuropeptides.

422
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,037
Could be their version
of a computer core.

423
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,123
( beeping )

424
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,544

( clanging echoes )

427
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,453
This damage was caused
by a Borg disruptor beam.

428
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,580
The wall appears
to be regenerating itself.

429
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,260
Commander.

430

435
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,875
Harry's in danger.
What do you see?

436
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,793
Get them out of there!
Sick Bay to Janeway.

437
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,379
KIM:
Commander!

438
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,593
There's something
in here with us

439
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,511
and it's not the Borg.

440
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,265
I can't localize it,
but it's within 20 meters.

441
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,807
Perhaps the pilot
has returned.

442

( beeping )

447
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,611
I can't get a lock on them.
What's the problem?

448
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,280
It looks like
bio-electric interference

449
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,572
from whatever's
coming toward them.

450
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,241
(<i> beeping</i> )

451
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:13,202
It's within seven meters.

(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

453
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,165
Narrow the confinement beam.

454
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,209
No effect.

455
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,669
I'm going to try
a skeletal lock.

456
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,796
A what?

457
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,298
I think I can get
a clean lock

458
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,216
on the minerals
in their bone tissue.

459
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,802
I just came up with it,
but I think it might work.

460
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,929
(<i> suspenseful theme continues</i> )

461
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,402
The life-form's five meters away
and closing.

462
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,486
From where?

463
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:52,490
( snarling )

464
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,413
( screaming )

465
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,084
I've got them.

466
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,877
A skeletal lock, huh?

467
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,255
We'll have to add that one
to the transporter manual.

( beeping )
Captain.

469
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,718
The bioship is powering up--
Like it's charging

470
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,179
some kind of weapon.

471
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,597

472
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,975
Mr. Paris, get
us out of here--

475
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,714

JANEWAY:
Kes?

477
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,595
I could hear
its thoughts.

478
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,056
The pilot of the bioship

479
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,891
was trying
to communicate with me.

480
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,602
They're a telepathic species.

481
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,022
I've been aware of them
for some time now,

482
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,108
the premonitions.
Captain, it's not the Borg

483
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,152
that we should be
worried about. It's them.

484
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,945
What did it say to you?

485
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,073
It said...

486
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,702
"The weak...

487
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,496

The infection is

What began with
a few stray cells

500
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,832
contaminating
the chest wound

501
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,335
is now infusing
every system in his body.

502
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,422
It looks like he's being
transformed in some way.

503
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,923
Not exactly.

504
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,551
The alien cells
are consuming his body

505
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,885
from the inside out.

506
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,554
In essence...

507
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,599
Mr. Kim is being
eaten alive.

508
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,934
He's still conscious,
Doctor?

509
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,352
I tried giving him
a sedative,

510
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,937
but it was rejected
immediately.

511
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,022
In fact, every treatment
I've tried

512
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,233
has been neutralized
within seconds.

513
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,029
( computer beeping )

514
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,782
These are alien cells.

515
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,328
Each one contains
more than a hundred times

516
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,954
the DNA of a human cell.

517
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:47,249
It's the most densely coded
life-form I've ever seen.

518
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,585
Even I would need years
to decipher it.

519
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:53,213
They have an extraordinary
immune response.

520
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,842
Anything that penetrates
the cell membrane...

521
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,052
chemical...biological...

522
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,846

523
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,142
it's all instantly
destroyed.

524
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,645
That's why the Borg
can't assimilate them.

525
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:11,440
Resistance in this case
is far from futile.

526
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,734
Nevertheless,
I believe Borg technology

527
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,029
holds the key
to saving Mr. Kim.

528
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,322
How so?

529
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,782
I hope to unleash
an army of modified

530
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,909
Borg nanoprobes
into his bloodstream,

531
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,579
designed to target
and eradicate the infection.

532
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,999
As you know, I've been
analyzing the nanoprobes.

533
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,709
They're efficient
little assimilators.

534
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,837
One can't help
but admire the workmanship.

535
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,173
But they're no match
for the alien cells.

536
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:41,011
So I successfully
dissected a nanoprobe

537
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,390
and managed to access
its recoding mechanism.

538
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,683
I reprogrammed the probe

539
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,851
to emit the same
electrochemical signatures

540
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,395
as the alien cells.

541
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,605
That way, the probe
can do its work

542
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,566
without being detected.

543
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,317
Observe.

544
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,070
The alien cells are completely
oblivious to the probe

545
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,697
until it's too late.

546
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:02,866
Unfortunately, I've only
created a few prototypes.

547
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,411
I'll need several days

548
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:06,912
to modify
enough nanoprobes

549
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,622
to cure Ensign Kim.

550
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,124
Does Harry have
several days?

551
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,001
I wish I knew.

552
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,630
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

553
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,430
Fight it, Harry.

554
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,973
That's an order.

555
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,730
We've analyzed the Borg's
tactical database.

556
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,900
They refer to these new aliens
as "Species 8472."

557
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,110
Over the past five months,

558
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,445
the Borg have been
attacked by them

559
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,987
on at least
a dozen occasions.

560
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,822
Each time, the Borg
were defeated swiftly.

561
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,576
The Collective has very little
information about the species.

562
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,911
Is anything known about
where they come from?

563
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,956
I'm afraid so.

564
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,832
(<i> console beeping</i> )

565
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,378
Get the captain.

566
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,258
JANEWAY:
The Northwest Passage.

567
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,844
It's clear of Borg activity
for a very good reason.

568
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,846
I'm detecting 133 bioships.

569
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,140
More are approaching.

570
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,725
From where?

571
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,394
They seem to be coming
from a quantum singularity.

572
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,730
TORRES:
I'm localizing the
gravimetric distortions.

573
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,356
On screen.

574
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,904
Kes?

575
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,239
Anything?

576
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,658
Yes, I can hear them.

577
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,247
They're in a place
where they're all alone.

578
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,415
Nothing else lives there.

579
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,626
Some kind of
parallel universe?

580
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,918
I don't know.

581
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,088
I feel malevolence...

582
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,299
a cold hatred.

583
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,968
The weak will perish.

584
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,180
It's an invasion.

585
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,141
They intend on
destroying everything.

586
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,352
Tom, reverse course,
maximum warp.

587
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,270
Take us five light-years out
and hold position.

588
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,522
Aye, Captain.

589
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,856
Maintain Red Alert.

590
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,941
Commander?

591
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,119
That moment we spoke about?
It's here.

592
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,747
Any thoughts?
Just one.

593
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,791
Flying into that corridor
would mean certain death.

594
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,127
Agreed. The Northwest Passage
is no longer an option.

595
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,340
So now the choice is between
facing the Borg in their space

596
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,218
or finding a nice planet
here in the Delta Quadrant

597
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,970
and giving up
on ever getting home.

598
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,306
We'd be turning around,
but we wouldn't be giving up.

599
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,100
We may find
another way home.

600
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,355
I'm not ready to
walk onto that Bridge

601
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,690
and tell the crew
we're quitting.

602
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,024
I can't do it,
Chakotay, not yet.

603
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,276
There<i> must</i> be
another alternative.

604
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,362
Kathryn....

605
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,656
you haven't slept
in two days.

606
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,826
Try getting some rest
and clearing your head.

607
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,619
We're safe for the moment.

608
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,330
We can tell the crew tomorrow
if we have to.

609
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,124
See you in
the morning.

610
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,214
( door opens, closes )

611
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,383
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

612
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,905
Maestro?

613
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,035
Leonardo.

614
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,249
Catarina...

615
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,500
<i>buona sera.</i>

616
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,168
Am I disturbing you?

617
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,421
What do you see?

618
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,507
A wall,

619
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,718
with candlelight
reflecting on it.

620
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,511
Why?

621
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,722
What do<i> you</i> see?

622
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,934
A flock of starlings...

623
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,144
the leaves on an oak...

624
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,604
a horse's tail...

625
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,774
a thief with a noose
around his neck...

626
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,360
Ah...

627
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,613
and a wall...

628
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,198
with the candlelight
reflecting on it.

629
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,245
There are times, Catarina,

630
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,080
when I find myself...

631
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,334
transfixed by a shadow
on the wall,

632
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,378
or the splashing of water
against a stone.

633
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:29,132
I stare at it,
the hours pass...

634
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,928
the world around me
drops away...

635
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:38,308
replaced by worlds
being created and destroyed

636
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,854
by my imagination...

637
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,608
a way to focus the mind.

638
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,570
Sit and tell me
why you have come.

639
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,747
There's a path before me...

640
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,542
the only way home.

641
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,961
And on either side,

642
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,297
mortal enemies
bent on destroying each other.

643
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,175
If I attempt to pass
through them,

644
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,720
I'll be destroyed as well.

645
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,304
But if I turn around,

646
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:21,059
that would end all hope
of ever getting home.

647
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,897
And no matter how much
I try to focus my mind,

648
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,524
I can't see an alternative.

649
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:34,406
When one's imagination
cannot provide an answer,

650
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:38,368
one must seek out
a greater imagination.

651
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:42,414
There are times
when even I find myself

652
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,541
kneeling in prayer.

653
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:49,629
I must deliver a bronzetto
to the monks at Santa Croce.

654
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,967
Come with me, Catarina, eh?

655
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:57,262
We will awake the abbot,
visit the chapel,

656
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,305
and appeal to God.

657
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,809
Somehow I don't think
that's going to work for me.

658
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,646
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

659
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:15,363
But there is an alternative
I hadn't considered.

660
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:21,078
What if I made an appeal...

661
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,372
...to the devil?

662
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,670
An alliance with the Borg?

663
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,339
More like...
an exchange.

664
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,718
We offer them a way
to defeat their new enemy,

665
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,055
and, in return,
we get safe passage

666
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,306
through their space.

667
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,266
In developing
a treatment for Harry,

668
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,644
the Doctor has found a way
to attack the aliens

669
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,104
at a microscopic level.

670
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,272
It's still in the experimental
stages, Captain.

671
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,941
I've only made
a few prototypes.

672
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,358
Nevertheless,
if we teach the Borg

673
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,027
how to modify
their own nanoprobes,

674
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,445
they'd have a blueprint

675
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,447
to create a weapon
to fight the aliens.

676
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,365
In theory, yes.

677
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,577
B'Elanna, it's clear
from the Borg database

678
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,247
that they know practically
nothing about Species 8472.

679
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,583
That's right. The Borg gain
knowledge through assimilation.

680
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,794
What they can't assimilate,
they can't understand.

681
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,462
But we don't assimilate.

682
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:16,549
We investigate, and in this
case, that's given us an edge.

683
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,761
We've discovered something
they need.

684
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,097
But the Borg aren't
exactly known

685
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,849
for their diplomacy.

686
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,892
How can we expect them
to cooperate with us?

687
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,310
Normally, the answer
would be no,

688
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,270
but if what I've learned
from the aliens is true,

689
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,523
the Borg are losing
this conflict.

690
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,441
In one regard,
the Borg are no different

691
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,695
than we are.
They're trying to survive.

692
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,280
I don't believe they're
going to refuse an offer

693
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,740
that will help them
do that.

694
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,659
What makes you think the Borg
won't attempt to

695
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,994
take the information

696
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,079
by assimilating<i> Voyager</i>
and its crew?

697
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,123
Because that won't
get them anywhere.

698
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:51,126
Doctor, you're
the only one on board

699
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,419
with full knowledge
of the nanoprobe modifications.

700
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,547
I want you to transfer
all of that research

701
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,841
into your holo-matrix.
Certainly.

702
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,843
You're my guarantee.

703
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,220
If the Borg threaten us
in any way,

704
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,430
we'll simply
erase your program.

705
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,183
But it won't
come to that, Doctor.

706
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,435
It's in the Collective's
own interest to cooperate.

707
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,898
<i>Voyager</i> is only one ship.

708
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,483
Our safe passage
is a small price to pay

709
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,944
for what we're offering
in exchange.

710
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,157
B'Elanna, assist the Doctor
with his transfer.

711
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,409
B'ELANNA: Aye, Captain.
Mr. Paris--

712
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,204
locate the nearest Borg vessel

713
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,039
and lay in a course.

714
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,790
They shouldn't
be difficult to find.

715
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,542
Yes, ma'am.

716
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,336
Dismissed.

717
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,346
You were awfully quiet.

718
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,515
I didn't want the
others to hear this,

719
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,227
but I think what you're
proposing is too great a risk.

720
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,520
How so?

721
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,607
There's a story I heard
as a child, a parable,

722
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,650
and I never forgot it.

723
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,113
A scorpion was walking along
the bank of a river

724
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,823
wondering how to get
to the other side.

725
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,409
Suddenly, he saw a fox.

726
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,413
He asked the fox to take him
on his back across the river.

727
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:15,334
The fox said, "No,
if I do that, you'll sting me,

728
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,630
and I'll drown."

729
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,590
The scorpion assured him,

730
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,718
"If I did that,
we'd both drown."

731
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,973
So the fox thought about it
and finally agreed.

732
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,268
So the scorpion
climbed up on his back,

733
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,561
and the fox began to swim.

734
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,106
But halfway across the river,

735
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:39,317
the scorpion stung him.

736
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,278
As the poison filled his veins,

737
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,906
the fox turned to the scorpion
and said, "Why did you do that?

738
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,366
Now, you'll drown too."

739
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,120
"I couldn't help it,"
said the scorpion.

740
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,789
"It's my nature."

741
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,295
I understand the risk...

742
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,630
...and I'm not proposing

743
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,507
that we try to change
the nature of the beast,

744
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,425
but this is a unique situation.

745
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,220
To our knowledge, the Borg
have never been so threatened.

746
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,513
They're vulnerable.

747
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,223
I think we can take
advantage of that.

748
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,725
Even if we do somehow
negotiate an exchange,

749
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,936
how long will they keep up
their end of the bargain?

750
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,480
It could take months
to get across Borg territory.

751
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,233
We'd be facing
thousands of systems,

752
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,110
millions of vessels.

753
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,988
But only one Collective, and
we've got them over a barrel.

754
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,199
We don't need to give them
a single bit of information,

755
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,783
not until we're safe.

756
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,619
We just need the courage
to see this through to the end.

757
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,038
There are other kinds
of courage,

758
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,789
like the courage to accept

759
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,833
that there are some situations
beyond your control.

760
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,545
Not every problem
has an immediate solution.

761
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,880
You're suggesting
we turn around.

762
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,299
Yes. We should
get out of harm's way.

763
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,009
Let them fight it out.

764
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,677
In the meantime, there's still
plenty of Delta Quadrant

765
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,180
left to explore.
We may find another way home.

766
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,307
Or we might find
something else.

767
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,267
Six months,
a year down the road.

768
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,145
After Species 8472
gets through with the Borg,

769
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,147
we could find ourselves
right back in the line of fire,

770
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,066
and we'll have missed
the window of opportunity

771
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,360
that exists right here,
right now.

772
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,444
How much is our safety worth?

773
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,779
What do you mean?

774
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,198
We'd be giving an advantage

775
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,449
to a race
guilty of murdering billions.

776
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,703
We'd be helping the Borg
assimilate yet another species,

777
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,206
just to get ourselves
back home-- It's wrong!

778
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,540
Tell that to Harry Kim.

779
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,834
He's barely alive,
thanks to that species.

780
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,670
Maybe helping to assimilate them
isn't such a bad idea.

781
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,589
We could be doing
the Delta Quadrant a favor.

782
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,133
I don't think
you really believe that.

783
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,635
I think you're struggling
to justify your plan

784
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,637
because your desire
to get this crew home

785
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,639
is blinding you
to other options.

786
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,558
I know you, Kathryn.

787
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,019
Sometimes...

788
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,480
...you don't know
when to step back.

789
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,359
Do you trust me, Chakotay?

790
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,569
That isn't the issue.
Oh, but it is.

791
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,406
Only yesterday, you were saying
that we'd face this together,

792
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,698
that you'd be at my side.

793
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,491
I still have to tell you
what I believe.

794
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,286
I'm no good to you
if I don't do that.

795
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,580
I appreciate your insights,
but the time for debate is over.

796
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,416
I've made my decision.

797
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:03,002
Now, do I have your support?

798
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,713
You're the Captain.

799
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,299
I'm the First Officer,

800
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,967
I'll follow your orders.

801
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,969
But that doesn't change
my belief

802
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,221
that we're making
a fatal mistake.

803
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,184
Then I guess I am alone
after all.
