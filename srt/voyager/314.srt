00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,340
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 50460.3.</i>

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,801
<i>We've been investigating</i>
<i>an "inversion nebula"</i>

3
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,594
<i>for several days.</i>

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,138
<i>This phenomenon has never been</i>
<i>seen in the Alpha Quadrant</i>

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,809
<i>and is proving something</i>
<i>of a mystery to us here.</i>

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,812
According to
Federation astro-theorists,

7
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:22,021
inversion nebulae
are so unstable,

8
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,942
they're supposed to burn out
within a few years, but...

9
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,862
this one appears
to be centuries old.

10
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,864
Maybe the theorists
were wrong.

11
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,741
They never had a chance
to look at the real thing.

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,242
Not entirely wrong.

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,953
These plasma strands
we're approaching

14
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,204
look ready to ignite.

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,622
Tom, back us off
2,000 kilometers.

16
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,957
That will give us
a safety margin.

17
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,500
Aye, captain.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,502
Harry, set the sensors
for full-spectrum scans,

19
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,212
continuous sweep.

20
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,924
If that nebula does flare up,
I don't want to miss a beat.

21
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,552
Mr. Kim, I need your attention
on the sensors.

22
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,845
Sorry, captain.

23
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,180
Full-spectrum scans.
I'm on it.

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,183
Astro-theory never predicted
this would be so lovely.

25
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:03,146
Beauty and mystery--
a tantalizing combination.

26
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,608
No argument here.
Right, Tuvok?

27
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,528
I am fully capable
of appreciating this phenomenon

28
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,530
without the extraneous
sentimentality

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,407
humans find so necessary.

30
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,826
Being moved by an emotion
isn't always extraneous.

31
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,619
Sometimes it's the whole point.

32
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,314
(<i> door chimes</i> )

33
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,900
Enter.

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,361
Mr. Kim.

35
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,614
Can I help you?

36
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,991
Um...

37
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,994
that's<i> kal-toh,</i> isn't it?
Vulcan chess?

38
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,038
<i>Kal-toh</i> is to chess

39
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,833
as chess is
to tic-tac-toe.

40
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,461
I should have known. Uh...

41
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,546
What is on your
mind, ensign?

42
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,217
Tuvok, I need your help.

43
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,638
I want to eliminate emotions
like Vulcans do.

44
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,640
Mr. Kim, it is a
lifelong process.

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,350
I realize that,
and I also know

46
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,896
that Vulcans use
certain techniques.

47
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,856
The<i> t'an s'at,</i>

48
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,357
the intellectual
deconstruction

49
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,110
of emotional patterns.

50
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,074
I'm willing to learn.

51
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,367
May I ask why?

52
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,288
I have...

53
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,249
feelings
I don't want to have.

54
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,252
That would seem
to be self-evident.

55
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,922
And what is the nature
of those feelings?

56
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,009
I... I'm in love

57
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,011
and I don't want to be.

58
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,554
I see.

59
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,432
And who is the object
of your affections?

60
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,521
Her name is... Marayna.

61
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,274
I am not aware of anyone
on the ship with that name.

62
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,234
She's not a member of the crew.

63
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,656
She's a character
on the holodeck.

64
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,285
You're in love
with a computer subroutine?

65
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,081
That's the problem.

66
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,679
Interesting.

67
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,756
To see through an
emotional complex

68
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,340
is to rob it
of its power.

69
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,302
The first step is to
identify the complex

70
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,678
in which you
have been caught.

71
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,263
I told you, I'm in love.

72
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,098
There are many different
kinds of love, ensign.

73
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,724
You must learn
to differentiate.

74
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,102
For example, you told me
that you met this individual

75
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,396
only days ago, yet
you feel overwhelmed.

76
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,649
I can't get her out of my mind,
not for a second.

77
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,942
Have you been
able to sleep?

78
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,610
No.
Have you eaten?

79
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,987
No.

80
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,072
Does your daily routine
seem somehow empty?

81
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,700
Perhaps even ludicrous?
Yes!

82
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,077
You are experiencing
<i>shon-ha'lock.</i>

83
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,412
The engulfment.
It is the most intense

84
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,832
and psychologically
perilous form of Eros.

85
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,251
I believe humans call it
"love at first sight."

86
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,920
But... we're talking
about a holodeck character.

87
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,547
Irrelevant.
The emotional complex

88
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,341
in which you are
trapped is the same

89
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,552
and so is the cure.
Logical deconstruction

90
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,681
followed by a regimen
of meditative suppression

91
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,641
as I shall demonstrate.

92
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,608
Uh, a little further
to the left.

93
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,112
No. That's too much.

94
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,780
KIM:
Neelix.

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,285
Have you seen Marayna?

96
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,120
Oh... perfect!

97
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,412
Welcome, gentlemen.

98
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,789
Just getting
things ready

99
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,833
for tonight's
little get-together.

100
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,835
I completely forgot,
the luau.

101
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,004
Polynesian-style.
I've done my research.

102
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,174
Uh, Lieutenant Tuvok,
you neglected to R.S.V.P.

103
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,634
That was not an oversight,
I assure you.

104
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,969
Where is Marayna?

105
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,221
Who?

106
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,764
She's part of
this program.

107
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,557
Doesn't ring a bell.

108
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,144
How could you miss her?
She's tall, athletic, blond.

109
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,479
Oh, one of the
entertainment directors.

110
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,316
I believe she's giving Kes
a hydro-sail lesson.

111
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,319
Uh, no, no, not there.

112
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,281
There.

113
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,617
Harry. Tuvok.
The lake is perfect today.

114
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,493
Hello, Harry.
Hi, Marayna.

115
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,913
We were just talking about you.
You were?

116
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,207
Marayna said what
an excellent student you were.

117
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,251
She's a great instructor.

118
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,461
Ready to get
your ears wet?

119
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,005
Vulcans do not hydro-sail.

120
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,424
Oh, why not?

121
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,092
Lieutenant Tuvok
prefers the solitude

122
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,261
of his own quarters
and a game of<i> kal-toh.</i>

123
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,388
I'm sure we can do
better than that.

124
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,307
I'm going back
on duty. Thanks.

125
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,100
You're welcome.

126
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,061
There's a volleyball game
starting down on the sand.

127
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,314
Mr. Kim and I
would prefer some conversation.

128
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,190
Would you care to join us?

129
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,900
All right.

130
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,447
I tried a reverse
curl this morning.

131
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,073
I think
I pulled a tendon.

132
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,908
Feel that.

133
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,828
It's like a knot.

134
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,621
I'm sure it is.

135
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,961
Are you two friends?

136
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,545
Yes.
No.

137
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,547
We're colleagues.

138
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,091
I respect Mr. Kim

139
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,135
for his intelligence
and his integrity

140
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,846
and I assume he holds me
in the same regard.

141
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,516
So Vulcans don't hydro-sail,
and they don't have friends?

142
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,644
We have fellowships
and associations,

143
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,646
but without
the emotional dimension

144
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,064
humans experience.

145
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,151
Hmm. You and I are friends,
aren't we?

146
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,112
Um... y-yeah.

147
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,489
Good.

148
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,449
<i>Chakotay to Tuvok and Kim.</i>

149
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,867
<i>Report to the bridge.</i>

150
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,077
Acknowledged.
We're on our way.

151
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,620
There's a luau tonight.

152
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,873
You're coming, aren't you?
Both of you?

153
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,334
No.
Yes.

154
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,378
You've got to stop doing that.

155
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,296
Ensign.

156
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,511
As I predicted,

157
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,430
your responses were as formulaic
as a mathematical equation.

158
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,639
What do you mean?

159
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,392
Consider the expression
on your face

160
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,102
when Neelix did not recall
Marayna--annoyance.

161
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,397
That's not true.
It is quite true.

162
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,148
At that moment,
Neelix was functioning

163
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,108
in Vulcan terms,
as the<i> soo-lak--</i>

164
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,403
The third party, who by
his very lack of interest

165
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,279
trivializes your own.

166
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,822
I guess it did bother me.

167
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,408
And the arrival of Kes
with Marayna

168
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,617
then precipitated
in you the<i> k'oh-nar--</i>

169
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,703
The feeling of being
completely exposed.

170
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,038
I was embarrassed.

171
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,748
I was sure Kes
would take one look at my face

172
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,458
and know exactly what
I was feeling.

173
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,877
And when Marayna placed your
hand on her stressed tendon...

174
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,004
Let's not even talk
about that.

175
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,548
Bridge.

176
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,550
It's all so...
predictable.

177
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,926
That's just what
I've been trying

178
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,302
to get you to perceive.

179
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,845
To the trained
Vulcan intellect

180
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,680
intense romantic love
is nothing more

181
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,100
than a set of
stereotypical behaviors.

182
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,642
Not having our discipline,

183
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,020
typically, humans are
swept along by the process

184
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,522
until it ends.

185
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,065
How does it end?

186
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,234
Either in conversion
to a more balanced

187
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,278
stable relationship

188
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,280
or in tragic circumstances.

189
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,490
I can't have a balanced,
stable relationship

190
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,824
with a holodeck character.

191
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,369
Marayna's a computer program.

192
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,288
She could never feel for me
what I feel for her.

193
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,457
Exactly. Logic dictates

194
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:27,544
a single course
of action-- retreat.

195
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,301
To tell you the truth...

196
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,220
I don't even like
hydro-sailing.

197
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,059
The temperature's
5,000 degrees kelvin

198
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,228
and rising.
Captain?

199
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,980
We've located
a plasma strand

200
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,815
that looks like
it's seconds from igniting.

201
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,525
There is some kind of
unknown process

202
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,527
that's been keeping
this nebula

203
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,779
from going up like a torch.
We're going to see it in action.

204
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,072
And if there isn't?

205
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,991
I've got my hand
on the controls.

206
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,660
We'll be out of here before it
even touches our shields.

207
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,538
Captain, the temperature
is 9,000 degrees kelvin.

208
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm picking up
a subatomic cascade reaction.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,336
There she goes.

210
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,108
The plasma strand completely
burned itself out.

211
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,943
Without causing a chain reaction
in the nebula.

212
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,945
Harry, what put out
the flames?

213
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,823
Sensors show some kind
of dampening effect

214
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,992
between the strands,
but I can't isolate it.

215
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,787
Like a firebreak
in space.

216
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,373
If we understood
how this happened

217
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,957
we might be able
to find a new way

218
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,626
to contain
a warp core breach.

219
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,085
Or any plasma reaction.

220
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,754
It's an investigation
worth pursuing.

221
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,256
Tom, it seems safe enough.

222
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,008
Take us in for
short-range sensor scans.

223
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,386
Let's find out all we can
about this phenomenon.

224
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,845
Aye, captain.

225
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,931
I'll see all of you
at Mr. Neelix's luau.

226
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,601
I'm sure everyone
will be attending.

227
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,700
Lieutenant,
you look absolutely...

228
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,619
Tropical?
More along the lines

229
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,496
of "smashing."
Thanks.

230
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,040
Of course, nothing can quite
measure up with this shirt.

231
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,000
This is
an exact recreation

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,295
of a 1962 big daddy-o
surf special.

233
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,297
An American classic.
I'd say you put

234
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,132
just a little bit too much
thought into that.

235
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,926
Now that's where
you're wrong.

236
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,262
Let's go. I told Vorik we'd pick
him up at 1600 hours.

237
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,846
And you know
how Vulcan he gets

238
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,098
when anybody is late.

239
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,600
Vorik? I thought
we were meeting Harry.

240
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,059
Oh, he's not coming.
Why not?

241
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,978
He said he was busy.
With what?

242
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,939
I don't know.

243
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,149
Harry and I will meet
you and Vorik at the luau.

244
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,361
You're pretty confident about
your powers of persuasion.

245
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,364
Yes, I am.

246
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,949
(<i> chiming</i> )

247
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,409
Come in.

248
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,494
Surf's up, Mr. Kim.

249
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,747
Hi, Tom.

250
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,915
Harry, this is a luau.

251
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,584
You look like you're
dressed for a funeral.

252
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,753
What are you doing?
Vulcan meditation.

253
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,045
What for?

254
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,131
To suppress my emotions.

255
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,425
(<i> scoffs</i> )

256
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,638
Is something wrong?

257
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,805
Not really.

258
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,603
The... resort woman?

259
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,979
What was her name?

260
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,356
Marayna.

261
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,108
How did you know that?

262
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,277
For two days now every time
I look for you

263
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,488
it's always,
"he's in holodeck one."

264
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,323
And since you don't like
hydro-sailing

265
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,784
I figured something
was going on.

266
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,077
Am I that predictable?

267
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,370
You sound like Tuvok.

268
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,999
Tuvok? He told you
to do all this?

269
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,461
Logically, the best
course is retreat.

270
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,005
Meditation helps.
Retreat.

271
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,717
A classic case of Vulcan denial
if you ask me.

272
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,136
Come on, Harry.

273
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,722
We've all fallen
for a holodeck character.

274
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,766
It happens.
You deal with it

275
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,309
by staying with
your normal routine,

276
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,227
not by hiding out
in your quarters.

277
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,688
I'm not hiding out.

278
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,065
I'm deconstructing
the emotional complex.

279
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,320
Okay.

280
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,572
Have fun.

281
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,660
No, wait.

282
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,245
Computer, standard illumination.

283
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,583
I'm getting tired
of this anyway.

284
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,085
Computer,
one Hawaiian shirt...

285
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,380
COMPUTER:
<i>Specify parameters.</i>

286
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,632
Pineapple motif.

287
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,663
Greetings, Mr. Vulcan.
No, thank you.

288
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,541
I've done a great deal
of ethnographic research

289
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,251
on the Polynesian
cultures of earth.

290
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,336
The flowered garland--
Or lei--

291
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,590
is said to represent
the flowering of love.

292
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,550
It's a marvelous tradition,
don't you think?

293
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,885
Marvelous.

294
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,095
Oh... Oh, my.

295
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,347
Did I program
a centerpiece that big?

296
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,601
Computer, open parameter
adjustment file.

297
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,443
The life of
a recreational hologram--

298
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,363
Dining, dancing,
nonrestrictive clothing...

299
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,533
I see the allure.

300
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,535
Your turn.

301
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,999
Hmm.

302
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,169
Oh, thank you.

303
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,504
Tuvok...

304
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,465
I'm glad
to see you here.

305
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,592
I would never
disobey an order, captain,

306
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,803
no matter how burdensome.

307
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,305
There's a difference between
an order and a suggestion.

308
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,433
The evening's young,
lieutenant. Let's mingle.

309
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,269
Vulcans do not...

310
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,437
Curious.

311
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,105
CHAKOTAY:
What's that?

312
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,566
If you will excuse me.

313
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,662
A common error
among novice players.

314
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,996
By placing the<i> t'an</i>

315
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
on opposite sides
of the<i> kal-toh</i>

316
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,835
you are attempting to introduce
a spatial balance.

317
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,128
A strategy that will
most certainly fail.

318
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,172
Why?
<i>Kal-toh</i> is not

319
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,966
about striving for balance.

320
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,926
It is about finding
the seeds of order

321
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,346
even in the midst
of profound chaos.

322
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,975
May I?
Please.

323
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,943
How beautiful.

324
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,862
<i>Kal-toh</i> is not
about beauty.

325
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:13,908
I understand,
but it's still beautiful.

326
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,243
Did you learn
to play on Vulcan?

327
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,621
Yes. From the age of 5

328
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,665
I took lessons
from a master.

329
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,459
I thought you might enjoy
having an opponent.

330
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,963
Playing alone must get
a little predictable sometimes.

331
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,340
You are perceptive.

332
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,301
Yes, I am. Extremely so.

333
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,388
Aloha, miss.

334
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,723
Thank you.

335
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,307
Sir?

336
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,227
No, thank you.

337
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,730
You're the only one here
not wearing a garland.

338
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,023
Given the decor

339
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,941
it seems
somehow excessive.

340
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,985
I don't believe you.

341
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,820
I beg your pardon.

342
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,739
I think you're trying
to isolate yourself

343
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,408
and make a public protest
at the same time.

344
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,951
Explain.

345
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:00,246
You didn't want to be here
in the first place.

346
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,165
Being the only one without a lei
sets you apart

347
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,709
from the others,
allowing you

348
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,294
to symbolically maintain
your solitude.

349
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,380
And since everybody can see

350
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,007
that you're
the only one without a lei,

351
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,299
you're letting them know

352
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,844
that you'd rather
be somewhere else.

353
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,685
Your logic is impeccable.

354
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,572
Thanks.

355
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,160
Mmm.

356
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,080
Thanks.
I am starving.

357
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,582
Oh, me too.
Let's find us a spot.

358
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,751
This place
is filling up fast.

359
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,878
I have already
taken the liberty

360
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,589
of reserving a table,
lieutenant,

361
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,467
with a view
of the lakeside.

362
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,302
You did express
a fondness

363
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,678
for that
particular vista.

364
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,346
I did?

365
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,058
Five days ago in a conversation
we had in engineering

366
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:06,145
regarding
holodeck programs.

367
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,148
I guess maybe I did.

368
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,777
Good memory.
Of course.

369
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,657
Well then, ensign...

370
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,158
let's go.

371
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,886
Harry.

372
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,513
What?

373
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,599
Do you want to get
something to eat, or not?

374
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,351
I... I don't know.

375
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,937
Maybe this
isn't a good idea.

376
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,523
Listen, I'm going
back to my quarters.

377
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,775
Harry...
Tom...

378
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,698
Okay.

379
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,951
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

380
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,589
I like the excitement
of the water.

381
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,176
The danger...

382
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,594
being tossed around...

383
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,556
by the wind and the waves.

384
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,808
But at the same time

385
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,977
feeling like
I'm in control.

386
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,604
The illusion of control.

387
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,565
That's exactly right.

388
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,316
Because no one
can control

389
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,903
the wind or the waves.

390
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,320
But for a few moments

391
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,033
when you're on the water

392
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,578
and the ride is perfect,

393
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,581
the feeling is that you can.

394
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,332
Do you ever feel that?

395
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,543
No.

396
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,712
Never?

397
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,881
Don't you have
an imagination?

398
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,633
If, by imagination
you mean the ability

399
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,428
to spontaneously
generate images within my mind,

400
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,431
then, yes, I have
a highly developed imagination,

401
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,933
as do all of my race.

402
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,560
All right,
imagine this--

403
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,689
that you, with your logic
and your reason

404
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:18,736
are skimming atop
endless waves of emotion.

405
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,613
You believe
you're in control,

406
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,242
but you know the control
is an illusion.

407
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,744
You believe that
you understand

408
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,663
the depths
beneath you...

409
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,211
but that, too,
is an illusion.

410
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,132
I can see why ensign Kim
finds you compelling.

411
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:43,510
I can see why
Harry admires...

412
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,512
and respects you.

413
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,515
Because it's obvious
that he does.

414
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,895
And... so do I.

415
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,689
I must return
to my quarters.

416
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,608
Please stay.

417
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,987
I've never met
anyone like you.

418
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,615
I must admit
I share that conclusion.

419
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,660
You are
a unique individual.

420
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,495
Then stay.

421
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,997
It is late.

422
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,748
I must go.

423
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,750
Then come back
tomorrow.

424
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,211
I'm sure the weather
will hold.

425
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,921
No doubt.

426
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,299
Please.

427
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,176
Perhaps.

428
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,430
Good night... Tuvok.

429
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,266
Good night, Marayna.

430
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,490
Computer,
end resort program.

431
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,124
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

432
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,043
<i>we've completed sensor scans</i>

433
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,171
<i>and confirmed our discovery</i>
<i>of an unusual dampening field</i>

434
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,589
<i>responsible for keeping</i>
<i>this unstable nebula</i>

435
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,091
<i>from going up in flames.</i>

436
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,511
<i>The field's origin</i>
<i>is still a mystery.</i>

437
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,429
The dampening field
only seems to appear

438
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,431
when one of
the plasma strands ignites,

439
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,433
as if the fire itself
initiates the field.

440
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,936
Which puts out the fire.
A feedback loop.

441
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,105
One that's preserved this nebula
for hundreds of years.

442
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,733
Mr. Kim, do we have enough data
on this dampening field

443
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,194
to produce a field artificially
using the deflector dish?

444
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,529
Harry, do we have the data?

445
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,949
Yes, captain,
but it'll take a while.

446
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,910
We'll have to simulate
the process in the computer

447
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,411
and then try to re-create it
with the deflector dish.

448
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,914
Probably a few weeks.

449
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,041
The project
is yours, ensign.

450
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,002
Tom, resume course for
the Alpha Quadrant. Warp six.

451
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,837
Aye, captain.

452
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,176
Captain, propulsion
is not responding.

453
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,220
Bridge to engineering.
B'Elanna, what's going on?

454
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,679
<i>I'm not sure, captain.</i>

455
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,348
<i>We're trying to track</i>
<i>the problem now.</i>

456
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,850
Acknowledged.
Harry, give B'Elanna a hand.

457
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,434
The nebula
could be having an effect

458
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,312
on the ship's systems.

459
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,439
That's a possibility
we can't discount.

460
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,365
The warp drive is functioning
within established

461
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,867
tolerance levels.
Matter/anti-matter containment

462
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,411
is at recommended
field strength.

463
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,371
The impulse engines
are also...

464
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,956
Within tolerance.
Yes.

465
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,083
Most likely, there's
some kind of failure

466
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,709
in the computer
pathways.

467
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,336
Nothing's wrong
with propulsion,

468
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,587
but the commands
from the helm

469
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,047
just aren't
getting there.

470
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,800
The warp drive seems okay.

471
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,385
Impulse too.

472
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,595
I think the problem
must be somewhere else.

473
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,140
I think maybe...
the helm's being blocked.

474
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,102
Like... some kind of failure
in the computer pathways?

475
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,645
Maybe.

476
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,563
I just said all that.
You're not listening, Harry.

477
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,441
I'll return
to my station, lieutenant.

478
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,902
I'm sorry. I guess I've got
a lot on my mind.

479
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,571
Forget about her.

480
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,115
What did Tom say to you?

481
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,033
Not a single word.
I saw the way

482
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,743
you were looking at Marayna
yesterday.

483
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:59,123
Hi. My name's Harry
"read-me-like-a-book" Kim.

484
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,083
It's not that bad.

485
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,960
Apparently, it is.

486
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,753
I can't get her off my mind.

487
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,505
COMPUTER:
<i>Input algorithm not accepted.</i>

488
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,049
Why don't you
take a break?

489
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,469
I can handle it
from here.

490
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,721
Thanks. I'll be
in my quarters if you need me.

491
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,397
Deck three.

492
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,363
Computer, belay that order.

493
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,656
Holodeck one.

494
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,286
Computer, activate
Neelix resort program.

495
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,331
COMPUTER:
<i>That program</i>
<i>is currently running.</i>

496
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,146
Hello, Harry.

497
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:07,649
Enjoying yourselves?

498
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,026
Now I know why
you told me

499
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,904
to keep off
the holodeck.

500
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,615
Mr. Kim, you are misconstruing
the nature of this situation.

501
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,868
Your jealousy
is entirely insupportable.

502
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,454
Stop analyzing me.

503
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,415
I respected you,
I trusted you,

504
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,542
and you did this
right behind my back.

505
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,126
I have done
nothing of the sort.

506
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,461
Then what
do you call this?

507
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,089
A game of<i> kal-toh,</i> 
which I am playing

508
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,840
with a nonsentient
computer subroutine.

509
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,717
Harry, I didn't intend
to harm you,

510
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,345
and I didn't do
anything wrong.

511
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,390
I'll accept that from her,
Tuvok, but not from you.

512
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,684
You said to stay away from her.
You should have done the same.

513
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,770
You're implying
a desire on my part

514
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,439
that simply
does not exist.

515
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,941
Marayna is an intriguing
interactive hologram.

516
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,026
Nothing more.

517
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,279
If you say so, lieutenant.

518
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,115
Mr. Kim, I value our
working relationship.

519
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,242
I would not allow a holodeck
character to disrupt that.

520
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,911
I think it's a little late--
Tuvok, Harry, please,

521
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,246
stop arguing.

522
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,748
Computer, delete the Marayna
subroutine.

523
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,042
Tuvok,
what are you...?

524
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,626
That's not going to help.

525
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,546
I never should have come
to you in the first place.

526
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,132
I should have
worked it out myself.

527
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,479
Let's try it again,
Mr. Paris. Warp six.

528
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,813
Course laid in.

529
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,482
Engage.

530
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,403
It would appear to me that
we're not moving, Mr. Paris.

531
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,862
I don't understand it,
captain.

532
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,573
Any ideas, B'Elanna?

533
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,533
Warp drive
is still on-line

534
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,410
and helm control
appears to be working,

535
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,537
but the engines
aren't responding.

536
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,747
It's possible we've got
a computer malfunction,

537
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,417
but I can't seem to localize it.
Let's run a level-four

538
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,462
computer diagnostic,
all systems.

539
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,879
Aye, captain.

540
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,966
Captain, I just got
aft thrusters to respond.

541
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,343
It's not much.

542
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,676
I'll take it, B'Elanna.

543
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,387
Tom, let's go.

544
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,097
At this speed,
we'll be completely clear

545
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,184
of the nebula by tomorrow.
Good enough.

546
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,242
Your move.

547
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,211
I think you'll find
my game has improved.

548
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,711
How did you get here?

549
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,506
Simple. I transferred myself

550
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,257
from the holodeck
to the sick bay,

551
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,468
then used your physician's
mobile emitter.

552
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,512
I deleted you from the holodeck.

553
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,264
But you only did that
for Harry's benefit.

554
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,976
I know you wanted
to keep seeing me.

555
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,729
I like Harry, but, uh...

556
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,981
well, you're different.

557
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,192
You're not like anyone else.

558
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,697
Why have you come here...
to my quarters?

559
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:03,283
You're like a new world
to me, Tuvok.

560
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,369
I want to know
everything about you.

561
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,707
I didn't realize how lonely
my existence was,

562
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,834
and I can't go back
to the way things were,

563
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,670
not without you.

564
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,593
Tuvok to Bridge.
Intruder alert.

565
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,428
Security team
to my quarters.

566
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,555
( alarm blares )
No!

567
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:25,972
Why did you do that?

568
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,683
Don't you want us
to be together?

569
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,269
Given your actions I have
no choice but to consider you

570
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,938
a potential threat
to myself and to<i> Voyager.</i>

571
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,314
But you're wrong.

572
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,192
I would never do
anything to harm you.

573
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,778
Make it stop!

574
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,697
( alarm stops )

575
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,366
You have access to the ship's
control systems?

576
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,159
And I'll use them all
if I have to.

577
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,622
You can't just delete me.

578
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,803
Where is this individual now?

579
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,055
When security got
to Tuvok's quarters

580
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,183
she downloaded herself
back into the computer

581
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,810
and onto the holodeck.

582
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,563
More to the point,
what is she?

583
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,774
Most likely a sentient
computer program.

584
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,525
I checked
the Starfleet database.

585
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,819
This kind of thing
has happened before.

586
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,571
The<i> Enterprise-D</i> 
under Picard

587
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,615
was once taken over
by a holo-character.

588
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,866
We studied that case
at the Academy.

589
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,495
It gained control of the ship
from inside the holodeck.

590
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,080
Marayna may well
have done the same.

591
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,249
She was able to silence
the intruder alert

592
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,834
by an apparent act of will.

593
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,504
Does she have the run of
our entire computer system?

594
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,755
She may.

595
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,256
Is it possible that
she is the source

596
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,049
of our mysterious
malfunctions?

597
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,968
It's certainly possible.

598
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,638
If Marayna's able to manipulate
the ship's computer pathways,

599
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,598
she could have
disrupted propulsion,

600
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,309
and then covered her tracks
so we couldn't trace the cause.

601
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,687
But why?
What's her motivation?

602
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,648
I believe it has something to do
with her feelings toward me.

603
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,317
In my quarters, she made
reference to her loneliness

604
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,195
and expressed her desire
to continue our relationship.

605
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,738
But what does that
have to do

606
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,115
with knocking propulsion
off-line?

607
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,494
Could she be trying
to keep us near the nebula?

608
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,538
This all started
the day we got here.

609
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,414
That's when I first met her.

610
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,875
Maybe the nebula is somehow
affecting the holodeck.

611
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,212
Giving rise to an intelligence
that doesn't belong there.

612
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,714
It's possible.

613
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,299
In any case...

614
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,511
I can't allow her to gain any
further control over my ship.

615
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,972
Tuvok, Paris, Torres,
get down to holodeck one.

616
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,643
I want this situation resolved
one way or another.

617
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,527
She's locked us
out of the program.

618
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,530
We'll be lucky if we
can open the doors.

619
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,032
We're lucky.

620
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,034
Marayna may have
opened the doors.

621
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,994
Caution is advised.

622
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,923
I'll try to access
the inside control panel.

623
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,682
It's kind of creepy.

624
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,726
Marayna's attempting
to re-create the setting

625
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,603
of my previous
encounter with her.

626
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,647
You really know how
to pick them, Tuvok.

627
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,072
I got access
to the holodeck computer.

628
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,991
PARIS:
I'm not reading anything
unusual on the holodeck.

629
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,453
It seems to be
working perfectly.

630
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,956
There's a subspace signal coming
from outside of<i> Voyager.</i>

631
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,334
It's some kind of an uplink.

632
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,712
There's somebody on a ship
out there tapping into the--

633
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,757
( gasping )
B'Elanna!

634
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,425
( grunts )

635
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,639
( gasping )

636
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,819
( grunting )

637
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,622
( gasping )

638
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,791
Shoot the control panel.

639
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,344
( coughing and gasping )

640
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,612
Shield status?
Still holding, captain,

641
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:54,491
but the inertial
dampeners are off-line.

642
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,576
Starboard shields
are down to 80 percent.

643
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,203
What happened
down there?

644
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,372
Marayna attacked us
and attempted to restrain me.

645
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,165
She has control over
the holodeck characters.

646
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,042
But she's not actually
on the holodeck.

647
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,085
I found an uplink
and tracked it to the nebula.

648
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,130
She's on a hidden ship
or a space station.

649
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,008
She's manipulating the holodeck
from there.

650
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,426
She's been using the Marayna
character like a puppet.

651
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,970
As an interface.

652
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,472
A way to move around<i> Voyager</i> 
to interact with us.

653
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,392
MARAYNA:
<i>Tuvok, come back to me.</i>

654
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,019
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

655
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:26,272
Harry, try to trace the uplink.
Find her.

656
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:30,235
<i>Don't make this more difficult</i>
<i>than it already is, captain.</i>

657
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,905
Are you responsible
for the plasma fires?

658
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,740
<i>You're giving me</i>
<i>no other choice</i>

659
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,116
<i>but to force the issue.</i>

660
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,202
What do you want?

661
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,330
<i>Tuvok. I want Tuvok.</i>

662
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,458
<i>Let him come to the holodeck</i>
<i>alone,</i>

663
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,670
<i>or I'll destroy your ship.</i>

664
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,816
Tuvok... you're back.

665
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,695
I had little choice.

666
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,114
We're alone now.

667
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,578
No one can see us
or hear us.

668
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,081
We can do whatever we want.

669
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,959
You don't have to pretend
anymore.

670
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,294
This is our world.

671
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,004
You've successfully
lured me here

672
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,505
by threatening the ship.

673
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,133
But any attempt to generate
intimacy between us

674
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,343
will not be successful.

675
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,638
I've isolated the source
of the uplink signal.

676
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,765
Standby to transport.

677
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,685
I understand
your sense of duty,

678
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,353
of loyalty
to your captain,

679
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,898
but we have
something stronger.

680
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:53,777
A connection that goes
beyond duty and loyalty.

681
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,905
I know you want
to be with me, Tuvok.

682
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,240
You must leave<i> Voyager</i> now

683
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,618
and allow us to continue
on our course.

684
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,745
I won't.

685
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,497
I suggest you reconsider

686
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,500
or Captain Janeway
will be forced to take action.

687
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,251
There's nothing she can do.

688
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,838
You're staying here
with me.

689
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,299
She'll just have to accept that.

690
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,137
Energize.

691
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,430
Transporting to the
source of the uplink.

692
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,765
Stop!

693
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,735
Shields are down to 47 percent.

694
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,057
Shields are gone.
Try to hail Tuvok.

695
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:08,226
I can't, captain.
Something's blocking the signal.

696
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,289
Marayna?

697
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:35,879
Your ship is helpless.

698
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:39,049
If I ignite one more strand

699
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:42,343
the hull will fail.

700
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,223
You are using the nebula
as a weapon.

701
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:48,558
My nebula.

702
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,560
I will fire if necessary.

703
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,229
You're too late.

704
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,814
I've already set
the ignition sequence.

705
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,734
Only I can stop it.

706
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,652
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

707
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,325
Are you alone here...

708
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,536
on this station...

709
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,164
in this nebula?

710
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,791
Yes.

711
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,834
It's my work.

712
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,420
I don't understand.

713
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:23,843
I keep the plasma fires
from chain reacting.

714
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,929
You are responsible
for the dampening field

715
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,181
we've been investigating.

716
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,641
That's correct.

717
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,101
I generate it from here

718
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,769
to preserve the nebula

719
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,854
so that others
from my home planet

720
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,523
may enjoy its beauty.

721
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,822
I watch the ships
when they pass by.

722
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,407
They don't even know I'm here.

723
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,163
You are... lonely.

724
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,707
By choice.

725
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:59,587
I prefer to be here... alone.

726
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,631
But you uplinked
with our holodeck

727
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,759
and created a character
in order to interact with us.

728
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,345
To amuse myself.
I've done it before.

729
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,640
Tapped into the computer
of a passing alien vessel,

730
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,854
examined all the little details
of their lives...

731
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,649
but I never expected
to find something

732
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,235
as... diverting

733
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,070
as your holodeck.

734
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,782
I never expected
to find you.

735
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,827
You...

736
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:34,580
are like nothing else
I've ever encountered...

737
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,169
and I can't be without you.

738
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,466
Stay here with me

739
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:49,846
and I will let
your ship resume course.

740
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,890
If it is the only option

741
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,768
I would willingly sacrifice
myself to save my crewmates.

742
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,812
No! That's not enough.

743
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,148
You have to want to be with me.

744
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,775
If you truly understood
who and what I am,

745
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,611
you would know that I could
never return your affections.

746
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:11,117
( voice breaking ):
But... you are more like me
than you are like them.

747
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,913
I-I-I've seen the way
you isolate yourself.

748
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,165
Even in a crowd of people

749
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,376
you're alone.

750
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:22,712
We should be together.

751
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,797
I must admit...

752
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,259
I found our conversation
stimulating,

753
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,887
your insight and intelligence

754
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:34,640
fresh and unexpected.

755
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,475
In other circumstances,

756
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,938
I would be willing
to spend time in your company

757
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:45,484
to continue to share
knowledge and ideas,

758
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:50,489
but I have a home
and a spouse on Vulcan.

759
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:54,619
I have a mission
and colleagues who depend on me.

760
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:02,794
I do not have a complete
understanding of emotions,

761
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,798
but I believe
that if you truly care for me,

762
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,551
you will not pursue
this course of action.

763
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,479
( sighs softly )

764
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,940
( beeping )

765
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,698
You may go.

766
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,833
Your communicator
will function now.

767
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,962
Tuvok to<i> Voyager.</i>

768
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,173
Go ahead, Tuvok.

769
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,342
<i>I am ready to return.</i>

770
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:53,511
<i>Stand by to beam me aboard.</i>

771
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,596
( ship's systems powering up )

772
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,598
( sighs )

773
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,601
Captain, ship's systems
are coming back on-line.

774
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,645
Acknowledged, Tuvok.

775
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,563
<i>Standing by.</i>

776
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,153
Consider this:

777
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,737
your feelings toward me

778
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:15,700
may be evidence
of a deeper need...

779
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,329
a more...
profound loneliness

780
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,124
than you are willing
to admit.

781
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:26,252
Why don't you call
for a replacement.

782
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,755
Let another
occupy this task.

783
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,885
Attempt for a time
to live among your own kind.

784
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:44,437
Logically, that would be
the best thing to do.

785
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,148
Yes.

786
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,317
Perhaps I will.

787
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,075
Tuvok to<i> Voyager.</i>

788
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,576
Ready for transport.

789
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,205
But what about you, Tuvok?

790
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,332
Will you always be alone?

791
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:19,722
TUVOK:
<i>Security chief's log,</i>
<i>stardate 50471.3.</i>

792
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,475
<i>The remaining damage to</i>
<i>the ship was easily repaired</i>

793
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,019
<i>and we soon left</i>
<i>Marayna's nebula behind.</i>

794
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,771
Voyager<i> is back on course</i>

795
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,899
<i>and I have resumed</i>
<i>my normal routine.</i>

796
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,369
( sighs )

797
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,253
( door opens )

798
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,134
Mr. Kim.

799
00:43:56,134 --> 00:44:00,846
Would you be interested
in learning to play<i> kal-toh?</i>

800
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:06,436
I thought<i> kal-toh</i>
was beyond human understanding.

801
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,813
Not entirely.

802
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,861
Ensign...

803
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,906
I failed to respect

804
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,451
the complexity of your emotions.

805
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:26,414
I apologize
for my lack of consideration.

806
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,584
(<i> sighs</i> )

807
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,128
Don't worry about it, Tuvok.

808
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,046
Apology accepted.

809
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,804
(<i> turns game on</i> )

810
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,140
Won't this take years to learn?

811
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,100
It will, indeed.

812
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,519
May I join you?

813
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,228
No.
No.

814
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,482
But... thank you.

815
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,570
(<i> chuckles</i> )
