1
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,149
What?

2
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,151
I've seen that look before.

3
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,737
Ensign Murphy
had better watch out.

4
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,531
I happen to know
that Murphy is seeing

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,032
one of the Delaney sisters.

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,952
Not since Harry and Tom Paris
made their move.

7
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,746
Harry and
the Delaney sisters?

8
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,456
He would have told me.

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,793
I guess there are some things
he keeps to himself.

10
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,294
Harry...

11
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,256
is it true about you
and the Delaney sisters?

12
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,591
Is what true?

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,134
Come on, Harry.

14
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,554
There aren't any secrets
on a ship this small.

15
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,141
What have you been
telling people?

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,228
Well, we did take that
trip to Venice with them.

17
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,563
KIM:
The holodeck?

18
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,105
You got
to be kidding.

19
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,191
That lasted
all of 15 minutes.

20
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,569
Yeah, you know,
I've been meaning to ask you.

21
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,030
What happened when
you and Jenny Delaney

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,114
disappeared
in that gondola?

23
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,909
Nothing.

24
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,119
Harry, we're your friends.
You can tell us.

25
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,206
Nothing.
We... talked.

26
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,542
And then...

27
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,336
I fell over the side.

28
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:30,215
You fell out of
the gondola?

29
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,051
I think maybe Harry
wasn't quite prepared

30
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:36,388
for how voracious
Jenny Delaney can be.

31
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,894
I think it's finally
beginning to happen.

32
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,688
Both crews getting along.

33
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,942
That kind of bonding
should improve performance

34
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,401
and maximize efficiency.

35
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,071
Yes, I'm sure it will.

36
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,906
CHAKOTAY:
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

37
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,240
Go ahead.

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,992
Captain, we're receiving
a distress call

39
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,994
in one of the lower
subspace bands.

40
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,371
I'm on my way.

41
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,165
This is it.
Thanks.

42
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,922
Report, Commander.

43
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,506
The subspace
distress signal's

44
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,676
coming from a vessel
bearing 125 mark 21.

45
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,137
Distance:
200,000 kilometers.

46
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,472
Captain...

47
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,682
sensors indicate five
life-forms aboard.

48
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,978
The vessel is altering
its course to intercept us.

49
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,854
Go to Yellow Alert
and slow to impulse.

50
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,315
Hail them, Mr. Kim.
Aye, Captain.

51
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,151
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

52
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,278
of the Federation
starship<i> Voyager.</i>

53
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,280
What is the nature
of your emergency?

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,324
We have no emergency.

55
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,868
But you're sending out
a distress call.

56
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,453
Yes, we are.

57
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,371
Why?

58
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,624
Because you are in distress.

59
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,412
I am Gathorel Labin
of the planet Sikaris.

60
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,124
Please, let us welcome you
to our system,

61
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,542
show you the hospitality
of our people.

62
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,128
That's very kind of you...

63
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,004
If I could come aboard
your ship,

64
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,714
I have gifts for you

65
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,176
and a proposal I hope
you will find irresistible.

66
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,642
Mr. Tuvok, make
the necessary arrangements

67
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,894
to receive our guest.

68
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,484
(<i> humming softly</i> )

69
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,655
Ah...

70
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,159
Mr. Labin, it really
isn't necessary

71
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,493
to go to all
of this trouble.

72
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,995
Please, call me Gath.

73
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,997
And I promise you,
I would like nothing better

74
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,666
than to prepare a few of our
newest delicacies for you.

75
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,501
Ah, this will
be perfect.

76
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,880
Uh-uh, Captain, I'm serving
lunch in less than two hours.

77
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,132
We won't be long, Neelix.

78
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,134
This is Mr.--
This is Gath.

79
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,468
He's from Sikaris.

80
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,596
Ooh, Sikaris.

81
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,223
Do you know the planet?

82
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:52,769
Only stories about their
incredible hospitality.

83
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,355
Tell me, how do
you know about us?

84
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,775
Our people are
very well-traveled.

85
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,777
Some of them have
brought back stories

86
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,237
about the ship
of aliens

87
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,905
from another part
of the galaxy--

88
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,074
People lost and alone,

89
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,202
struggling to find
their way home again.

90
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,287
This is wonderful.

91
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,206
And I decided to
come and meet you,

92
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,999
and offer you respite.

93
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,209
Respite?

94
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,044
A vacation,
if you will.

95
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,713
Get away from the confines
of the ship,

96
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,090
enjoy the beauty
of our landscape,

97
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,844
meet and talk with interesting,
learn-ed people.

98
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,762
And the crew would
certainly welcome

99
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,264
a little shore leave,
Captain.

100
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,765
And I hear the Sikarians

101
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,685
have a huge variety
of edible plants.

102
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,687
If we could
collect some seeds,

103
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,607
we'd expand our selection
significantly.

104
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,944
Sounds like all this
would increase performance

105
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,196
and maximize efficiency.

106
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,614
Don't you think,
Mr. Tuvok?

107
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,449
Indeed.

108
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,828
Well, Gath, looks like
you're getting visitors.

109
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,748
We'll set a course
and follow you in.

110
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,708
I could not be happier.

111
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,053
GATH:
If you see
anything you like,

112
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,389
just let me know.

113
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,352
What is this material?

114
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,978
It's so delicate.

115
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,355
Exquisite, isn't it?

116
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,690
It's the latest import
from Dedestris.

117
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,068
It's spun from
the petals of a flower

118
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,279
that blooms
only in moonlight.

119
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,989
Shall I have
a dress made for you?

120
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,491
It's lovely,
but, no... thank you.

121
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,537
Is it so hard
for you to accept a gift?

122
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,082
All right,
but something small.

123
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,375
Maybe a scarf?

124
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,543
What a curious people
you are.

125
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,795
Tell me,

126
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,088
would it help if I said

127
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,299
that you could have
an entire wardrobe

128
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,342
made from these
beautiful fabrics,

129
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,470
and that it would give
all of us pleasure

130
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,347
to create it for you?

131
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,933
Let's...
start with the scarf.

132
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,517
As you like.

133
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,520
Which cloth do
you prefer, huh?

134
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,694
(<i> tones chiming</i> )

135
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,197
That's beautiful.

136
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,366
Are you a musician?

137
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,493
This isn't a
musical instrument.

138
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,912
It's an atmospheric sensor.

139
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,538
The frequency of the chimes

140
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:21,460
indicates changes
in weather conditions.

141
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,711
Then it must work
on a principle

142
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,088
of non-linear resonance,

143
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,965
adjusting
to the dynamic variables

144
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,216
in the atmosphere.

145
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,926
That's exactly right.

146
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,262
Are you a scientist?

147
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,888
In a sense.

148
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,057
Can you show me
how to operate it?

149
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,892
I'd be happy to.

150
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,187
First, you have
to initialize

151
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,230
the sub-harmonic mode.

152
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,940
(<i> tones chiming</i> )

153
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,275
(<i> laughs</i> )

154
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,152
Mm-hmm.

155
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,406
Oh, I think this one.

156
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,368
When I see you
wearing that scarf,

157
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,078
my pleasure will be
greater than yours.

158
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,791
Well, I should get back.

159
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,126
But with your permission,

160
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,212
I'd like to start
organizing teams

161
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,629
to gather plants
and seeds.

162
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,383
This is my associate,
Jaret Otel.

163
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,925
You may contact him
to make

164
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,469
any necessary
arrangements.

165
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,887
We'll be glad to assist you

166
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,264
in any way, Captain.

167
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,724
I'll find my officers,

168
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,393
and we'll return
to the ship.

169
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,103
Tonight, we are having
a celebration here.

170
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,606
I hope you and your officers
will be my guests.

171
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,819
We'd be delighted.

172
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:42,082
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48642.5.</i>

173
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,334
<i>The crew is enjoying an evening</i>
<i>on Sikaris.</i>

174
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>They are discovering,</i>
<i>to their delight, that reports</i>

175
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,590
<i>of this species' hospitality</i>
<i>have not been exaggerated.</i>

176
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,717
KIM:
...so the whole thing exploded,

177
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,970
and there we were,
70,000 light-years from home,

178
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,473
and no way to get back.

179
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,352
Felt pretty lonely.

180
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,687
That's a very noble story.

181
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,022
Noble?

182
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,483
Mm-hmm. Stories
can be whimsical

183
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,693
or frightening
or-or melancholy

184
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,862
or many other things,

185
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,574
but noble stories
are the ones

186
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,326
that can most
affect our lives.

187
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,913
May I have
your permission

188
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,874
to tell others
this story?

189
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,293
Sure.

190
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,502
It's no secret.

191
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,963
But stories are
an essential part

192
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,299
of every person's being.

193
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,759
I would never share one
without permission.

194
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,011
Go right ahead.

195
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,972
I've got a few others too.

196
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,808
You do?

197
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,393
Come with me.

198
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,189
I know a private place

199
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,110
where you can tell me
all your stories.

200
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,654
Stand close to me.

201
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,158
Alastria.

202
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,704
(<i> chuckles</i> )

203
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,206
Mm...

204
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,749
Where are we?

205
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,670
The woods of Alastria.
My favorite place.

206
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,963
I usually come here

207
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,672
when I want
to spend time alone,

208
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:18,595
but tonight, it...
it seemed right to bring you.

209
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,139
Now...

210
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,600
tell me your stories.

211
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,768
All of them.

212
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,814
Why is it so much
warmer here?

213
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,901
What is that?

214
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,863
The dawn zephyr.

215
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,740
Dawn? We just got here.

216
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,911
( sighs )

217
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,083
That's... that is
an amazing feeling.

218
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,336
What... what's happening?

219
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,796
The erosene winds--

220
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,385
passion winds...

221
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,847
come just before the dawn.

222
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,476
The erosene
creates euphoria.

223
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,565
I'll say.

224
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,875
Why am I seeing two suns?

225
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,379
Because this is
a binary system.

226
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,298
But your planet
only has one sun.

227
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,218
But Alastria has two.

228
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,637
Eudana...

229
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,763
Hmm?

230
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,057
Where are we?

231
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,850
I told you...

232
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,894
Alastria--

233
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,064
a system far from Sikaris.

234
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,566
How far?

235
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,444
Do you have to ask
all these questions?

236
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,241
Please, it's important.

237
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,077
Alastria is about
two and a half billion times

238
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,747
the distance between
Sikaris and its sun.

239
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,374
That's almost...

240
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,251
40,000 light-years.

241
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,671
Mmm...

242
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,089
Now...

243
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,758
(<i> wind blowing softly</i> )

244
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,510
...feel the breeze.

245
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,432
Um, we have to go back.

246
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,684
It's still night on Sikaris.

247
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,311
We have plenty of time.

248
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,732
No. Um...

249
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,776
we're going back.

250
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,445
And I need you
to tell me everything you know

251
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,947
about that platform
that got us here.

252
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:49,120
GATH:
And tomorrow night, you must
let me take you to the theater.

253
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,330
Oh, my.

254
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,248
I have lost
all track of time.

255
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,625
My crew has gone.

256
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,502
I'm the last one here.

257
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,798
I hope that's because
you are enjoying yourself.

258
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,008
I am.

259
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,930
KIM:
Captain!
Excuse me for interrupting,

260
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,224
but I've just found out
about something incredible.

261
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,518
Calm down, Ensign.

262
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,811
What is it?

263
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,396
That platform...

264
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,231
it's a transportation device.

265
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,608
Extremely sophisticated.

266
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,110
It operates on the principle
of folding space.

267
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,281
That's something
that's been theorized,

268
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,493
but no one's ever been able
to develop the technology.

269
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,286
Well, these people have.

270
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,707
I've just been
to Alastria and back.

271
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:37,251
Alastria is 40,000
light-years away.

272
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,339
We call it a
spatial trajector.

273
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,549
We're able to travel

274
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,217
to all the planets
in this quadrant.

275
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,219
How far can it take you?

276
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,347
Alastria is at the outermost
limits of its range.

277
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,307
KIM:
Apparently, it's never been used

278
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,601
to move anything
as large as<i> Voyager,</i>

279
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,187
but as I understand the
principle of space folding,

280
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,898
the size of the object
isn't relevant.

281
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,026
What do you think?

282
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,071
Would it be possible
to modify your technology

283
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,615
so we could use it?

284
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,409
I tried to tell him.

285
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,244
What is it?

286
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,329
We cannot share our technology.

287
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,039
Once it's out of our control,

288
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,876
it might fall into the hands
of those who would abuse it,

289
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,421
and our Canon of Laws
strictly forbids that.

290
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,172
But we wouldn't abuse it.

291
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,007
KIM:
Don't you see

292
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,885
what it would mean to us?

293
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,888
Please, don't make it
more difficult for me.

294
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,681
I don't enjoy denying you this,

295
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,141
but our Canon of
Laws has determined

296
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,102
our entire system
of values.

297
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,187
To break one of its precepts

298
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,357
would undermine
everything we believe in.

299
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:46,446
I'm sorry, but there can be
no exceptions to the law.

300
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,340
I can't believe
they're not going to help us.

301
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,384
Some kind of hospitality.

302
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,094
40,000 light-years.

303
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,846
Even if that's as
far as we could go,

304
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,099
it would still knock about
four decades off our trip.

305
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,601
And the possibility exists

306
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,812
that we could reconfigure
the matrix at that point

307
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,814
to take us another
30,000 light-years

308
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,649
right into
Federation space.

309
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,609
Since they've already said no,

310
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,779
this kind of thinking is only
going to make you feel worse.

311
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,949
It's the first time
we've been on the other side

312
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,366
of the fence.

313
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,410
What fence?

314
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,538
The one that's made
of binding principles.

315
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,582
We have our own set of rules,

316
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,585
which includes
the Prime Directive.

317
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,629
How many times
have we been in the position

318
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,340
of refusing to interfere
when some kind of disaster

319
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,926
threatened an alien culture?

320
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,886
It's all very well
to say we do it

321
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,764
on the basis of
an enlightened principle,

322
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,016
but how does that feel
to the aliens?

323
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,603
I'm sure many
of them think

324
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,564
the Prime Directive
is a lousy idea.

325
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,316
Even we think so
sometimes.

326
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,401
I know of many times
when Starfleet personnel

327
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,111
have decided
on strong ethical grounds

328
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,238
to ignore it.
Still, there's a reason why

329
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,157
it's Starfleet's
General Order #1.

330
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,576
On the whole, it does
a lot more good than harm.

331
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,161
Captain,
it occurs to me

332
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,121
that we know little
about the Sikarians.

333
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,667
We cannot assume that their
first refusal is unalterable.

334
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,169
It may be that "no" is simply
a prelude to negotiation.

335
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,463
TORRES:
He's right. Maybe they
can be reasoned with.

336
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,256
CHAKOTAY:
Maybe they
want something.

337
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,466
Maybe they'll bargain.

338
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,801
But what do we
have to offer?

339
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,679
They seem to have
everything they need.

340
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,307
Stories.

341
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,686
Stories are an important part
of their culture.

342
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,104
They seem to provide
more than entertainment.

343
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,982
They're kind of
a measuring rod of values

344
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,483
and beliefs.

345
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,861
We have a huge library
in our data banks.

346
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,654
We could offer them
the whole thing.

347
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,032
All the great literature
of dozens of cultures.

348
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,449
What do you think,
Captain?

349
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,701
Would they
be interested?

350
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,829
They just might be.

351
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,457
From what we've
seen of them,

352
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,252
they're a remarkably
pleasure-oriented people.

353
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:10,130
They might appreciate
a gift of literature.

354
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,050
I'll arrange
to meet with Gath.

355
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,634
As magistrate,
he has the authority

356
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,678
to make this decision.
In the meantime,

357
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,222
I'm going to take a look
at that trajector platform.

358
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,849
Maybe I can figure out
how it works.

359
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,684
You'll do nothing of
the sort, Lieutenant.

360
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,771
( sighs )

361
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,814
If I find
this law is negotiable,

362
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,191
I'll make every attempt
to get the technology,

363
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,111
but until then, we won't do
anything that might violate

364
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,322
their Canon of Laws
as we understand it.

365
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,951
That's all.

366
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,377
What's wrong?

367
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,800
I just hope she gets it.

368
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,637
She will.

369
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,649
Mmm. Exquisite.

370
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,692
And what did you say
you call it?

371
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,903
Pecan pie.

372
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,738
I must have the recipe.

373
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,491
I'd be happy
to share it with you.

374
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,748
Gath... I want you to know
I understand your reluctance

375
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,207
to share your technology
with us.

376
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,919
We have
similar restrictions,

377
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,337
but I wondered,

378
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,673
would it make any difference
if I gave you my word

379
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,508
that we would destroy
the trajector matrix

380
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,136
as soon as
we'd used it?

381
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,597
I know this will upset
you, but I can't.

382
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:46,936
I understand, and frankly,
I suspected as much,

383
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,731
but I have a proposal
which might allow you

384
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,983
to obey your laws

385
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,861
and still give us
what we want.

386
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,534
Surely you could use
the trajector to send us.

387
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,952
40,000 light-years

388
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,287
would mean
a great deal to us,

389
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,583
and in return, we're prepared
to offer you something

390
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,877
you might enjoy.

391
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,586
Oh!

392
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,505
A full library

393
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,051
of the Federation's
finest literature.

394
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,011
Literature?

395
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,808
Centuries of stories.
New stories

396
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,643
from diverse cultures.

397
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,312
Stories that fire
the imagination.

398
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,025
You certainly know
how to tempt me,

399
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,861
Captain.

400
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,613
It's certainly possible.

401
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,075
I'll have to meet with the other
magistrates to discuss it.

402
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,785
No one has ever made
a request like that.

403
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,287
In the meantime,
I'd like to enjoy

404
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,333
every bite of, uh, this...
how did you call it?

405
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,335
Pecan pie.

406
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:03,054
( indistinct chatter )

407
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,555
I finished
the maintenance check

408
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,432
on the shock attenuation
cylinders.

409
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,102
They'll have to be replaced
in another 2,000 hours,

410
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,354
but we'll face that problem
when we come to it.

411
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,024
Seska.

412
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,027
Sorry. I wasn't
concentrating.

413
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,738
What did you say?

414
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,157
You looked a million
light-years away.

415
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:27,787
No.
Only about 70,000.

416
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,916
My brother's birthday
is in four days.

417
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,087
Last year, I promised
I'd meet him on Nivoch

418
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,297
to celebrate
with him.

419
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,175
He'll think
I broke my promise.

420
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,054
That I'm dead.

421
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,148
What are you doing?

422
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,983
I've been thinking.

423
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,902
The folding of space should
leave a sub-space residue.

424
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,113
If we can detect one,
we might be a step closer

425
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,282
to knowing
how the trajector works.

426
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,700
Look at that
neutrino dispersion pattern.

427
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,078
Could that be the result
of space folding?

428
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,205
Maybe. If the device

429
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,539
creates a
neutrino bubble

430
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,500
around whatever's
being trajected.

431
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,960
If that's the case,

432
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,005
we'd need a bubble
big enough for the ship.

433
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,882
Don't worry,
Lieutenant.

434
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,927
I'm with you on this one.

435
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:29,265
After all,
it doesn't hurt to theorize.

436
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:33,186
Right, and
hypothetically,

437
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,437
if we could modify
the deflector array

438
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,439
to emit phased neutrinos,

439
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,526
we could create a
big enough bubble.

440
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,819
Let's give it a try.

441
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,779
In theory, of course.

442
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,790
I don't understand.

443
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,416
Why is it so important
I come here now?

444
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,669
You'll see in a minute.

445
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,675
We're here.

446
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,761
Good evening, Ensign.
Thank you for coming.

447
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,055
What's this about?

448
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,931
I asked Eudana
to invite you here

449
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,309
because I was sure you
would respond to her

450
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,728
and because it would
look perfectly natural.

451
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,689
I am prepared to accept
your collection of literature

452
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,900
in exchange
for our trajector technology.

453
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,070
Is that something
you're authorized to do?

454
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,614
Officially, no,
but many people believe

455
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,283
that rules
should be flexible enough

456
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,161
to meet the needs
of the moment.

457
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,248
There is a great desire here
for new stories,

458
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,415
and I want to be the one
to supply them.

459
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:41,254
So you'd stand to benefit
from this arrangement, right?

460
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,963
We would both benefit.

461
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,715
I would gain prestige,

462
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,552
and you would gain
40,000 light-years

463
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,680
in your journey home,
possibly more.

464
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,890
This is it, Ensign,

465
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,516
the matrix of
the trajector.

466
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,231
Captain Janeway
has asked the magistrate

467
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,483
to send us 40,000 light-years.
He won't.

468
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,070
He never had any intention
of helping you leave here.

469
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,030
EUDANA:
Jaret is right.

470
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,118
I know how much
it means to you to get home.

471
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,287
Please,
listen to him.

472
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,580
You must believe me
when I tell you

473
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,375
this is the only way
you will make that journey.

474
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,670
Consider my offer.

475
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,548
I'm sure you will decide
it is a fair one.

476
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,927
I don't know what to do.

477
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,264
I know we'd all like to get
that much closer to home,

478
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,765
but I don't think
Captain Janeway

479
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,892
is going to go for getting
the technology like that.

480
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,978
Maybe she will.
After all,

481
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,397
it's a Sikarian
who's making the offer.

482
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,107
But it's not aboveboard.

483
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,234
The Captain
is only going to deal

484
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,445
with an official
representative.

485
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,905
Bridge to Ensign Kim.
The Captain can see you now.

486
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,449
Just tell her
everything you know.

487
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,534
Let her take it from there.
Right.

488
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,953
I'll walk you partway.

489
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,164
I'm headed for bed.

490
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,748
( sighs )

491
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:04,170
Somehow... I have
a bad feeling about this.

492
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,005
It's just not going
to work out.

493
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,258
Don't you think
that's up to us?

494
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,634
What does that mean?

495
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,303
It means that
we can sit here

496
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,971
and let someone make
the decision for us,

497
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,722
or we can take matters
into our own hands.

498
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,684
We've been offered
the grand prize.

499
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,103
All we have to do is
step up and claim it.

500
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:25,107
Take the technology?
Without permission?

501
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,443
Since when
do you talk like that?

502
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,320
Do you think permission
is more important

503
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,323
than getting us halfway home?

504
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,284
The Captain is so infatuated
with the Sikarian magistrate,

505
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,328
she can't
think straight.

506
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,455
We can't trust
that she's going to make

507
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,375
the best decision for all of us.

508
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,001
If we do this,

509
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,879
we'll need to use Engineering
to configure the matrix.

510
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,630
It will be a lot easier

511
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,257
if we knew
we could count on you.

512
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,386
Seska, I am
a Senior Officer now.

513
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,137
I have responsibilities.

514
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,515
And the main responsibility
for everyone on this ship

515
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,099
is to try to find a way home.

516
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,394
Captain Janeway made that clear
from the beginning.

517
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,480
That's our primary mission.

518
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,442
Just think about it.
That's all.

519
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,335
Did Jaret explain what he meant
when he said

520
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,128
Gath had no intention
of helping us leave?

521
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,257
No. He just made it clear
that our only choice

522
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,717
was to get the trajector
technology from him.

523
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,137
He may simply want us to believe
that so we would deal with him.

524
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,766
Possibly...

525
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:44,353
but somehow,
I suspect he's right.

526
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,355
Thank you for coming to me
with this, Ensign.

527
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,524
It may muddy
the situation somewhat,

528
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,359
but it helps me
force the issue.

529
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,609
Dismissed.

530
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,863
Good night, Captain. Lieutenant.

531
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,830
Oh, Tuvok,
what do I do now?

532
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,333
You would seem to
have two options.

533
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,168
Continue to negotiate
with a man

534
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,421
who may have
a hidden agenda,

535
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,339
or deal with a man

536
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,800
who is willing to
defy his own laws.

537
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,927
Not very pretty choices.

538
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,221
At least if you
deal with Jaret,

539
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,515
it is his law that
is being compromised,

540
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,184
not ours.

541
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,313
But does that matter?

542
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,940
I told the crew
when we started this journey

543
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,733
that we'd be a Starfleet crew,

544
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,278
behaving as Starfleet
would expect us to.

545
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,073
That means there's a certain
standard I have to uphold.

546
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,328
Principles, principles.

547
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,830
That's what it comes down to.

548
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,502
Do I compromise
my almighty principles?

549
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,795
But how do I not compromise them

550
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,256
if it involves a chance
to get the crew

551
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,800
more than halfway home?

552
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,512
How do I tell them...

553
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,598
my principles are so important

554
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,017
I would deny them
that opportunity?

555
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,271
I believe
the first thing you must do

556
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,772
is determine whether or not

557
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,317
Gath is willing to use
the trajector to help us.

558
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,902
If that possibility
exists at all,

559
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,404
you must explore it.

560
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,906
You're right.

561
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,329
Thank you, Tuvok.

562
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,419
JANEWAY:
Have you spoken with
the other magistrates

563
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,463
about using
the trajector?

564
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,673
Actually, I haven't.

565
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:37,049
Some of them
are traveling now,

566
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,010
but I assure you
I will do it.

567
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,889
Oh, I've already seen
all those.

568
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,433
It's becoming a matter
of some urgency.

569
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,809
Oh. Why?

570
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,020
We've imposed on you
for long enough.

571
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,355
Not true.

572
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,107
We welcome you
for as long as you can stay,

573
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,986
and I hope that's
a very long time indeed.

574
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,409
My crew is eager to
continue our journey.

575
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,910
Once they realized

576
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,079
the trajector might bring
us 40,000 light-years

577
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,622
closer to home...

578
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:12,585
Why are you so consumed
with this desire to get home?

579
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,628
I find it difficult
to understand.

580
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,923
Home... is home.

581
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,841
It's where we belong.

582
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,969
Couldn't you create
a new home here with us?

583
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,347
Can you imagine
a more delightful place to live

584
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,559
where you could pass your time
extracting pleasure

585
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,893
from every moment?

586
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,520
I promise you,

587
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,316
you and I have many
such moments to explore.

588
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:40,946
Yes, but for how long?

589
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,322
I've seen how quickly

590
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,408
you get tired of
your pleasures.

591
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,618
All that interests you

592
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:48,370
is what's new
and unexplored.

593
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,624
After a day or two,
it becomes commonplace.

594
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,125
Yes...

595
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,544
We prefer
permanence...

596
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,505
the reward
of relationships that endure

597
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,341
and grow deeper
with the passing of time.

598
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,178
You would lose those notions
if you stayed with us.

599
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:09,933
You may be right,
and that's why we have to leave.

600
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,438
We have offered you
nothing but hospitality.

601
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:19,818
Is this how you repay us,
with an attack on our beliefs?

602
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,738
I'm sorry.

603
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,074
I was just trying to illustrate
the differences between us.

604
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,909
I don't enjoy
being judged like this.

605
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,497
It's very upsetting.
Not at all pleasurable.

606
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:35,626
That's all you really
care about, isn't it?

607
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,128
Your pleasure.

608
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,674
All your hospitality,
your graciousness--

609
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:45,051
it was never about
giving us pleasure.

610
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,722
It's all been
to gratify yourselves.

611
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,350
We're nothing more than
the latest novelty.

612
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,812
You're hostile and vicious.

613
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,439
You would infect
the joyousness of our lives.

614
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,609
You must leave immediately.

615
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,696
You never had any intention
of helping us, did you?

616
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,405
Of course I did.

617
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,783
I did everything in my power
to persuade you to stay here.

618
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,079
Janeway to<i> Voyager.</i> 
One to beam up.

619
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,052
Cancel all shore leave
and recall the away teams.

620
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,762
We've been asked to leave.

621
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,597
Aye, Captain.

622
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,394
I assume that means Gath
will not be assisting us.

623
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,937
I don't think he ever had
any intention of helping us.

624
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,899
He just...
strung us along.

625
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,819
Are you considering
Jaret's offer?

626
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,738
Oh, I wish I could...

627
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,198
but I can't.

628
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,701
Captain, it'll take hours
to get everyone up.

629
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,412
We've got crew members scattered
throughout both hemispheres.

630
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,039
Get them back as quickly
as you can, Commander.

631
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,333
I think we've
overextended our stay here.

632
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,169
I'll be in my ready room.

633
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,135
SESKA:
I've downloaded
the Federation library.

634
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,721
It's all on these chips.

635
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,515
We know the man to contact.
He wants the library,

636
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,267
and he doesn't care
who gives it to him.

637
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,395
We're under orders...
B'Elanna, right now

638
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,522
our people are still
fighting Cardassians,

639
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,315
dying for our cause.

640
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,276
Settlers in
the Demilitarized Zone

641
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,319
are still under attack.

642
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,447
We made a promise, B'Elanna,

643
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,658
that we'd all stick together
until the Zone was safe,

644
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,620
and I intend
to keep that promise.

645
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,915
I have a wife
and two little boys.

646
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:40,333
I don't want them to grow up
without a father.

647
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,502
I'd do anything to prevent that.

648
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,546
We're not
the only ones.

649
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,840
Everyone wants
to get back.

650
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,635
They're just waiting
for someone to act.

651
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,220
I've been working
on the theory that the trajector

652
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,347
operates within
a neutrino envelope.

653
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,600
If that's true,
I think we can use it

654
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,144
as many times
as we need

655
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,730
until we're all the way home.

656
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,067
Just think... by tomorrow,
we could be there.

657
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,074
All right.

658
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,119
Let's do it.

659
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,628
With shore leave canceled,

660
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,505
are we able to get to
the surface undetected?

661
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,465
We'll have to override
the security lockout,

662
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,967
but that shouldn't
be a problem.

663
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,677
It's not accepting
my security code.

664
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,303
Reinitialize
the lockout buffers.

665
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,805
I did.
It's not working.

666
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,682
Someone's altered
the security subroutine.

667
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,559
Why would anyone do that?
Never mind. Beam me down.

668
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,936
Are you crazy?!

669
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,689
Security will find you out
before you get there.

670
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,283
I altered
the security subroutines.

671
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,369
Any attempt to override
the lockout

672
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,705
would have alerted me
to your presence here.

673
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,505
Is this
<i>Voyager's</i> library

674
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:12,425
which you intended to trade
for the trajector technology?

675
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,761
Yes.

676
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,724
When I attempted
to download it,

677
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,642
I noticed it had
already been accessed.

678
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,144
You were going
to download it?

679
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,814
I will make the exchange
with Jaret Otel.

680
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,572
Return to your stations.
Do what you can

681
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,657
to prepare the ship
for the matrix.

682
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,826
Energize.

683
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,844
Mr. Tuvok is
on the surface now, Captain.

684
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,679
He says the remaining
away teams

685
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,222
should be on board
within 15 minutes.

686
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,933
Are all the food
supplies secured?

687
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,560
Aye, Captain. As soon as
the last of the crew gets back,

688
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,645
we'll be ready
to leave.

689
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,856
Bridge to Engineering.
Torres here.

690
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,608
We'll be leaving orbit
within minutes.

691
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,068
Ready all propulsion systems.

692
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,028
We're ready now, Captain.

693
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,907
Where's Tuvok?
He'll be here.

694
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,491
We certainly won't leave
without him.

695
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,244
Well, what's keeping him?
Calm down.

696
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,997
You're going to draw
attention to yourself.

697
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,630
Do not attempt
to activate the device

698
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,673
until I've spoken
to Captain Janeway.

699
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,472
What are you doing?

700
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,557
He said
not to activate it.

701
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,267
I'm not.

702
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,437
I'm just going to try
the interface simulation.

703
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,731
We don't even know
if it will interface.

704
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,192
We can give ourselves
a head start by testing it now.

705
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,361
All right.

706
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,115
But just a simulation.

707
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,916
It's working.

708
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,208
I was right.

709
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,377
It operates within
a neutrino envelope.

710
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,463
The trajector field is bigger
than anything we've created

711
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,465
by ten orders
of magnitude.

712
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,216
To get a field that size,

713
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,761
you'd need an amplifier
as big as a planet.

714
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,179
I don't understand.

715
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,515
How do they get that
kind of amplification?

716
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,184
I'll show you.

717
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,602
Sikaris has a mantle

718
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,897
of tetrahedral quartz
20 kilometers thick.

719
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,899
The crystalline structure
of the mantle

720
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,360
serves to focus and amplify
the trajector field.

721
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,071
If that's how
the power transfer occurs,

722
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,282
then once we leave orbit,
we lose the ability to traject.

723
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,119
We don't have time to test it.

724
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,371
We'll have to try it now
or forget it.

725
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,166
Do it.
If there are
any compatibility problems--

726
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,961
Then we can abort.
This is our only chance.

727
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,755
JANEWAY:
Bridge to Engineering.

728
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,298
Torres here.

729
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,926
We're ready to leave orbit.
Thrusters on-line.

730
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,219
Aye, Captain.

731
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,513
We have to do something.

732
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:04,931
( beeping )

733
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,017
Mr. Paris,
take us out of orbit.

734
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,685
4,000 kph.

735
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,311
Aye, Captain.

736
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,441
There's no response.
Thrusters are off line.

737
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,653
Janeway to Engineering.
What's going on, Lieutenant?

738
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,115
We've got a phase variance
in plasma conduit 3.

739
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,826
I'll have to check it out before
we can engage thrusters.

740
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,619
When did this problem show up?

741
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,413
Just now, Captain.

742
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,874
It's only a slight variance.
I'll have it fixed in a minute.

743
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,709
Keep me advised.

744
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,629
All right.

745
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,007
The matrix is activating.

746
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,550
The trajector field is forming.

747
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,635
CAREY:
And it's amplifying.

748
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,804
Look how fast it's expanding.

749
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,556
That's the effect
of the quartz mantle.

750
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,433
We're nearly
at full field strength.

751
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,310
This is going to work.
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

752
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,773
What is it?

753
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,025
The plasma manifold
is becoming unstable.

754
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,818
I can compensate for that.

755
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,946
CAREY:
The manifold is being bombarded

756
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,448
by anti-neutrinos
from the trajector field.

757
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,991
Anti-neutrinos?

758
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,744
The must be the catalyst
for the space folding process.

759
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,328
It's not working.

760
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,289
I can't compensate
for the instability.

761
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,833
CAREY:
There's no way to compensate for
a field that size.

762
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,502
( deep thud )

763
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,632
Captain, I'm showing
an unstable plasma manifold.

764
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,134
We're headed for a breach.

765
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,010
Bridge to Torres.
What's happening?

766
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,597
We're reading
a warp core breach up here.

767
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,725
We're on it, Captain.
No time to talk.

768
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,269
Shut down the matrix!

769
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,979
I can't!
It's not responding!

770
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,396
CAREY:
It's fused!

771
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,732
Plasma temperature
at 43 million Kelvin!

772
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,901
Carey, get everybody out!

773
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,820
All right, people, let's go!
Right now!

774
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,362
Move it out!
Move out! Come on!

775
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,739
Let's go! Right now!

776
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,365
Let's go, come on!
Move it out! Fast!

777
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,202
Right now!
Keep moving!

778
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,829
I can't unlock it.

779
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,623
The command matrix is sealed.

780
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:57,585
Plasma temperature
at 50 million Kelvin!

781
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,799
Anti-neutrino
bombardment has stopped.

782
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,260
Plasma temperature
dropping.

783
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:19,232
We didn't anticipate
anti-neutrinos.

784
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,693
The trajector could
never be compatible

785
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,696
with Federation technology.

786
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,739
I'll start erasing
the sensor logs.

787
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,616
We can blame it
on the phase discrepancy.

788
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,451
No.

789
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,453
We're not going
to cover this up.

790
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,913
Are you crazy?

791
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,707
We don't have
to take the blame for this.

792
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,084
But we're going to.

793
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,088
We disobeyed orders,

794
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,008
gambling it would pay off.
It didn't.

795
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,635
And now we just can't pretend
like nothing happened.

796
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,387
I don't understand.

797
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,014
There's no need for this.

798
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,975
I'm sorry
if you don't get it, Seska,

799
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:57,270
but it has something
to do with, um...

800
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,438
with being able
to live with yourself.

801
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:02,859
That doesn't sound like you.

802
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,361
You've changed.

803
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,907
If that's true...

804
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,076
I take it as a compliment.

805
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,501
I take full responsibility
for what happened.

806
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,089
There were others involved,
but I was the Senior Officer,

807
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,216
and the culpability
is mine.

808
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:29,552
Lieutenant Torres is not
precisely correct, Captain.

809
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,680
She was not
the Senior Officer involved.

810
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,599
I was.

811
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,643
You?

812
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,105
It was I who made the exchange.

813
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:43,524
The Federation library
for the trajector matrix.

814
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,623
I will deal with you
in a moment.

815
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,379
I don't have the luxury
of throwing you in the brig

816
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,672
for the rest of this voyage.
I need you.

817
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:10,093
I need every person
on this ship.

818
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,222
But I want you to know

819
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,683
how very deeply
you have disappointed me.

820
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,898
If there are
any further transgressions,

821
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,734
even a minor one...

822
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:32,324
you will no longer
be an officer on this crew.

823
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,243
Is that clear?

824
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,745
Yes, ma'am.

825
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,500
Dismissed.

826
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,635
I don't even know
where to start.

827
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,681
I want you
to explain to me

828
00:41:56,681 --> 00:42:00,559
how you, of all people,
could be involved in this.

829
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,937
It is quite simple, Captain.

830
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,190
You have made it clear
on many occasions

831
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,108
that your highest goal
for the crew

832
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,068
is to get them home.

833
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,445
But in this instance,

834
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,571
your standards
would not allow you

835
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,407
to violate
Sikarian law.

836
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,909
Someone had to spare you
the ethical dilemma.

837
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,537
I was the logical choice,

838
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,540
and so I chose to act.

839
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,630
You did it for me...

840
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,925
because you knew I couldn't.

841
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,012
I accept the consequences
of my actions.

842
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,432
I expect to lose my commission
and to be court-martialed

843
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:42,185
when we return
to Federation space.

844
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,910
You are one of
my most valued officers...

845
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,996
and you are my friend.

846
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,583
It is vital that
you understand me here.

847
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,128
I need you.

848
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:15,009
But I also need to know
that I can count on you.

849
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,970
You are my counsel,

850
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,640
the one I turn to when I need
my moral compass checked.

851
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,977
We have forged
this relationship for years,

852
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,063
and I depend on it.

853
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,577
I realize you made
a sacrifice for me...

854
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,661
but it's not one

855
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:46,624
I would have allowed you
to make.

856
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,795
You can use logic
to justify almost anything.

857
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,798
That's its power...

858
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,508
and its flaw.

859
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,805
From now on...
bring your logic to me.

860
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,684
Don't act on it behind my back.

861
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,607
You have my word.

862
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:14,110
My logic was not in error...

863
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,404
but I was.

864
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,079
Dismissed.
