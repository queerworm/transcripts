1
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,638
Gedrin!

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,389
Gedrin!

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,477
(<i> coughing</i> )

4
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,524
(<i> coughing</i> )

5
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,567
What happened?
I lost you.

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,611
37 bio-pods were damaged.

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,531
I had to disconnect them
from the reactor.

8
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,157
Were they dead?

9
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,325
I had no choice.

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,536
(<i> both cough</i> )

11
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,041
The main power's holding.

12
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,628
The rest of the
bio-pods are secure,

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,881
and that leaves<i> us.</i>

14
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,719
Don't look so worried.
It'll be like a simple
night's sleep.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,928
(<i> loud rumbling</i> )

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,179
(<i> gasps</i> )

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,015
We're out of time.

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,766
Do you think we'll dream?

19
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,476
I don't know.

20
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,938
We'll get through this.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,065
What if there's
nothing left?

22
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,568
We'll start again.

23
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,905
Five years.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,034
(<i> beeping</i> )

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,535
(<i> gasps</i> )

26
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,285
Report.

27
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,245
We've entered some kind
of a subspace corridor.

28
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,915
We were cruising
at warp 6, then, wham.

29
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,543
This thing pulled at our
warp field like a magnet.

30
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,252
JANEWAY:
Where did that debris come from?

31
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,797
Unknown, but the corridor
is filled with it.

32
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,300
Metal fragments, plasma exhaust,
organic residue.

33
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,761
Some of the debris
is over 800 years old, Captain.

34
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,514
I'd like to avoid
becoming part of
this garbage stream.

35
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,975
Can you find a way out?
I don't know.

36
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,394
There's hundreds
of corridors.
It's like a maze.

37
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,855
Well, be a good rat and
find us the cheese, hmm?

38
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,024
I'll do my best, Captain.

39
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,319
Tuvok?

40
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,988
It was a vessel, sir.

41
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,198
They are hailing us.

42
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,448
Put it through.

43
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,995
Who are you?

44
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,081
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Starship<i> Voyager</i>

45
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,498
and you are...?

46
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,959
This under-space belongs to us.

47
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,503
We're here by accident.
We're trying to find a way out.

48
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,629
Can you help us?

49
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,339
Help you?

50
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,384
Yes. We'll help you.

51
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,180
They are targeting our shields
with a resonance pulse.

52
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,848
It's altering the harmonics.

53
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,475
We're being pushed
out of the corridor.

54
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,269
(<i> rumbling</i> )

55
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,023
We're clear.

56
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,609
The vessel has exited
the corridor as well.

57
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,820
Captain, we're over
200 light-years

58
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,321
from where we entered
the corridor.

59
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,407
200 light-years in five minutes?

60
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,576
Hail them.

61
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,788
Thank you for your help.
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

62
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,372
We've got a long
journey ahead of us,

63
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,125
and I was wondering
if we could negotiate

64
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,252
passage through
this under-space of yours.

65
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,587
Lower your shields.
Prepare to be boarded.

66
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,839
Boarded? For what reason?

67
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,758
We must purge your computer.

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,177
Remove all readings you've
gathered in our territory.

69
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,971
We pose no threat to you.
We're simply trying to...

70
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,098
We're going to destroy
that information

71
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,767
one way or another.

72
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,560
Lower your shields.

73
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,146
I won't do that.

74
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,318
Evasive maneuvers.

75
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,945
Try to
disable them.

76
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,863
Their vessel is
highly maneuverable.

77
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,949
It's difficult to get
a phaser lock.

78
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,951
Picking up two more ships
heading our way.

79
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,329
Direct hit. Our warp
drive is off-line.

80
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,415
Shields down to 82 percent.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,669
60 percent.
They're closing.

82
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,297
We could use some
clever suggestions
about now.

83
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,299
There's a planet
eight million
kilometers ahead--

84
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,092
uninhabited--
but the atmosphere

85
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,927
is charged
with radiogenic particles.

86
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,137
How radiogenic?

87
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,639
3,000 isorems.

88
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,183
If we route enough power
to the shields,

89
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,558
we can survive in that,

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,893
but maybe
our friends can't.

91
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,729
Shields at 53 percent.

92
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,648
Do it.

93
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,990
Entering
the thermosphere.

94
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,450
Radiation levels at 3,000
isorems and climbing.

95
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,994
CHAKOTAY:
The alien ships?

96
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,288
TUVOK: In pursuit
and charging weapons.

97
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,372
Increase our
descent vector.

98
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,211
They're still closing.

99
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,464
Direct hit to our aft shields.

100
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,508
Find the highest
concentration of radiation,

101
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,260
and take us through it.

102
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,347
Proximity radiation
at 4,000 isorems...

103
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,848
5,000...

104
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,643
Six.
Their shields are weakening.

105
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,478
They're breaking off.

106
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
Now... all we need

107
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,524
is a place to set down
and make repairs. Tom?

108
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,110
We're clearing
the lower stratosphere.

109
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,071
On screen.

110
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,702
I thought you said
this planet was uninhabited.

111
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,996
The radiation must have
interfered with my scans.

112
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,040
I doubt it's inhabited anymore.
Looks like this planet

113
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,875
is in the middle
of a nuclear winter.

114
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,295
Agreed. Gamma radiation levels
are highly toxic.

115
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,798
The impact crater suggests
an orbital bombardment.

116
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,550
How long ago?

117
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,636
From the rate of radiogenic
decay... 892 years.

118
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,765
This must have been
a city of millions.

119
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,600
Set us down.

120
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,160
Disengaging engines.

121
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,205
Stand down Red Alert.
Assign damage repair teams,

122
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,291
and, Tom, make sure B'Elanna
has enough help in Engineering.

123
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,210
I want those warp
engines back on line.
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,296
Our "friends"
are still in orbit.

125
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,923
Circling like vultures.
Well, they're going
to go hungry.

126
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,009
Not if they find a way
to adapt their shields
and come down after us.

127
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,387
Captain... I'm detecting
faint life signs

128
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,223
coming from a chamber
several hundred meters
beneath the surface.

129
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,474
Survivors?

130
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,268
After 900 years?

131
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,188
Oversee the repair teams.
You're going down there?

132
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,899
If somebody survived
this catastrophe,
they might need our help.

133
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,525
Get a good fix
on those coordinates.

134
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,902
I don't want to beam
into solid rock.

135
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,113
Seven, Tuvok, you're with me.

136
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,633
These walls have been reinforced
with tritonium.

137
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,885
They built this place to last.

138
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,398
Most of the power relays
are still active.

139
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,733
Not bad
after nine centuries.

140
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,777
The main reactor
is drawing energy

141
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,071
from the planet's
geothermal core.

142
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,572
Efficient.

143
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,636
Some kind
of stasis pod.

144
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,602
(<i> computer beeping</i> )

145
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,732
This display indicates
that there are more chambers
behind these walls.

146
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,317
Some of them have failed.

147
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,444
It's amazing
they survived at all.

148
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,071
Let's see what else we can find.

149
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,436
Seven?

150
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,104
What are
you doing?

151
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,523
I've activated
the reanimation sequence.

152
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,400
He may be able to
provide us with answers.

153
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,651
We don't know anything
about this species.

154
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,112
They could be hostile.

155
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,281
Most humanoid cultures are.

156
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,117
Remind me to reacquaint you
with away mission protocols.

157
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,879
Who?

158
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,214
It's all right.

159
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,715
We're not your enemy.

160
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,675
We're from a starship.

161
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,429
We discovered
this chamber
and revived you.

162
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,265
How long was I...?

163
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,100
In stasis?

164
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,394
Close to 900 years.

165
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,855
900?

166
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,234
Jisa.

167
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,737
Help her, please.

168
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,132
No, Jisa.

169
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,428
She was my wife.

170
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,113
I won't hurt you.

171
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,369
I was drifting in and out
of consciousness when
they brought me here,

172
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,704
but I thought I saw you
appear out of thin air.

173
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,707
I'm a computer program,
a hologram.

174
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,588
And the others?

175
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,090
Flesh and blood,
like yourself.

176
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,387
You're the ones
that took me
out of stasis.

177
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,972
I don't recognize
your species.

178
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,851
Human. Our home planet
is halfway across the galaxy.

179
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,146
And you've expanded
your territory
into this space?

180
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,649
Our ship was
brought here by accident.

181
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,693
We're trying to get home.

182
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,028
You're Borg.

183
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,697
How do you know that?

184
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:22,200
Don't you recognize
my people, the Vaadwaur?

185
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,744
The collective's memory
from 900 years ago
is fragmentary.

186
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,332
I've had many encounters
with your kind.

187
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,251
And lived
to tell about them?

188
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,712
Impressive.

189
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,380
How did you find us?

190
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,924
We needed someplace
to hide from the Turei,

191
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,511
after they found us in one
of their subspace corridors.

192
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,180
<i>Their</i> corridors?
So they claimed.

193
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,267
The corridors were ours.
It took centuries
to map them.

194
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,437
We were the envy
of a hundred species,
including the Turei.

195
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,939
Are they responsible
for what happened
to your planet?

196
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,691
The Turei and
a dozen others.

197
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,568
What one couldn't
accomplish,

198
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,152
the others finally did.

199
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:06,244
I... would like to look
at what's left of my world.

200
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,624
We made our
final stand there.

201
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,333
I've scanned the caverns.

202
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,835
You've got a thousand more
stasis pods down there--

203
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,879
most of them still active.

204
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,676
Hundreds of ships,
land vehicles... weapons.

205
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,844
A single battalion
and their families.

206
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,514
We had planned to
come out of stasis
after five years.

207
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:30,351
We believed that by then,
the alliance would have been
at each other's throats.

208
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,811
You were going to rebuild?
No, not here.

209
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,898
We knew this planet
would be poisoned
for centuries.

210
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,692
We were planning
to go to another world,

211
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,987
start a colony,
hope to find new allies,

212
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,781
learn from them.

213
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,658
Your power core is
still functioning.

214
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,034
It was the controls
that were damaged
in the attack.

215
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,287
That's why you never
came out of stasis.

216
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,247
Jisa and I
lived there

217
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,416
in the old quarter.
We had a garden

218
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,126
overlooking the street below.

219
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,003
It's a shame
she didn't show

220
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,005
more courage
at the end.

221
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,341
Given the circumstances...

222
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,009
Well, that's no excuse.

223
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,053
Pardon me
for saying this,

224
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,930
but that seems
a bit heartless.

225
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,850
When it rains,
do you run from
doorway to doorway,

226
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,937
trying to stay dry,
getting wet all the while,

227
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,649
or do you just accept
the fact that it's raining

228
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,526
and walk with dignity?

229
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,069
Rain's one thing.
Plasma bombs are
something else.

230
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,572
But the principle is the same.

231
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,202
I'd bring an umbrella.

232
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,456
Maybe it's not too late

233
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,710
to meet a new ally
and learn from her.

234
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,504
I took the liberty
of preparing a large assortment

235
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,464
of Delta Quadrant dishes.

236
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,883
Hopefully, there's something
here that you'll like.

237
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,635
You're Talax-ilzay.

238
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,847
Talaxian, but you're right.

239
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,851
My ancestors referred
to themselves as Talax-ilzay

240
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,561
in the Old Tongue.

241
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,271
The Old Tongue was new
when I met your race.

242
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,273
You traveled
all the way to Talaxia?

243
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:03,152
And farther.
Our corridors took us
to many worlds.

244
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,072
I'm curious.
Have you heard of us,
the Vaadwaur?

245
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:10,535
Oh, I'm afraid there aren't
many records from that period,

246
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,996
but<i> Vaadwaur</i> is a word
in the Old Tongue.

247
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,207
It means, uh, "foolish."

248
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,295
I'm, uh, I'm sure that it's, uh,
just a coincidence, of course.

249
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,215
I... I didn't mean to be rude.

250
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,008
Your ancestors were wise.

251
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,722
Only fools would let
this happen to them.

252
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,852
Chakotay to Captain Janeway.
Go ahead.

253
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,145
Looks like our friends in orbit
have found us.

254
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,231
We're on our way.

255
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,486
Report.
Six Turei vessels
are in orbit,

256
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,906
all firing
plasma charges.

257
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,366
That was 2,000 meters
to starboard.

258
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,827
KIM: Looks like they
can't get an exact fix
on our position.

259
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,830
The radiogenic atmosphere
must be disrupting
their targeting.

260
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,208
TUVOK: 900 meters.
PARIS: They're getting closer.

261
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,668
JANEWAY:
Can we return fire?

262
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,002
CHAKOTAY: We have
the same problem.

263
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,630
Our torpedoes
won't lock on.

264
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,005
TUVOK:
Direct hit.

265
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,966
Aft shields down to 18 percent.

266
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,595
Captain, can you
transmit a signal
through this atmosphere?

267
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,263
We've already tried
talking to them.

268
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,890
I have no intention of
speaking with the Turei.

269
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,934
We put a sentry
satellite in orbit

270
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,184
directly above
the city.

271
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,519
You could use
its sensors

272
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,062
to help guide
your torpedoes.

273
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,942
It's there,
intact and functional.

274
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,861
GEDRIN:
Open a channel.

275
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,614
I'll give you
the activation code.

276
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,120
I'm a few centuries out of date.

277
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,998
You can enter
the activation code here.

278
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,419
It's processing
our telemetry.

279
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,838
Triangulate.

280
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,299
Fire.

281
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,926
Direct hit.

282
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,011
The lead ship
has lost shields.

283
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,471
Its propulsion
is down.

284
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,055
One more torpedo
will finish them.

285
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,099
The other ships are retreating.

286
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,935
Captain, why don't you
keep firing?

287
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,979
We've scared them off.
That's enough for now.

288
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,063
But they'll come back
with twice as many ships.

289
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,900
With any luck,
our warp drive will be
back on line by then.

290
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,068
The Turei may
be cowards,

291
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,030
but their technology has become
much more advanced than ours.

292
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:15,075
If you leave us,
we will be slaughtered again.

293
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,661
What do you propose?

294
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,956
Help us off this planet,

295
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:24,126
and we will show you
subspace corridors
known to nobody else.

296
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,880
You will be free from the Turei,

297
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,131
and you will be
a thousand light-years

298
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,175
closer to your home.

299
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,349
Let's wake up
your battalion.

300
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,086
Dragon's teeth.

301
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,462
JANEWAY:
"Dragon's teeth"?

302
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,881
An old Greek myth.

303
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,091
After a dragon
was killed in a war,

304
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:16,095
its teeth were spread out
over the battlefield.

305
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,513
They took root,

306
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,807
and warriors sprung
from the ground

307
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,475
to continue the fighting.

308
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,651
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

309
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,071
<i>We've revived</i>
<i>nearly 200 of the Vaadwaur,</i>

310
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,575
<i>and we're moving forward</i>
<i>with our unexpected alliance.</i>

311
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,326
<i>Voyager </i> was pulled
into the corridor,

312
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,162
200 light-years from here.
Pulled in?

313
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,206
There must have been a break
along the radial wall.

314
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,793
The corridors occur
naturally, but they're
very unstable.

315
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,544
They're
damaged by use.

316
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,337
Obviously, the Turei
don't have the wisdom

317
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,172
to maintain them properly.

318
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,258
They'll be very difficult

319
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,260
to navigate after
centuries of neglect.

320
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,638
We've only been able to chart
a few of the corridors.

321
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,640
Can you provide us
with a more complete map?

322
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,893
We've never kept
written records
for security reasons.

323
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,354
Of course, we've
committed all the
corridors to memory--

324
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,816
every multifold,
every spatial intersect.

325
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,442
We'll be happy to plot
a course for you,

326
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,153
but first, we'll need
to get past the Turei.

327
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,406
How many vessels
are in orbit?
Eleven.

328
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,617
Mr. Gaul, Tuvok, start working
on a tactical plan.

329
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,995
If we do manage
to escape,

330
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,371
we'll need to locate
a habitable world.

331
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,666
Seven, scan
the astrometric database.

332
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,752
See what you can find.
Someplace out of the way.
Yes, Captain.

333
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,672
Morin, take charge of reviving
the rest of our battalion.

334
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,675
Many of our bio-pods have
been damaged. I could
use some assistance.

335
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,969
JANEWAY:
Our Chief Engineer will be
glad to give you a hand.

336
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,178
Thank you.

337
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,763
Well, let's get started.

338
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,974
We've got a civilization
to rebuild.

339
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,780
No story tonight, Naomi.

340
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,282
I had to cook
for 200 people today.

341
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,869
That's okay.
I'm tired, too.

342
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,166
Did you get a chance
to meet any of the children?

343
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,709
I don't like them.

344
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,461
Why not?

345
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,421
I just don't.

346
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,632
Well, that's
not good enough.

347
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,592
I'm the ship's Ambassador.

348
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,011
You're the Captain's Assistant.

349
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,470
We have to make
a-a good impression

350
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,222
on our new friends.

351
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,307
They're not
<i>my</i> friends.

352
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,894
Well... not yet.

353
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,480
Listen... first thing tomorrow,
you and I will get together

354
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,440
with a couple
of the children...

355
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,692
No.

356
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,821
Naomi, what's wrong?

357
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,865
Nothing.
I don't like them,

358
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,825
and I don't want
to play with them.

359
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,495
That doesn't sound like you.

360
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,122
Tell me what happened.

361
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,500
They called
you names.

362
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,836
Names?

363
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,380
They said everybody from
your planet was stupid.

364
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,216
They said your
ears were funny.

365
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,551
They said just looking
at you made them laugh.

366
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,761
They said...

367
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,680
I-I-I... I get the idea.

368
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,892
Children can be
a little cruel sometimes,

369
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,770
but there's no need
to take it personally.

370
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,066
Besides, my ears<i> are</i>
kind of funny.

371
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,778
I don't want
to play with them.

372
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,907
Well... and you don't have to.

373
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,117
Okay.

374
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,492
Come on.

375
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,081
Good night.

376
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,501
I'll tell you
a story tomorrow, I promise.

377
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,806
I'm not happy with
these fluctuations.

378
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,809
We may be trying
to reactivate
too many ships at once.

379
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,770
I suggest we focus
on the assault fighters.

380
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,316
<i>Qual tel t'pok.</i>

381
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,027
Thanks.

382
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,946
When did you learn Klingon?

383
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:05,324
Just a few phrases.
I was studying
your database.

384
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,451
The Klingons are
a noble race.

385
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,870
They have their moments.

386
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,331
"Today is a good
day to die."

387
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,749
Pardon?

388
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,668
Kahless, your
greatest warrior.

389
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,920
That was his battle cry.

390
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,798
You seem to have
taken an interest
in Klingon history.

391
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,092
There are many parallels
between our cultures.

392
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,927
The Vaadwaur
have also learned

393
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,596
to embrace death
without fear.

394
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:31,058
As children, we're taught
to fall asleep each night

395
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,435
imagining a different
way to die.

396
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,647
I prefer curling up
with a good book.

397
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,940
Hmm.

398
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,653
(<i> sighs</i> )

399
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,240
Computer,
access my personal database.

400
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,076
COMPUTER:
Access established.

401
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,705
Go into the Talaxian
linguistic files,

402
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,875
Old Tongue dialect.

403
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,837
Find and define
the word<i> "Vaadwaur."</i>

404
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,673
<i>Vaadwaur: archaic adjective.</i>

405
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,717
Primary meaning: foolish.

406
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:09,471
Additional meanings:
Weak-minded, reckless, blind.

407
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,726
What's the first known usage?

408
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,728
First written example
appears

409
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,855
in Eldaxon's
<i>Collected Folklore,</i>

410
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,481
Second Edition.

411
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:23,861
Year of publication,
5012, New Calendar.

412
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,699
(<i> sighs</i> )

413
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,160
Computer,
name the specific folktales

414
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,787
that use the word "Vaadwaur."

415
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,874
"The Demon
with the Golden Voice,"

416
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,919
"The Tale
of the Deadly Stranger,"

417
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,547
"The Tale of the Boy
Who Lost His Head,"

418
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,842
"The Tale of the Bloody Hand."

419
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,054
Not exactly Mother Goose.

420
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:55,017
Computer, transfer the text
of those stories to my quarters.

421
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,810
Transfer complete.

422
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,814
That star cluster
in Grid 1421?

423
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,276
Nearly half the planets
are inhabitable.

424
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,778
Unfortunately, they
are already occupied

425
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,280
by the Borg.

426
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,156
The Borg?

427
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,367
In my century,
they'd only assimilated

428
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,078
a handful of systems.

429
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,331
It looks like they've
spread through the Quadrant
like a plague.

430
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,542
No offense.

431
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,253
None taken.

432
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:27,341
We had a colony near
the twin star in Grid 315.

433
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,760
That is part of the
Devore Imperium now.

434
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,220
And who are they?

435
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,805
An authoritarian regime.

436
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,349
They claim 11 systems
across three sectors.

437
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,019
I don't suppose they'd
be willing to negotiate
for a continent or two.

438
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,021
The Devore are
intolerant of outsiders.

439
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,732
Well, it doesn't matter.
We have nothing
to negotiate with.

440
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,944
Our technology is 900
years out of date.

441
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,696
Your pessimism
is irrelevant.

442
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,366
We will find a home
for you.

443
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,161
I hope you're right.

444
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,830
16 Turei vessels
are now in orbit.

445
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,000
Long-range sensors
indicate five more on the way.

446
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,918
I can understand
that they want the
odds in their favor,

447
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,420
but isn't
that overkill?

448
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,255
They may have
detected<i> us.</i>

449
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:09,008
If they know their history,
they'll come prepared.

450
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,136
900 years is a long time
to hold a grudge.

451
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,971
The Turei would
like nothing more

452
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,098
than to find the rest of
our subspace corridors.

453
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,934
We can't allow that
to happen.

454
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:22,021
Then I suggest
we use the element of surprise.

455
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,065
At 0600,<i> Voyager</i>
will leave the surface

456
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,109
and engage the Turei ships
in orbit.

457
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,528
As we draw their fire,
the more powerful
Vaadwaur vessels

458
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,698
will attack
from multiple vectors.

459
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,783
The rest of the Vaadwaur
will break orbit

460
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,452
from the opposite side
of the planet

461
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,371
and proceed
to the subspace corridors.

462
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,373
We'll rendezvous
with them afterwards.

463
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,000
What if <i> Voyager</i> is disabled?
We'll be defenseless.

464
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,461
If we armed
my ships with your
photon torpedoes...

465
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,796
I can't authorize that.
Why not?

466
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,966
Starfleet protocols are
very strict about the
transfer of weapons.

467
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,469
I'm not used to putting my life
into someone else's hands.

468
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,429
There are a lot of things you're
going to have to get used to.

469
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,681
We've faced enemies
worse than the Turei.

470
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,350
I'm confident
we can handle them.

471
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,893
I need those weapons.

472
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,895
I'm sorry.
The answer's no.

473
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,980
If you want access
to our corridors...

474
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,941
We'll continue home
through open space
if we have to.

475
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:14,323
All right. Our lives
are in your hands.

476
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,786
We've found a planet
in a nebula

477
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,123
near the junction
of Corridors 39 and 875.

478
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,418
We'd be isolated
and relatively safe.

479
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,960
"Relatively"?

480
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,088
I'm afraid the planet
is somewhat harsh.

481
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,797
There are no large
bodies of water,

482
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,758
and the vegetation is sparse.
This is absurd!

483
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,677
Ensign, we need a power coupling
over here, on the double.

484
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,849
Our plan was
to reoccupy one of
our former colonies,

485
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,351
gain allies,
rebuild our forces--

486
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,270
take back what
was ours!

487
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,147
Our former colonies
are destroyed or were occupied

488
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,066
by species that are
far more advanced than we are.

489
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,193
Then we'll find a way
to take them back.

490
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,905
With what? A battalion
of obsolete ships
and outdated weapons?

491
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,699
No...
with<i> Voyager.</i>

492
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,911
I've been studying
their technology--

493
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,456
the control systems,
propulsion, weaponry.

494
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,874
We could learn to operate
the vessel ourselves.

495
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,251
What are you saying?

496
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,420
After they engage
the Turei,

497
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:12,256
they'll expect us
to assist them.
Instead, we'll attack.

498
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,007
We'll put as many
soldiers as we can

499
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,093
onto<i> Voyager</i> 
and take it into
the corridors!

500
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,929
This is a mistake.
If we fail,
we'll lose everything.

501
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,516
If you'd like,
I can return you
to your stasis pod.

502
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,393
Inform the others.

503
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,192
This is an M-Class planet
in orbit of a Type-G star.

504
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,487
We've located a continent
with edible vegetation

505
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,489
and an underground
water supply.

506
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,492
Unfortunately, the
region is subject
to windstorms.

507
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,909
Not exactly paradise.

508
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,496
You will adapt.

509
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:47,249
Practical
and to the point--
just like my wife.

510
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,209
She had a knack
for cutting to the truth.

511
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,504
She must have been
an efficient individual.

512
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,798
Ah, to say the least.
You would have enjoyed
her company.

513
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,011
You are not at all
like the Borg I knew.

514
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,055
As a drone,

515
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,184
I helped assimilate
many civilizations.

516
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:09,355
Now I have the opportunity
to help reconstruct one.

517
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,857
I find the experience...

518
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,900
gratifying.

519
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,569
So do I.

520
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,948
I'm curious--

521
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,411
has your crew ever considered
finding a planet of their own,

522
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,580
a place to settle down?

523
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,248
Captain Janeway
is committed

524
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,916
to getting<i> Voyager</i>
back to Earth.

525
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,960
That could take decades...

526
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,712
and there are
many dangers ahead.

527
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,714
We will adapt.

528
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,426
I suppose you will.

529
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,054
Neelix to Seven of Nine.
Yes?

530
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,349
Could I see you in Cargo Bay 2?
It's important.

531
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,309
Acknowledged.

532
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,728
I'm due for a final briefing
with your Mr. Tuvok.

533
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,897
I'll accompany you
to the Bridge.

534
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,161
I'm sorry to bother you,

535
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,955
but I've been doing
some research on our new allies,

536
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,166
and I have found something
very interesting.

537
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,711
In dozens of the ancient
folktales of my people,

538
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,671
there's a common theme.

539
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:19,341
They describe a phantom army
that appears out of thin air,

540
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,301
destroys entire colonies,

541
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,929
and vanishes in the blink
of an eye.

542
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,514
Sound familiar?

543
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,558
The subspace corridors.

544
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,310
Exactly!
Gedrin claims

545
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,354
they've been using them
as trade routes,

546
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,273
but I'm starting to wonder.

547
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,109
Your source material is
folktales, Mr. Neelix.

548
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,486
But many fables have
a basis in reality.

549
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:43,073
You've got
the collective knowledge
of thousands of species.

550
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,825
You could cross-reference
my findings.

551
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,995
It'll only take a few minutes.

552
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,844
(<i> door chimes</i> )

553
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,388
Come in.

554
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,600
You wanted to see me, Captain?

555
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,478
Yes.

556
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,565
I need a little history lesson.

557
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,693
Can't it... wait until after
we've reached the corridors?

558
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,320
I'm afraid not.

559
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,447
I've just had a conversation

560
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,658
with Mr. Neelix
and Seven of Nine.

561
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,410
They've been poring through
various databases

562
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:32,831
and have come up with
some surprising findings.
Surprising?

563
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,375
You told me the Vaadwaur
were a culture

564
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,127
of merchants
and scientists,

565
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,796
who expanded
their knowledge

566
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,756
by using subspace
corridors

567
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,509
to travel to
other worlds.

568
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,052
You were the envy of
hundreds of species,

569
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,473
some of whom eventually
wanted the corridors
for themselves.

570
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,437
Your point?

571
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,815
Let me give you another
version of events.

572
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,987
The Vaadwaur were
an aggressive culture,

573
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,989
who expanded
their territory

574
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,409
by using the corridors
to attack other worlds...

575
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,745
until some of those
worlds banded together

576
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,123
to defend themselves
and put an end to
the Vaadwaur threat

577
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,875
once and for all.

578
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,752
Would you care to set
the record straight?

579
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,463
That was 900 years ago.

580
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,174
If we're going to be
fighting side-by-side,

581
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,259
I have to trust you.

582
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,179
I need to be certain
you don't have any
ulterior motives.

583
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,724
Our only motive is survival.

584
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,059
If I were to take you
at your word,

585
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,103
the ancient Talaxians
might call me<i> Vaadwaur--</i>

586
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,731
"foolish."

587
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,691
That's what they
came to call anyone

588
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,443
who allowed themselves
to be deceived by an enemy.

589
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,572
There are hundreds of other
references just like it.

590
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:51,243
Both versions of our history
are true.

591
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,537
We did use the corridors
to explore,

592
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,289
and, on occasion,
expand our territory,

593
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,544
but, Captain, we have gone
from a population
of six billion to 600.

594
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,004
Our weapons are archaic.

595
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,674
Do you really think that
we are prepared to declare war

596
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,300
on the Delta Quadrant?

597
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,135
Not yet,
but right now,

598
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,555
it's <i> Voyager</i> 
I'm worried about.

599
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:15,058
The Turei are going
to be firing everything
they've got at my ship.

600
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,519
You might try
to take advantage of that.

601
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,313
What are you going to do--
put us all back into stasis?

602
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,859
We said we'd try to help you
make a new start,

603
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,612
and I want to keep that promise,

604
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,823
but I can't ignore history,
Mr. Gedrin.

605
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,796
Make yourself comfortable,
Mr. Gedrin.

606
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,091
Chakotay...

607
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,385
(<i> quietly</i> ):
I don't know whether
to believe him or not.

608
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,054
What I wouldn't give
for a Betazoid about now.

609
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,515
If Mr. Neelix is right,
we should be ready
for anything.

610
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,559
Their technology
may be outdated,

611
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,144
but it can still do
a lot of damage.

612
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,188
Agreed.
Maintain a full
security alert

613
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,357
and have Tuvok keep
a weapons lock

614
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,234
on their primary
reactor.

615
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,403
Are we still proceeding
at 0600 hours?

616
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:11,490
Yes, but with a few
modifications.

617
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,910
What's Mr. Gaul's location?

618
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,245
He's in the
Central Chamber.

619
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,997
Hail him.

620
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,417
Captain, we've reactivated
73 assault vessels.

621
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,210
Our pilots are standing by.

622
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:28,548
I need to inform you
about a change of plan.

623
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,011
I want you to deactivate
the particle cannons

624
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,430
on all but ten of
your assault vessels.

625
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,015
Then we'll proceed
on schedule.

626
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,892
I don't understand.

627
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,854
Only ten of your ships
are going to engage the Turei.

628
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,565
The others will head directly
for the subspace corridors.

629
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,901
I see no reason
for those to be armed.

630
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,904
Something could go wrong.
Why leave them defenseless?

631
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,616
<i>Voyager</i> will
defend them.

632
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,493
What prompted this change?

633
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,913
You haven't been completely
honest about your past,

634
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,249
and that makes me a little
uncertain about the present.

635
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,628
Gedrin.

636
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,839
I suggest you listen to her.

637
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,966
Request denied, Captain.

638
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,551
It's not a request.

639
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,303
You can call it an ultimatum
if you like.

640
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,638
Unacceptable.

641
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,139
I'm going to leave this planet

642
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,225
in one hour with or without you.

643
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:25,313
We did not spend 900 years in
stasis to take orders from you.

644
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,944
Contact the battalion.

645
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,071
Tell them to prepare
for the attack.

646
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,450
I don't know about
the rest of you, but I'm
ready to get moving.

647
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,829
What's our status?
Impulse engines are on line.

648
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,331
Shields at maximum.
Weapons standing by.

649
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,751
Tom, prepare to initiate
the ascent sequence in...

650
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,419
CHAKOTAY:
Report.

651
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,837
Massive energy readings

652
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,171
coming from the Central Chamber.

653
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,798
It's the Vaadwaur.

654
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,717
They're launching
the first wave of ships.

655
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,011
17 vessels
have broken through
the surface.

656
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:59,806
They're at an altitude of
2,000 meters and
charging weapons.

657
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,893
Ma'am, they're not ascending
into orbit.

658
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,353
They're heading straight
for<i> Voyager.</i>

659
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,737
Tom?

660
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,238
Engaging thrusters.

661
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,032
Initiating ascent sequence.

662
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:20,077
Vaadwaur ships approaching
off our starboard bow.

663
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,873
Target phasers,
full spread.

664
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:29,002
(<i> rumbling</i> )
We're airborne.

665
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,964
What altitude do we need
on this planet, Tom,
before we can go to warp?

666
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,632
We'll have to clear
the thermosphere.

667
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,842
280 kilometers at least.

668
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,264
Shields at 92 percent.

669
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,682
Phasers.

670
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,568
We've disabled
four of their ships.

671
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,737
They've launched
another 39 vessels.

672
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,530
Evasive maneuvers.

673
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,951
It's no use.
They're closing
on all sides.

674
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,120
Direct hit to
the port thrusters.

675
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,997
We're losing altitude.
Reroute emergency power.

676
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,457
We need to get into orbit.

677
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,752
Targeting sensors off-line.
Switching to manual.

678
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,463
Harry, can you open
a secure channel

679
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,298
to the Turei ships
in orbit?

680
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,050
Yes, ma'am, but that
would give away our position.

681
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,927
They could lock on
with plasma charges.

682
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,720
I think it's time we reacquaint
a couple of old friends.

683
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,305
Hail them.

684
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,808
<i>Voyager's</i> shields
are weakening,

685
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,351
but they're gaining
altitude again.

686
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,727
They're approaching
the thermosphere.

687
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,187
Launch another squadron.

688
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,447
We've got nine more fighters
on our tail.

689
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,950
Aft shields down to 20 percent.

690
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,660
Captain, the Turei
are responding.

691
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,245
Put them through.

692
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,041
What do you want?
I've got a proposition
for you.

693
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,626
No more talk.
Prepare to be boarded.

694
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,212
Tell me, have you
been picking up weapons fire?

695
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:58,842
We have detected some unusual
energy signatures, yes.

696
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,679
That's because
we're under attack
by the Vaadwaur.

697
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,058
Impossible.
They were destroyed
centuries ago.

698
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,518
Some of us have survived.

699
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,812
JANEWAY:
They've got over 200 ships.

700
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,481
They said something
about wanting their
subspace corridors back.

701
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,942
I suggest we
join forces

702
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,403
and try to neutralize
the threat here and now.

703
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,030
What's more
important to you?

704
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,865
Deleting the records
of a Federation ship

705
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,825
that means you no harm,
or defending yourselves

706
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,702
against hundreds
of Vaadwaur fighters

707
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,704
who are determined to
invade your under-space?

708
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,664
I suggest you
pick your enemy.

709
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,624
Our sensors can't penetrate
the atmosphere.

710
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,668
How can we fight
an enemy we can't see?

711
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,504
We have access to one
of their surveillance
satellites.

712
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,382
We could use it
to transmit their vital
coordinates to you.

713
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,177
If this is a deception...

714
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,970
I'm having trouble establishing
a link with the satellite.

715
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,889
Our sensor array
took heavy damage.

716
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,225
I could access it
from the underground
control chamber.

717
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,684
Transport me there.

718
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,898
Not all of my people
are stuck in the past, Captain.

719
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,525
Tuvok, go with him.

720
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,364
MORIN:
We've impacted their hull.

721
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,408
There are breaches in
progress on two decks.

722
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,161
They'll have to reroute power
from their shields to seal them.

723
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,829
They'll have no choice
but to put down.

724
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,497
Have our ground
forces ready.

725
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,841
(<i> grunts</i> )

726
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,807
We've lost impulse
engines and navigation.

727
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,475
PARIS:
Thrusters are failing.

728
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,810
We're losing altitude.

729
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,103
Tuvok, status.

730
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,520
Tuvok?

731
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,274
KIM:
I've lost
his signal.

732
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,567
All hands, this is the Captain.

733
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,863
Initiate
emergency landing procedures
and arm yourselves.

734
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,074
If the Vaadwaur board this ship,

735
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,618
we'll fight them hand-to-hand
if we have to.

736
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,371
Once we've
secured <i> Voyager,</i>
execute the crew.

737
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,583
Wait! We have hundreds
of bio-pods still intact.

738
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,003
Put them into stasis.
In a few hundred years,

739
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,797
maybe someone
will be kind enough
to revive<i> them.</i>

740
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:03,466
What is that?!

741
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,136
It's a plasma charge.

742
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,637
It came from orbit.

743
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,975
It's the Turei. They've
isolated our location.
How?!

744
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,060
One of the surveillance
satellites has been activated.

745
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,895
Shut it down!

746
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,857
They're blocking my commands.

747
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,818
I'm rotating
the carrier frequencies.

748
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,611
(<i> gasps</i> )

749
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,158
The chamber
is destabilizing.
We must evacuate.

750
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,994
No, not yet. If we're going
to succeed, I need to transmit

751
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,872
the signatures of our fighters
to the Turei.

752
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,290
You go.

753
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,052
Six Vaadwaur ships were just
destroyed by the Turei.

754
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,137
The others are breaking off
their attack.

755
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,972
Impulse engines?
Still off-line.

756
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,307
How about emergency power?

757
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,059
Barely enough for life-support.

758
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,602
Harry, the radiogenic particles
in the atmosphere--

759
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,771
could we use them
as a power source?

760
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,024
Well, we'd have to modify the
warp core's conversion matrix.

761
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,235
It could take hours.
What if we drew the particles

762
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,903
directly into
our plasma manifold?

763
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,738
That would give us
one hell of a boost.

764
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,656
It could also blow out
every power relay
on the ship.

765
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,159
Damned if we do;
damned if we don't.

766
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,245
Open the forward
nacelle ports

767
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,205
and reverse
the pressure gradient.

768
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,916
Take in 600 kilograms.

769
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,964
The chamber's collapsing, sir!

770
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,718
We'll take as many ships
as we can.

771
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,804
Try to reach the
subspace corridor!

772
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,099
(<i> grunting</i> )

773
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,525
(<i> groans</i> )

774
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,528
Particle concentration
at 3,000 parts per million.

775
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,239
Release the manifold.

776
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:54,077
Rerouting plasma to
the power conduits.

777
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,661
We have impulse.

778
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,330
Take us up.

779
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,256
KIM:
13 power relays just
blew out on Deck 6.

780
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,924
JANEWAY:
Steady.

781
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,759
PARIS:
We're crossing
the thermosphere.

782
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,594
JANEWAY:
Any sign of pursuit?

783
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,139
None. Looks like the Vaadwaur
have their hands full.

784
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,015
JANEWAY:
Altitude?

785
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,518
260 kilometers, 270...

786
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,020
(<i> console beeps</i> )

787
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,855
We've cleared
the thermosphere.

788
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,190
Go to warp, Mr. Paris.

789
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,234
Yes, ma'am.

790
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:45,044
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53167.9.</i>

791
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,255
<i>After two days,</i>
<i>there's been no sign</i>

792
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,507
<i>of the Vaadwaur</i>
<i>or the Turei.</i>

793
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:53,386
<i>However,</i>
<i>Seven of Nine has made</i>
<i>an unsettling discovery.</i>

794
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,972
How many ships?

795
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,932
Astrometric scans detected

796
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,518
53 ion signatures
entering the corridors--

797
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,604
all Vaadwaur.
The underground chambers?

798
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,649
They were destroyed
by the Turei bombardment.

799
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,698
Captain...

800
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,328
I believe I made
an error in judgment.

801
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,745
Oh?

802
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,622
By awakening Gedrin,

803
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,291
I initiated
a chain of events

804
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,335
that nearly led
to our destruction.

805
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:31,508
I wanted to help revive
a civilization, not start a war.

806
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,094
You thought you were
acting out of compassion.

807
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,889
I might have done
the same thing,

808
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,350
but that doesn't
make it right, Seven.

809
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,311
The repercussions of this
could be catastrophic.

810
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,189
Their technology
is nine centuries out of date.

811
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,358
Their plans for conquest
are irrelevant.

812
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,610
They're a resourceful
species, determined.

813
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,531
They'll adapt.

814
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,700
I doubt we've seen
the last of them.
