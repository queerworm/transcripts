1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,172
(<i> foliage rustling</i> )

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:18,519
(<i> insects chirping</i> )

3
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,617
(<i> bird calling</i> )

4
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,236
MALE:
Don't move!

5
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,905
What's this?

6
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,365
We found him
in the trunks

7
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,283
a hundred footfalls
past Grove Yellow.

8
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,368
Arms?

9
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,577
None, sir.

10
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,454
These colors?

11
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,040
We didn't ask.

12
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,376
He's no Krady beast, is he?

13
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:33,547
No, sir, but he doesn't bear
Vori colors, either.

14
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,050
Hmm... his glimpse
is too tame to be a Kradin.

15
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,136
I hadn't fathomed
that, sir.

16
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,180
Well, fathom it now.

17
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,264
He's no nemesis,
is he?

18
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,309
I'm not certain
what he is, sir.

19
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,228
Weren't you drilled
to fathom the nemesis?

20
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,354
Yes, sir.

21
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,898
And we abhor none
but the nemesis,

22
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,066
do we?

23
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,151
No, sir.
None but the nemesis.

24
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,360
Then set him loose.

25
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,655
Didn't you hear, novice?

26
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,210
Thanks.

27
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,627
Go take
provisions.

28
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,051
I'm sorry, sir...

29
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,761
Go.

30
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,681
I take it you're
in charge here.

31
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,601
Team Leader Brone,
Fourth Vori Defense Contingent.

32
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,770
Commander Chakotay
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

33
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
Very sorry
for my defenders.

34
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,654
They're new
to the clash

35
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,531
and glimpse the nemesis
all around them.

36
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,117
The clash?

37
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,576
You're at war.

38
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,453
You've strayed into
the fullness of it.

39
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,705
That explains why
my shuttle came under fire.

40
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,415
One of my defenders
glimpsed a vessel

41
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,499
falling in Grove Yellow.

42
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,709
Must've been yours.

43
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,338
Why fly so close
to this sphere?

44
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,591
I was on a survey mission.

45
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,342
I picked up traces
of omicron radiation

46
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,845
in your atmosphere, so I
slowed down to take a look.

47
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,265
As soon as I did that,
I came under attack.

48
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,891
I lost helm control

49
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,185
and had to make an emergency
transport to the surface.

50
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,020
It'll be the Kradin
who fired at you.

51
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,021
The Kradin?

52
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,440
Our nemesis.

53
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,317
I see.

54
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,361
Well, I tried to explain that
I had no hostile intentions,

55
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,655
but they just kept shooting.

56
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,199
The nemesis crave
supremacy in the air.

57
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,910
They fire on any craft that
doesn't show Kradin colors.

58
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,995
I tried to contact my ship,

59
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,289
but my communicator's
not working.

60
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,915
All dispatching
in the clash zone

61
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,000
has been suppressed.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,543
I have to find my vessel.

63
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,586
Maybe it's salvageable.

64
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,172
That's little likely.

65
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,590
We're ordered to cluster
with the Seventh Contingent

66
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,925
two new lights from now.

67
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,927
They'll have means
to signal your people.

68
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,804
You can make the walk
with us to meet them.

69
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,431
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't wait two days.

70
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,142
I have to find my vessel now.

71
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,227
It wouldn't be sharp
to return to the trunks.

72
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,562
The nemesis is
everywhere there.

73
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,233
Then I'll have to do my best
to steer clear of them.

74
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,195
If your tactic
won't change...

75
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,446
It won't.

76
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,742
It's sharper to wait
for the new light.

77
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,041
Then I'll take
your advice and wait.

78
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,169
(<i> quiet conversations</i> )

79
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,889
Well done.

80
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,486
(<i> sighs</i> )

81
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,204
Provisions?

82
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,918
It's not so savory.

83
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,836
Thanks. I'm sure
it'll be fine.

84
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,465
They call me Rafin.

85
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,633
Chakotay.

86
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,968
Pleased to meet you.

87
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,471
In the trunks, di...

88
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,681
did you glimpse any?

89
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,851
Any what?

90
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,311
Krady beasts.

91
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,274
No, I didn't.

92
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:24,027
Rafin's never glimpsed
the face of the nemesis, either.

93
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,029
Have you, Rafin?

94
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,864
No.

95
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,744
It's my first walk
in the clash zone.

96
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,871
You'll glimpse them
in the Soonafter.

97
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,332
When you do, you'll fathom

98
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,918
there's no heart thumping
beneath their flesh.

99
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,136
How many beasts will you send
to the Wayafter, Rafin?

100
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,931
I... I couldn't say.

101
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,599
Me, I'll nullify one

102
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,144
for each brother and cousin
that I've lost.

103
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,563
And then one more after.

104
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,066
True or not,
my allies?

105
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,151
SOLDIERS:
True.

106
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,360
True.

107
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,406
So I ask you
again, Rafin.

108
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,532
How many
will you nullify?

109
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,827
As man... as many
as I'm able.

110
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,208
You've got the trembles.

111
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,128
If you don't wrestle
your trembles to rages, ally,

112
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,630
the nemesis will nullify you.

113
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,389
This nemesis of yours--

114
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,850
why do you
call them beasts?

115
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,735
It's told they all wear
the same horrid face.

116
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,992
Their flesh...
is gnarled and blistery

117
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,869
like the rotting trunks.

118
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,998
Their glimpses
flame like fire.

119
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,003
And if you dare near enough,
their breath stinks of muck.

120
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,630
You know, sometimes
people say terrible things

121
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,049
about their enemies,

122
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,551
to make them seem worse
than they really are.

123
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,221
There might be some
young Kradin soldier out there

124
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,639
who's more afraid of you
than you are of him.

125
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,602
Nemesis wasn't scared
to fume my village...

126
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,190
nor scared to nullify my cousins
and brothers in their sleep.

127
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,196
And my old mother's mother,
too...

128
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,408
who never told an unkind word,
nor nullified an insect

129
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,494
in all her days and nights
on this sphere.

130
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,371
That's pretty rough.

131
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,165
And who but a Krady beast

132
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:46,378
would leave the nullified bodies
of mine and ours upturned...

133
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,630
so they'll never descend
to the gloried Wayafter.

134
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,591
What do you mean by "upturned"?

135
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,134
Which of you will walk
with Chakotay

136
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,969
to find his craft
when the new light comes?

137
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,723
I appreciate the offer,
but I'll be fine on my own.

138
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,184
You don't fathom the trunks
and you don't carry arms.

139
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,186
One of my defenders
will walk with you.

140
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,645
Which will it be?

141
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,731
You, Rafin?

142
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,359
S-Sir, I... I...

143
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,736
NAMON:
I'll walk with
the stranger, sir.

144
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,988
If any beast
comes to clash,

145
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,740
I'll nullify the beast.

146
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,284
Well told, Namon.

147
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,327
Now close your
glimpses, Defenders...

148
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,205
and dream of your
sisters and mothers.

149
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,100
Have you never nullified
another, stranger?

150
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,604
Killing's the worst thing
I've ever had to do.

151
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,064
Then the nemesis
you nullified

152
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,567
wasn't half so beastly
as the Kradin.

153
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,194
Maybe not.

154
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,448
In their glimpses,
we're less than nothing.

155
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,867
They flame our homes,
take our plantings...

156
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,829
make playthings
of our sisters.

157
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,080
If you were a Vori,

158
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,166
you'd crave to drive them
from this sphere

159
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,750
just as I do.

160
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,503
Maybe I would

161
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,212
if they did things
like that

162
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,547
to the people I loved.

163
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,425
But on the sphere
I come from,

164
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,385
we try to find
other ways

165
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,179
to resolve differences--

166
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,015
peaceful solutions,
negotiations.

167
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,853
You don't fathom
the nemesis.

168
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,106
No. I suppose
I don't.

169
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,693
Beg the Power
you believe in

170
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,530
that you never will.

171
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,541
The light will be old soon.

172
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,001
We'd be sharp to cluster
with the others.

173
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,002
In a few minutes.

174
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,587
We should be
getting close.

175
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,131
You'd be sharp
to do my tellings.

176
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,258
Go back
if you want to.

177
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,635
I've got to keep looking.

178
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,261
No, wait.

179
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,474
I pledged
to walk with you.

180
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,561
Glimpse there.

181
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,362
Doesn't look like there's
much left of my shuttle.

182
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,239
You'll have to make
the walk with us

183
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,699
to the Seventh
Contingent.

184
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,367
(<i> brush rustling</i> )

185
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,535
(<i> gasps</i> )

186
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,332
Don't make me kill you!

187
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,668
(<i> gunshots</i> )

188
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,848
How is he?

189
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,604
Nullified.

190
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,406
BRONE:
We beg peace from the Power
who made us Vori

191
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:05,577
and we commend
our brother, Namon,

192
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,162
to the gloried Wayafter.

193
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,490
What's this?

194
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,866
Namon's coverings.

195
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,162
Shouldn't they go to his family
or someone he was close to?

196
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,829
It's a long walk
to the clustermark.

197
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,333
It's sharper to blend
with the trunks.

198
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,002
Your fleet colors will
get us all nullified.

199
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,258
I'm sorry about
what happened to Namon.

200
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,178
The nemesis has nullified
mine and ours in the before

201
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,806
and will in the now.

202
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:11,601
But in the Soonafter...

203
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,688
we'll send them flying
from this sphere

204
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,649
and go back to our
sisters and mothers.

205
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,195
Take it.

206
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,155
This isn't my war.

207
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,906
I'm not planning
to shoot anybody.

208
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,242
If we greet the nemesis
in the trunks, you'll fire

209
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,537
like the rest.

210
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,623
As long as you're with us,
you do my tellings, fathom?

211
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,629
Fathom.

212
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,340
Rafin.

213
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,258
Yes, sir?

214
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,261
Drill Chakotay
to fire Vori arms.

215
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,015
(<i> gunshot</i> )

216
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,602
Now you.

217
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,530
Your glimpse is too low.

218
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,407
With these arms,
it's sharper

219
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,949
to aim higher
than the mark.

220
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,458
You're good.

221
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,960
Don't mock me.

222
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,838
I was paying you
a compliment.

223
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,799
It is one matter
to fire at clay marks,

224
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,802
but much another
to nullify the nemesis.

225
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,389
That's what Namon told,
and he told the truth

226
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,307
before he went
to the gloried Wayafter.

227
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,934
He was right.

228
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,310
Killing's not easy.

229
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,523
Risking my own days
and nights

230
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,358
to drive the nemesis
from our sphere...

231
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,573
that should be as
easy as a long sleep.

232
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,284
Who taught you that?

233
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:55,413
My brothers and uncles
who were in the clash...

234
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,832
Brone, my driller...

235
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:05,423
and Namon, my ally...

236
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,050
who was nullified
because of me.

237
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,262
You think it's your
fault that Namon died?

238
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,972
If I didn't have
the coward's trembles,

239
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,516
I would have walked with you
in the trunks...

240
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,687
and it would be me and not he
who went to the Wayafter.

241
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,649
You weren't the one who
pulled the trigger, Rafin,

242
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,984
and there's no shame in
being afraid of fighting.

243
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,445
Having the trembles is natural.

244
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,572
How do you fathom that?

245
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,198
Because I've been
in battle before,

246
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,200
fighting to free my people

247
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,495
from a nemesis called
the Cardassians.

248
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,000
These Cardassians...

249
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,418
were they beasts?

250
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,130
Let's just say they
weren't very friendly.

251
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,966
The point is,

252
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,384
even though I believed
in what we were doing,

253
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,762
I always felt fear
before a fight.

254
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,766
But you wrestled your trembles
to rages, didn't you?

255
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,102
I guess I did,

256
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,312
but that doesn't mean...

257
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,439
I was told to drill you,
Chakotay,

258
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,400
but it's you
who've drilled me--

259
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,862
drilled me to fathom the rages.

260
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,029
Brone.

261
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,363
What is it?

262
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,573
I don't know.

263
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,502
Neck-strapped and upturned.

264
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,339
Left to be cooked by the glare.

265
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,841
He's one of yours?

266
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,052
By his coverings,
he's of the Seventh Contingent.

267
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,762
Likely a scoutwalker.

268
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,723
Desecrated by the Kradin.

269
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,559
He'll never turn his face
to the Wayafter.

270
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,686
We're 300 footfalls
from the clustermark.

271
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,354
Signal the Seventh.

272
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,113
Again.

273
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,159
Why don't they answer?

274
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,495
Is it possible they moved
their camp for some reason?

275
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,663
Little likely.

276
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,206
You two fastwalk
to the clustermark

277
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,416
and glimpse
what you can.

278
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,375
Sir.

279
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,710
What?

280
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,962
Let me go.

281
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,466
Well told, novice.

282
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,385
Keep your top low
and your glimpse wide.

283
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,859
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

284
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,278
Sir!

285
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,117
What have you glimpsed?

286
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,119
The Seventh Contingent, sir,

287
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,203
nullified.

288
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,498
What? All of them?

289
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,125
At least 20 defenders

290
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,294
and that's not the
whole terrible of it.

291
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,713
They're all...

292
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,216
they're all...

293
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,927
Tell it, Rafin.
They're all how?

294
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,763
Like him, sir.

295
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,932
Upturned.

296
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,184
Staked to the dirt
and upturned.

297
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,728
Those motherless Krady beasts.

298
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,860
Do you glimpse the fullness
of it now, stranger?

299
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,031
Yes. I think I do.

300
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,075
Now you fathom why we name
them beasts and not men.

301
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,286
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:09,042
We're much more
than sorry...

303
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,877
aren't we, Defenders?

304
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,545
SOLDIERS:
Yes, sir!

305
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,506
The nemesis
wants your plantings.

306
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,051
SOLDIERS:
True.

307
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,261
He wants your homes.

308
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:25,265
He wants your sisters,

309
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,643
but does it suffice him
to nullify you?

310
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,811
SOLDIERS:
No!

311
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,189
No. He craves
to shame you,

312
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,483
mock you, keep you from
the gloried Wayafter!

313
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,818
We're wearied of it,
aren't we?

314
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,403
SOLDIERS:
Yes, sir!

315
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,697
We're wrestled to the rages
for it, aren't we?!

316
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,990
SOLDIERS:
Yes, sir!

317
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,909
And we're not going
to swallow it--

318
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,162
not in the now,
or in the Soonafter!

319
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,540
(<i> gunshots</i> )

320
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,584
Assault!

321
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,795
Sly yourselves and fire back!

322
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,013
(<i> groans</i> )

323
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,695
Motherless beasts!

324
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,739
Rafin, no! Stay down!

325
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,741
I'll nullify you all!

326
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,325
(<i> grunts</i> )

327
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,203
(<i> gunfire continues</i> )

328
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,414
Hold on.

329
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm going to get
you out of here.

330
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,253
(<i> cries out</i> )

331
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,760
Please...

332
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,180
turn my face to the... Wayafter.

333
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,185
(<i> breathing stops</i> )

334
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,897
(<i> gunshots, soldiers yelling)</i>

335
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,630
(<i> panting</i> )

336
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,273
(<i> distant voices</i> )

337
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,112
A defender.

338
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,155
Mark, neighbors.

339
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,990
A defender!

340
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,285
(<i> all talking</i> )

341
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,538
Welcome to Larhana settlement,
gloried defender.

342
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,832
You're brightly greeted.

343
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:07,136
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 51082.4.</i>

344
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,222
<i>After searching</i>
<i>for more than two days,</i>

345
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,431
<i>we've finally located</i>
<i>what's left</i>

346
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>of Commander Chakotay's</i>
<i>shuttle.</i>

347
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,019
<i>I can only hope the Commander</i>

348
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,813
<i>has fared better</i>
<i>than his vessel.</i>

349
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,357
According to the Ambassador,

350
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,567
Commander Chakotay's shuttle
was hit by enemy fire

351
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,153
and crash-landed somewhere
on the southernmost continent.

352
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,696
Right in the middle
of the war zone.

353
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,489
I'm afraid so.
Can we get a lock on him?

354
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,534
Too much radiation from weapons.
We can't scan the surface.

355
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,578
Which means, we don't know
if he's still alive.

356
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,080
Why don't we assume
that he still is?

357
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,413
I should have
gone with him.

358
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,498
It's not your fault, Tom.

359
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,084
We couldn't have
anticipated this.

360
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,252
What we've got to do now

361
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,753
is figure out
how to deal with it.

362
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,671
B'Elanna, try to modify
the scanners,

363
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,923
cut through the interference.

364
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,174
Aye, Captain.

365
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,343
Neelix, what do you know
about this war?

366
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,011
It's vicious.

367
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,555
Ambassador Treen's people
have been defending themselves

368
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,431
against a particularly
savage aggressor

369
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,017
for more than a decade.

370
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,311
Is the Ambassador willing
to help us find Chakotay?

371
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,022
He's willing,
but he may not be able.

372
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,941
His resources
are extremely limited

373
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,859
and the situation
on the surface is chaotic.

374
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,236
NEELIX:
But he's assured me

375
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,987
that if his troops
do find Chakotay,

376
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,406
he'll receive medical attention

377
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,490
and be transported
to the nearest command post.

378
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,784
Let's hope he
doesn't meet up

379
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,619
with these
"savage aggressors" first.

380
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,870
Captain, let me lead

381
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,580
a team down there
and bring him back.

382
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,790
I understand how you feel, Tom,

383
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,875
but let's take it
one step at a time.

384
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,459
Tuvok, recontact
Ambassador Treen.

385
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,796
Ask for any tactical support
he's willing to provide--

386
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,424
maps, weapons analyses,
intelligence reports.

387
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,968
Before I risk
anyone else's life,

388
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,094
I want to know exactly

389
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,762
what we're getting
ourselves into.

390
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,476
By your coverings,
you're a novice defender.

391
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,021
Do I tell the truth?

392
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,816
Listen, there's been
a misunderstanding.

393
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,609
I'm not a defender.

394
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,445
My shuttle was shot down
by the Kradin

395
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,487
and I landed in the clash zone.

396
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,449
I met up
with one of your patrols.

397
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,159
They gave me this uniform.

398
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,368
Which Contingent?

399
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,162
The Fourth.

400
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,580
The Fourth?

401
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,040
They're sturdy clashers.

402
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,169
Tell us-- did you
and your allies

403
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,046
drive the nemesis
from the trunks?

404
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,798
We put up a brave fight.

405
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,217
FEMALE:
Then you're
a gloried defender

406
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,219
even if you claim not to be.

407
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,305
Marna tells the
truth, Chakotay.

408
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,266
You are welcome
among my neighbors.

409
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,059
Thank you.

410
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,687
That's very kind.

411
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,397
Do you crave anything more?

412
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,732
Drink? Warm coverings?

413
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,110
What I really need is
some communications equipment

414
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,403
to contact my crew.

415
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,156
We have no means
to signal your people.

416
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,992
MARNA:
The Kradin drove us
from our homes

417
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,411
and plantings and took
all the machinery we had.

418
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,205
Do you know
where I might find someplace

419
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,706
with communications equipment?

420
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,625
The re-stock unit.

421
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,127
Can you tell me
how to get there?

422
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,005
It's not very near--
at least 10,000 footfalls

423
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,923
through the thick
of the trunks.

424
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,134
Then I'd better get started.

425
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,346
The new light is coming.

426
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,514
Rest till then.

427
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,015
Yes, please,
Chakotay.

428
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,933
Rest until
the new light.

429
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,355
I think I will.

430
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,193
Come, neighbors.

431
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,737
Let's give Defender
Chakotay some quiet.

432
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,718
I wanted to know
if you crave more.

433
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,099
No, thank you.

434
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,435
Oh.

435
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,144
But it was delicious.

436
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,565
And the blossoms?

437
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:48,815
Do you like them?

438
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,151
I planted them myself.

439
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,028
They're very pretty.

440
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,365
I've heard tellings
that the Kradin

441
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,616
leave our nullied defenders
upturned.

442
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,744
Is it true?

443
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,663
You can tell me.

444
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,460
Penno says I'm too small
to be told, but I'm not.

445
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,130
It's true the Kradin
don't respect your beliefs.

446
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,839
The Kradin are beasty.

447
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,468
I don't fathom
why they flamed our homes

448
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,177
nor why they crave
to nully us all.

449
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,596
I don't, either.

450
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,307
We never took
their plantings.

451
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,809
We never nullied
their brothers.

452
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,643
So why do they hate us?

453
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,480
I wish I could tell you.

454
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,316
Hate's not something
I understand very well.

455
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,195
My brother's a defender, too.

456
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,572
Really?

457
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,450
He left for the clash
two plantings before.

458
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,744
I was much smaller then.

459
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:48,167
He was sturdy and pleasing
to glimpse in his colors.

460
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,710
Like you.

461
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,671
Maybe you've
glimpsed him.

462
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,257
He's called Daryo.

463
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,843
There are
a lot of soldiers in the war.

464
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,637
I only met a few of them.

465
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,846
He's a team leader

466
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,015
of the Seventh
Defense Contingent.

467
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,934
The Seventh?

468
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,145
Are you sure
he was with the Seventh?

469
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,356
They're very sturdy
in the clash.

470
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,149
Have you heard of them?

471
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,568
The patrol I was with

472
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,278
was supposed
to rendezvous with them.

473
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,279
Why didn't you?

474
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,656
You would have glimpsed him.

475
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,783
We were ambushed
before we had the chance.

476
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,578
But when you go back
to the clash

477
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,997
likely you'll glimpse
Daryo then.

478
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,542
You could take a letter to him.

479
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,336
I'm not going back
to the clash zone.

480
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,463
I've got to get
to the re-stock unit

481
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,006
so I can contact my ship.

482
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,467
Then you can bring my letter
to the re-stock unit.

483
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,220
Likely some defender there
can take it to Daryo.

484
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,888
Will you do it?

485
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,806
Please?

486
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,854
I'll go write it now
before the new light comes.

487
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,942
(<i> sighing</i> )

488
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,285
CHAKOTAY:
I wish you a good day.

489
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,745
Thank you.

490
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,665
Provisions for
your long walk.

491
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,125
Walk well,
Defender Chakotay.

492
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,793
Thank you both.

493
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,046
You've all been very kind.

494
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,968
Writings for
my brother.

495
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,054
You'll be sure
he gets them?

496
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,098
I'll do my best.

497
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,141
Your best
will be enough.

498
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,976
The pretty smell
of the blossoms

499
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,020
will hold the
nemesis far away.

500
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,941
Then you'd better
keep one for yourself.

501
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,348
(<i> aircraft overhead</i> )

502
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,485
(<i> explosions</i> )

503
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,031
(<i> people yelling,</i>
<i>children crying</i> )

504
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,786
FEMALE:
Father!

505
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,164
(<i> crying, yelling continue</i> )

506
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,474
Offer no opposition
or you'll be nullified.

507
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,741
No evidence of
cellular residue

508
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,201
on the shuttle wreckage,

509
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,620
so there's a chance
Chakotay survived the crash.

510
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,664
Well, unfortunately,
the wreckage was found

511
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,998
inside enemy territory.

512
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,458
So there is
also a chance

513
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,127
he's been captured
or killed by the nemesis.

514
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,505
There you go looking
on the bright side again, Tuvok.

515
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,923
What's this "nemesis"?

516
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,759
It is the term
Ambassador Treen's people

517
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,135
use to identify their enemy.

518
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,428
Apparently, they're vicious.

519
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,138
They shoot
without warning,

520
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,225
use biochemical weapons,
routinely massacre civilians.

521
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,310
If we run into them,
it's safe to say

522
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,063
they won't be hanging out
a welcome sign.

523
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,065
I want a team on the surface
as soon as possible.

524
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,359
I was hoping you'd say that.
Tuvok, let's get moving.

525
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,652
I must caution you both.

526
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,779
My tactical analysis
does not bode well

527
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,531
for the success
of such a mission.

528
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,575
Given the situation
in the battle zone,

529
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,618
there is
a very high probability

530
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,037
that an away team
will sustain heavy casualties.

531
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,206
Are you saying we should
just abandon Chakotay?

532
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,750
On the contrary.

533
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,001
I suppose you've come up
with an alternative plan?

534
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,169
Indeed.

535
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,046
I have concluded
that the least risky

536
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,507
course of action is for
a single crew member

537
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,633
to make the infiltration,

538
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,594
accompanied by
a commando unit

539
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,596
that Ambassador Treen
has agreed to provide.

540
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,599
Fine with me.
When do I leave?

541
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,269
Something tells me that's
not what Tuvok has in mind.

542
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,521
Naturally, I am
the logical person

543
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,856
to carry out this mission.

544
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,067
Naturally.

545
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,408
Get down there!

546
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,701
Chakotay!

547
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,582
I heard the explosions.

548
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,834
I came back to help.

549
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,378
What did the Kradin
do to you?

550
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,799
They interrogated me.

551
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,595
Where's your grandfather?

552
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,096
I don't know.

553
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,433
He's very gray,
and his heart's not sturdy.

554
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,310
He needs me to tend him.

555
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,939
You!

556
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,443
You! I want to talk

557
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,861
to your superior!

558
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,239
Hey! I'm talking to you.
I want to know

559
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,325
what you've done
with this girl's grandfather.

560
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,534
He's old and needs medical...

561
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,619
(<i> grunts</i> )

562
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,120
Chakotay!

563
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,834
Penno always tells
it'll be brighter

564
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,126
when the new light comes.

565
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,172
Your grandfather
is a wise man.

566
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,225
That's right.

567
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,894
Now get some sleep.

568
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,938
You'll tend me, won't you?

569
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,898
No matter what comes
in the Soonafter?

570
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,319
Close your glimpses...

571
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,490
and dream
of your gloried brother.

572
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,340
(<i> two gunshots</i> )

573
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,550
KRADIN:
Move along, Vori.

574
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,467
VORI:
Don't shoot.

575
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,386
(<i> babies crying</i> )

576
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,265
(<i> worried voices</i> )

577
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,228
OLD VORI:
We're coming.

578
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,814
KRADIN:
Move along!

579
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,236
Where are they
taking them?

580
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,487
I don't know.

581
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,697
They'll be fastwalked

582
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,323
to the extermination facility.

583
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,616
Why?

584
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,452
Because they're gray
and too long-lived

585
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,830
and the Kradin think them
unfit for toiling.

586
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,249
They won't make good servers,
like us.

587
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,667
Penno!

588
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,461
Penno!

589
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,629
Karya!

590
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,297
Where are they taking you?

591
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,092
Be sturdy,
my daughter's daughter.

592
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,761
Who's going to tend you?

593
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,806
We'll glimpse each other again
in the Wayafter.

594
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,433
Set him loose!
Karya!

595
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,268
Set him loose!

596
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,686
KRADIN:
Be still.

597
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,729
Keep your hands off her!

598
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,065
Don't touch her!

599
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,067
Halt!

600
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,654
What's the matter, pretty one?

601
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,322
Set my mother's
father loose!

602
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,825
Is that the
man you mean?

603
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,369
No! Karya!

604
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,329
Please!

605
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,915
Set him loose!

606
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,166
You don't want
to see him suffer, do you,

607
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,418
pretty one?

608
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,461
No.

609
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,963
Don't worry.

610
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,131
The old Vori's suffering'll
be over soon enough.

611
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,132
No!

612
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,968
Penno!

613
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,636
Take this
screeching waif

614
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,429
to the extermination
facility.

615
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:43,224
No. Chakotay.
Set me loose!

616
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,726
Chakotay,
help me!

617
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,608
You motherless beast!

618
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,369
Are Ambassador Treen
and his soldiers

619
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,370
ready to beam aboard?

620
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,665
Aye, Captain.
Energize.

621
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,587
Welcome aboard,
Ambassador.

622
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,340
Thank you for agreeing
to help us find our crewman.

623
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,968
Your thanks
are unnecessary, Captain.

624
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:22,014
Any victim of our
bloodthirsty nemesis the Vori

625
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,308
will always find friends
among the Kradin people.

626
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,819
(<i> panting</i> )

627
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,534
Chakotay...

628
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,952
calm now.

629
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,411
I'll set you loose.

630
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,711
Sorry to leave you
upturned so long...

631
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,381
but I had to shroud
myself in the trunks

632
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,091
till the Kradin
walked on.

633
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,150
The villagers
from Larhana settlement?

634
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,235
They were fastwalked
through the trunks.

635
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,820
And your defenders?

636
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,199
All nullified.

637
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,826
Thank you for
coming back for me.

638
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,786
You put yourself at risk.

639
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:30,040
And you, Chakotay, clashed
beside us against the Kradin

640
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,000
though you're a stranger
to this sphere.

641
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,877
I glimpsed you chancing
your days and nights

642
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,254
to save Rafin
from our nemesis.

643
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,549
You tell the truth
when you name them beasts.

644
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,388
What will you do
now that your men are gone?

645
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,099
Join with
the Fifth Contingent.

646
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,975
They're trying to
free the villagers.

647
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,019
It doesn't go
brightly for them.

648
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,023
I'll come with you.

649
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,442
No. I'll bring
you to command.

650
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,318
You can signal
your people.

651
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,071
That can wait
till the Soonafter.

652
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,572
In the now...

653
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,617
you need my help
to nullify the nemesis.

654
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,172
Backwalk!

655
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,632
Backwalk!

656
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,551
The nemesis is nearing!

657
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,803
It's sharper to backwalk!

658
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,608
(<i> explosion</i> )

659
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,487
(<i> Brone groaning</i> )

660
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,490
(<i> gunfire continues</i> )

661
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,204
Brone!

662
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,041
AMPLIFIED VOICE:
Vori soldiers!

663
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,002
You are surrounded.

664
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,296
Lay down your arms
and surrender.

665
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,593
Hold your fire!

666
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,553
You'll have to
nullify me first!

667
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,808
Hold your fire,
Commander Chakotay.

668
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,228
Do not fire, Commander.

669
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,521
How do you know my name?

670
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,356
I am Lieutenant Tuvok.

671
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,026
Tuvok?
Don't walk any closer.

672
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,529
I've come to bring
you back to<i> Voyager.</i>

673
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,738
Nullify him, Chakotay!

674
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,324
It's a Kradin tactic.

675
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,616
I assure you,
Commander,

676
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,493
this is no ruse.

677
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,953
It is Lieutenant Tuvok.

678
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,246
Don't you recognize me?

679
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,458
He's the nemesis!

680
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,295
You're a Kradin beast.

681
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,629
You destroyed
that village,

682
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,798
nullified Penno;
took away Karya.

683
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,008
She was only a child!

684
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,510
They've brainwashed you,
Commander.

685
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,095
Look closer.

686
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,474
Try to recall.

687
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,268
Your shuttle was shot down.

688
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:59,272
These people-- the Vori--
they captured you.

689
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,900
No. They rescued me.

690
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,651
That is what they want you
to believe.

691
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,946
But they have been
indoctrinating you, training you

692
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,656
to fight their war.

693
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,616
Take one more step
and I'll nullify you.

694
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,955
You are Commander Chakotay
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

695
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,623
You are a scientist,

696
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,042
an explorer.

697
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,502
You are not a killer.

698
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,884
Tuvok.

699
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,302
Yes, Commander.

700
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,889
How can you
wear those colors?

701
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,100
The Kradin...

702
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,643
they're beasts, murderers.

703
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,312
On the contrary--

704
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,773
they are the ones
who helped us locate you.

705
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,317
We tracked you
to a Vori training camp.

706
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:47,112
We infiltrated the facility,
but you were gone.

707
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,654
They had already
brought you here

708
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,573
to fight this battle.

709
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,452
Before today, nothing you
experienced here was real.

710
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,164
It is the method the Vori use
to conscript and train soldiers.

711
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,665
I don't believe you!

712
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:03,461
I will prove it to you
if you will lower your weapon.

713
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,114
(<i> distant voices</i> )

714
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,827
Do you recognize
this place?

715
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,914
It's Larhana
settlement.

716
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,390
A defender.

717
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,810
Mark, neighbors!
A defender.

718
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,061
(<i> all talking</i> )

719
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,481
Defender.

720
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,731
Karya.

721
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,446
Welcome to Larhana settlement,
gloried defender.

722
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,573
You're brightly greeted.

723
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,214
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 51096.5.</i>

724
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,216
<i>Although Lieutenant Tuvok</i>
<i>has managed</i>

725
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:34,177
<i>to bring Commander Chakotay</i>
<i>safely back to the ship,</i>

726
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,761
<i>it may be some time</i>

727
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,474
<i>before his psychological wounds</i>
<i>are fully healed.</i>

728
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,100
My guess is the Vori used

729
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,353
a combination
of mind control techniques,

730
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,272
including
photometric projections,

731
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,899
heightened emotional stimuli

732
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,735
and highly sophisticated
psychotropic manipulation.

733
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,695
From the condition
of your hypothalamus,

734
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,531
I'd say they had you
so mixed up

735
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,200
they could have convinced you
your own mother was a turnip.

736
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,329
Everything I experienced
was some sort of simulation?

737
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,122
Except for the battle
you were fighting

738
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,499
when Tuvok found you.

739
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,835
Apparently, attacking
the simulated commandant

740
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,796
marked your graduation
from basic training.

741
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,507
And the men I fought beside--

742
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,133
none of them was real?

743
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,553
Namon and Rafin weren't killed
in front of me?

744
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:19,097
As far as we can tell, they
were part of the simulation.

745
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,639
The idea was
to make you bond

746
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,351
with your fellow soldiers
as well as the villagers,

747
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,228
so their deaths
would enrage you.

748
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,400
Why me?

749
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,193
Luck of the draw.

750
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,195
You happened to be
passing through their space

751
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,364
and you were as promising
a recruit as anyone else.

752
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,157
We've been told
the Vori have dozens

753
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,534
of these training facilities

754
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,702
where they conscript
their own people

755
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,955
and any aliens
they're able to capture.

756
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,332
DOCTOR:
In short, Commander,
you've been subjected

757
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,295
to a highly sophisticated form
of propaganda.

758
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,047
Then the Kradin don't kill
innocent civilians?

759
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,300
They don't desecrate
the Vori's dead?

760
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,510
I don't know.

761
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,556
But the Kradin accuse the Vori
of the same kinds of atrocities.

762
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:05,435
I cared about the Vori,
but I hated the Kradin.

763
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,312
I wanted to kill
every one of them.

764
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,439
Evidently, that was the point.

765
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,565
(<i> door opens</i> )

766
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,566
NEELIX:
Captain.

767
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,817
Ambassador Treen would like

768
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,611
to have a word
with the Commander.

769
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,447
I wish to tell you
how pleased

770
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:20,450
our people are
to hear of your recovery.

771
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,160
I'm only sorry we weren't able

772
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,245
to rescue you sooner
from our nemesis.

773
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,462
Have I said something wrong?

774
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,255
I don't know.

775
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,383
If you'll excuse me, Captain.

776
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:45,850
Chakotay?

777
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,650
I wish it were as
easy to stop hating

778
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,610
as it was to start.
