1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,130
The prophets sing.
This is a holy time.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,718
<i>B'tanay,</i> the time
of awakening.

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,101
Return to that dark place
from which all life springs.

4
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,020
A primal energy
charges your blood,

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,981
an energy of rebirth.

6
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:28,362
The mind awakens
and focuses on its task.

7
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>Pagh 'tem 'far B'tanay.</i>

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,578
<i>Pagh 'tem 'far</i>

9
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,455
<i>B'tanay.</i>

10
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,237
Fresh flowers?

11
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,281
An afternoon
on the holodeck?

12
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,867
It almost feels
like we're dating again.

13
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,285
The secret to a
lasting marriage--

14
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,287
-keep the romance alive.
-I'm not complaining.

15
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,205
[chuckles]

16
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,376
Lecture hall?

17
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,543
Guess again.

18
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,879
Opera house?

19
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,340
Not another one of the
Doctor's performances?

20
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,509
This is a movie house.

21
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:00,472
This is the old Palace Theater
in Chicago, built in 1932.

22
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,433
Look at the detail
on that crown molding.

23
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,519
It doesn't look
very functional.

24
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,979
Well, this place
isn't about function.

25
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,606
It's about fantasy.

26
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,488
Chewing gum.

27
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,825
There is such a thing
as too much authenticity.

28
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,618
Attention to detail.

29
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,286
That's what
makes it fun.

30
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,499
Protective lenses?

31
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,626
These will make the
images on the screen

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,294
appear three-dimensional.

33
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,047
Let me get this straight.

34
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,716
You've gone
to all this trouble

35
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,968
to program a three-dimensional
environment

36
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,553
that projects
a two-dimensional image,

37
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,346
and now you're asking me
to wear these

38
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,306
to make it look
three-dimensional again?

39
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,725
Great, isn't it?

40
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,144
[audience murmuring]

41
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,358
[dramatic music plays]

42
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,658
[monster growling]

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,548
Crick in your neck?

44
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,841
People didn't
go to the movies

45
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,551
just for the
movies, you know.

46
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,888
Really? What did they go for?

47
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,973
Well, I'll try
to demonstrate.

48
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,228
[roaring]

49
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,274
I can see why this
was so popular.

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,358
Shh!

51
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,407
Maybe this would be more fun
if we were alone.

52
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,618
Computer,
delete audience.

53
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,580
[screaming and clamoring]

54
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,208
Who's in the front row?

55
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,251
Must be a glitch.

56
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,004
No. That's Tabor.

57
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,590
[man]
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

58
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,050
<i>The gill-man has escaped.</i>

59
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,969
<i>Please, please clear</i>

60
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,471
<i>Get out, everybody.</i>

00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,472
<i>[screaming]</i>

62
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,598
Are you okay?

63
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,357
He appears to be in a coma,

64
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,609
but I'm reading
unusual synaptic activity.

65
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,738
-What happened to him?
-I don't know.

66
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,032
I'd like to know what he's been doing
the last few weeks--

67
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,784
where he's worked,
away missions...

68
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,245
I'll access his
duty roster.

69
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,917
Was Ensign Tabor wearing these
when he was found?

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,794
No, they were on the floor
next to him.

71
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,754
I don't think
they cause comas.

72
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,049
Lights strobing
at certain frequencies

73
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,468
have been known
to induce seizures.

74
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,429
We should analyze the optical
properties of this "movie."

75
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,849
When was the last time
you spoke with Mr. Tabor?

76
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,561
About 10, 15 minutes
before B'Elanna and I got here.

77
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,105
He called to say the program
was up and running.

78
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,523
[Torres]
Funny...

79
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,025
Lieutenant?

80
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,529
When we were
in the Maquis together,

81
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,322
we used to joke
that Tabor must have had

82
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,199
his own personal force field.

83
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,617
He went through
a dozen firefights

84
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,452
without even getting
his clothes dirty.

85
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,246
He's still alive.

86
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,372
Perhaps his force field
is holding.

87
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,793
Commander, I've reviewed
the sensor logs

88
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,420
for the four hours
Tabor was here.

89
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,005
All systems were
operating normally.

90
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,590
Safeties were on-line.

91
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,426
Run a level-5 diagnostic
on the logs.

92
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,429
[Janeway] <i>Janeway to Tuvok.</i>
<i>Report to Sick Bay.</i>

93
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,014
On my way.

94
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,767
[Doctor] I've found several
microfractures in his cranium.

95
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,811
They're minor,
but the pattern suggests

96
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,563
that he suffered a
trauma of some sort.

97
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,357
There's also evidence
of subdermal contusions

98
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,609
along his right shoulder.

99
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,193
This man was attacked.

100
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,321
It's possible that whoever did it
is still on board.

101
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,156
Go to Yellow Alert.

102
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,242
Tuvok, I'm putting you in charge
of the investigation.

103
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,577
Aye, Captain.

104
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,463
Security override:
Tuvok-pi-alpha.

105
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,298
[door beeps]

106
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,594
Commander.

107
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,972
Crewman Jor,
if I'm not mistaken,

108
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,432
your quarters are on Deck 4.

109
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,309
I heard what happened to Tabor.

110
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,394
I was looking for a book
to bring to him.

111
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,523
-I'm afraid he's in no condition to read.
-I was going to read to him.

112
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,443
I've heard sometimes it helps
to hear a familiar voice.

113
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,863
You and Tabor
were friends.

114
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,283
Do you have any idea why
someone would want to hurt him?

115
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,534
I can't imagine.

116
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,791
Could you tell me where you were
from 0700 to 1100 hours this morning?

117
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,002
On duty... in Engineering.

118
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,297
You can check
with Lieutenant Torres if you'd like.

119
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,468
That won't be necessary.
Thank you, Crewman.

120
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,056
[door opens, closes]

121
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,520
Harry's found evidence

122
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,272
that someone tampered
with the holodeck sensor logs.

123
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,483
Several files
have been deleted.

124
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,736
-Any sign of an outside intruder?
-No, nothing.

125
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,489
I believe that a member of
this crew is responsible.

126
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,328
Tabor was well-liked.
What's the motive?

127
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,999
I have one suspect.
Crewman Jor.

128
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,751
I find that
hard to believe.

129
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,630
I've known her for a long time.
She and Tabor were friends.

130
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:26,756
Close friends.

131
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,508
She had access
to his quarters.

132
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,969
A close relationship
is hardly a crime.

133
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,763
It is my experience
that emotional involvements

134
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,849
often lead
to unpredictable behavior.

135
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,893
That's an opinion...
not evidence.

136
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,937
[Tuvok]
There may be other suspects.

137
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,356
I intend to question
all crew members

138
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,983
who had recent contact
with Tabor.

139
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,529
I'll check the internal sensors,
see what else I can find.

140
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,241
[door opens, closes]

141
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,578
Commander.

142
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:05,045
You seem awfully convinced that
one of the crew was behind this.

143
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,338
Now, you can't tell me that's
the only logical conclusion,

144
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,257
because I can think
of a number of others.

145
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,721
I realize my assumptions
seem premature...

146
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,265
but I have a strong instinct
about this.

147
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,268
You might call it a hunch.

148
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,645
I didn't think
Vulcans had hunches.

149
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,650
I can't explain it, Captain,
but I can't ignore it, either.

150
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:33,198
Someone on board is responsible
and I intend to find out who it is.

151
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,793
-Pressure is fluctuating in 114.
-You'd better check the seals.

Crewman Yosa to Security.

161
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,369
His neocortical readings
are identical to Tabor's,

162
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,789
and he has the same microfractures
along his right temple.

00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,334
-Who discovered him?
-Crewman Jor.

164

Crewman Jor
is in the Mess Hall.

Crewman Jor.

169

If this keeps up, I may have to
open a special coma ward.

170
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,921
Take a look

Tell me if anything

Former Maquis.

173
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,888
It's either a coincidence,
or they're being singled out.

174
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,224
There hasn't been any hostility
between the Maquis

175
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,934
and the rest of the crew
for years.

176
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,727
Maybe someone on your crew
couldn't put the past behind them.

"My" crew?

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,982
Our crew.

179
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,735
Are you any closer
to a diagnosis, Doctor?

180
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,948
They all have the same disruptions
in their synaptic pathways.

181
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,867
The same cranial
fractures, contusions,

182
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,704
but I still don't know the cause,
or how to reverse it.

183
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,291
-Your investigation?
-Nothing conclusive.

184
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,878
Five crewmen in comas,
and we don't have a single clue?

185
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,965
The assailant must have access
to security protocols.

186
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,467
There is no other way
he could've escaped detection.

187
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,387
Well, you'd better find a way
to protect the rest of the Maquis.

188
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,972
I'm running out of beds.

189
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,309
What is it you expect us to do?

190
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,228
Stay alert.

191
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,897
Report anything suspicious
to Commander Tuvok.

192
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,733
I'd rather report to<i> you,</i>
if it's all the same.

193
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,776
He's right.
I've never trusted the Vulcan.

194
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,738
-He's betrayed us before.
-He was doing his job.

195
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,532
He didn't care
about the Maquis back then.

196
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,701
-Why should he now?
-We're not Maquis anymore.

197
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,536
Tell that to our friends
in Sick Bay.

198
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,787
Oh, come on, we put
our differences aside seven years ago.

199
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,333
-It's ancient history.
-Maybe history is repeating itself.

200
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,669
Look, the truth is we don't know
what we're up against,

201
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,088
but the last thing we need right
now is an outbreak of paranoia.

202
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,632
Now, until we get
to the bottom of this,

203
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,676
I want you all
to carry hand phasers.

204
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,678
Nobody goes anywhere alone.

205
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,682
We thought maybe the intruder
left behind some kind of negative image.

206
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,933
Displaced photons.

207
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,602
Tom figured that if we dampen
the photonic ambiance and enhance...

208
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,980
We can applaud
Mr. Paris' ingenuity later.

209
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,066
-What have you found?
-[beeping]

210
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,406
Ensign Tabor.

211
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,617
Now, take a look at this.

212
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,912
Impressive.

213
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,706
It doesn't tell us
who the attacker was,

214
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,708
but we do know
someone else was here.

215
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,252
Can you extrapolate
the assailant's height and weight?

216
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:01,174
I'd say between 170
and 190 centimeters.

217
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,259
Maybe 75 kilograms.

218
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,887
That describes about half
the members of the crew.

219
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,056
At least we can rule out
Naomi Wildman.

220
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,558
[Tuvok]
Is it possible to increase the resolution?

221
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,893
We're already
working on it.

222
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,771
Keep me informed.

223
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,151
[sighs]

224
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,780
Commander?

225
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,540
Stop it.
You're making me nervous.

226
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,169
It doesn't make sense.
This ship, with all its sensors--

227
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,755
how could five people be attacked
without leaving a trace?

228
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,173
Good question.

229
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,633
Maybe it's a
conspiracy.

230
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,886
Ever since<i> Voyager </i>began
sending datastreams back home,

231
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,390
Starfleet has known that almost
a quarter of the crew is Maquis.

232
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,809
-So?
-Maybe they think we're still dangerous.

233
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,020
Maybe they ordered the Captain
to neutralize the threat.

234
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,816
Yes, that's it.
She's putting us all into stasis.

235
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,068
The comas
are just a cover story.

236
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,529
It would be easier
than putting us all in the brig.

237
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,828
-It could be her.
-Oh, please.

238
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,254
That'll be all, Crewman.
Please send in Mr. Kim.

239
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,513
I'm still trying to enhance
the photon displacement.

240
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,598
I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Kim,

241
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,392
but I called you here
for another reason.

242
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,185
In the last datastream
from Earth,

243
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,688
you received a letter
from someone named Dennis Kim.

244
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,398
My cousin.

245
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,777
In that letter, he spoke of
your mutual friend, Maxwell Saroyan.

246
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,405
-You read my mail?
-Yes.

247
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,324
Isn't that a violation
of privacy protocols?

248
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,326
As the Chief of Security,

249
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,495
I have the authority
to suspend those protocols

250
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,080
under special circumstances.

251
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,791
And what is so special
about a letter from my cousin?

252
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,543
The attacks began

253
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,504
shortly after we received
the last datastream.

254
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,715
Your letter was part
of that transmission.

255
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,717
A lot of people
got letters.

256
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,637
28, to be exact,
but only six of them matched

257
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,265
the physical parameters
of the photon displacement.

258
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,684
Am I a suspect?

259
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,147
According to the letter,
your friend, Mr. Saroyan,

260
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,775
was killed by the Maquis
a number of years ago.

261
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,613
You got me, Tuvok.
I confess.

262
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,740
I was so distraught
after hearing Max's name

263
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:35,077
that I fired my Captain Proton comatizer
at every Maquis I could find.

264
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,456
Your sarcasm could be
viewed as subterfuge.

265
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,417
Tuvok, it's me, Harry.

266
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,294
Do you really think
I'd be capable of this?

267
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,838
My personal views
are irrelevant.

268
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,759
I learned about Max's death
a long time ago.

269
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,470
I was upset,
but I don't blame the Maquis,

270
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,555
and I certainly don't
blame anyone on this ship.

271
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,434
If that'll be all?

272
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,316
Is everything all right?

273
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,987
This investigation is...
perplexing.

274
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,657
It defies logic.

275
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,078
I'll keep you posted
on the holodeck analysis.

276
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,667
[Doctor] <i>Doctor to Commander Tuvok.</i>
<i>Report to Sick Bay immediately.</i>

277
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,545
On my way.

278
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,094
I thought you might like
to have a few words with Mr. Tabor.

279
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,096
-How did you revive him?
-I didn't.

280
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,348
His synaptic pathways
stabilized on their own.

281
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,936
-How do you feel?
-Fine, sir. Hungry.

282
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,105
What do you remember?

283
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,359
Not much. I was working
in the holodeck, and...

284
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,902
then I was here.

285
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,113
Was anyone in the
holodeck with you?

286
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,197
No, sir.

287
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,743
Do you know why anyone
would want to hurt you?

288
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,953
No.

289
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,414
What's going on?

290
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,001
Thank you, Ensign.

291
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,714
Crewman.

292
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,551
I remember ordering everyone
to work in pairs.

293
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,219
Where's your partner?

294
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,804
Uh, she's, uh, uh...

295
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,140
-Who's your partner?
-Lieutenant Torres.

296
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,269
I told her we shouldn't split up, sir,
but she said she could handle herself.

297
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,396
You know how stubborn
she can be.

298
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,940
I have a vague idea.
Do you know where she went?

299
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,817
Cargo Bay 2, sir.

300
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,615
B'Elanna?

301
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,161
-Computer...
-[computer beeps]

302
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,579
Locate Lieutenant Torres.

303
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,874
[computer] <i>Lieutenant Torres</i>
<i>is in Cargo Bay 2.</i>

304
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,727
Help me get her to Sick Bay.

305
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,314
This is a holy time.

306
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,066
What?

307
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,902
[grunts]

308
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,654
Security to Cargo Bay 2!

309
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,366
[grunting]

310
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,245
Let the mind awaken
and focus on the task.

311
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,500
My mind to your mind.
My thoughts to your thoughts.

312
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,881
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

313
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,299
<i>Chakotay and B'Elanna</i>

314
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,636
<i>are the latest victims</i>
<i>of our mysterious assailant.</i>

315
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,098
<i>I've decided to put the ship</i>
<i>on a level-10 security alert.</i>

316
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,892
<i>Nonessential personnel</i>
<i>are confined to quarters,</i>

317
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,561
<i>and security teams have been</i>
<i>posted on all decks.</i>

318
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,693
Ensign, run
a metallurgical analysis.

319
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,279
Two more victims regained
consciousness--

320
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,906
Crewmen Yosa and Jor.

321
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,783
Their bio-readings
returned to normal

322
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,911
as if they suffered nothing worse
than a good night's sleep.

323
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,371
Doesn't make any sense.

324
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,208
It is, however, a pattern,
and a pattern implies purpose.

325
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,960
We simply have
to uncover it.

326
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,712
-Any clues here?
-Not yet.

327
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,297
I'm beginning to think
our perpetrator is a ghost.

328
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,924
Perhaps we should conduct
a séance.

329
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,050
It couldn't hurt.

330
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,930
I have worked meticulously,
yet he has outwitted me each time.

331
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,185
-How can you be sure it's a he?
-I can't, but I am.

332
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,815
-Another hunch?
-I can almost sense his presence.

333
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,402
It's as though
he's challenging me to find him.

334
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,450
I'd say you're taking this
a little too personally.

335
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,326
-Maybe you should take a break.
-No.

336
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,786
You haven't slept
in three days.

337
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,913
Get some rest, meditate,
clear your mind.

338
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,373
My mind is
perfectly clear.

339
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,500
I don't want to make
this an order, Tuvok.

340
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,589
I'll go over
your scans.

341
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,257
Fresh pair of eyes
might help.

342
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,802
[sighing]
Captain.

343
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,667

00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,963
[panting]

345
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,443
[grunts]

346
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,515
Resist your doubts.

347
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,357
[man]

Anyone you know?

350
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,079
Tuvok...

351
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,124
Computer, isolate the precise

[Computer]
<i>Stardate 54090.4.</i>

353

Where was Commander Tuvok

00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,673

00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,135
Access to that information
has been restricted.

357
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,261
Tuvok, what's going on?

358
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,221
Computer, override those

[computer beeping]
<i>Restrictions overridden.</i>

00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,811
Where was Commander Tuvok
at the specified time?

362
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,813
<i>Commander Tuvok</i>
<i>was in Holodeck 2.</i>

363
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,190
Computer, based
on the most recent data,

364
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,651
can you give me a better estimation
of the intruder's height?

365
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,112
[beeping]
<i>182 centimeters.</i>

366
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,824
And what is the height
of Lieutenant Commander Tuvok?

367
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,618
<i>182 centimeters.</i>

368
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,829
Captain, I believe I...

369
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,998
Ignore your doubts.

370
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,167
No.

371
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,711
Commander, lower your weapon.

372
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,380
<i>Pagh 'tem 'far</i>
<i>B'tanay.</i>

373
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,590
Who are you?

374
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,476
Captain, it would appear
that I am the guilty party.

375
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,187
How is that possible?

376
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,732
I don't know...

377
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:06,028
but for the safety of the crew,
you must confine me to the brig.

378
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,248
[Doctor]
He wants to speak with you,

379
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,293
but I advise you to remain
outside the force field.

380
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,711
Tuvok.

381
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,841
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

382
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,428
I hear you...

383
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,516
but there is another voice
trying to control me.

384
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,227
Another voice? Whose?

385
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,068
"This is... a holy time."

386
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,736
What did you mean by that?

387
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,156
A primal energy charges
the blood,

388
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,242
an energy of rebirth.

389
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,327
That's what the voice
is telling you?

390
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,038
It's a Bajoran incantation.

391
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,750
The voice is Bajoran.

392
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,086
We need to get you
to Sick Bay so I can run...

393
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,004
No!

394
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,966
No more scans.
Leave me alone.

395
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,010
Don't question your mission.

396
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,930
Get away from me.

397
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,893
What do you see, Tuvok?

398
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,854
The Bajoran.

399
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,066
Ignore him.

400
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,485
Focus on<i> my</i> voice.

401
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,487
Tell me what's happening.

402
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,616
I believe I've...
I've been attacking

403
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,370
certain members of the crew--the Maquis--

404
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:44,460
then investigating the crimes
with no memory of what I'd done.

405
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,170
Attacking them, how?

406
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,966
-Mind-melds.
-Why?

407
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,470
I don't know.

408
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,974
He is responsible.

409
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,852
What did you do to me?

410
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,398
Commander...
Commander!

411
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,776
Is he a member of the crew?

412
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,987
Then who is he?

413
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,657
I don't know.

414
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,788
The day the first attack
occurred,

415
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,998
did anything unusual
happen to you?

416
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,544
I was tending to my duties.

417
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,132
I received a letter
from my son.

418
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,051
A letter?

419
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,935
This all started right after we
received the last datastream.

420
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:49,566
I reviewed every letter...
except my own.

421
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,277
Stay with him, Doctor.

422
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,240
[door opens]

423
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,956
-How long?
-29 hours.

424
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,750
She woke up
just before you did.

425
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,211
They've all recovered.
We don't know why.

426
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,464
-It's Tuvok.
-Tuvok?

427
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,590
He's in the brig.

428
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:14,883
Apparently,
he's being manipulated

429
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,552
by some form of mind control.

430
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,429
-Can he leave, Mr. Paris?
-I don't see why not,

431
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,306
but he should wear
one of these.

432
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,850
There's something
I want to show you.

433
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,355
Exolinguistics always seemed
a little too...

434
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,523
theoretical to me.

435
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,943
I've decided to study
musical composition instead.

436
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,736
I would've sent you
my latest construct,

437
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,531
but they won't give me
enough room in this datastream.

438
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,284
-Maybe next time I can...
-[beeping]

439
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,910
A letter from his son.

440
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,580
We found another signal embedded
in the message...

441
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,124
a letter within a letter.

442
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,127
Hello, Father.

443
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,753
We received
your last transmission...

444
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,465
Prophets sing.
This is a holy time.

445
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,761
<i>B'tanay,</i> the time
of awakening.

446
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,849
Return to that dark place
from which all life springs.

447
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,893
The signal is calibrated
to correspond

448
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,853
with Vulcan synaptic
frequencies.

449
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,272
Tuvok wouldn't have been
consciously aware of it.

450
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,860
Teero.
Teero Anaydis.

451
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,822
He was a Bajoran vedek.
He worked with the Maquis.

452
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,240
Doing what?

453
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,575
Counterintelligence.

454
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,038
He was thrown out
for experimenting with mind control.

455
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,249
He thought it was a good
way to recruit agents.

456
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,046
Well, apparently, he was successful
at recruiting our Tactical Officer.

457
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,382
These incantations and symbols,
they must've triggered something

458
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,427
in Tuvok-- preconditioned behavior,
instructions.

459
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,347
I should've known
you'd show up again.

460
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,392
Commander?
Teero was a fanatic.

461
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,978
He'd go to any extreme
for the Maquis.

462
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,690
He called the rest of us traitors
for rejecting his ideas.

463
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,902
Swore he'd fight the war
on his own if he had to.

464
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,029
Why instruct Tuvok
to mind-meld

465
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,241
with<i> Voyager's</i> Maquis
35,000 light-years from Earth?

466
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,702
I'd like Tuvok to take a look
at this message.

467
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,538
Maybe it'll jog
his memory.

468
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,332
Try to decode
those symbols.

469
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,502
[Tuvok]
It's him.

470
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,796
[Janeway] His name
is Teero Anaydis.

471
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,589
Teero?

472
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,841
He worked
for Maquis Intelligence.

473
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,427
Yes.

474
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,013
I remember
meeting him.

475
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,977
I was undercover,
doing reconnaissance

476
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,604
on a colony near
the Badlands.

477
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,234
He was a vedek at the
Bajoran temple there.

478
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,906
-Go on.
-We spoke briefly.

479
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,618
He was interested
in Vulcan culture.

480
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,997
That's all I remember.

481
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,583
Maybe that's all he wanted you
to remember.

482
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,088
He was developing some kind
of mind control technique.

483
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,675
We think he used it on you
seven years ago.

484
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,223
What is it?

485
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,184
I was restrained.

486
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,229
Very frightened.

487
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,856
What did he do to you?

488
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,444
-I can't remember.
-Try.

489
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,196
I can't!

490
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,160
Tuvok, if we're going to help you,
we need to find out.

491
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,833
The last time you meditated,
it helped the memories resurface,

492
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,251
didn't it?

493
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,339
You've helped me meditate.

494
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,593
I think I've learned a thing
or two about the process.

495
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,096
Let me try to guide you.

496
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,194
Where are you?

497
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,198
In a laboratory...
underground.

498
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,826
[Janeway]
<i>Is Teero there?</i>

499
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,623
[Tuvok]
<i>There is someone...</i>

500
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,378
<i>It's him.</i>

501
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,423
[Janeway]
<i>Describe what's happening.</i>

502
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,929
Lieutenant...

503
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,724
[Janeway]
Tuvok? Tuvok?

504
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,268
It is Lieutenant,
isn't it?

505
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,190
I'm sure your Maquis comrades
would be interested to know

506
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,650
your Starfleet rank.

507
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,277
Don't worry.

508
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,613
I don't plan
to expose you.

509
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,115
What do you want?

510
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,410
You.

511
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,746
You're the perfect subject.

512
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,249
For what?

513
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,543
I'm a student of the mind.

514
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,878
Yours is remarkable.

515
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,881
Disciplined, orderly...

516
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,883
on the surface, that is.

517
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,679
-Beneath...
-[grunts]

518
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,890
boiling emotions,
repressed violence.

519
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,685
In a sense,
you're two different men.

520
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,022
One I could never
hope to manipulate,

521
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,024
but the other...

522
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,737
I have been trained
to resist mind control.

523
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,117
That's the rational,

Why?

00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,811
-Complete your mission!
-No!

531
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,563
This is a holy time.

-Commander...

00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,364

Janeway to Chakotay.

537
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,295
Commander?

538
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,219
<i>Pagh 'tem 'far B'tanay.</i>

539
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,430
What did that mean, Tuvok?
Tell me.

540
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,016
This is a holy time...

541
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,559
a time of awakening.

542
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,063
This Teero has awakened you
to do what?

543
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,901
If you can remember,
you can fight him.

544
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,319
You can resist.

545
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,654
What does he want?

546
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,990
To give us instructions.

547
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,575
What kind of
instructions?

548
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,494
Focus on your task.

549
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,996
No.

-What is it?
-I'm not sure.

What did Teero
want you to do?

564
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,144
To... to awaken the others.

565
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,104
Resist your doubts!

574
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,215
Janeway to the Bridge.
Report.

575
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,985
What the hell are you doing?

576
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,489
I think it's obvious.
I'm taking control of your ship.

577
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,618
Within the hour, all Starfleet personnel
will be locked in their quarters.

578
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,370
Step back
in the brig, Kathryn.

579
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,747
What's Teero done to you?

580
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,041
He simply helped us
remember who we are.

581
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,417
We're Maquis.

582
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,294
We've always been Maquis.

583
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,296
The rebellion ended
three years ago.

584
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,381
You know that.

585
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,549
In the Alpha
Quadrant, maybe.

586
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,176
Not on this ship.

Acknowledged.

590
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,317
We're 35,000 light-years
from Earth, Chakotay.

591
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,152
No one out here even
knows about the Maquis.

592
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,905
It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing you can accomplish.

593
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,075
As long as we exist,
so does the rebellion.

594
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,077
That's Teero talking.

595
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,496
He was unstable.
You said so yourself.

596
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,498
[Chakotay] We have no intention
of hurting any of you.

597
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,794
Your orders, Captain?

598
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,338
Take your station.

605
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,366
Looks like a nice place
for a Federation colony.

606
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,909
Take us into orbit.

607
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,829
[Chakotay] <i>Tuvok, would you mind</i>
<i>joining me in the ready room?</i>

608
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,382
You wished to see me,
Captain?

609
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,468
You can drop
the formalities.

610
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,136
This is a Maquis
ship now.

611
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,014
Vulcan brandy.

612
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,225
I thought we'd have
a drink to celebrate.

613
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,685
A fitting gesture.

614
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,063
-To awakenings.
-Awakenings.

615
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,406
There are still 23 of our former comrades
who aren't with us yet.

616
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,243
I was hoping you'd be able
to help persuade them.

617
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,079
I'm prepared to mind-meld
with the remaining Maquis,

618
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,373
to convey
Teero's instructions.

619
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,337
It'll be nice to have
my old crew back.

620
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,717
You've been a big help
to us, Tuvok,

621
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,306
but I can't forget
what happened seven years ago.

622
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,434
You have a history
of betraying the Maquis.

623
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,645
It won't happen again.

624
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,688
We have a small crew.

625
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,690
I have to be able
to trust everyone,

626
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,151
especially my Tactical Officer.

627
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,030
Bring her in.

628
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,875
Consider this a test
of your loyalty.

629
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,253
It's set to kill.

630
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,381
You said you wouldn't
hurt anyone.

631
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,060
You're in control
of your actions--

632
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,479
not Chakotay, not Teero.

633
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:19,816
Tuvok?

634
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,736
Don't do this.

635
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,661
[phaser hisses]

636
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,251
This phaser is defective.

637
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,131
Take her back to the brig.

638
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,183
You pass.

639
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,608
Now, we've got
some tactical issues to review.

640
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,902
I want to reroute
all weapons control

641
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,778
to my command console...
[groans]

642
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,077
My mind to your mind.
My thoughts to your thoughts.

643
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,174
Kim and Paris engineered
a little breakout on Deck 6.

644
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,593
We've contained them all
behind a force field.

645
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,219
We should begin
the evacuation.

646
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,599
Start beaming them down.
Begin on Deck 2, Section 01.

647
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,267
Belay that order.

648
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,147
Tuvok informed me that this planet
has an unstable atmosphere.

649
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,360
Go to Astrometrics
and scan for an alternative.

650
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,444
What are you talking about?

651
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,904
There's nothing wrong
with the atmosphere.

652
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,656
We don't have time
to debate this.

653
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,366
Well, I can scan from here.

654
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,209
Chakotay, what's going on?

655
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,797
Stand down.

656
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,470
Your weapon.

657
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,309
I thought you might like
your ship back.

658
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,730
No more rebellion?

659
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,234
It took another mind-meld
with Tuvok, but I'm fine.

660
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,944
Tuvok, you're all right?

661
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,362
I am in control again,
Captain.

662
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,863
Whatever you said
to him, it worked.

663
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,741
It's good to have you back,
Commander.

664
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,802
All ready for

665
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,929
I am not familiar
with that species.

666
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,264
You will be
soon enough.

667
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,474
I haven't completed
my security rounds.

668
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,601
You have now.

669
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:05,732
Buttered or
unbuttered?

670
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:06,941
Thank you, Neelix.

671
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,277
[crowd murmuring]

672
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,448
How's right here?

673
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,410
I saved you a seat.

674
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,748
How long is this...
entertainment?

675
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,834
I'm not sure. Tom said something
about a "double-feature."

676
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,254
I've been meaning
to ask you...

677
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,883
how did you know
that phaser wasn't charged?

678
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,885
Chakotay doubted
my loyalty.

679
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,262
He wouldn't have given
me an active weapon.

680
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,059
Not exactly ironclad logic.

681
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,479
-Call it... a hunch.
-[movie playing]

682
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,190
Remind me to pay
more attention to your hunches.

683
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,233
Shh!
