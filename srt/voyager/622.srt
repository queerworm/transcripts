1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,924
MALES (<i> in unison</i> ):
Captain's Log, Stardate 53896.

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:11,094
B'Elanna Torres
has requested permission

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:17,142
to take the<i> Delta Flyer</i>
<i>and search for dilithium.</i>

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:21,188
Shining<i> Voyager,</i>
<i>far from home,</i>

5
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:25,066
far from the gleaming cities
of Earth.

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,737
Headstrong B'Elanna Torres
and young Harry Kim

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,407
speed away from<i> Voyager</i>
<i>on the Delta Flyer</i>

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,159
in search of
their treasures.

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,536
"KIM":
I've trimmed
the sails,

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,162
but the sea is rough.

11
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,457
Maybe we should return.
I know what I'm doing.

12
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:46,714
MALES:
A wave as high as a mountain
struck the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

13
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,215
Get into the
escape pod.

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,675
We die together.

15
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,218
No one is going to die.

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,803
Go.

17
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:56,640
MALES:
Young Harry Kim left her side

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:01:01,896
and B'Elanna Torres
was thrown against the rocks,

19
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,524
the rocks of our very shore.

20
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,819
Which is where I,
Kelis the Poet,

21
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,529
found her...

22
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,447
broken...

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,074
dying.

24
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,244
She told me her story...

25
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,122
...and now I've told you.

26
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,726
An excellent conceit, that
you discovered her yourself.

27
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,185
Thank you.

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,729
Well, now that
B'Elanna Torres

29
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,314
has come to our shore,
what will happen?

30
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,859
Does Captain Janeway
come searching for her,

31
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,652
or does she give
her up for lost?

32
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,279
Who can say?

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,573
Well, I would hope
that<i> you</i> can.

34
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,035
I want to see more of these
<i>Voyager</i> Eternals.

35
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,662
Inspiration...

36
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,247
can't be forced.

37
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,583
One week.

38
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,167
Or three weeks.

39
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,711
Uh, maybe two.

40
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,131
One week.

41
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,092
The story will continue.

42
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,552
Have you noticed
how thin

43
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,429
my performers have gotten?

44
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,934
(<i> clears throat</i> )

45
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,560
Let them eat this.

46
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,906
Ladies and gentlemen--

47
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,533
our patron
salutes you.

48
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,619
Finally!
(<i> performers gasp</i> )

49
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,788
We're doing another
<i>Voyager</i> play...

50
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,874
as soon as I
can write it.

51
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,963
Shall we celebrate,
the two of us?

52
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,547
I have very little time.

53
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,549
Celebrating
will have to wait.

54
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,630
(<i> grunts</i> )

55
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,798
Who are you?!

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,925
Kelis... Kelis,

57
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,177
the Poet.

58
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,848
Your servant.

59
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,960
My servant.

60
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,589
All right.
Then let me go.

61
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,592
I... can't.

62
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,511
Why not?

63
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,931
You'll fly from me...

64
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,600
the way inspiration
always does.

65
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,275
You're trying to kill me.

66
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,359
I'm releasing the heat
from your veins.

67
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,903
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,156
You've been in a fever
since I found you.

69
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,158
Bleeding is the best way
to treat it.

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,327
Oh, I can see I'm in good hands.

71
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,205
Something tells me
you have your doubts.

72
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,082
There's a medkit over there.

73
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,459
A box.

74
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,086
Made out of metal?

75
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,382
There's a small
cylinder inside.

76
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,970
Bring it here.

77
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,311
Give it to me.

78
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,569
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

79
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,820
Don't be afraid.

80
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,323
It won't hurt you.

81
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,201
Here.

82
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,620
Pass it over
where you cut me.

83
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,838
(<i> whirring</i> )

84
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,895
You're an Eternal.
I suppose such things
are to be expected.

85
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,232
What other things do you
expect from an Eternal?

86
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:24,278
The power to make the ground
open up and the sky to fall.

87
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,072
All the strange events
sung by the ancient poets.

88
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,076
Fortunately for me,
no poet has ever sung

89
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,453
about your clan.
I'm the first.

90
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,829
My clan?

91
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,498
The Eternals on<i> Voyager.</i>

92
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,169
"Shining<i> Voyager,</i>
<i>far from home."</i>

93
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,297
How do you know about that?

94
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:53,514
TORRES:
<i>Delta Flyer</i> Log,
Stardate 53918.

95
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,809
Harry and I are continuing
toward the fourth planet.

96
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,228
Sensors have picked up
natural dilithium deposits

97
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,896
on nearly every land mass.

98
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,440
CHAKOTAY (<i> staticky):</i>
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

99
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,941
Has your warp core been damaged?

100
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,235
TORRES:
Yes. We're running on thrusters.

101
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,528
Can you track our position?

102
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,407
How long have I been here?

103
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,285
Eight days.

104
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,704
I was walking through
these mountains.

105
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,166
I saw a light burn
across the sky,

106
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,584
and I heard a
terrible sound.

107
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,962
When I arrived, I found you.

108
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,755
I treated your wounds.

109
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,674
And you tied me to this chair.

110
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,427
When a gift falls
from the heavens,

111
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,720
only a fool would let her go.

112
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,599
You've already given me
one play.

113
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,270
The story told by those voices.

114
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,022
I pieced them together,

115
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,940
tried to fill in the gaps.

116
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,193
You made a play out of our logs?

117
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,613
<i>The Away Mission</i>
<i>of B'Elanna Torres.</i>

118
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,866
My patron was impressed.

119
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,827
Well, he has great taste.

120
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,413
Now, take that knife
of yours and cut me free.

121
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,002
That... would be unwise.

122
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,586
Why?

123
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,088
My patron is intrigued

124
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,548
by the<i> Voyager</i> Eternals.

125
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,217
He wants another play.

126
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,593
To compose that, I need more...

127
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,095
details.

128
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,348
And you expect
to get them from me?

129
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,184
I<i> did</i> save your life.

130
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,356
I need to get back
to<i> Voyager.</i>

131
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,403
I need another play.

132
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,407
What exactly
do you want to know?

133
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,867
Everything.
It's not possible.

134
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,912
We "Eternals" have our rules.

135
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,998
We can't just...
give everything away.

136
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,668
How did you get lost?

137
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,880
Cut me free and I'll tell you.

138
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,302
You won't leave me?

139
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,929
Cut me free.

140
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,614
You're the one
who's leaving.

141
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,289
Don't come back.

142
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,593
Computer, bring the subspace
transmitter on line.

143
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,970
Unable to comply.
Why not?

144
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,222
Insufficient power.

145
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,151
Great. Now there's<i> no</i> power.

146
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,819
KELIS:
Are you hungry?

147
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,197
I told you not to come back.

148
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,992
You haven't eaten in days.

149
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,413
We have to support each other,
we poets.

150
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,419
I'm an Engineer.

151
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,797
I fix things.

152
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,091
From the looks of it,

153
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,968
you're not
doing so well.

154
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,928
Are you a poet
or a critic?

155
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,559
Tell me about Earth.

156
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,354
I have to sing
for my supper, huh?

157
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,855
We all do...

158
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,983
...in one way
or another.

159
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,696
Earth.

160
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,914
It's, uh...

161
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,083
an island...

162
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,588
a beautiful island,
blue and green.

163
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,591
And<i> Voyager?</i>
<i>A-a great ship?</i>

164
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,093
In a long line of great ships.

165
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,304
How did<i> Voyager</i> get lost?

166
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,682
The Caretaker.

167
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,724
An Eternal.

168
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,229
Yes, you could say that.

169
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,231
He...

170
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:15,026
caused a storm,
which blew us off course.

171
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,699
Tom Paris.

172
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,410
Are you in love with him?

173
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,328
Supper is over.

174
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,042
Come with me.

175
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,924
(<i> grunting with effort</i> )

176
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,565
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

177
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,448
This is where we put
all the names and dates

178
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,533
when our heads
won't hold anymore.

179
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,076
A memory.

180
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,703
Exactly.

181
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,204
Tell me...

182
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,540
have you ever seen this before?

183
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,378
Winter's tears.

184
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,465
Can you get me some?

185
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,343
This is... dilithium,
isn't it?

186
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,053
What you were
looking for.

187
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,430
Where can I find it?

188
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,098
The only deposit
I know of

189
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,267
is on the hunting
grounds of my patron.

190
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,352
He'd execute me
for trespassing,

191
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,355
and you, well, he'd love
to capture an Eternal.

192
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,234
M-maybe I'm more powerful
than he is.

193
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,070
Perhaps, but, if he caught you,

194
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,864
he'd force you to fight
against his enemies.

195
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,159
They're constantly
at each other's throats,

196
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,702
bickering over territory,

197
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,037
raiding each other's
land, starting wars

198
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,457
whenever they can be
guaranteed of good weather

199
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,502
and<i> we</i> suffer
the consequences.

200
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,836
You don't want
to get involved with them.

201
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,340
Which is why<i> you're</i> going
to get the dilithium.

202
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,925
I told you,
I'd be executed if I'm caught.

203
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,885
The dilithium...

204
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,263
or I don't say
another word about...

205
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,433
"shining<i> Voyager,</i>
<i>far from home."</i>

206
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,519
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

207
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,355
Did you...?

208
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,652
Don't get caught.

209
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,952
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

210
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,211
Well?

211
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,638
Beautiful.

212
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,392
I've got an idea
for your next play.

213
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,271
I've been visited
by inspiration herself.

214
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,190
How does this sound?

215
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,735
<i>The Rescue</i>
<i>of B'Elanna Torres--</i>

216
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,528
right here, in one week.

217
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,612
MALE:
One week?!

218
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,197
Let's get to work.

219
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,874
Dismissed.
That's it?

220
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,667
Mr. Paris, try to stay calm.

221
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,335
No, that's not going to happen.

222
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,128
Isn't there anything else
we can do?

223
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,963
Not until something
shows up on sensors.

224
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,424
I'll take
a shuttle out myself.

225
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,467
I'll run
a planet-by-planet search.

226
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,178
An inefficient plan.
CHAKOTAY:
And too dangerous.

227
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,725
You could be hit
by the same spatial eddies that
sent the<i> Flyer</i> off course.

228
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,061
We need to concentrate
our efforts from here, Tom.

229
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,521
All right?

230
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,900
Dismissed.

231
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,075
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

232
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,454
Steady-armed Paris,

233
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,832
bound by a sleep
that brings no rest...

234
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:02,796
The door opens and
the shadow of a woman
falls on the helmsman.

235
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,423
His eyes open...

236
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,886
Seven of Nine,
did you find B'Elanna Torres?

237
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,472
I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

238
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,932
Closer.

239
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,313
Closer.

240
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,236
Unpleasant news,

241
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,198
delivered by the most
pleasing of messengers.

242
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,287
KELIS:
No, no, no, no.

243
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,998
Seven of Nine is a Borg,

244
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,834
the scourge
of the Eternals.
I...

245
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,669
You're portraying her
like a shy bride

246
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,962
on her wedding night.

247
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,005
Once more.

248
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,888
Seven of Nine,

249
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,599
did you find
B'Elanna Torres?

250
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,519
I am sorry
to disappoint you.

251
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,025
I can't blame
my performers.

252
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,487
These Eternals on<i> Voyager</i>
<i>are difficult to understand.</i>

253
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,532
Will you stop walking around?
You're going to break something.

254
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,702
This Tuvok, for example.
He's not like anybody
I've ever met.

255
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,329
No emotions?
How's that possible?

256
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,123
It just is.

257
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,750
(<i> whirring</i> )

258
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,752
It worked?

259
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,838
It worked.

260
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,934
(<i> console beeping</i> )

261
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,770
Okay.

262
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,440
Computer, bring subspace
transmitter on line.

263
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,695
What happened?!
I don't know.

264
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,489
The transmitter must have
been weakened in the crash.

265
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,116
It couldn't take
the energy surge.

266
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,368
(<i> grunting with effort</i> )

267
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,369
These Vulcans...

268
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,287
Enough!

269
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,956
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

270
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,128
What kind of
metallurgic
technology

271
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,840
do you
people have?

272
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,259
Alloys...
which ones can you make?

273
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,720
Steel? Bronze?
Bronze.

274
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,597
Bronze, all right.

275
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,808
I need a plate of metal
this big, as thin as it can be--

276
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,685
three parts tin
to five parts bronze,

277
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,228
one side coated with gold.

278
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,480
Gold is expensive;
I can't afford it.

279
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,941
Then you're going into debt.

280
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,150
Then tell me about the Vulcans.

281
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,903
Get me the plate,
and then I'll tell you.

282
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,280
Everyone's asleep.
I'll do it in the morning.

283
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,576
The Vulcans?

284
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,419
Maybe I've miscounted, but...

285
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,631
I don't think you've slept
in ten days?

286
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,758
Your count is accurate.

287
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,055
Don't you think
you should go to bed?

288
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,765
(<i> sighs</i> ):
As a Vulcan,

289
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,600
I can function
without sleep

290
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,852
for more than
two weeks.

291
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,396
But there's a point
of diminishing returns

292
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,566
when your mind starts
to play tricks on you.

293
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:15,780
My mind, Mr. Neelix,
does not play tricks.

294
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,244
The ship is lonely
without them, isn't it?

295
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,917
If you would allow me
to continue my sensor analysis,

296
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,753
I might be able to locate them.

297
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,757
If there's anything else
you need...

298
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,469
a stronger tea, perhaps.

299
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,980
When a friend is lost,
the mind is split in half,

300
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,649
divided between memory
of the past

301
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,484
and fear of the future.

302
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,403
Harry Kim, Ensign.

303
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,489
Only a boy
when fate took you

304
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,867
from the arms
of blue-green Earth.

305
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,535
B'Elanna Torres,

306
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,745
half-Klingon, half-human.

307
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,665
I am honored to call you...

308
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,959
What are you doing?

309
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,794
Is that a tear?

310
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,504
Yes.

311
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,298
Logical Tuvok doesn't cry.

312
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,425
That's why they call him
logical.

313
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,802
Everybody cries.

314
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,303
The land of Vulcan

315
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,389
has no laughter,
and it has no tears.

316
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,685
It is a very quiet place--
calm, just like Tuvok.

317
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,311
I can't believe that.

318
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,313
You don't have to;
just don't cry.

319
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,482
The audience
won't believe it either.

320
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,902
They'll either think Tuvok
is an unfeeling monster

321
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,737
or that I am a bad performer.

322
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,280
They'll realize that beneath
your unfeeling exterior

323
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,950
is a heart
that's breaking, silently,

324
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,411
and in more pain than any of us
can possibly understand,

325
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,538
because that's what it is
to be Vulcan.

326
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,712
Try it again.

327
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,216
Kelis!

328
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,300
KELIS:
What's wrong?

329
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,637
Our patron has been insulted
by his enemy to the north.

330
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,057
The armories are opened.
(<i> murmuring</i> )

331
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,767
Has a battlefield
been chosen?

332
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,351
Not yet.

333
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,979
Then we have a chance.

334
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,659
I need your help.

335
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,161
I've given you
enough help.

336
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,122
Where's that
piece of metal?

337
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,588
Not bad.

338
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,173
My patron's been angered

339
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,341
by the leader
of a neighboring state.

340
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,843
He'll want to take revenge.

341
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,470
It could lead to war.

342
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:48,515
We Eternals aren't supposed
to take sides.

343
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,810
I'm not asking you to fight.

344
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,104
I need a way to change his mind.

345
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,940
I don't have
that kind of magical power.

346
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,399
Yes, you do.

347
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,444
I believe
the right kind of play

348
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,739
can turn the mind
from violent thoughts.

349
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,575
The perfect play
might even stop a war.

350
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,703
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

351
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,790
I can't fix the transmitter
with this.

352
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,126
It has too many impurities.

353
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,586
It'll never carry
a plasma charge.

354
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,423
If the fighting starts,
scouting parties will start

355
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,425
moving through
these mountains.

356
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,052
You'll be discovered.

357
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:27,888
But my play...

358
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,683
it could stop it
from happening.

359
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,146
You have to help me.

360
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,107
There's nothing I can do.
Then come with me.

361
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,901
I'll show you
what I've done so far.

362
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,989
It's our only chance.

363
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,661
She's a fellow poet
from across the eastern sea,

364
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,872
an expert
on the<i> Voyager</i> Eternals.

365
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,541
She's devoted
her life to them.

366
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,169
She's here to help.

367
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,848
<i>The Rescue</i>
<i>of B'Elanna Torres.</i>

368
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,558
We begin with Harry Kim,

369
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,019
reaching<i> Voyager</i>
<i>in the escape pod.</i>

370
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,021
He tells Captain Janeway

371
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,815
that B'Elanna Torres
is lost.

372
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,442
We continue to the point
where they discover

373
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,737
a piece of
the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

374
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,822
After that...

375
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,409
It's simple. They search
for B'Elanna Torres.

376
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,829
B'Elanna Torres is found...
Or not found.

377
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,623
Or not found.
The end.

378
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,918
Sounds pretty
straightforward to me.

379
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,794
That's exactly
the problem.

380
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,089
Where is the
mistaken identity?

381
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,258
The discovery?
The sudden reversal?

382
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:51,389
Mistaken identity--
a character who is someone else.

383
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,224
Discovery--

384
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,726
the moment when that identity
is revealed.

385
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,437
Reversal-- a situation
that turns from good to bad

386
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,856
in a blink of an eye.

387
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,817
Find the truth
of your story,

388
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,738
and you won't need
all those tricks.

389
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,700
I don't know how things are done
across the Eastern Sea,

390
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:15,996
but here,
poets have become lazy.

391
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,916
They rely on
manipulation

392
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,501
to move
their audience.

393
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,504
It wasn't always that way.

394
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,632
Welcome.

395
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,175
Thank you.

396
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,513
The truth of my story.

397
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,849
It's an
old-fashioned idea.

398
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,979
Today audiences want
excitement... passion.

399
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,190
Let me show you
what I've done

400
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,651
with Captain Janeway
and Commander Chakotay.

401
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,948
Let's make
a good impression
on our visitor.

402
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,537
Chakotay,
why must I be denied

403
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,958
what every other female officer
on this ship can have?

404
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,793
Captain?

405
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,004
The privilege...

406
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,214
of your touch.

407
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,023
(<i> door chimes</i> )

408
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,607
Come in.

409
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,821
If that was good news,
you'd be smiling.

410
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,575
I was just contacted
by an alien
transport vessel.

411
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,829
They picked up
the<i> Delta Flyer's</i>
<i>distress call.</i>

412
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,710
TORRES:
The primary controls
are off-line.

413
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,213
I've ordered Harry to eject.
I still have thrusters.

414
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,507
I'm setting a course
for an L-Class planet.

415
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,384
I'll try to maintain contact.

416
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,760
They couldn't get a
fix on her position.

417
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,721
That was ten days ago.

418
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:59,141
B'Elanna ordered Harry
into an escape pod.

419
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,852
What's the longest
he could survive?

420
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:04,855
Less than ten days.

421
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,941
An L-Class planet.

422
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,777
I've already narrowed
the search parameters.

423
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,864
If B'Elanna made it there,
it's possible Harry did, too.

424
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,706
Good night, Commander.

425
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,333
Captain.

426
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,799
(<i> gasps</i> )

427
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,846
We'll have a final rehearsal
in the morning.

428
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,770
The last Tuvok scene
doesn't make sense to me,

429
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,440
and we still don't
have an ending.

430
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,234
I've got the rest of
the night to work on it.

431
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,278
Maybe<i> you</i> can get
some sleep.

432
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,291
What did you think?

433
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:09,253
Captain Janeway kissing
Commander Chakotay?

434
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,548
Tom Paris kissing Seven of Nine?

435
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,716
I don't see the point.

436
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,470
Anger is like fire.

437
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:21,348
Love can be the rain
that extinguishes it.

438
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,394
My patron is filled
with hatred for his rival.

439
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,729
So our play should be
filled with love.

440
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,399
You can't change
somebody's way of life

441
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,443
with a few lines of dialogue.

442
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,902
Yes, you can.

443
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,862
It's been done before.

444
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,282
Do you know what
this place used to be...

445
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,326
a hundred years ago?

446
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,868
A temple.

447
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,163
And this was
the altar stone.

448
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,249
Every year a victim
would be sacrificed on it

449
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,875
in honor of winter,

450
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,503
and then one year--

451
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,630
nobody remembers
exactly when or why--

452
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,008
a play took the place
of the ritual,

453
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,885
and no one had to die
here again.

454
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,682
Why can't my play
take the place of a war?

455
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,561
Well, you're going to have to do
a lot better than Harry Kim

456
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,605
kissing the Delaney sisters.

457
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:10,772
Why?

458
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,651
Because...

459
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,529
when you think that
you are surrounded by enemies,

460
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,574
when you're up against the Borg,
or... or Species 8472,

461
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:24,911
the last thing on your mind
is romance.

462
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,830
You're an Eternal.

463
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,167
You have to help me.

464
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,132
I'm sorry, Kelis.

465
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,385
The Borg...

466
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,556
tell me more
about them.

467
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:52,189
They are soldiers,
part of a vast army.

468
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,274
They all think
the same thoughts

469
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:59,905
and they travel on ships
that look like hives.

470
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,823
Like insect colonies.

471
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,701
They even have a queen.

472
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,121
That sounds
terrifying.

473
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,124
Captain Janeway
hasn't been able
to destroy them.

474
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,211
She is a Starfleet officer,

475
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,673
trained to avoid violence
whenever possible.

476
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:21,385
She would make peace
with the Borg, if she could.

477
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,721
This is what I need...

478
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,222
an enemy,

479
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,974
someone to stand
in the way

480
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,686
of<i> Voyager</i>
<i>finding B'Elanna Torres. It...</i>

481
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,398
Captain Janeway,
driven by vengeance,

482
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,483
must seek out
the Queen of the Borg.

483
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:41,488
The audience thinks she plans
to destroy them all, but...

484
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,449
Go on.

485
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,534
The sudden reversal!

486
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,454
Eh, Captain Janeway, holding
her spear at the queen's throat,

487
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,122
throws her weapon aside,

488
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,583
and she argues
passionately

489
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,001
to put an end
to their conflict...

490
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,754
in words...

491
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,840
...no one will fail
to understand.

492
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,595
Including your patron?
(<i> sighs</i> )

493
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,268
That's much better
than all that kissing.

494
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,070
Stay and help me.

495
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,781
I still need an ending.

496
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,283
You'll figure something out.

497
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,245
B'Elanna Torres
dies tragically.

498
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,124
You wouldn't dare.

499
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,776
I followed you here
expecting to find
a love nest.

500
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,323
It's quite a nest.

501
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,078
You're no poet
from across the sea.

502
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,872
You're an Eternal.

503
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,751
Maybe even B'Elanna Torres
herself.

504
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,462
Don't be ridiculous.

505
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,880
Mm.

506
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:26,176
You know
all he thinks about is you?

507
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,764
We're collaborators,
that's all.

508
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,600
If you come to the performance
tomorrow night,

509
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,520
I'll expose you to the Autarch.

510
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,022
Just leave us alone.

511
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,775
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):
You fix your ship and go.

512
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,151
Please.

513
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,701
Friend of yours?

514
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,663
Harry?

515
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,750
(<i> laughs</i> )

516
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,834
Give me a hand.

517
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,085
Here.

518
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,212
Oh, how?
(<i> laughs</i> )

519
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,381
I ran into some turbulence
in the escape pod,

520
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,300
decided to turn around
and follow your ion trail,

521
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,636
landed about 200 kilometers
from here.

522
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,805
You<i> walked?</i>
<i>At night.</i>

523
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,891
I tracked your position
with a tricorder

524
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,559
and tried to stay hidden
during the day.

525
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:16,727
(<i> sighs</i> )

526
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,270
Uh...

527
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,105
I've got
some emergency rations left,

528
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,567
a phaser, and the escape
pod's transmitter,

529
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,527
which I didn't have enough
power left to run, but...

530
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,280
Harry Kim saves the day.

531
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,157
Just the ending
I was looking for.

532
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,618
Huh?

533
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,714
The final moment.

534
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,091
The last scene.

535
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,386
More important than anything
that's gone before.

536
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,014
But what is it?

Where is she?

00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:12,198
Your collaborator's
probably halfway across

539
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,785
She'll be here.

540
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:18,371
You said we'd have an ending
by mid-morning.

541

We won't have time
to learn it.

He's not in a

He will be.

Not if this is

00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,515
Yes. Kelis, this is
no way to end a play.

It doesn't make sense.

It'll have to.

And B'Elanna Torres?

601

No sign of her.

602
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,778
Seven of Nine, you are
my eyes and my ears.

603

If anyone can find
her, it is you.

Her eyes and her ears...

00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,289
and the viper in her nest.

606
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:52,794
I, Seven of Nine,
have no intention
of finding B'Elanna Torres.

607

I, Seven of Nine,
am Queen of the Borg.

more surprised than Janeway

So was I.

"Without inspiration...

628
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,311
B'Elanna Torres will perish."

He's threatening
to kill off B'Elanna.

630
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,735
As the climax to his play.

631
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,070
Let him.

632
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,822
That means...

633
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,573
that he still can't
figure out the ending.

634
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,077
Uh, who cares?
I do.

635
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,870
You're serious.

...have you ever
inspired anybody?

That's kind of a
strange question.

Well, it's been a strange
couple of weeks.

on that stage.

Wait for my signal.

647
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,821
My death is irrelevant.

648
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,282
You will never see
the gleaming cities of Earth.

649
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,201
You will be assimilated.

650
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,328
And if I let you live?

651
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,663
Also irrelevant.

652
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,708
You don't believe that.

The battle is over.

until all your drones and
all my crew are destroyed--

659
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,684
until everything
we value is gone

660
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,687
and there is nothing left...

661
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,647
but our hatred.

662
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,403
This final scene
will ruin everything
that we've done out there.

663
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,364
We'll have to improvise.

And not a moment
too soon.

Right here,
before your eyes.

677
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,736
Wait. She's not
from across the Eastern Sea.

678
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,446
She's an Eternal.

679
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,489
I'm telling you she's
B'Elanna Torres.

680
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,908

Our patron rises
to his feet

00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,006
to stop the play.

686
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,101
Nicely done.

(<i> audience murmuring</i> )

688
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,022
I almost believed you.

690
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,567
Continue.

691
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,700
Stay.

692
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,703
<i>Voyager</i> needs me.

693
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,291
So do I.

694
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,001
No, you don't.

695
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,879
You have all that you need
right here.

696
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,804
I'll be inspired...

697
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,268
...every time I think of you.

...to ascend...

to the heavens.

701
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:21,914
And so ends
the rescue of
B'Elanna Torres,

702
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,834
half-Klingon,
B'Elanna Torres,

00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,963
B'Elanna Torres,
Chief Engineer.

704
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,090
These stories will continue...

705
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,136
for as long as we have
the breath to tell them...

706
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,891
...and as long
as our patrons...

707
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,434
remain wise

708
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,269
and compassionate.

709
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,771
And<i> Voyager</i>
<i>will continue</i>
<i>on her journey</i>

710
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,774
to the gleaming cities

where peace reigns...

712
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,489
and hatred has no home.
