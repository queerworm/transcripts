1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,214
[Doctor singing
upbeat opera loudly]

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,886
[singing continues]

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,732
[singing continuing]

4
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,913
Captain...
Computer, pause music.

5
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,414
I didn't wake you, did I?

6
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,625
That's all right, Doctor.

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,586
15 minutes of sleep
is really all I need.

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,171
Coffee, black.

9
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,800
Maybe you should pay
a little more attention to flying

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,802
and a little less to singing.

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,555
As a hologram, I can handle
a variety of tasks at once.

12
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,139
In addition to piloting the Flyer,

13
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,975
I'm writing a paper
on the physiological stresses

14
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,393
of long-duration space flight

15
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,772
and... taking holo-images
of this Mutara-class nebula.

16
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,191
With a hologram on board,
who needs a crew?

17
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,026
I'd never admit this
to anyone else,

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,362
but there was a time when
I would have given anything

19
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,655
to be flesh and blood,

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,158
but I've come to realize that
being a hologram is far superior.

21
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,868
Really?

22
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:18,870
No offense.

23
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,373
I'll always enjoy the company
of organics.

24
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,792
In fact, I'm delighted
you were able to attend

25
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,294
this medical symposium with me.

26
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,546
It's been a pleasure
spending time with you.

27
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,008
Actually, I was hoping we might
do this sort of thing more often.

28
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,134
[console beeping]

29
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,011
Hmm.

30
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,138
We're passing
through a subspace eddy.

31
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,307
It could be the wake
of another ship.

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,308
No.

33
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,018
There's nothing on sensors.

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,187
It's probably just the gravimetric
shear from the nebula.

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,481
Maybe I should
take the controls.

36
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,066
Sit down and relax, Captain.

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,944
You've got a hologram
at the helm.

38
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,480
The plasma surges have to be coming
from one of these relays.

39
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,234
Try realigning
the deuterium manifolds.

40
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,449
-<i>Paris to Torres.</i>
<i>-</i>Go ahead.

41
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,493
<i>Can you pull yourself away from</i>
<i>Engineering for a few minutes?</i>

42
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,829
<i>I've got a shuttle down here</i>
<i>with a faulty deflector array.</i>

43
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,372
I'm a little busy right now.

44
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,124
<i>It's kind of urgent.</i>

45
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,721
What's this?

46
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,932
Well, I thought you'd enjoy
a romantic lunch

47
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,268
under the glow of a red giant.

48
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,021
Oh, you replicated potato salad.

49
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,775
With extra paprika--
just the way you like it.

50
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:39,613
This is so sweet... but I can't.

51
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,198
Sure you can.

52
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,575
I've already cleared it
with Chakotay.

53
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,912
I told the Captain
I'd have the dilithium matrix

54
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,414
recalibrated before she got back.

55
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,209
You know, this might be
our last chance

56
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:57,214
to be alone...
for the next 18 years.

57
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,927
I will make some time
before the baby comes, I promise.

58
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,140
Oh, I've got to get back.

59
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,103
[sighs]

60
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,444
Report.

61
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,240
There's some kind of pulse being
directed at our transceiver array.

62
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,159
It's coming
from the Delta Flyer.

63
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,244
Hail them.

64
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,663
No response.

65
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,582
Looks like they've encoded
the pulse with a com signal.

66
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,379
Captain...

67
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,756
<i>Sorry about the image, Ensign.</i>

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,049
<i>Our com system's been damaged.</i>

69
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,760
<i>The only way I could send you a signal</i>
<i>was through the main deflector.</i>

70
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,846
Are you and the Doctor
all right?

71
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,180
<i>We're fine.</i>

72
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,849
<i>Tell Commander Chakotay</i>
<i>to meet me in my ready room</i>

73
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,183
<i>as soon as we've docked.</i>

74
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,810
<i>Janeway out.</i>

75
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,022
Harry tells me the Flyer
took some damage.

76
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,107
That's an understatement.

77
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,734
We almost didn't make it
back in one piece.

78
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,695
They're called the R'Kaal.

79
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,363
Their technology
is decades ahead of ours.

80
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,116
Transphasic warp drive,

81
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,034
multispectral cloaking systems.

82
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,037
They could destroy this ship before
our sensors knew they were there.

83
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,497
They sound like people
we should avoid.

84
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,957
I wish that were possible.

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,917
They control
thousands of parsecs

86
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,086
from here to the edge
of the Beta Quadrant.

87
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,213
They're ecological extremists.

88
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,300
They believe conventional
warp engines damage subspace,

89
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,802
so they've outlawed warp travel
through their territory.

90
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,929
Then we should reverse course
and find a way around.

91
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,723
That's the problem.

92
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,310
We've already been in their space
for three weeks without knowing it.

93
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,811
You'd think they'd mark
their borders

94
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,105
-a little more clearly.
-As punishment,

95
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,191
their law demands
that our ship be dismantled.

96
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,695
Obviously, we're not going
to let that happen.

97
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,197
I spent three hours
explaining our situation

98
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,451
to their "Supreme Archon"--
a thoroughly unpleasant man.

99
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,162
I convinced him
to spare Voyager...

100
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,955
but at a price.

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,876
We're going to rendezvous
with their armada

102
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,711
and surrender our warp core...

103
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,840
at a Class-M planet
where they've agreed to let us settle.

104
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:04,799
Settle?

105
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,011
I didn't make this decision
lightly, Chakotay.

106
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,263
We have to bring
the senior staff in on this.

107
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,432
We can find a way
to evade their ships

108
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,851
or adapt our sensors
to their cloaking technology.

109
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,646
We could try that, and we might
make it past their armada,

110
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,523
but we could lose a lot of people
in the process, maybe the entire ship.

111
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,858
Kathyrn, there's got to be
another way.

112
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,195
I'm tired, Chakotay,
tired of casualty reports,

113
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,697
of continually risking my people
on the slim chance

114
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,199
that we'll make it home in one piece.

115
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,370
We've found our way
out of worse situations.

116
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,373
-Set a course.
-What am I supposed to tell the crew?

117
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,625
For now, I'd like to keep this
between us.

118
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,336
It's not like you to keep
your people in the dark...

119
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,046
I'll make an announcement
when the time is right.

120
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,464
Dismissed.

121
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,893
-Captain.
-I'm sorry to interrupt,

122
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,438
but I could use your input
on a hypothetical scenario.

123
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,398
Of course.

124
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,526
If we were to eject the core,

125
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,778
could it be towed safely at warp?

126
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,991
In theory, but a tractor beam might
destabilize the containment field.

127
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,283
You'd be risking a breach.

128
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,035
Could you compensate
for that?

129
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,372
You could configure the tractor emitters
to generate a resonance pulse.

130
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,249
That should stabilize the field.

131
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,962
Can you make those modifications
to the Delta Flyer's tractor emitters?

132
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,755
I suppose.

133
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,340
How long would it take?

134
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,175
Um, a few hours.

135
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,969
Get started.

136
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,096
I thought you said this was
a hypothetical scenario.

137
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,390
We should be prepared,
just in case.

138
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,058
In case of what?

139
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,978
Let me know as soon
as you're finished.

140
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,693
-Torres to Chakotay.
-<i>Go ahead.</i>

141
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,445
Have you got a minute?

142
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,801
B'Elanna tells me you ordered
some modifications to the Flyer.

143
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,595
That's right.

144
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,555
Maybe I misunderstood.

145
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,350
I thought the plan was to hand over
the core when we reached the planet.

146
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,561
Are we taking it somewhere else?

147
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,064
[whispering]
I heard you the first time.

148
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,482
Captain?

149
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,861
You've already made
your concerns clear, Commander,

150
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,155
but there's been
a slight change of plans.

151
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,364
Were you going to tell me?

152
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,868
Kathryn...

153
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,578
what's going on?

154
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,498
I don't feel well.

155
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,832
I've got a headache.

156
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,921
I'm going to my quarters,
and I'd prefer not to be disturbed.

157
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,297
You have the Bridge.

158
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,176
[whispering]
Not now.

159
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,511
I beg your pardon, Captain?

160
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,513
Carry on, Commander.

161
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,150
Chakotay to the Doctor.

162
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,903
-<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>
-Report to Sick Bay immediately.

163
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,159
Something wrong with the turbolifts?

164
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,245
You did say immediately.
How can I help you?

165
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,038
[sighs] I'm concerned
about the Captain.

166
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,249
-She doesn't seem to be feeling well.
-What's wrong?

167
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,708
I'm not sure.

168
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,460
She went to her quarters
with a headache.

169
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,629
I'll bring her an analgesic.

170
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,714
I was wondering
if this could be related

171
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,299
to your encounter
with the aliens.

172
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,551
You think they harmed her?

173
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,427
You tell me.

174
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,096
What did they do to her?

175
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,514
I'm not sure, exactly.

176
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,143
The aliens took my program off-line
as soon as they boarded the Flyer.

177
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,103
The Captain reactivated me
a few hours later

178
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,604
and told me
she'd been interrogated.

179
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,065
Naturally, I examined her
to make sure she was all right.

180
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,859
Did you find anything unusual?

181
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,903
I suppose I'm violating
doctor-patient confidentiality

182
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,948
by telling you this, but...
she was fine.

183
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,993
I'd like you to give her
a more thorough examination.

184
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,871
Gladly, but you know how
she feels about physicals.

185
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,165
You can be very persuasive,
Doctor.

186
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,666
Contact me as soon
as you're done.

187
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,834
Aye, sir.

188
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,091
Anything interesting on sensors
this morning?

189
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,675
Nothing extraordinary.

190
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,970
A red giant and two G-type stars,

191
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:23,349
a Golorian trading vessel
bearing 156 mark 4.

192
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,269
If there were a fleet
of cloaked ships in the vicinity,

193
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,104
could you devise a way
to detect them?

194
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,858
A cloaked fleet would generate
significant subspace distortions.

195
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,942
Why do you ask?

196
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,112
[Kim] <i>Commander,</i>
<i>we're receiving a transmission.</i>

197
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,614
Source?

198
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,199
<i>I'm having trouble pinpointing it.</i>

199
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,992
<i>Should I notify the Captain?</i>

200
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,036
No, she didn't want
to be disturbed.

201
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,579
Route the call here.

202
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,666
I'm Commander Chakotay
of the Starship <i>Voyager.</i>

203
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,711
This is Supreme Archon Loth
of the R'Kaal <i>Imperium.</i>

204
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,007
Why haven't you ejected your warp core
as your Captain agreed?

205
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,968
We're en route
to the planet you specified.

206
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,054
We can't jettison the core
until we get there.

207
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,557
If we don't receive the core
within ten hours,

208
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,061
my armada
will destroy your ship.

209
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,522
This is your only warning.

210
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,068
Work with Harry.

211
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,278
I want to know the source
of that transmission.

212
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,821
Understood.

213
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,578
Ah, Commander,
you'll be relieved to know

214
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,956
I've given the Captain
a clean bill of health.

215
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,499
Did you run a neurological scan?

216
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,085
Mm-hmm. Her brain activity
and cognitive functions

217
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,294
are completely normal.

218
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,464
As far as I can tell she's perfectly fit,
physically and mentally.

219
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,133
Thank you, Doctor.

220
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,769
Chakotay to the Captain.

221
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,023
Computer,
locate Captain Janeway.

222
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,233
Computer, belay that.

223
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,110
My quarters, now.

224
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,571
Really, Chakotay,

225
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,865
sending the Doctor
to check up on me?

226
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,782
I'm concerned.

227
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,118
Then why didn't you
come to me directly?

228
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,870
-I thought we trusted each other.
-So did I.

229
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,373
Something happened on that away mission
that you're not telling me.

230
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,208
I've told you everything
you need to know.

231
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,210
You've consulted me
on every major decision

232
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,713
over the last seven years
except this one.

233
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,880
Why?

234
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,093
There are some decisions
a captain has to make on her own.

235
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:26,306
I understand that, but every instinct
tells me what you're doing is wrong.

236
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,017
Don't you remember
what happened on Lessek Prime?

237
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,186
I don't see how that's relevant.

238
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,771
I think you do.

239
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,650
15 years ago, you were the Lieutenant
who was kept in the dark.

240
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,694
If you hadn't questioned
your Captain's orders,

241
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,779
the entire away team
would've been lost.

242
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,824
This situation's entirely different.

243
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,411
You never told me
that story.

244
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,579
I made it up.

245
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,289
Chakotay to Tuvok.

246
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,959
I've erected a dampening field
around these quarters.

247
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,587
I'm sorry, Commander.

248
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,384
[groaning]

249
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,646
Computer, secure the doors
and establish

250
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,483
a level-5 dampening field
around the morgue.

251
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,984
[computer beeps]

252
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,391
I can't do my job with the two of you
constantly talking in my head.

253
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,398
No!

254
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,403
I'm not doing anything else
until I speak with the Captain.

255
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:07,949
Fine!

256
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,868
What's your
encryption frequency?

257
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,289
<i>Captain, are you all right?</i>

258
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,083
Doctor, listen to me.

259
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,711
Under no circumstances
are you to eject the warp core.

260
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,880
<i>If I don't do what they ask,</i>
<i>they'll kill you.</i>

261
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,342
I'm giving you a direct order.
Stop what you're doing.

262
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,677
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

263
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,387
<i>I can't obey that order.</i>

264
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,389
Doctor, I want you
to go to the Bridge right now

265
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,640
and alert Commander Tuvok...

266
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,183
Put her behind the force field!

267
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,275
We have another assignment
for you.

268
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,695
I've been going over
the schematics of your vessel,

269
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,700
and I'm intrigued
by this bio-neural circuitry.

270
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,953
I want you to bring us
a series of these gel packs.

271
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,664
<i>The gel packs are integrated</i>
<i>into the ship's systems.</i>

272
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,708
<i>I can't just remove them</i>
<i>without someone noticing.</i>

273
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,586
You've proven yourself
to be very resourceful, Doctor.

274
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,087
You'll find a way.

275
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,547
Remember--

276
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,925
we're monitoring
your perceptual subroutines.

277
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,637
We can see and hear everything.

278
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,390
<i>Tuvok to Chakotay.</i>

279
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,269
<i>You know what will happen to her</i>
<i>if you alert your crew.</i>

280
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,482
[clears throat]

281
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,150
[hoarse voice]
Go ahead.

282
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,402
Are you all right,
Commander?

283
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,988
Uh, just a scratchy throat.
The Doctor's treating me now.

284
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,782
Could you come to the Shuttle Bay
when you're finished?

285
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:32,909
I'll be right there.

286
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,410
Chakotay out.

287
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,415
Computer,
access the holodeck database

288
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,585
and locate Commander Chakotay's
holographic template.

289
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,004
Download the physical parameters
into my program.

290
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,606
[coughing]

291
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,943
You wanted to see me?

292
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,737
I've completed the diagnostic
as you requested.

293
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,156
The Flyer's com system
is functioning normally.

294
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,449
You find that unusual?

295
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,619
The Captain did report
that it was damaged

296
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,246
<i>during the attack</i>
<i>by the R'Kaal.</i>

297
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,206
[Chakotay]
<i>I'll have a talk with her.</i>

298
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,124
<i>Did you find anything else</i>
<i>out of the ordinary?</i>

299
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,125
[Tuvok]
<i>No.</i>

300
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,795
Get out of there
before you arouse suspicion.

301
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,422
I'll be on the Bridge
if you need me.

302
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,718
You're doing
a wonderful job, Doctor.

303
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,515
I'm just giving him
a little encouragement.

304
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,226
That's why <i>I'm </i>in command.

305
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,112
If all goes well, we should have
the warp core in less than six hours.

306
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,780
He's making excellent progress.

307
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,283
That's exactly what
he wants you to believe.

308
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,326
What do you mean?

309
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,871
Did you really think you could
outsmart a hologram?

310
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,335
Everything appears
to be normal.

311
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,547
How do you know you're not looking
at a holographic projection?

312
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,174
The Doctor isn't just
a physician.

313
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,427
His emergency command
subroutines

314
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,054
contain thousands
of tactical scenarios.

315
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,681
I wouldn't be surprised

316
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,100
if <i>Voyager </i>was already
on its way here.

317
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,853
You do have an option.

318
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,272
Leave me behind
in an escape pod,

319
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,108
and I'll forget
any of this ever happened.

320
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,111
Maybe we should let her go.

321
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,655
Are you delusional?

322
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,241
It took months to plan this.

323
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,744
We've already found a buyer
for the warp core.

324
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,579
Now you want
to abandon everything?

325
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,373
It's better than being sent
to a rehabilitation center.

326
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,252
We made our choice
when we stole this vessel.

327
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,754
I am not going back

328
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,797
to the Hierarchy,
and neither are you.

329
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,305
She's just trying to trick you.

330
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,558
A month from now,

331
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,479
we'll be soaking
in the mud baths of Eblar Prime.

332
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,357
Trust me.

333
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,945
[sizzle]

334
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,657
[Janeway's voice]
Janeway to Torres.

335
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,741
<i>Torres here.</i>

336
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,785
I'm having a little trouble
with my replicator again.

337
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,036
Can you take a look at it?

338
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,288
I'm still working on those
modifications you asked for.

339
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,748
I'll send somebody else.

340
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,793
I'd consider it a personal favor
if you'd do it yourself, Lieutenant.

341
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,753
<i>I'll be there in five minutes.</i>

342
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,713
Thank you.
Janeway out.

343
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,803
[normal voice] Computer, access
Lieutenant Torres' holographic template

344
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,555
and download the physical parameters
into my program.

345
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,987
Computer, access
medical file: Torres-3

346
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,948
and update
her holographic template.

347
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,476
Did you forget something,
Lieutenant?

348
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,645
I did, actually.

349
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,148
Where do we keep
the spare gel packs?

350
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,484
Locker Gamma 5.

351
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,737
Of course, Gamma 5.

352
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,532
On the upper level.

353
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,492
I know where it is, Ensign.

354
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,505
You left me no choice.

355
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,631
Lieutenant.

356
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,259
Oh, are we calling each other
by our rank now?

357
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,554
Uh, you startled me.

358
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,097
Oh, sorry.

359
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,391
Well, I thought
since you didn't have time

360
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,226
for lunch under the stars,

361
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,104
maybe you'd settle for the glow
of the warp core.

362
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,524
How thoughtful,

363
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,569
but I'm... not hungry.

364
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,238
Well, I'm sure the baby
is famished.

365
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,784
A pregnant woman
shouldn't eat this kind of food.

366
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,577
Do you want to give me
an arterial occlusion?

367
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,164
[scoffs] One drumstick
isn't going to kill you.

368
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,584
Besides, I won't tell the Doctor...

369
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,294
if you won't.

370
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,546
You know...

371
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,174
this all looks so delicious.

372
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,635
Why don't we save it
for a romantic dinner this evening?

373
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,304
All right.

374
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,598
1900 hours,
but if you're not there,

375
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,391
I'm sending Security after you.

376
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,769
I'll be there... sweetheart.

377
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,563
"Sweetheart"?

378
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,942
Well, aren't you getting affectionate
in your third trimester.

379
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,076
I'll see you later.

380
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,213
<i>Kim to Chakotay.</i>

381
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,673
<i>Can you come to Astrometrics?</i>

382
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,176
[Chakotay's voice] Harry,
I'll be right there. Chakotay out.

383
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,102
The transmission was encoded
with a false subspace signature.

384
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,020
The signal didn't originate
on another vessel.

385
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,106
It came from inside <i>Voyager.</i>

386
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,900
We traced it to Holodeck 2.

387
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,402
Do you know who sent it?

388
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,028
I'm on my way
to check the access logs.

389
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,947
I'll go with you.

390
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,743
Whoever sent this transmission
knew how to cover his tracks.

391
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,704
The holodeck logs
have been erased.

392
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,039
Doesn't look like
we'll get any answers here.

393
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,710
I might be able to find
some residual photonic displacement.

394
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,006
There we go.

395
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,217
I think I can clarify the image
with a recursive algorithm.

396
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,429
Our alien's a hologram.

397
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,472
The question is,
who programmed him?

398
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,474
Good work, Ensign.
I'll take it from here.

399
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,726
Wait a minute.

400
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,103
I'm picking up
two holographic signatures.

401
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,231
It looks like a second image
was superimposed

402
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,316
over an existing template.

403
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,611
I'll see if I can isolate
the first image.

404
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,403
["Blue Danube Waltz" playing]

405
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,489
[sighs]

406
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,039
Doctor...

407
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,332
what are you doing?

408
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,126
<i>If you don't mind,</i>

409
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,796
I've had a stressful day.

410
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,006
[music continues]

411
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,512
I'm extremely busy, Commander.

412
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,471
<i>This will only take a moment.</i>

413
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,891
<i>I've been reviewing</i>
<i>the communication logs.</i>

414
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,560
<i>There's a discrepancy</i>
<i>I was hoping you could explain.</i>

415
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,147
At the precise moment the Flyer
transmitted a deflector pulse,

416
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,984
you apparently accessed
<i>Voyager's </i>holographic database.

417
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,030
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

418
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,241
Your access code was used

419
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,451
to download the Captain's
physical parameters.

420
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,914
Exactly what are you insinuating,
Commander?

421
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,958
Perhaps we should have
a word with the Captain.

422
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:01,917
Fine.

423
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,965
Computer,
deactivate the EMH.

424
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,342
<i>EMH protocols are off-line.</i>

425
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,511
Security to Sick Bay.
Remain where you are.

426
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,723
You haven't forgotten
I'm a hologram, have you?

427
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,104
If necessary, I'll disable
all of your holo-emitters.

428
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,944
Computer, transfer the EMH
to the mobile emitter!

429
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,905
All hands, Red Alert.

430
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,824
Security teams,
apprehend the Doctor.

431
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,458
Computer,
open the holodeck doors.

432
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,959
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

433
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,378
<i>Access to the holodeck</i>
<i>has been restricted.</i>

434
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,756
Security override:
Tuvok-sigma-four.

435
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,261
Computer, end program.

436
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,682
<i>Unable to comply.</i>
<i>Holodeck controls are off-line.</i>

437
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,978
Tuvok to Engineering.
Shut down power to Holodeck 2.

438
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,107
It looks like the Doctor's
rerouted the power relays.

439
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,650
It'll take a minute to bypass them.

440
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:13,489
Doctor, I've reconfigured my phaser
to disrupt your holo-matrix.

441
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,617
Surrender yourself now.

442
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:27,836
Tuvok to Bridge.

443
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,380
<i>Can you locate the Doctor</i>
<i>on internal sensors?</i>

444
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,091
I'm not reading him.

445
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,468
He must've masked
his signature somehow.

446
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,595
<i>Try scanning for the polydeutonic</i>
<i>alloy in his emitter.</i>

447
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,765
Shut down all turbolifts
and transporters.

448
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,100
[Paris]
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

449
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,271
Get your people out of here.
The core's about to breach.

450
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,065
I'm not detecting
an overload.

451
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,691
You're getting false readings.

452
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,860
The Doctor's reprogrammed
your sensors.

453
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,613
All right, everybody out!
Now! Move it!

454
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,699
You too, B'Elanna.

455
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,452
I might be able to stabilize
the containment field.

456
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,454
You're not putting
your baby in danger. Go!

457
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,958
-You'd better be right behind me.
-<i>Paris to Torres.</i>

458
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,293
<i>I'm picking up the Doctor's</i>
<i>emitter in your section.</i>

459
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,879
-Where?
<i>-Right next to the warp core.</i>

460
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,436
Computer...

461
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,814
activate Emergency
Command Hologram.

462
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,277
<i>All command codes have been</i>
<i>transferred to the ECH.</i>

463
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,444
Prepare to eject the warp core.

464
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,447
Authorization: ECH-omega-four-two.

465
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,951
Doctor, don't do this.

466
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,744
[computer]
<i>Warp ejection system enabled.</i>

467
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,247
Computer... eject the core.

468
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,547
Computer, lock on
to my mobile emitter

469
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,465
and transport me
to the Delta Flyer.

470
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,467
<i>Transporters are off-line.</i>

471
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,766
Tuvok, we just lost main power,
and internal sensors are down.

472
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,978
The Doctor has entered
Jefferies Tube 11-Alpha.

473
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,231
Send a security team
to the Shuttle Bay.

474
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,691
[grunting]

475
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,986
[panting]

476
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,161
Lieutenant.

477
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,039
I think the Doctor's heading
for the escape pods.

478
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,629
You wouldn't shoot
a pregnant woman, would you?

479
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,214
Come with me, Doctor.

480
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,687
Tuvok, someone's
launching the Flyer.

481
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,774
<i>Tuvok?</i>

482
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,833
Ow!

483
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,045
[sighs]

484
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,595
You might try disconnecting
the phase discriminator.

485
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,435
[laughs]

486
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,771
I've rebuilt dozens
of these units,

487
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,565
but I've never seen
this configuration before.

488
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,526
Do you know how I can
stabilize the ion flow?

489
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,784
That looks like
the charge inverter.

490
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,830
Thank you.

491
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,081
You're welcome.

492
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,458
Your ship must need
a lot of replacement parts.

493
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,878
Oh... those aren't for this ship.

494
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,840
I've been collecting and repairing
spare components for years.

495
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,843
This is from an old
impulse drive.

496
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,512
Would you believe I found it
sitting in a waste depository?

497
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,307
I'll be able to find a buyer
now that it's working.

498
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,392
These parts could be worth
a small fortune.

499
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,477
That's exactly what I think.

500
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,689
I'm going to use
my quarter of the profits

501
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,443
to establish an outpost specializing
in obsolete engine components.

502
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,445
I'm certain
there's a demand for them.

503
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,072
My Chief Engineer is always
looking for spare parts.

504
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,409
She might be interested
in acquiring your entire inventory.

505
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,577
[Alien 1]
Captain.

506
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,245
[clucking tongue]

507
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,541
You're not trying to take advantage
of my subordinate, are you?

508
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,212
No one's ever going
to buy this junk.

509
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,590
It's almost as useless as you.

510
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,966
<i>[beeping]</i>

511
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,676
There's a ship approaching.

512
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,264
This is the Delta Flyer.

513
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,390
I've got the warp core,

514
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,893
<i>but you're not getting it</i>
<i>until you release the Captain.</i>

515
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,317
Are you insane?

516
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,569
You almost destabilized
the core.

517
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,321
Both of our ships
would've been destroyed!

518
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,198
This isn't a negotiation!

519
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,450
Release your tractor beam now!

520
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,702
All right.

521
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,542
It's in the Cargo Hold.

522
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,089
Lower your shields, and we'll
beam your Captain to you.

523
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,384
[computer beeps]

524
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,760
Ready.

525
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,349
We had an agreement.

526
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,894
[laughing]
To spare your Captain.

527
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,438
As you can see,
she's still alive.

528
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,816
Let the Doctor go.
I'm the more valuable hostage.

529
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,526
Actually, you're not.

530
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,237
We'll leave you
in the Vinri system.

531
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,156
The inhabitants are
mostly harmless.

532
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,450
The Doctor will be
working for us now.

533
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,160
I'll do no such thing.

534
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,037
I'm sure you'll feel differently

535
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,332
after I make a few adjustments
to your program.

536
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,047
I had no idea
he was going to do this.

537
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,382
I'm sorry.

538
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:11,179
I hope you realize you've stranded
<i>Voyager </i>in the Delta Quadrant.

539
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,598
What did you expect me to do,
let them kill you?

540
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,143
I expected you
to follow my orders.

541
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,854
You might as well have been ordering me
to put a phaser to your head.

542
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:24,067
<i>Voyager </i>can survive without a warp core,
but not without a captain.

543
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,320
Now it doesn't have either.

544
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,709
[Tuvok] <i>Chief Tactical Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54890.7.</i>

545
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,295

546
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:47,090
<i>I've had to order a section-by-section</i>
<i>search for our missing crew members.</i>

547
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,676
<i>Until main power is restored,</i>

548
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,221
Voyager <i>remains immobilized</i>
<i>and defenseless.</i>

549
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,153
They're just unconscious.

550
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,280
Paris to Tuvok.

551
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,657
I found them.

552
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,326
It is logical to assume

553
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,453
the Captain never returned
from the away mission.

554
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,538
Do you have any idea
where the Flyer is?

555
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,457
The Doctor masked his ion trail.

556
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,959
Engineering to Chakotay.

557
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:23,877
<i>Go ahead.</i>

558
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,879
We're ready to restart
the impulse reactors.

559
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,380
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

560
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,552
["Blue Danube Waltz" playing]

561
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,059
[discordant notes]

562
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,696
[music continues
with discordant notes]

563
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,492
It's playing on every
com channel on the ship.

564
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,202
Computer, pause music.

565
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,620
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

566
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,499
Didn't the Doctor play this
at his recital last month?

567
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,545
Yes, and as I recall,
he performed the piece flawlessly.

568
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,631
Maybe the recording was
damaged by the power loss.

569
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,968
Or perhaps the Doctor altered
the music deliberately.

570
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,886
Why would he do that?

571
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,639
I performed a Fourier analysis
on the recording.

572
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,391
The harmonics
have been modified.

573
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,142
It could be a com frequency.

574
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,936
Unlikely.
There's no carrier wave.

575
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,022
I could be wrong, but it looks
like a warp signature.

576
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,108
The power utilization curve
would be about right.

577
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,734
Try scanning for it.

578
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,530
I'm detecting
a matching signature.

579
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,700
Distance: 6.7 light-years.

580
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,660
We can't follow them
at impulse.

581
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,663
You and Tom take a shuttle.

582
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,637
What are you doing?

583
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,306
If I can amplify your matrix,

584
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,933
I might be able to disrupt
the force field.

585
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,147
I'm sorry I put us
in this position, Captain.

586
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,858
You said you wanted us
to spend more time together.

587
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,444
This isn't what I had in mind.

588
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,365
Maybe... if we get
back to the ship,

589
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,242
we could try
socializing a little more.

590
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,121
This really isn't the place
to be talking about this.

591
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,707
Besides, I don't do
a lot of socializing.

592
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,376
You have meals with
Commander Chakotay...

593
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,712
...and you play velocity
with Seven.

594
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,298
We going to have
to discuss this later.

595
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,425
I need to upload
your first assignment.

596
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,642
[sighs]

597
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,856
You want me to infiltrate
the Hierarchy's surveillance complex?

598
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,776
The data stored there is worth
a hundred warp cores.

599
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,362
How do you expect me to get past
their security perimeter?

600
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,280
I'm glad you asked.

601
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,497
I trust this won't be
permanent?

602
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,999
I've given you the rank
of a Class-One Overseer.

603
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,669
You'll be able to walk into Central
Command without anyone noticing.

604
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,921
I've also uploaded several other
holographic templates

605
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,089
you might find useful.

606
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,258
What's wrong?

607
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,385
I'm not certain.

608
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,804
The compression algorithms
are breaking down.

609
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,390
I told you his program
couldn't handle that much data.

610
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,227
[various voices, garbled]
What have you done to me?

611
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,949
I'm detecting
a human life sign aboard...

612
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,327
and a holographic
signature.

613
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,454
The vessel's weapons
are polaron-based,

614
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,581
and they have
auto-regenerative shielding.

615
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,710
We still have
the element of surprise.

616
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,420
If you don't get him
back to <i>Voyager,</i>

617
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,255
his matrix will be
permanently damaged.

618
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,801
Please do something.

619
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,429
He won't be any use to us
if he decompiles.

620
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,402
Someone's boarded
the Delta Flyer.

621
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,653
They're moving away.

622
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,155
Fire at both vessels.

623
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,494
Now, Mr. Paris!

624
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,457
[alarm blaring]

625
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,876
Our shield generator
isn't going to last.

626
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,129
If we give them what they want,
maybe they'll leave.

627
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,384
Prepare to jettison
their warp core.

628
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,849
What are you doing?

629
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,476
Arming a torpedo.

630
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,602
If we detonate their core,

631
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,146
the blast wave should give us
enough time to escape.

632
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,481
That would kill them.

633
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,113
Captain, get down!

634
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,282
[grunting]

635
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,957
Lieutenant, lock a tractor beam
onto the core and get it back to <i>Voyager.</i>

636
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:13,875
[Paris]
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

637
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,335

[both grunting]

641
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,642
Nar, get this hologram off me!

642
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,487
Guess this wasn't so useless
after all.

643
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,203
[groans]

644
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,374
Are you still interested
in acquiring my inventory?

645
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,470
Computer, transfer the EMH
back into the holodeck buffer.

646
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,264
Can you stabilize
his matrix?

647
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,975
Not until we purge
the excess subroutines.

648
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,520
There's more than a thousand
teraquads of new data in here.

649
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,940
-How is he?
-We're not sure yet.

650
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,361
Captain,
if I don't survive,

651
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,779
I need you to do
something for me.

652
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,780
You're going to be all right.

653
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,658
If I'm not, when you reach Earth,

654
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,578
I want you to donate my emitter
to the Daystrom Institute.

655
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,454
They may be able
to replicate it someday

656
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,666
so that other holograms can know
the freedom I've enjoyed.

657
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,753
I've had something
on my conscience for a long time.

658
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,047
After I was first activated,

659
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,883
I kept a record
of what I considered to be

660
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,552
your most... questionable
command decisions.

661
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,804
It's in my personal database.

662
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,849
I hope you'll delete the file
without reading it.

663
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:58,354
Mr. Tuvok... I violated
the most sacred trust

664
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,106
between a physician
and his patient.

665
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,441
I told Mr. Neelix

666
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,485
about the cutaneous eruption
you developed on your...

667
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,282
That was indiscreet.

668
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,326
I hope you can forgive me.

669
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,079
Ensign... at your recital
last month,

670
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,290
I told Lieutenant Torres
that your saxophone playing

671
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,459
reminded me of a wounded targ.

672
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,587
I should've put it more delicately.
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,465
Seven...

674
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,175
You should remain still.

675
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,761
You have no idea
how difficult it's been

676
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,512
hiding my true feelings
all these years,

677
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,849
averting my eyes during
your regular maintenance exams.

678
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,937
I know you could never have
the same feelings for me,

679
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,605
but I want you to know the truth.

680
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,773
I love you, Seven.

681
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,321
Your cognitive algorithms
are malfunctioning.

682
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,824
Goodbye, my friends.

683
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,326
Speak well of me.

684
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,664
-Is he...?
-No, I've got him.

685
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,838
What happened?

686
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,299
I deleted the extraneous subroutines.

687
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,010
I'm not going to decompile?

688
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,888
You'll probably outlive us all.

00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,289
<i>He hasn't left Sick Bay once</i>
<i>since he returned to the ship.</i>

696
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,714
Captain...
do you need...

697
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,048
do you need
medical attention?

698
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,133
No.

699
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,343
You've been keeping
to yourself lately.

700
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,138
Your friends
are worried about you.

701
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,270
After my deathbed confession,

702
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,106
I wasn't sure
I had any friends left.

703
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,861
I overstepped my bounds
in documenting your command decisions.

704
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,405
It happened a long time ago,

705
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,991
before I considered myself
to be a part of your crew.

706
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,951
Oh, I'm not here
to make you grovel.

707
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,787
I'm here to punish you for your
insubordinate behavior.

708
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,039
I understand.

709
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,626
You're hereby denied the use
of your mobile emitter for six days.

710
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,130
Since you haven't left
Sick Bay for a week,

711
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,882
we'll call it time served.

712
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,885
I appreciate the gesture, Captain,

713
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,720
but I've got a lot of work
to catch up on.

714
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,263
I'm sorry to hear that.

715
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,808
I was hoping you might be free
for a cup of coffee on the holodeck.

716
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:44,187
I know a little sidewalk café
in Buenos Aires.

717
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,441
You said you wanted us
to socialize more.

718
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,904
I suppose Mr. Paris
can finish this.

719
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,448
Now, when you're on
the holodeck with the Captain,

720
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,034
-there are two rules you have to follow.
-I understand.

721
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,994
First: leave your rank
at the door.

722
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,496
Not a problem.
The second?

723
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,580
No opera.

724
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,415
Hmm.
