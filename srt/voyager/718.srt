[playing classical music]

3
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,782
Feels heavy.

4
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,743
-Baby's first tricorder?
-Not exactly.

5
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,496
Hmm...

6
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,295
Thank you.

7
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,589
I'm sure she'll love it.

8
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,925
-What is it?
-A pleenok.

9
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,261
Vulcans use them to train
their infants in primary logic.

10
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,598
Never too early to train
those synapses, eh, Tuvok?

11
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,226
Here, let me see that.
I love a good puzzle.

12
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,354
This one's from Mr. Kim.

13
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,067
[laughing]

14
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,239
-Starfleet diapers.
-Standard issue.

15
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,282
[laughter]

16
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,953
[Paris] At least we'll know who to call
if there's a containment breach.

17
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,706
Now that your Borg implants
have been removed,

18
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,875
you might think about having children
of your own one day.

19
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,711
One day.

20
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,505
I have been considering
some less radical changes

21
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,757
-in my personal life.
-Such as?

22
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,344
I realize I don't have a rank,
but I would like to request a uniform.

23
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,638
Consider it done.

24
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,349
The Doctor tells me you don't need
to regenerate anymore.

25
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,226
I can arrange some quarters for you,

26
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,354
unless you enjoy curling up
in the cargo bay.

27
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,773
A bed would be more comfortable.

28
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,194
Since I arrived on<i> Voyager,</i>

29
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,196
your guidance has been invaluable.

30
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,990
Thank you, Captain.

31
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,285
All I did was chart the course.

32
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,203
You were the one
who made the journey.

33
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,165
[Chakotay]
Seven.

34
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,376
It's traditional for everyone to share
their best wishes for the baby.

35
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,086
I thought you might like to start.

36
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,928
To the newest member of our crew...

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,931
may all her desires be fulfilled
except for one...

38
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,267
so she'll always have
something to strive for.

39
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,977
-Oh, very good.
-Well said.

40
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,729
Hear, hear.

41
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,274
And may she inherit a sense of logic
from her mother.

42
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,359
I'll drink to that.

43
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,111
[laughter]

44
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,822
-[console beeps]
-That was strange.

45
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,199
Care to explain?

46
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,575
I wish I could.

47
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,536
Long-range sensors picked up
an energy discharge,

48
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,163
-but now it's gone.
-[console beeps]

49
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,540
There. There's another one.

50
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,418
They're occurring approximately
5.9 light-years ahead.

51
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,254
-Source?
-We're too far to get a clear reading.

52
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,049
-Bridge to Seven of Nine.
-Go ahead.

53
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,803
<i>-Report to the Astrometrics Lab.</i>
-Acknowledged.

54
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,680
Computer, end program.

55
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,027
I wasn't able to find the cause
of the discharges,

56
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,072
but the region ahead contains
unusual amounts of subspace radiation

57
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,324
-and metallic debris.
-Vessels?

58
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,992
Not within range,

59
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,078
but I'll have more data
once we move closer.

60
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,914
I see no reason to alter course.
Keep an eye on your sensors.

61
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,291
-Yes, Captain.
-Now...

62
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,918
on to more pressing matters.

63
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,753
Does B'Elanna suspect anything?

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,506
-Not a clue.
-Good. Mess Hall, 1400 hours.

65
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,591
Be on time; I don't want
to spoil the surprise.

66
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,844
I expect both of you to show up.

67
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,095
I'll be busy here.

68
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,515
What's wrong, Seven?
No baby showers in the collective?

69
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,476
I'm sure you can spare a few minutes.

70
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,312
[Paris clears throat]

71
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,773
If it's any consolation,

72
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,484
I share your discomfort
with social gatherings.

73
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,778
They seem to occur
with alarming frequency.

74
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,115
Mr. Neelix would argue
that they improve morale.

75
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,744
I have been looking for ways
to improve my social skills.

76
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,664
Perhaps I'll attend.

77
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,002
Well, it certainly is, uh... efficient.

78
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,588
No clutter.

79
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,342
Plenty of room to move around.

80
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,510
[chuckles]

81
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,139
But it's a little impersonal.
Don't you think?

82
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,807
Explain.

83
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,350
Well, these are your quarters, Seven.

84
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,020
They should reflect your individuality.

85
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,648
How about a table
and a couple of chairs?

86
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,027
Give yourself a place to work...
entertain guests.

87
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,488
Uh, try to add a little color.

88
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,367
Uh, photographs,
uh, artwork, knickknacks.

89
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,119
-Knickknacks?
-Little things,

90
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,496
like the wood carvings
in Ensign Kim's quarters.

91
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,499
I've never been
to Ensign Kim's quarters.

92
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,668
But I suppose I could
replicate some items

93
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,419
and disperse them
throughout the room.

94
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,339
That's a start.

95
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,675
Some people like to display
pictures of family and friends.

96
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,969
There's a photograph of my parents
in the ship's database.

97
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,347
I'll make a copy
and place it in a frame.

98
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,556
Good, good.

99
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,810
A multispectral starchart
might enhance this bulkhead.

100
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,687
Or a painting.

101
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,272
A painting of a starchart.

102
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,944
I was thinking of something
more abstract, more, uh, artistic.

103
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,862
Drapes.

104
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,698
Nothing livens up a room
like good window dressing.

105
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,575
Not to mention the added privacy.

106
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,244
Privacy? We're in space.

107
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,289
Well, you never know when we'll be
docking at a crowded spaceport.

108
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,418
But we'll have to make sure
that they match the carpet.

109
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,879
I'm thinking of
a Talaxian mosaic, uh,

110
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,173
tulaberry blue stripes
with an orange inlay...

111
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,092
I appreciate your aesthetic insights,

112
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,469
but I believe I can proceed on my own.

113
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,763
-[door chimes]
-Enter.

114
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,392
Am I interrupting?

115
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,018
Please come in.

116
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,688
Love what you've done
with the place.

117
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,773
We're in the process of decorating.

118
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,858
Maybe this will help.

119
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,654
Consider it a housewarming gift.

120
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,698
It's beautiful. What is it?

121
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,782
A dreamcatcher.

122
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,786
According to Native American mythology,
it wards off nightmares.

123
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,454
I'm impressed.

124
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,916
I've familiarized myself
with your culture.

125
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,877
Now that you'll be sleeping
instead of regenerating,

126
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,587
I thought it might come in handy.

127
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,590
I'm sure it will. Thank you.

128
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,261
I'll let you two
find a place to hang that.

129
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,597
But it would look perfect
right above the bed.

130
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,351
Pleasant dreams.

131
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,771
[door opens, closes]

132
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,440
It was thoughtful of you to stop by.

133
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,442
On move-in day?
I wouldn't miss it.

134
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,611
I suppose this makes you
my inaugural guest.

135
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,573
I'd be a negligent host if I didn't
offer you a beverage.

136
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,824
Tea?

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,744
That might be difficult.

138
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,496
No replicator.

139
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,875
Another flaw in the decor.

140
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,960
I'll requisition one for you
first thing tomorrow.

141
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,962
I'd appreciate that, Commander.

142
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,049
Chakotay.

143
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,260
We're off-duty.
We can drop the formalities.

144
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,471
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,181
[chuckles softly]

146
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,059
I enjoyed your toast today.

147
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,686
You've come a long way.
I hope to see more.

148
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,481
You will.

149
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,942
Good night.

150
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,819
Chakotay.

151
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,072
As you might know,

152
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,824
I've taken an interest
in culinary science.

153
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,534
I'm preparing a meal
tomorrow night,

154
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,662
and I thought perhaps
you could attend...

155
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,331
to evaluate my work.

156
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,999
I'd be happy to.

157
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,667
1900 hours?

158
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,253
I'll bring the wine...
and the furniture.

159
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,421
Then you accept?

160
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,673
It's a date.

165

Are you trying to soothe the infant
or traumatize her?

166
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,329
The lyrics are rather grim,
but it's the melody they respond to.

167
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,500
I recorded 29 in all,
including a couple of Klingon lullabies.

168
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,545
My favorite is "quong vaj Ocht."

169
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,547
"Sleep, Little Warrior."

170
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,674
I could tell by the look
on their faces

171
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,301
that my gift made quite an impression.

172
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,971
-No doubt.
-I wish you'd been there.

173
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,097
It was a lovely shower.

174
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,642
Tom and B'Elanna were disappointed
that you didn't attend.

175
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,602
I was occupied.

176
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,730
Are you experiencing
any shoulder pain?

177
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,108
-Yes.
-Hmm.

178
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,861
Your biradial clamp is out
of alignment by .3 microns.

179
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,737
I'm afraid it'll have to be repaired.

180
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,031
Can't you simply extract
the component?

181
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,534
Not if you want to keep
using that arm.

182
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,618
[sighs]

183
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,371
I know it's an inconvenience,
but until we can find a way

184
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,457
to remove your cybernetic systems,
they'll have to be maintained.

185
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,711
It's a minor procedure.
We might as well take care of it now.

186
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,296
I prefer to wait.

187
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,298
We'll be done in an hour.

188
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,966
I have research to complete.

189
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,135
Oh.

190
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,181
I suppose we can put it off
until next week's physical.

191
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,602
I also noticed that your electrolyte
levels are down by 12 percent.

192
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,813
Have you missed
any regeneration cycles?

193
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,107
-Last night.
-Don't tell me.

194
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,402
More... research?

195
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,363
This must be some project.

196
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,490
Mind if I ask what you're working on?

197
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,492
-It's complicated.
-How do you mean?

198
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,287
My personal life
is none of your concern.

199
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,459
I wasn't aware you had a personal life.

200
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,920
Report?

201
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,924
It was an energy discharge,
200,000 kilometers starboard.

202
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,884
[Tuvok] It produced
a level-9 shock wave.

203
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,260
Some kind of weapon?

204
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,595
[Tuvok]
Possibly.

205
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,889
Another one,
five million kilometers to port.

206
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,974
A shock wave is approaching.

207
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,185
Full power to the shields.

208
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,443
Our warp field's destabilizing.

209
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,988
I'm detecting another.
Distance 50,000 kilometers.

210
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,533
Turn our bow into the wave front.
It'll minimize the damage.

211
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,995
Sorry, Captain,
there wasn't enough time.

212
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,580
We've lost warp drive.

213
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm reading another.
Distance 26 million kilometers.

214
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,335
Too far to pose a threat.

215
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,338
If they are weapons, they don't seem
to be directed at us.

216
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,675
Or whoever's firing them
is a lousy shot.

217
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,262
[Seven] Astrometric sensors
recorded the explosions.

218
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,641
I believe it's
a long-range subspace warhead.

219
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,185
The debris in this region
suggests that dozens have been fired

220
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,478
in the last several weeks.

221
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,064
The warhead destroyed something.
What was it?

222
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,483
It appeared to be
an unmanned probe.

223
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,403
This is all very intriguing,
but I'd just as soon get out of here

224
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,530
before we cross paths
with another one of these things.

225
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,990
Where do we stand on repairs?

226
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,075
Subspace radiation from the explosions

227
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,911
is making it difficult
to create a stable warp field.

228
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,871
Lieutenant Torres estimates 48 hours.

229
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,165
Can you find a way
to detect the warheads

230
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,002
-before they emerge from subspace?
-I believe so.

231
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,087
The weapons create
minor gravimetric distortions

232
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,548
as they approach
the subspace barrier,

233
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,050
but I'll need to recalibrate my sensors
to isolate the effect.

234
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,553
Do it. Even a few seconds'
warning would help us.

235
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,638
Yes, Captain.

236
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,772
Your duty shift
doesn't begin for two hours.

237
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,608
The Doctor sent me
to relieve you early.

238
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,611
He wants you to spend
more time regenerating.

239
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,990
I see he's enlisted an ally.

240
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,451
"Don't kill the messenger."

241
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,953
It's Sophocles-- <i>Oedipus Rex.</i>

242
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,374
I've been studying Earth literature
as a part of my Academy training.

243
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,793
[sighs]

244
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,254
Continue these scans
of the subspace barrier.

245
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,214
Look for any gravimetric distortions.

246
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,533
Run another diagnostic
on the injector ports.

247
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,494
-Make sure they're aligned.
-They're aligned. I checked.

248
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,162
Check again.

249
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,624
Come to join the fun? We're trying
to cold-start the warp core...

250
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,584
for the 15th time.

251
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,337
Perhaps this will enhance your day.

252
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,507
It's a belated gift
for your baby shower.

253
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,094
-I apologize for my absence.
-Oh.

254
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,970
Proceed.

255
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,812
They're lined
with biothermal insulation.

256
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,314
Your infant's feet will be protected,
even if the external temperature

257
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,733
drops below minus 40 degrees Celsius.

258
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,362
Well, they're certainly unique.

259
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,948
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

260
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,746
I wish to ask you
a personal question.

261
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,415
Shoot.

262
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,339
You have an appealing coiffure.
What is your grooming regimen?

263
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,635
You're asking me what
I do with my hair?

264
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,345
Yes.

265
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,391
Oh, well, nothing too elaborate.

266
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,394
Sonic shower...
a little engine grease.

267
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,272
Thinking about a new look?

268
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,149
Perhaps.

269
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,608
I'll keep you apprised
if you'd like.

270
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,735
Please do.

271
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,241
Was that Seven of Nine?

272
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,827
There must be an alien intruder onboard.

273

Give me a hand with this?

281
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,072
I'm surprised your Starfleet training
didn't include cork extraction.

282
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,408
I must have been sick that day.

Unless you brought a phaser.

00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,128
Never on the first date.

287
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,048
Assist me.

288
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,391
Slice these vegetables transversally
in five-millimeter increments.

289
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,101
Aye, aye.

290
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,605
That smells delicious.

291
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,399
Our appetizer is braised leeks.

292

Primary course, rack of lamb
with wild rice.

293
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,862
No dessert?

294
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,740
Dessert will be a surprise.

295
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,577
I can't wait.

296
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,498
Does this contain enough
sodium chloride for your taste?

297
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,842
Could use another .6 milligrams,

298
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,928
but you're the chef.

299
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,855
I concur. More salt.

301
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,491
Chopin.

302
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,078
I've discovered that classical music
has intriguing mathematical properties.

303
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,871
Do you play an instrument?

304
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,082
The Doctor's been
giving me piano lessons.

305
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,418
I'd love to hear you play.

307
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,177
Your technique is flawed.

but you've got
a wonderful smile.

315

It wasn't a smile;
it was a smirk.

00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,106
Oh, no, it was a smile.

317
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,984

00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,323
Titus Livius,
<i>A History of Rome.</i>

354
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,533
You're relieved.

355
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,287
[sighs]

356
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,997
Get some rest.

357
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,423
[door opens, closes]

358
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,175

361
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,867
-[sighs] Bravo.
-You approve?

362
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:33,411
Approve? I'm amazed.

363
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,874
I was expecting "Chopsticks."
I had no idea you were so good.

364
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,627
The Doctor's an efficient instructor.

365
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,297
It won't be long before you're giving
a recital for the entire crew.

366
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,674
The Doctor did suggest
that I accompany him

367
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,469
during his next operatic performance.

368
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,930
Your turn.

369
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,934
Mmm... unfortunately,
I don't play.

370
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,019
But I'd love to hear you again.

371
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,396
And this...

372
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,439
is one of my favorites.

373
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,322
[metronome ticking]

376
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,300
You want me to stop?

377
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,929
No. I want you to play.

378
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,515
I don't understand.

379
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,517
Look.

380
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,228
Your technique is flawless,

381
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,897
but try to put a little
more heart into the piece.

382
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,691
More of yourself.

383
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,364

-[music stops]
-[laughs] That's all right.

386
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,872
Keep going.

387
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,583
[music resumes]

388
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,133
Tell me what you're feeling.

389
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,927
-My tempo is erratic.
-Not what you're thinking.

390
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,680
What you're feeling.

391
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,598
Your emotions.

392
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,892
Frustration, anxiety.

393
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,729
Stop thinking about the notes.
Just play.

394
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,273
-[music stops]
-I can't.

395
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,026
Yes, you can.

396
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,069
Don't you see what's happening?

397
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,655
The metronome is holding you back.

398
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,240
It gives you a sense of order,

399
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,409
but it also cuts you off
from your feelings.

400
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,163
Remember when you first came aboard?

401
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,167
The thought of disconnecting
from the hive mind terrified you.

402
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,878
This is no different.

403
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,130
It doesn't have to be perfect.

404
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,015
[music begins]

405

Bridge to Seven of Nine.

408
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:31,965
[Seven]
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

409
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,842
We need those sensor calibrations.

410
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,762
I'll need a moment to return
to my station.

411
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,847
That would be a good idea.

412
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,983
Hull fracture, Deck 12.

413
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,652
Seven of Nine, report.

414
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,112
[Seven]
<i>Stand by, Captain.</i>

415
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,826
Lieutenant Paris, isolate
subspace band omicron theta.

416
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,661
Acknowledged.

417
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,621
Direct your sensors
to coordinates 178 mark 26.

418
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,291
Nothing there.

419
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,628
Correction 178 mark 36.

420
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,965
I can see them.

421
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,884
Two warheads are about to emerge.
Adjusting course.

422
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,262
Full power to the forward shields.

423
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,888
Impact in five...

424
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,475
four... three... two...

425
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,482
Shields are holding.

426
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,734
Why wasn't Seven at her post?

427
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,945
Good question.
Maybe you should ask her.

428
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,160
It was your responsibility
to locate those warheads.

429
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,579
-I succeeded.
-Not before we took heavy damage.

430
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,958
You told Chakotay you'd have
those sensor calibrations hours ago.

431
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,419
The work took longer
than I anticipated.

432
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,046
It might've gone faster
if you'd stayed at your post,

433
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,423
as you were ordered to do.

434
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,593
I didn't realize I was confined
to the Astrometrics Lab.

435
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,887
You were on duty.

436
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,559
This isn't the first time you've left
your station over the past few days.

437
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,812
Holodeck 2?

438
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,900
You've logged a lot of time in there.
Mind if I ask why?

439
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,362
Well, it must be
something important, Seven.

440
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,825
Forty-nine hours in six days?

441
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,452
I was running a simulation.

442
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,370
Of what?

443
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,169
A new gravimetric array
I've been developing.

444
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:36,006
I wanted to perfect the design
before I brought it to you.

445
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:39,635
I appreciate your efforts
to improve our systems,

446
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,762
but I can't have you
dividing your time right now.

447
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,514
When the ship's on alert, I expect you
to perform your duties.

448
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:48,227
If you need to leave your post,
inform Commander Chakotay. Understood?

449
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,145
Yes, Captain.

450
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,856
I apologize for my lapse
in judgment.

451
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,400
We all make mistakes, Seven.

452
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,154
I've even been known
to make a few myself.

453
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,576
It sounds intriguing.

454
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,079
Your new gravimetric array.

455
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,082
When this crisis is over,
I'd be happy to take a look.

456
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,209
Maybe I can lend a hand.

457
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,895
I've analyzed the sensor data
from that last barrage.

458
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,314
I've refined your detection method.

459
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:41,071
We'll be able to see the weapons
10.3 seconds earlier.

460
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,115
The Captain will be pleased.

461
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,203
Have I offended you?

462
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,460
No. You've done nothing wrong.

463
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,090
I was negligent in my duties.

464
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,759
As a result,
<i>Voyager</i> was nearly destroyed.

465
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,307
I was hoping you could
provide a quotation

466
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,225
to help alleviate my guilt.

467
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,479
I can't think of one,

468
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,024
but I'd be happy
to search the database.

469
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,986
That won't be necessary.

470
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,783
Stay here until I return.

471
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,869
Where are you going?

472
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,580
To correct an error.

473
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,684
Computer, activate Chakotay simulation.

474

[door chimes]

475
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,441
Come in.

476
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,528
I hope you're not allergic.

477
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,531
Antarian moon blossoms.
Extremely rare.

478
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,450
I had to smuggle them
out of Airponics.

479
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,827
Don't tell Neelix.

480
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,041
I thought I'd cook for you tonight.

481
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,543
How does roasted chicken sound?

482
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,631
I slaved over the replicator for hours.

483
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,387
Not hungry?

484
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,350
I called you here to thank you.

485
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,935
For what?

486
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,732
The past few days
have been memorable.

487
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,777
To say the least.

488
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,035
You're ending this.

489
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,496
In a manner of speaking, yes.

490
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,582
Why?

491
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,169
Our relationship is interfering
with my responsibilities on<i> Voyager.</i>

492
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,714
I could speak to the Captain,
have her cut back on your duty shifts.

493
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,511
Seven, the past few days
have been more than memorable.

494
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,097
They've been an important step forward
for both of us.

495
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,057
Don't throw that away.

496
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,517
I'm sorry, Commander.

497
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,686
You're making a mistake.

498
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,231
No, I'm trying to correct one.

499
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,783
Ask yourself why
you want to end this.

500
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,411
Is it out of a sense of duty...

501
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,079
or something else?

502
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,583
Every time you move closer
to your emotions, you back away.

503
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,586
-Like hiding behind that metronome.
-Your analogy is flawed.

504
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,546
Is it?

505
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,840
I think you're afraid
that embracing your humanity

506
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,260
will make you weak,
less than perfect.

507
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,345
But think about what
you stand to gain.

508
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,346
It's irrelevant.

509
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,015
No, it's not.

510
00:32:55,182 --> 00:33:00,145
Real intimacy with another person--
nothing's more relevant.

00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,732

-Stay here with me.
-This ship needs me.

-So do I.
-I can't function this way!

you're human!

00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,186
We were having an argument,
and she just collapsed.

526
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:45,232
Her cortical node is shutting down.
She's going into neural shock.

527
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,567
And what happened
to her facial implants?

528
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,861
I thought you removed
all her cybernetic systems.

Computer, end program.

00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,265
Commander?

531
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,142
If you're looking for
your other holographic friend,

532
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,603
he's off-line at the moment.

533
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,191
Your cortical node
began to shut down.

534
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:32,195
Fortunately, I managed to stabilize it
before there was any permanent damage.

535
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,115
It was functioning properly
when you examined me two days ago.

536
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,410
I'm going to run a diagnostic
on your entire cortical array.

537
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,830
But it might help if I knew what
you were doing before you collapsed.

538
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,040
Did you suffer a physical injury
of some kind?

539
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,458
No.

540
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,252
Were you exposed
to any unusual radiation?

541
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,378
No.

542
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,256
What exactly were you doing in there?

543
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,926
Research.

544
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,599
That simulation of Commander Chakotay

545
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,603
mentioned that the two of you
were having an argument.

546
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,188
Was that part of your research?

547
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:13,903
I couldn't help but notice that you'd
created some quarters for yourself.

548
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,074
A new dress... dinner for two.

549
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:23,079
I trust you'll respect
doctor-patient confidentiality.

550
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,665
Of course.

551
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,671
I've been conducting simulations

552
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,635
to explore different aspects
of my humanity.

553
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,970
Such as?

554
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,514
Social activities,

555
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,683
friendships with the crew...

556
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,394
intimate relations.

557
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:52,776
I take it our first officer
is your romantic interest?

558
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,696
Commander Chakotay seemed
like an appropriate choice.

559
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,741
He has many admirable qualities.

560
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,868
So he does.

561
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,996
What prompted all this?

562
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,791
Unimatrix Zero.

563
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,672
I've been trying to re-create

564
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,049
some of the experiences
I had there.

565
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,681
Ever since it was destroyed,
my life has...

566
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,517
seemed incomplete.

567
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,522
I wanted to feel those emotions again.

568
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:35,151
Well, this is encouraging.

569
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,571
You might be ready to start
forming deeper relationships.

570
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,323
I'm proud of you, Seven.

571
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,450
Your pride is misplaced.

572
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,202
I intend to delete the programs.

573
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,412
Why?

574
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,123
I can no longer perform
my duties efficiently.

575
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,583
My personal life
has become a distraction.

576
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,544
It's supposed to be a distraction.

577
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,421
You simply have to find
the right balance

578
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,715
between work and recreation.

579
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,175
Inform me when you finish the diagnostic.

580
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,677
Seven.

581
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,724
For what it's worth,
you have excellent taste.

582
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,061
Your quarters...

583
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,397
they suited you.

584
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,913
Antimatter flow stable.

585
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,999
Injector ports aligned.

586
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,917
That should do it.

587
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,461
Torres to the Bridge.

588
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,463
Looks like we've got
warp drive back.

589
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,131
Well done. Tom.

590
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,467
With pleasure.

591
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,808
I'm detecting another subspace warhead.

592
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,518
Range?

593
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,771
12 million kilometers.
Closing from astern.

594
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,190
Red alert.
Where's the target probe?

595
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,609
It's on a totally different trajectory.

596
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,110
When we engaged the engines,

597
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,696
the warhead must have
diverted from its target

598
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,740
and locked on
to our warp signature.

599
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,450
Evasive maneuvers.

600
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,870
It's matching our course.
Eight million kilometers.

601
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,330
Can you get a weapons lock?

602
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,831
Affirmative.

603
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,543
Photon torpedoes.
Full spread.

604
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,095
Our torpedoes have been neutralized.

605
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,972
Five million kilometers.

606
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,975
-Bridge to Seven of Nine.
<i>-Here, Captain.</i>

607
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,145
Can you get me anything on
the warhead's internal circuitry?

608
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,605
Stand by.

609
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:37,982
I have it.

610
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,151
<i>What can you tell me</i>
<i>about the detonator?</i>

611
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,737
The weapon is armed with
proximity resonance circuitry.

612
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,114
<i>What's the activation frequency?</i>

613
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,408
4.84 gigahertz.

614
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,537
I may be able to disarm it
with an antiresonance pulse.

615
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,789
-Do it.
-Two million kilometers.

616
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,291
-Initiating the pulse.
-Seven, status?

617
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,586
The warhead's rotating
its activation frequency.

618
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,923
-It's still armed.
-One million kilometers.

619
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,216
Can you compensate?

620
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,260
Negative.

621
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,595
Captain, I believe
I can disarm the warhead.

622
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,763
<i>How?</i>

623
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,807
By extracting the detonator
with our transporter.

624
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,351
At this velocity?
The device is too small.

625
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,644
You'd never get a lock.

626
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,398
I can use the submicron imager
to focus our targeting scanners.

627
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,568
Please, give me transporter control.

628
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,488
Eight hundred thousand.

629
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,118
[Janeway] All right, Seven.
It's up to you.

630
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,537
I have a lock.

631
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,414
Energizing.

632
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,710
The detonator's protected
by tritanium shielding.

633
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,754
I can penetrate it,
but not at this distance.

634
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,673
We'll have to wait until it's closer.

635
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,509
-Five hundred thousand.
-Status?

636
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,761
<i>-Not yet, Captain.</i>
-[Paris] Four...

637
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,471
<i>three...</i>

638
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,681
<i>two...</i>

639
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,559
<i>Brace for impact!</i>

640
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,105
[sighs]

641
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,527
[door opening]

642
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,405
Doctor.

643
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,826
You've come to deliver unpleasant news.

644
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,913
Is it that obvious?

645
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,041
I've completed my diagnostic.

646
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,920
What you experienced
was no malfunction.

647
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,925
Your cortical node was designed
to shut down your higher brain functions

648
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,012
when you achieve a certain level
of emotional stimulation.

649
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,681
Clarify.

650
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,643
It appears to be
a fail-safe mechanism...

651
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,397
to deactivate drones who start
to regain their emotions.

652
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,609
Knowing the Borg,
it makes perfect sense.

653
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,029
Finding one's heart is the surest road
to individuality.

654
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,281
But I'm no longer linked
to the hive mind.

655
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,909
The technology's built into your node.

656
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,162
It simply remained dormant...
until now.

657
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,835
Can you repair me?

658
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,463
Possibly.

659
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,093
I've been thinking about a way
to reconfigure the micro-circuitry.

660
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,471
I won't lie to you, Seven.

661
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,765
It would entail multiple surgeries,

662
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,559
and the recovery might be difficult.

663
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,562
But I believe we could
eventually succeed.

664
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,691
I'll prepare the Surgical Bay.
We can begin tomorrow morning.

665
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,567
No.

666
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,072
Without the procedure, you won't be able
to continue your simulations.

667
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,826
I've experienced enough humanity
for the time being.

668
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,996
They were only
holographic fantasies, Doctor.

669
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,747
An inefficient use of my time.

670
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,791
You don't really believe that.

671
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,544
The fail-safe device will ensure
that I'm no longer distracted.

672
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,087
That's the Borg talking...

673
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,588
not you.

674
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,341
As your physician...

675
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,719
as your friend,

676
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,054
I'm asking you to let me proceed.

677
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,597
-I need to regenerate.
-Seven...

678
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,641
Good night, Doctor.

679
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,660
-Where's the fire?
-Fire?

680
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,245
You seem to be in a hurry.

681
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,165
I have to finish my report
on the subspace warheads.

682
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,083
The ship's out of danger,
thanks to you.

683
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,460
You've earned a break.

684
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,086
Why don't you join me
in the Mess Hall?

685
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,047
Neelix is going to give
a cooking lesson.

686
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,174
"Talaxian Tenderloin
in Ten Minutes."

687
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,342
I'm no longer interested in cooking.

688
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,137
Then come for the company.
B'Elanna's going to be there.

689
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,182
Tuvok even promised to show up.
It'll be fun.

690
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,852
I appreciate your offer.

691
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,687
Another time, perhaps.

692
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:49,150
You know, you should try socializing
with the crew a little more.

693
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,944
It might do you some good.
