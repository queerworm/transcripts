00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,965
DOCTOR:
Somewhere in that totality
known as the universe

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,384
is a galaxy
called the Milky Way.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,429
Tucked into the corner
of that galaxy

4
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,431
is a planet named Earth.

5
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:18,769
On that planet
is a city called Mantua.

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,522
Go straight ahead
past the fountain,

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,441
turn right, then left,
then right again.

8
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,987
You'll find yourself
walking along the water,

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,949
listening as a man sings

10
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,118
of his beloved's
unfaithful heart.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,789
And even the fish
begin to weep.

Doctor?

59
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,222
Hello?

60
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,475
Hmm.
(<i> clears throat</i> )

61
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,435
Maybe I'd better
run a diagnostic

62
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,313
on your hearing subroutines.
My hearing's fine.

63
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:13,068
I was just letting
my mind wander, that's all.

64
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,015
If you're not working
on anything, you should
deactivate yourself.

65
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,850
Save us the energy.
Wait a second.

66
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,895
I thought I was scheduled
to go on the away team.

67
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,939
The planet looks pretty safe
on the long-range sensors.

68
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,441
Any medical problems, and
we can just use the transporter.

69
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,819
But take a look at those scans,
see if there's anything
we might have missed.

70
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,114
Lieutenant, I<i> wanted</i>
to go on the away team.

71
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:25,075
There's a canyon on that planet
I'd like to investigate.

72
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,702
I've already
handed out assignments.
Next time.

73
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,626
If you'd like, I'll snap
a few images for you.

74
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,086
Don't bother.

75
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,879
Suit yourself.

76
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,676
I'll just use my imagination.

77
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,602
CHAKOTAY:
Where did that
come from?

78
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,396
Good question.
Didn't show up on sensors
until a few minutes ago.

79
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,900
T-class nebula.

80
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,611
1,000 kilometer
diameter.

81
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,197
Hydrogen, helium...

82
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,490
argon.
Nothing too dramatic.

83
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,576
If you want some drama,
take a look at this.

84
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,371
"To Captain Kathryn Janeway,
Starship<i> Voyager</i>

85
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,126
from Emergency Medical
Hologram, Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

86
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:21,298
Topic: Status of Emergency
Medical Hologram,
Starship<i> Voyager."</i>

87
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,217
He's filing a
formal grievance.

88
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,053
Regarding?
His treatment by the crew.

89
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,556
There's also a paragraph
about his future
on<i> Voyager</i>

90
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,933
and a proposal
for his advancement.

91
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,102
"Failure
to acknowledge sentience."

92
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,896
"Rude behavior."

93
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,689
What's this?

94
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,649
A request to be "made Captain

95
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,443
in the event
of a catastrophic emergency."

96
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,363
He's serious?
Dead serious,

97
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,615
and he wants
a formal response...
for the record.

98
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,701
Protocol allows
for Commander Chakotay

99
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,079
or myself
to address his<i> demands,</i>

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,621
if the Captain
would prefer.

101
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,124
No, I'll take care of it.

102
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,626
I don't want anybody
to be uncomfortable
on this ship.

103
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,629
I guess we should
all try to be a little more
considerate of his feelings.

104
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,422
Captain, he does it to himself.

105
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,175
He's Chief<i> Medical</i> Officer.

106
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,177
Is it our fault
that's not enough for him?

107
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,179
Resume course
toward the planet.

108
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,722
Chakotay, you have the Bridge.

109
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,141
I've got a formal response
to draft.

110
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,239
MALE:
What category did I
assign that vessel?

111
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,159
Unacceptable risk.
Correct.

112
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,120
And what was
my justification
for that decision?

113
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,332
The ship appears
in none of our databases.

114
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,335
Initial attempts
to scan the interior failed.

115
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,004
Then why are you
wasting our resources?

116
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,257
I-I think I<i> can</i>
penetrate the hull...

117
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,634
uh, using a micro-tunneling
sensor...

118
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,220
And observe the interior
one molecule at a time?

119
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:36,599
There are
other potential targets
that must be surveyed.

120
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,061
If I could tap into
a data transfer conduit,

121
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,648
I'd be able to reach
their main computer core.

122
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,692
That would tell me
all we need to know

123
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,069
about their tactical
systems... in theory.

124
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,739
We could be detected.
They may not like
being spied upon.

125
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,658
I think I've been
very careful avoiding this.

126
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,618
I'll take every precaution--
I promise!

127
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,579
Unacceptable risk.

128
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,626
I've already transmitted
my proposal to the Hierarchy.

129
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,962
They should be
responding momentarily.

130
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,882
Do you have something
you'd like to say?
No.

131
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,221
The Hierarchy cannot be bothered
with every ill-conceived
notion that you...

132
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,930
(<i> beeping</i> )

133
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,813
They've approved.

134
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,773
I'd better get started.

135
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,157
You're too
confrontational.

136
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,201
He'll report you.

137
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,452
Humph.

138
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,833
Acceptable risk.

139
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,257
The layer of antonium
runs right along the edge
of the canyon.

140
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,759
My scans show
geological instability

141
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,303
within 100 meters of
the target location.

142
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,515
I could put the<i> Flyer</i>
down just outside of that.

143
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,183
NEELIX:
I don't know, Tom.

144
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,352
That might be
a little too far.

145
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,145
PARIS:
What's the matter, Neelix?

146
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,646
Afraid of a little exercise?

147
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,984
Well, I think we could handle
a 100-meter stroll.

148
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,279
PARIS:
I have to agree.

149
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,281
NEELIX:
Maybe getting there.

150
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,242
It's coming back
I'm worried about.

151
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,536
We'll be loaded
down with ore.

152
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,455
If the ground
is unstable...

153
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,791
I suggest limiting the team
members to 20 kilograms.

154
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,961
Preliminary scans indicate
the crust is dense enough
to support that weight.

155
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:32,799
You might try carrying
a transport enhancer
to the site.

156
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,675
NEELIX:
That's not a bad idea.

157
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,761
We'll beam the ore back
to the<i> Delta Flyer--</i>

158
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,679
and we won't have
to carry anything.

159
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,807
TORRES:
You know, this mission
is starting to look

160
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,809
a little more dangerous
than we thought.

161
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,145
Maybe we<i> do</i> need
the Doctor to come along.

162
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,022
If one of us fell
through the crust,
there could be injuries.

163
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,691
I require the Doctor's
assistance in Astrometrics.

164
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,985
What for?

165
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,947
That's none of your business.

166
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,950
I think it is.
(<i> groaning</i> )

167
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,285
What's wrong, Captain?

168
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,495
It's nothing, really.

169
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,829
An old Academy injury.

170
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,414
Flares up
every now and then.

171
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,583
I've learned
to live with it,

172
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,503
but maybe you should
stay here and have a look.

173
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,463
Right...

174
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,008
there.

175
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,680
Get away from him!

176
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,934
<i>You</i> ... are dismissed.

177
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,024
(<i> satisfied sigh</i> )

178
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,318
Doctor?

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,569
Doctor?

180
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,279
Yes... Captain.

181
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,991
Let's talk about
these demands of yours.

182
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,246
I've given you a great deal
of freedom on this ship.

183
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,581
I'm not disputing that.

184
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,375
But you're not
satisfied, either.

185
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,084
I should be allowed
to participate

186
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,212
and advance
according to my abilities,

187
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,796
like any other member
of this crew.

188
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,798
You should also
know your limits.

189
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,758
My program can be
expanded indefinitely.

190
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,220
I don't<i> have</i> limits.
Maybe.

191
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,180
But we all have primary
responsibilities.

192
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,932
Yours is Sick Bay.
I'm a computer program.

193
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,768
Multiple tasking
is second nature to me.

194
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,022
This proposal of yours...
to be made a... what?

195
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,440
What did you call it?

196
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,527
ECH--
Emergency Command
Hologram.

197
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,697
In principle, it's
an interesting idea.

198
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,199
A backup Captain
in case I'm
incapacitated,

199
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,784
and the command
structure breaks down.

200
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,787
But expanding your program
would take months of work.

201
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,832
The lives of the crew
may depend on it someday.

202
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,503
I'm afraid
the answer is no, Doctor.

203
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,256
However, as part of
my formal response,
I have recommended

204
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,800
that Starfleet assign
a team of engineers
to consider your proposal.

205
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,388
When we get back to
the Alpha Quadrant,
I'll pass it along.

206
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,434
Thank you, Captain.

207
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,977
Thank<i> you,</i> Doctor.

208
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,739
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce

209
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,199
the Emergency
Command Hologram.

210
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,951
Hear, hear.
(<i> applause</i> )

211
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,661
Congratulations.

212
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,751
I've tried to access
their internal sensors,

213
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,211
but I couldn't get past
the security encryption.

214
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,424
So I found something
even better--

215
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,968
a holographic crewman.

216
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,304
I've tapped into his
cognitive subroutines.

217
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:28,182
We can now monitor
everything he's experiencing.

218
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,184
It's like having
an agent on board.

219
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,103
To the ECH.

220
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,063
Captain,
this is such an honor,

221
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,899
but if you don't mind my saying,
hardly a surprise.

222
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,944
(<i> all laughing</i> )

223
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,071
(<i> satisfied sigh</i> )

224
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,454
Allow me to introduce...
the Doctor.

225
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,748
He's a computer program--

226
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,083
a sentient piece
of holographic technology--

227
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,877
and he is<i> Voyager's</i>
Medical Officer.

228
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,422
<i>"Voyager"?</i>
That's the name of the ship.

229
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,133
I've only been
observing the Doctor
for a matter of hours,

230
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,093
and I've already learned
more about this vessel

231
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,638
than I did in three days
of sensor sweeps.

232
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,348
Elaborate.

233
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,600
The reason<i> Voyager</i>
is not in our database

234
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:14,270
is because they are not
from this quadrant.

235
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,064
They're... lost...

236
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,358
alone.

237
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,401
No backup vessel?
Uh-huh.

238
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,862
No one to contact for help?
Precisely.

239
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,824
Another few hours of
observation and I will know

240
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,409
all we need to know
about them-- defenses,

241
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,287
weapons, crew complement--
everything.

242
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,833
From monitoring one individual?
Unlikely.

243
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,044
Actually...
it is<i> very</i> likely.

244
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,296
The social structure
on<i> Voyager</i>

245
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,632
is-is much different
than ours.

246
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,342
How so?

247
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,803
This is
my observation post.

248
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,930
I have a single function,
but the Doctor...

249
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,809
does much more
than just practice medicine.

250
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:57,355
He has access
to the entire ship.

251
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,108
And he seems to be
an expert on...<i> everything.</i>

252
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,697
In fact, the Captain
just gave him authorization

253
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,324
to command the bridge!

254
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:12,453
It was a very...
exciting moment.

255
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,622
Why aren't you
monitoring him now?

256
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,792
Well, the link drops out
intermittently,

257
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,086
but it should be reestablished
in a few minutes.

258
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,259
Maintain your surveillance.

259
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,891
This'll take care
of any potential allergens
in the planet's atmosphere.

260
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,309
I'll monitor your medical
status from the bridge,

261
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,645
but I don't anticipate
any problems.

262
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,898
Since I'm not going,

263
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,358
I wonder if you'd mind
snapping a few holo-images

264
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,151
for me while you're
down there.

265
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,528
Gladly.

266
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,280
Tell me something,
Mr. Neelix.

267
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,324
Do you... daydream?

268
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,411
On Talaxia,
we have a saying--

269
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,995
"The dream dreams
the dreamer."

270
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,664
Care to translate?

271
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,418
We like to think
that fantasies and daydreams

272
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,630
come from someplace else--
another land.

273
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,133
They slip into our minds
and whisper about things
we never imagined.

274
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,885
A strange notion.

275
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,178
Do you daydream, Doctor?
No, of course not.

276
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,806
I'm a computer program.

277
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,181
I prefer wide shots,
Mr. Neelix.

278
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,725
If you're
feeling creative,

279
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,184
throw in a little ultraviolet.

280
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,479
Will do.

281
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,314
(<i> chuckling</i> )

282
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,530
<i>Voyager</i> to<i> Delta Flyer.</i>
Report.

283
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,199
PARIS:
We're approaching the canyon.
Phew, what a view.

284
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,743
I'm sure it is.

285
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,119
JANEWAY: Put us in
a synchronous orbit

286
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,704
above their
landing coordinates.

287
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,331
<i>Voyager,</i> Mayday!
What's wrong?

288
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,040
(<i> staticky</i> ):
We've been hit.

289
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,334
I'm taking us down
into the canyon...

290
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,794
Harry...

291
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,587
I don't know
what happened to them.

292
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,380
I am picking up a vessel,
Captain.

293
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,924
It's Borg.

294
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,343
Red alert.

295
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,761
On screen.

296
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,013
Battle stations.

297
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,271
Captain...

298
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,232
you must relieve me
of duty at once.

299
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,444
An assimilation virus
has penetrated our defenses.

300
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,821
We're becoming drones.

301
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,489
Hard to Starboard.

302
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,324
Reinforce the shields.

303
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,034
Incoming fire!

304
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,832
Doctor...

305
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:25,044
Computer, activate the ECH.

306
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,380
Acknowledged.

307
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,260
Transferring all systems
to your command.

308
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,805
You have the bridge.
Indeed.

309
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,390
Shields to maximum.

310
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,351
Photon torpedoes, full volley.

311
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,686
Fire.

312
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,605
Computer, report.

313
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,608
Enemy shields are intact.

314
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,235
We are the Borg.

315
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,820
I know very well who you are.

316
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,321
Stand down your weapons.

317
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,407
State your designation.

318
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,870
Emergency Command Hologram,
at your service.

319
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,581
Designation unknown.

320
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,332
Not for long.

321
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,584
Doctor...

322
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,020
COMPUTER:
Warning.

323
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,313
Primary shields are failing.

324
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,608
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

325
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,610
Stand down your weapons.

326
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,613
Turn back while you still can.

327
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,699
You will be assimilated.

328
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,035
Over my dead program.

329
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:43,748
Computer,
activate the photonic cannon.

330
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,126
The photonic cannon is on line.

331
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,711
Fire.

332
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,803
KIM:
Doctor, can you confirm?

333
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,768
The readings, Doctor.

334
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,646
Um, the, uh...

335
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,399
Uh...

336
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,027
readings, uh...
confirm, of course.

337
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,904
Uh, the away team's
physiologies

338
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,073
are within acceptable
parameters.

339
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,491
All life signs stable.

340
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,076
You're okay to
proceed, Tom.

341
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,953
PARIS:
Understood.

342
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,580
We'll contact you again
when we reach the site.

343
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,921
<i>Voyager</i> will not
be an easy target.

344
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,090
It is armed with
something called

345
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,383
"a photonic cannon".

346
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,179
I watched them destroy
a Borg sphere with
a single volley.

347
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,932
There are no reports
of Borg in this region.

348
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,476
I saw it
with my own eyes.

349
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,020
Did you check
for debris?

350
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,813
The ship was annihilated.

351
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,982
There was nothing left
for the sensors to pick up.

352
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,984
Continue.

353
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,486
Their Captain was disabled
in the attack.

354
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,156
The hologram is now in command.

355
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,615
He's...

356
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,241
an impressive individual--

357
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,079
a physician, an engineer...
a warrior--

358
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:09,458
and very attractive
to the females.

359
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,505
We must at all cost try to avoid
a direct confrontation with him.

360
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,051
I recommend
a type-3 stealth assault.

361
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,645
The Hierarchy approves.

362
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,355
Prepare
for a stealth assault

363
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,815
type-3.

364
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,358
Scan for Borg.

365
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,360
We don't want
any last-minute surprises...

366
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,406
or mistakes.

367
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,291
Doctor...
can I have a
word with you?

368
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,253
I know I let my attention
drift a little on the bridge,
but I assure you...

369
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,296
Are you kidding?
That was incredible.

370
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,298
I just wanted to
congratulate you.

371
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,717
For what exactly?

372
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,301
The Borg will have
to think twice

373
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,012
about attacking
<i>Voyager</i> again.

374
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,847
Nice work.

375
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,933
Computer, locate
Commander Chakotay.

376
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,019
Commander Chakotay is
in his quarters.

377
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,687
Something wrong?

378
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,527
TORRES:
What were you trying to do?

379
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,029
I've been
experimenting

380
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,614
with introducing
a new function

381
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,242
into my program--
cognitive projections...

382
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,995
daydreaming.
I wanted to be
able to daydream.

383
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,872
An inefficient activity.

384
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,166
We all do it
now and then, Seven.
Why not the Doctor?

385
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,294
My thought exactly.
So, what's the problem?

386
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,380
The algorithms
are malfunctioning.

387
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,509
I'm starting to daydream...
whether I want to or not.

388
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,138
They say a Doctor
who operates on himself

389
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,598
has a<i> p'takh</i> for a patient.

390
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,061
I can help him.
I'm sure you<i> can.</i>

391
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,188
The Doctor and I
are going to Sick Bay.

392
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,357
Any excuse to be
alone with him,
eh, Seven?

393
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,777
Assimilation is
an unpleasant fate.

394
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,195
Is that a threat?

395
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,489
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

396
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,370
This is impossible.
The warp containment field
is failing!

397
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,626
COMPUTER:
Warp core breach in 30 seconds.

398
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,837
Try stabilizing
the antimatter flow.

399
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,214
The control linkage
is down.

400
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,092
COMPUTER:
Warning. Warp core breach
a lot sooner than you think.

401
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,887
TORRES: We've got to get
someone inside the warp core...
try to eject it manually.

402
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,891
No one could survive
the current level
of plasma radiation.

403
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,519
The Doctor.
The Doctor.

404
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,856
This isn't real...
is it?

405
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,025
Doc, you're the only one
who can help us.

406
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,444
Warning. Last chance
to be a hero, Doctor.

407
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,322
Get going.

408
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,032
Here's the problem.

409
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,117
The new algorithms
weren't isolated properly.

410
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,452
They've branched
into his perceptual subroutines.

411
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,831
Doc, why don't we
take a closer look
at the matrix and...

412
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,373
What are you doing?

413
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,002
I have to eject
the core.
What?!

414
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,338
Deactivate his program.
No, it will damage his matrix.

415
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,672
Don't try to stop me.

416
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,299
Let's take him
to Sick Bay.

417
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,925
I have
to save the ship!

418
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,927
I have to save the ship!

419
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,181
I have to save the ship!

420
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,894
You look lovely tonight, Seven.

421
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,771
Where shall we go?
That sounds wonderful.

422
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,691
The new algorithms
have completely
taken over his program.

423
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,193
Ambassador!

424
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,986
So, now he's
daydreaming
constantly?

425
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,739
It's a photonic cannon.
I designed it myself.

426
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,991
He seems to be randomly jumping
from one to the next.

427
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,576
Oh. Pardon me, Miss.

428
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,661
I routed his subroutines
to Holodeck 1,

429
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,830
so Harry and Seven
could monitor his fantasies.

430
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,999
Do you think
that's appropriate?

431
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,293
They're<i> his</i> fantasies,
and I promised him

432
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,212
we'd show a little
more consideration.

433
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,963
It'll give us a better idea
of what's going on,

434
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,464
help us fix him.

435
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,384
Mr. Neelix, how thoughtful.

436
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,426
You baked me a cake...

437
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,762
Kim to Sick Bay.

438
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,305
Go ahead, Harry.

439
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,640
You might want
to have a look at this.

440
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,226
We're on our way.

441
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,271
Mm-hmm.

442
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,543
Keep still, please.

443
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,712
Anything you say, Doctor.

444
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,340
He does the hands
very well.

445
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,343
Apparently,
he's had a great
deal of practice.

446
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,719
Look at these.

447
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,143
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

448
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:49,905
Computer... activate
the Emergency Command Hologram.

449
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,949
This is the
part I like.

450
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,288
Nice touch.

451
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,248
Bring the photonic cannon
on line.

452
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,498
Photonic cannon?

453
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,126
A weapon of mass
destruction,

454
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,086
invented by the
Doctor, of course.

455
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,005
Of course.
In many of his fantasies,

456
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,257
he takes command
and saves the ship.

457
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,758
I see.

458
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,427
Which means that
particular algorithm

459
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,053
is more easily accessible
than the others.

460
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,680
So, if we can isolate it,

461
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,765
we might be able to
stabilize his program.

462
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,018
TORRES:
Why do you torment
me like this?

463
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,894
DOCTOR:
That was never my intention.

464
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,229
It wasn't?

465
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,772
I want you to be
happy, B'Elanna.

466
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,565
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Without you?
What?!

467
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,984
Shh...

468
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,112
I'll always be...
fond of you.

469
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,322
That will never change.

470
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,407
You can't just leave me.

471
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,909
I couldn't bear to be alone.

472
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,870
Aren't you
forgetting someone?

473
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,707
He needs you, B'Elanna,
now more than ever.

474
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,419
Forget him.

475
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,172
He's not half the man you are.

476
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,673
Mm-hmm. Well...

477
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,467
I've seen enough of this.

478
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,844
All right, let's go
back to Sick Bay

479
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,805
and try to isolate
that algorithm.

480
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,393
Congratulations.

481
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,228
Thank you for this
opportunity, Captain.

482
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,812
All I've ever
wanted was

483
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,856
to live up to my
full potential...

484
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,608
to hone all my skills...

485
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,944
expand my abilities...

486
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,697
to help the people I love.

487
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,290
MALE:
What's the status?

488
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,501
I lost the signal again.

489
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,378
I don't know what happened.

490
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,756
Two assault vessels are
on course to join us.

491
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,175
Accurate information
is essential!

492
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,553
The more I learn
about<i> Voyager,</i>

493
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,764
the more I wonder...
if it's worth the trouble.

494
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,474
Clarify.

495
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,142
Launching an attack

496
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,894
against such
a heavily armed vessel

497
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,272
carries a great risk,
and for what?

498
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,233
A little antimatter
and some dilithium...

499
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,693
Your survey indicated
<i>large</i> quantities of both.

500
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,946
We've already committed
substantial resources

501
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,781
to mounting
this assault.

502
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,366
Were you mistaken?
No!

503
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,118
(<i> stammering</i> ):
Not at all.

504
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,702
I'm just...

505
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,955
sounding a note of caution.

506
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,084
If our boarding party
doesn't find<i> Voyager</i>

507
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,421
exactly as you've
described it...

508
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,466
the Hierarchy
will be informed.

509
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,219
I understand.

510
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,597
There has been no mistake.

511
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,934
Then we'll proceed.

512
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,649
I've made
a<i> terrible</i> mistake.

513
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,153
How... terrible?

514
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:38,449
The Doctor was appearing
in a different location
every few seconds.

515
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:42,995
It didn't seem possible.
So, I investigated
a little further and...

516
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,207
I haven't been monitoring
his perceptions.

517
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,293
I've been watching
his<i> dreams...</i>

518
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:53,046
or his... his imaginings.

519
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,881
I'm not sure which...

520
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,885
but none of this is real.

521
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,807
What am I going to do?

522
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,317
(<i> door opens,</i>
<i>footsteps approach</i> )

523
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,366
I came to check
on your patient.

524
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,994
He's doing just fine, Captain.

525
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,373
It took Lieutenant Torres
half the night
to stabilize my matrix,

526
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,376
but I haven't had
a single flight of fancy since.

527
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,464
I apologize for altering
my program without permission.

528
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,550
Well, at least
there wasn't
any permanent damage.

529
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,303
(<i> sighs</i> ):
I'm afraid there was.

530
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,973
I've been exposed...
humiliated...

531
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:48,185
turned inside out
for all the world to see.

532
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,354
If I've lost your respect...

533
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,939
That will never happen...

534
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,818
certainly not because we've seen
a few random fantasies.

535
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,405
We all daydream, Doctor.

536
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,325
It helps us imagine
other possibilities
in life.

537
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,911
Just hold off until
we've figured out
a way for you to do it

538
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,539
without damaging
yourself, all right?

539
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,213
(<i> door chimes</i> )

540
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,797
JANEWAY:
Come in.

541
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,469
Ship status report.

542
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,471
Federation Law.

543
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,890
Thinking about
a career change?

544
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,475
In a way.

545
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,394
Not for me, though.

546
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,563
I've been going over
the legal precedents

547
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,774
for granting command positions
to holograms.

548
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,401
There aren't any.

549
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,403
Captain, this ship
needs its Doctor.

550
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,697
He should focus on what
he was programmed for--

551
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,240
medical care.

552
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,908
I think we've
underestimated him

553
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,160
because of our own
human limitations.

554
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,788
His full potential's
unknown, Chakotay.

555
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,041
Would you be comfortable
handing over your ship
to a computer program?

556
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,419
Well, I don't know
if I'd take it that far.

557
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:59,214
You might have to.
He probably won't
settle for less.

558
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,310
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

559
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,650
Oh, no.

560
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,111
Allow me
to shake your hand.

561
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,739
Congratulations.

562
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,700
Doctor, may I please
have a word with you?

563
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,661
I don't recall
dreaming you up.

564
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,037
You didn't.
I'm transmitting
a simulation of myself

565
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,873
into your program,
but<i> I</i> am real.

566
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,627
Doctor to the Bridge.
I'm daydreaming again.
Somebody deactivate me.

567
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,462
<i>Voyager</i> is
about to be attacked.

568
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,339
Of course it is,
unless the valiant Doctor

569
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,758
swings into action, right?
Yes, yes, precisely.

570
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,426
A common theme in
all my fantasies.

571
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,386
I reactivated your
cognitive algorithms.

572
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,681
I put you back into
this... fiction.

573
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,140
(<i> whispering</i> )

574
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,810
Here. Why?

575
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,814
It was the only way for me
to communicate with you.

576
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,821
I'm listening.
I'm a long-range observer

577
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,905
on an assault-class vessel.

578
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,576
I scan passing ships
for technology
and raw materials.

579
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,412
When I find an acceptable
target, we raid it.

580
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,122
You've been
spying on us.

581
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,708
More to the point-- on you.

582
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,584
For several days,
I've been using

583
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,713
a long-range tunneling sensor
to tap into your program.

584
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,466
You were supposed to be
our eyes and ears
on<i> Voyager.</i>

585
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,427
Instead, I got this.

586
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,970
My daydreams?!

587
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,097
You tapped into
my daydreams?!

588
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,642
That's why my algorithms
have been destabilizing.

589
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,687
My fault. I'm sorry.

590
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,313
Tell me about this attack.

591
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,524
My ship is less
than an hour away.

592
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,317
I can help you avoid
a confrontation,

593
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,111
but you must do
exactly what I say.

594
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,280
Why should<i> you</i>
want to help us?

595
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,533
You don't understand.

596
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:52,536
The Hierarchy
does not tolerate mistakes

597
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,830
or misinformation.

598
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,332
If they learn of my error...

599
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,753
I'll lose my livelihood.

600
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:04,840
Well, that's what
you get for being
a Peeping Tom.

601
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,053
But I also care
about what happens to you.

602
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:14,558
I feel like
I've gotten to know you
over the past few days.

603
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,269
You've been spying
on my fantasies, not me.

604
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,396
You don't know<i> me</i> at all.

605
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,690
But I do.

606
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,860
I know how your mind works...

607
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,362
what your hopes are.

608
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,365
You created all these...

609
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,325
possibilities.

610
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,993
My species, we're...

611
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,871
very different.

612
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:39,666
Our thinking is confined, but...

613
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,710
I can't help...

614
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,378
but admire you.

615
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,548
I don't want you

616
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,174
to be harmed.

617
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,098
Then I suppose we should
swing into action.

618
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,603
Captain, we're
about to be attacked.

619
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,605
Alien vessels
are approaching.

620
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,482
There's nothing
on the sensors, Doc.

621
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,776
The vessels are cloaked.
How do you know this?

622
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,277
One of the aliens
contacted me.

623
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,154
TUVOK: I've detected
no transmissions.

624
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,323
He spoke to me in a daydream.
I don't want to hear it.

625
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,200
However, I would like to
know why you've disobeyed
my direct order.

626
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,035
I can prove it to you.

627
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,371
The alien told me
how to reconfigure our sensors

628
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,540
to compensate
for their cloaking field.

629
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,175
He's right.
I'm picking up
three ships

630
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:33,345
out there-- distance,
600 million kilometers,

631
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,097
headed right for us.
On screen.

632
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,268
Maximum magnification.

633
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,826
The alien won't help us
unless we help him.

634
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,620
What if this is all part
of their attack? A ruse?

635
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:02,290
He's already helped us
compensate for their cloak.
I'm inclined to believe him.

636
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,460
So am I, but I'd just as soon
set a course away from here
at maximum warp.

637
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,462
That will only delay
a confrontation.

638
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,923
They have vessels
hidden throughout
the entire sector.

639
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,091
Did your friend have a plan?

640
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,720
He said they're
running what's called
a type-3 stealth assault.

641
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,972
They won't de-cloak
until they're right
on top of us,

642
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:19,725
at which point they'll
fire a warning shot
across our bow.

643
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,019
Then come the demands--
for supplies and technology.

644
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,479
If we don't comply,
they'll destroy us.

645
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,732
Fortunately,
the alien promised

646
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,109
to transmit the resonance
frequencies of their phasers.

647
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,820
And in return?

648
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,698
In return...

649
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,411
He mistakenly informed
his superiors

650
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,039
that<i> I</i> was in command
of<i> Voyager.</i>

651
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,999
To keep himself
from being demoted,

652
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,920
he wants us...
to maintain that fiction.

653
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:51,590
When they open the channel,
I have to be sitting
in the Captain's chair.

654
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,719
I'm sorry, Captain...
but he insisted.

655
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,100
Well, I guess it's time
to turn fantasy into reality.

656
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,565
I'm in over my head.
What if I fail?

657
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,110
You sound like I did
when the Captain put me
in command of the night shift.

658
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,154
That chair looked so big,
I thought I'd sink
so far into it

659
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,074
that nobody
would be able to see me.

660
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,242
But you had your Academy
training to fall back on.

661
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,954
Yeah, well, sounds like you've
had plenty of practice.

662
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,246
That wasn't real.

663
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,040
Listen, Doc...
the whole reason

664
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,833
you wanted to be
able to daydream

665
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,629
was to test out
possibilities, right?

666
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,423
Well, consider
this a field test.

667
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,012
Why isn't there any hull damage
from the Borg attack?

668
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,139
They... repaired it.

669
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,725
So quickly? Hmm.

670
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,646
Prepare for type-4 assault.

671
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,900
Type-4?
That would cause a huge drain
on our energy core--

672
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,694
a... a waste of resources.

673
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,947
Do you really think
that's necessary?

674
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,865
What I think doesn't matter.

675
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,994
Your long-range surveillance
indicated an attack by Borg.

676
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:05,371
On closer inspection,
that appears to be doubtful.

677
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,333
Your report on this vessel
could be mistaken.

678
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,585
I think caution is in order.

679
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,015
The Hierarchy agrees.

680
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,351
Proceed to type-4.

681
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,155
Captain on the bridge.

682
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,241
(<i> gasps</i> )

683
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,423
It won't bite.

684
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,845
What I wouldn't give right now
for a whoopee cushion.

685
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,056
A what?
(<i> chuckling</i> )

686
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,016
Ancient technology.

687
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,027
(<i> beeping loudly</i> )

688
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,209
Captain, we're ready to proceed.

689
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,668
Acknowledged, Commander.

690
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,921
The internal
com-link is active.

691
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,423
No one will be able to
hear you but the Doctor.

692
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,051
Doctor, are you ready?

693
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,220
No, but do I
have a choice?

694
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,555
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

695
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,974
Just remember,
I'm still the captain.

696
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,102
Understood.

697
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,646
I'm receiving a transmission
on a secure channel--
audio only.

698
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,065
Must be the
Doctor's friend.

699
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,192
Let's hear what
he has to say.

700
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,027
Doctor?

701
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:03,823
Hello?<i> Voyager</i> here.
It's me.

702
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,785
ALIEN (<i> quietly</i> ): Doctor,
something terrible has happened.

703
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,788
They've ordered
a type-4 assault.

704
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,332
Our phaser frequencies
will be rotated continuously.

705
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,335
I won't be able to help you.

706
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,337
Evasive maneuvers.
TUVOK: Three vessels

707
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,090
are de-cloaking
off the port bow.

708
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,678
That didn't feel like
a warning shot.

709
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
Direct hit.
Shields are holding.

710
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,099
They're hailing us.

711
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,684
This is it, Doctor.

712
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,519
On screen.

713
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,274
You see? There he is.

714
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,524
Uh...

715
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,152
be careful.

716
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,695
He-he-he's dangerous.

717
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,159
The Hierarchy controls
this region of space.

718
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,328
Your ship has supplies
and technology that we require.

719
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,455
Tell him
we'll defend ourselves.

720
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,208
They won't get
what they're after.

721
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,835
We'll defend ourselves.

722
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,504
They won't get
what they're after.
Huh?

723
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,798
I mean<i> you...</i> won't get
what<i> you're</i> after.

724
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,967
Not in a million years.

725
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,094
Not if<i> I</i> have anything
to say about it!

726
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,470
Don't improvise, Doctor.

727
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,972
Sorry.

728
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,433
MALE:
An exchange of fire

729
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,062
would damage both of our ships,
but we have support nearby.

730
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:20,275
You are alone.
Take your weapons off-line
and prepare to be b...

731
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,652
TUVOK:
Excuse the interruption,
Commander.

732
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,737
I've found a potential weakness
in their shields,

733
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,366
but I'll need time
to reconfigure our phasers.

734
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,203
Keep him occupied,
Doctor. On screen.

735
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,829
(<i> stammering</i> )

736
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,122
This is my final warning.

737
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:36,041
Don't... rush me.

738
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,584
Take your weapons off-line.
Immediately.

739
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,961
I won't ask again.

740
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,630
You...
appear to be suffering

741
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,633
from a physio-emotive disorder.

742
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,053
You're impatient,
quick to anger.

743
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,139
Do you have any idea what that
does to your vascular pressure?

744
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,598
You may want to see a physician.

745
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,642
Firing phasers.

746
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,646
Direct hit.

747
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,898
Ha!

748
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,233
How do you like that, huh?

749
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,692
A taste of your own medicine!

750
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,152
JANEWAY:
Tone it down, Doctor.

751
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,403
Sorry.

752
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,536
Our phasers are off-line.

753
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,121
Prepare to be boarded.

754
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,540
JANEWAY:
It's time to negotiate, Doctor.

755
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,000
Tell them...
Tuvok!

756
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,843
Activate the photonic cannon.

757
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,515
Tuvok, that was an order!

758
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,064
Activating
the photonic cannon...

759
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,607
sir.

760
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,777
I'd rather not give the order
to fire.

761
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,906
My sensors are showing
no activation sequence.

762
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,701
Of course not. The photonic
cannon is impervious to sensors.

763
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,995
The Borg couldn't
detect it either.

764
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,081
That's why they
were destroyed.

765
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,999
The Borg, the Hierarchy--

766
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,876
it's all the same to me.

767
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,588
Just another bully who didn't
know when to back off.

768
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,799
We'll be vaporized.

769
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,064
(<i> both sighing</i> )

770
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:26,192
The Hierarchy
suggests retreat.

771
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,072
(<i> sighing</i> )

772
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,367
They're moving away
at maximum impulse.

773
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,961
Go ahead, Doctor.

774
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,796
You've earned it.

775
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,104
Seven of Nine to the Doctor.
Go ahead.

776
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:06,107
I require your assistance
in the mess hall.

777
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,650
(<i> sighing</i> )

778
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,319
I'll be right there.

779
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,202
ALL: Surprise!
(<i> applause</i> )

780
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,953
Don't worry, Doc.

781
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,456
You're not dreaming.
Captain?

782
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:28,171
For your imaginative defense
of this ship and her crew,

783
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:31,216
I'm awarding you the Starfleet
Medal of Commendation.

784
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,218
Congratulations.

785
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,677
Thank you.

786
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,762
I've also reconsidered
your request.

787
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,182
I'm going to authorize
a research project

788
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,226
to explore
your command abilities.

789
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,061
You're a natural.

790
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,773
Congratulations, Doctor.

791
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,363
That was a platonic gesture.

792
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,240
Don't expect me
to pose for you.

793
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,866
Noted.
