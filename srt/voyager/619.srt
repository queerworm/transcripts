1
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,712
JANEWAY:
Why potatoes?

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,465
SEVEN:
Their first idea
was to clone Naomi,

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,926
but I suggested they start
with something smaller.

4
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,147
Quite a feat of engineering.

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,732
It's a Teirenian ant colony.

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,193
I infused the soil
with a blue ion dye,

7
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,987
so it'd be easier
to see the insects.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,738
They're luminescent.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,032
The drones produce
a fluorescent enzyme

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,701
that's activated
by the queen.

11
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,995
Drones and queens?

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,914
I thought we were trying
to get these children<i> away</i>
from the Borg.

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,833
The project
was Mezoti's idea.

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,336
I didn't want to discourage
her individuality.

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,005
I like bugs.

16
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,631
Well done.

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,091
Let me know before
you take up beekeeping.

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,012
What have we got here?

19
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,430
It's Kataris.
Your father's planet.

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,892
I've been learning all about it.

21
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,311
Naomi programmed the geophysical
and atmospheric conditions.

22
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,105
There's quite a storm
in those mountains.

23
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,275
The Arpasian range is known
for high winds and hail.

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,528
I'll remember to bring my coat.

25
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,118
Now, this looks
impressive.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,288
It's a high-resolution
gravimetric sensor array.

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,790
Ambitious.

28
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,667
It'll augment
our ability to scan

29
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,294
for the neutrino flux
associated with wormholes.

30
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,839
It could help<i> Voyager</i>
find a faster way home.

31
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,592
The engineering principles
are sound.

32
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,471
I expected these projects
to be interesting,

33
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,682
but this is truly exceptional.

34
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,183
Thank you, Captain.

35
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,811
I am very interested
in astrophysics.

36
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,439
Well, you've obviously got
a knack for it.

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,106
Well done.

38
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,486
How did you think of scanning
for neutrino fluctuations?

39
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,488
I've been studying
Starfleet records.

40
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,616
He's a remarkable young man.

41
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,743
He hopes to earn
a permanent posting

42
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,202
in Astrometrics one day.

43
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,538
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,540
Captain, the boy has
a unique talent.

45
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,918
It's not a question
of merit.

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,503
We've made contact
with his parents,

47
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,423
and I've set a course
for their planet.

48
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,717
(<i> Icheb speaking</i>
<i>indistinctly)</i>

49
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,928
My scanner is calibrated
to pick up changes

50
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,846
in neutrino
trajectories.

51
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,015
That's good news.

52
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,761
You've exceeded your scheduled
time here by one hour.

53
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,096
I am almost finished.

54
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,597
Your work
will have to wait.

55
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,724
There's something
we need to discuss.

56
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,934
Look at this.

57
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,813
(<i> sighs</i> )

58
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,027
It's a star forming
in the Orpisay nebula.

59
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,072
The Orpisay nebula
is out of range
of our sensors.

60
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:43,283
I increased the resolution
of the long-range scanners.

61
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,411
Impressive.

62
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,955
When I was on the cube,

63
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,331
I never thought
about what was outside--

64
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,210
pulsars,

65
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,753
quasars,

66
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,797
nebulas--

67
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,715
but here in this lab,

68
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,052
I feel like I can see
the entire galaxy.

69
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,681
What did you want
to talk to me about?

70
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,726
You said there
was something
we needed to discuss.

71
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,020
Yes. That's correct.

72
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,401
It's time for you
to regenerate.

73
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,749
(<i> door chimes</i> )

74
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,839
Come in.

75
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,093
I'd like the data
you've collected
on Icheb's species

76
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,595
so I can prepare him
for reassimilation.

77
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,223
Maybe we could refer to it

78
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,558
as "getting reacquainted
with his family."

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,393
If you prefer.

80
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,438
I'll transfer the files
to Astrometrics.

81
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,815
Thank you.

82
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,151
How'd he take
the news?

83
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,239
You haven't told him.

84
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,825
No.

85
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,327
Why not?

86
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,163
It won't be easy for him
to accept.

87
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,665
He's adapted to life
on<i> Voyager.</i>

88
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,417
And you've adapted
to having him here.

89
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,461
My feelings are irrelevant.

90
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,088
Are they?

91
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,511
Would you like me
to tell him?

92
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,555
It's my responsibility...

93
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,976
but I am uncertain
how to proceed.

94
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,271
Well, you've already
helped him make

95
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,939
one difficult transition.

96
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,274
How did you do that?

97
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,651
By giving him the benefit

98
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,653
of my own experiences,

99
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,656
encouraging him to be resilient
in the face of obstacles.

100
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,536
Sounds like a good strategy.

101
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,861
Is your alcove
malfunctioning?

102
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,989
I'm calculating
neutrino trajectories.

103
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,741
You need to regenerate.

104
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,954
Very well.

105
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,707
Wait.

106
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,004
We've located your parents.

107
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,174
<i>Voyager</i> is due
to arrive at their
planet tomorrow.

108
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,430
Do I have to stay with them?

109
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,474
They're your parents.

110
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,893
I don't remember them.

111
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,147
After my parents
were assimilated,

112
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,899
I never saw them again.

113
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,193
You're fortunate
to have this chance.

114
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,070
What about the others?

115
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,198
We haven't been able
to locate their
families yet.

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,658
That's not what I mean.

117
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,702
What will happen to them
if I leave?

118
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,288
They depend on me.

119
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,206
They'll adapt.

120
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,173
I'll never see you again?

121
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,429
I've been studying
Brunali culture.
It's very different

122
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,764
from what you've
become accustomed to
on<i> Voyager.</i>

123
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,808
In what way?

124
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,144
They're an
agrarian society.

125
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,772
Their technological
resources are limited.

126
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,317
Are they capable
of space travel?

127
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,777
Yes, but most
of their vessels

128
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,570
were destroyed
by the Borg.

129
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,157
How will I continue my studies?

130
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,910
I don't know.

131
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,793
Icheb...

132
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,022
I'm detecting
scattered enclaves

133
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,773
on the northern
continent--

134
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,026
all with populations
of fewer than 10,000.

135
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,653
Judging from the residual
gamma radiation,

136
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,366
it appears they've suffered
numerous Borg attacks
over the past decade.

137
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,410
That's not surprising.

138
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,454
There's a Borg transwarp conduit
less than a light-year away.

139
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,998
Not exactly prime real estate.

140
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,709
Tuvok, run continuous scans
for Borg activity.

141
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,795
Tom, put us into
synchronous orbit.

142
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,297
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,132
Seven, you'd better get Icheb.

144
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,810
According to these scans,
you're in perfect health.

145
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,147
Then why does my stomach
feel so strange?

146
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,648
Hmm.

147
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,029
Oh, I should have known.

148
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,740
You've got butterflies
in there.

149
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,452
I never assimilated
butterflies.

150
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,287
It's an expression used

151
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,248
to describe anxiety
or apprehension,

152
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,042
both of which are
perfectly natural reactions

153
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,045
for someone about to meet
his long-lost parents.

154
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,964
If it's any comfort,

155
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,425
I'm sure they're just
as nervous about meeting you.

156
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,219
Parents are irrelevant.
Really?

157
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,597
Do you think Naomi's mother
is irrelevant to her?

158
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,808
I have Seven of Nine to
assist me in my education.

159
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,937
I have you to care
for my medical needs.

160
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,566
Your parents can nurture you
in ways this crew can't.

161
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,443
They can explain
the Brunali culture,

162
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,278
share their experiences
with you.

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,572
You didn't have parents.
No, but...

164
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,492
You adapted to serve
a vital function
aboard this vessel,

165
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,202
forged relationships
with its crew--

166
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,704
all without the
benefit of parents.

167
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,582
I had my programming
to fall back on.

168
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,502
And how would your
programming respond

169
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,338
if you were asked to
live with strangers?

170
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,926
Are you damaged?

171
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,719
He's fine.

172
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,222
I was just giving him
a last-minute checkup.

173
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,058
It's time.

174
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,730
The "butterflies" will go away.

175
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,769
JANEWAY:
Hello.

176
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,397
I'm Captain Janeway.

177
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,981
Icheb.

178
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,067
You've... grown.

179
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,404
He spent several months
in a Borg maturation chamber.

180
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,366
This is Seven of Nine.

181
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,244
That's a Borg designation,
isn't it?

182
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,372
Like your son, I was liberated
from the collective.

183
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,583
Seven has been instrumental
in helping Icheb

184
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,209
make his transition.

185
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,253
Then we're very
grateful to you.

186
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,338
I'm Leucon,
Icheb's father.

187
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,756
This is his
mother, Yifay.

188
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,427
How are you?

189
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,970
Fine.

190
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,015
Do these hurt you?

191
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,893
No.

192
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,735
We're very happy to
have you back with us.

193
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,737
Mala, Remi,

194
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,946
Yivel.

195
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,490
Welcome home, Icheb.

196
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,999
I would like
to return to
<i>Voyager</i> now.

197
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,975
Thank you for coming.

198
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,893
Where's Icheb?

199
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,521
I thought it might be
better if we talked
ourselves first.

200
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,650
What exactly is
there to discuss?

201
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,860
How to make this transition
easier for your son.

202
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,862
Please, sit down.

203
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,455
It won't be easy for him

204
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,957
to give up the luxuries
of your ship.

205
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,251
It's more than a
question of luxuries.

206
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,877
Icheb has special medical needs.

207
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,130
We have a physician
in our settlement.

208
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,008
We should arrange for him
to consult with our Doctor.

209
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,594
He also requires
daily regeneration.

210
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,930
I'm sure you can adapt
some of our technology
to make that possible.

211
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:12,143
What about his
educational needs?
Our children go to school.

212
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,271
Will he be able to continue
his studies in astrometrics
and spatial harmonics?

213
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,898
If Icheb has an
aptitude for science,

214
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,943
I'm sure he'll find that
<i>we</i> have a great deal
to teach him.

215
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,487
For example?

216
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,447
We've developed
sophisticated techniques

217
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,907
in agricultural genetics,
which allow us to grow crops

218
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,661
in an inhospitable environment.

219
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,664
Icheb has expressed no interest
in agriculture.

220
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,957
I'm sure, once he's been exposed
to the subject,

221
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,876
he'll find it quite challenging.

222
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,462
There's still the issue
of his safety.

223
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,006
We're perfectly capable
of protecting our son.

224
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:46,636
Your proximity to a Borg conduit
makes you extremely vulnerable.

225
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,971
I'm curious if you've
ever considered relocating.

226
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,724
Seven.
LEUCON: No.

227
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,433
It's all right, Captain.

228
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,934
This planet is our home.

229
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,436
We will never leave it.

230
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,480
We will defend it
against the Borg,

231
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,274
or anyone else who threatens us.

232
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,318
Your courage is admirable
but unrealistic.

233
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,944
Wait for me
in my ready room.

234
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,613
Captain...
Now.

235
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,462
I apologize
for her behavior.

236
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,548
She and Icheb have
grown very close,

237
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,425
but that's no excuse
for rudeness.

238
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,594
We'd like to see
our son now.

239
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,471
Please be patient.

240
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,474
If we rush things,
your next encounter with him

241
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,018
may not go any better
than the last.

242
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,813
Stay aboard<i> Voyager</i>
for a while.

243
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,232
It'll give Icheb a chance
to get to know you

244
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,693
in an environment
that's familiar to him.

245
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,862
I'll have Neelix
do everything he can

246
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,906
to make you comfortable
while you're here.

247
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,917
Your attitude is making
a difficult situation worse.

248
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,795
I was simply
attempting to ensure
Icheb's well-being.

249
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,296
By insulting his parents?

250
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,005
Those issues needed
to be discussed.

251
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,883
You could've done it
with a little more tact.

252
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,176
Perhaps. But that
doesn't alter the fact

253
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,221
that those individuals may
not be suitable guardians.

254
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,641
Those individuals are
his mother and father.

255
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,351
Which is no guarantee
that they'll be able
to care for him.

256
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,061
He's far more
likely to flourish

257
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,647
if he remains
on<i> Voyager.</i>

258
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,982
That's not an option, Seven.

259
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,777
Are you ordering him
off the ship...
That's not what I said.

260
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,528
...so that he can be
assimilated again?

261
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,280
What makes you so sure
that's going to happen?

262
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,532
They shouldn't remain
on that planet.

263
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,993
It's their home.
It's not worth protecting.

264
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,996
Who are you to decide that?

265
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,249
Anyone who values
their own goals

266
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,544
over the safety of their
children is irresponsible.

267
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:47,340
Are we talking
about Icheb's parents or yours?

268
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,759
Both.

269
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,977
It's not like you to admit
to something like that.

270
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,939
It would be naive for me to
claim objectivity in this case,

271
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,608
but I'm not prepared
to return Icheb to parents

272
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,027
who may be as careless
as my own.

273
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,237
I know what it's like
to feel protective

274
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,407
towards someone you've helped
through a difficult period.

275
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,663
But Icheb is
an individual now.

276
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,206
You have to give
him a chance

277
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,458
to form
his own opinions.

278
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,128
If I do...

279
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,215
and he decides to
remain on<i> Voyager...</i>

280
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,968
Then it'll be my problem.

281
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,639
Is your mother pretty?

282
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,600
What are
they like?

283
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,143
I'm busy.

284
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,312
I never met my father.

285
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,606
I don't
remember ours.

286
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,108
Neither do I.

287
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,654
Are you going to stay
with them?
If you leave,

288
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,281
who is going to help us
with our science projects?

289
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,409
If you don't stop
asking questions,

290
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,619
I'm going to put all of you
in a cargo container

291
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,915
and transport you back
to the Borg.

292
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,464
Come with me.

293
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,008
Where?

294
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,551
To dinner
with your parents.

295
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,094
I'm working.

296
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,013
You can continue
your work after the meal.

297
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,683
I don't have anything
to talk about with them.

298
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,394
Then it will be
a very quiet evening.

299
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,772
I'm not going.

300
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,107
Your attendance is not optional.

301
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,265
Enjoy your meal.

302
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,688
Come, sit down.

303
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,984
I prefer to stand.

304
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,904
Mr. Neelix let me
use his galley

305
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,489
to prepare some<i> poma.</i>

306
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,658
I'm not hungry.

307
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,412
It was your favorite food
when you were little.

308
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,665
I'm not little anymore.

309
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,709
No.

310
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,837
No, you're not.

311
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:39,512
Your mother worked hard
on that meal.

312
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,889
Couldn't you at least try it?

313
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,428
Good.

314
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,682
Isn't it?

315
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,192
Nice to see the family
back together again,
isn't it?

316
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,863
When you were little,
you would only eat...

317
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,883
The Borg didn't leave us
much to work with,

318
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,428
but we didn't need much,
just a little ingenuity.

319
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,638
Everything you see,
we built with our own hands--

320
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,349
our homes,
cultivation bays...

321
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,519
What's this?

322
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,730
A genetic resequencer.

323
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,441
We use it to alter the
DNA of certain plants

324
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,526
to conform with
environmental conditions.

325
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,361
You built this as well.

326
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,614
We adapted parts
from damaged vessels.

327
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,699
Nothing's been wasted.

328
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,492
Efficient.

329
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,328
Efficiency's one attribute
we share with the Borg.

330
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,124
In our case,
it's a necessity.

331
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,754
I know our settlement
seems primitive...

332
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,714
compared to<i> Voyager,</i>

333
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,550
but I promise you,
that will change.

334
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,052
What about space travel?

335
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,595
Someday...

336
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,555
we'll have ships
that rival<i> Voyager,</i>

337
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,057
but we need the dedication

338
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,017
of young people like you
to help us.

339
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,936
Icheb!

340
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,395
How are you?

341
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,815
Well! Thank you!

342
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,567
Maybe later you can join us
up on the field

343
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,903
for a game of pala!

344
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,865
I don't remember
how to play!

345
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,618
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
It will come back to you!

346
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,789
You used to be
quite an athlete.

347
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,751
You can make
a difference here, Icheb.

348
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,296
I don't know anything
about agriculture...

349
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,755
or genetics.

350
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,215
It won't take you long to learn,

351
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,217
not with a mind like yours.

352
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,847
It's time to return
to<i> Voyager.</i>

353
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,224
I am staying here tonight.

354
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,601
They don't have
a regeneration unit.

355
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,728
We're going to have
to install one eventually.

356
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,563
Might as well do it now.

357
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,066
As far as I'm aware,

358
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,943
he hasn't decided
to remain here yet.

359
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,612
But he<i> has</i> asked to stay
tonight.

360
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,408
Return with me to the ship.

361
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,577
We'll prepare
a regeneration unit.

362
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,626
I've adapted
this neural transceiver

363
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,004
to interface
with the portable regenerator.

364
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,341
It has enough power
to complete one full cycle.

365
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,384
We'll have to devise
a way of recharging it.

366
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,679
<i>If</i> Icheb decides to stay.

367
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,227
My wife and I appreciate

368
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,436
everything you've
done for our son.

369
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,147
It's obvious you
care about him.

370
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,733
He's a unique individual.

371
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,818
Yes, he is.

372
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,279
To get him back is... well...

373
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,073
a miracle.

374
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,160
How was he taken?

375
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,291
Since the Borg
first attacked us,

376
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:41,254
we've taken great pains
to hide whatever new technology
we develop.

377
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,173
So that passing cubes won't be
attracted to your planet.

378
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:48,344
Unfortunately, we haven't
always been successful.

379
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:54,141
One morning, about
four years ago...

380
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,396
Icheb heard me talking

381
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,023
about a new
fertilization array

382
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,776
we'd constructed
in the lower field.

383
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,986
He wanted to see it.

384
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,654
I told him I'd take
him the next day.

385
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,407
(<i> sighs</i> )

386
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,368
But he was impatient,
the way boys can be.

387
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,703
I never even realized
he'd wandered off

388
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,496
when the alarm
sounded.

389
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,251
It turns out the Borg
were just as interested

390
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:23,254
in our new technology
as Icheb was.

391
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,424
They took him...

392
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:30,303
assimilated everyone
in the area.

393
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:34,181
Oh. If only I'd kept
a closer eye on him.

394
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,559
Icheb has a mind of his own.

395
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,520
But still...

396
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,523
it's hard not to blame myself.

397
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,568
Your parents must've felt
the same way when they lost you.

398
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,572
My parents were<i> with</i> me
when the Borg attacked.

399
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,034
I can't imagine what that
must've been like for them,

400
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,702
watching their daughter
being assimilated...

401
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,165
helpless to
defend her?

402
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:04,711
It's important
that Icheb regenerate
for six uninterrupted hours.

403
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,380
I understand.

404
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,798
He may resist.

405
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,969
He doesn't like to waste time.

406
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,473
I have had to contend with
his lack of patience as well.

407
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:21,687
LEUCON:
Over there is a star
called Kelsin III,

408
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:25,107
and to the west is
the Orlitus Cluster.

409
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,485
There, just above it,

410
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,862
when you connect
those six stars,

411
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,906
they form what we call
the Great Horn.

412
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,577
I see it.

413
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,709
You inherited your
love of the stars
from your father.

414
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,919
Being on that starship,

415
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,423
you learned much more
about astronomy than I have.

416
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,966
Our little window
can't compare

417
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,302
to<i> Voyager's</i>
Astrometrics Lab.

418
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,428
No.

419
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,514
But it's nice.

420
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,641
You see?

421
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,978
We have everything
we need right here--

422
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:08,484
a warm fire, good food
that we grow ourselves,

423
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,028
and people who love us.

424
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,613
Icheb has people on<i> Voyager</i>

425
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,366
who love him, too.

426
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:22,039
You've grown attached
to the crew on that ship,
haven't you?

427
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,918
They've provided for me,
given me opportunities.

428
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,045
LEUCON:
They're good people--

429
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:32,091
people who've experienced
hardship themselves.

430
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:36,220
Seven of Nine told me
about your science project.

431
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,680
She said it might prove
very useful.

432
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,267
It's designed
to detect wormholes.

433
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,685
How will that benefit them?

434
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,522
It may help them find
a way back to Earth.

435
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,857
Why is that so important
to them?

436
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,820
It's their home.

437
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,535
Interesting, isn't it?

438
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,787
What?

439
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,248
With all their technology,

440
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,461
their opportunity
to explore the galaxy,

441
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:12,381
the thing they want most
is to get home.

442
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,392
Good morning.

443
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,103
Did you regenerate
successfully?

444
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,397
Yes, and I slept...

445
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,941
under the stars.

446
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,818
You should try it.

447
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,613
You weren't in
class this morning.

448
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,573
The others missed you.

449
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,701
I was helping my father.

450
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,081
There is something
we need to discuss.

451
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,795
What is it?

452
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,968
You've decided
to stay with them.

453
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,180
Yes.

454
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,681
You're certain?

455
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,934
This is my home.

456
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:09,313
I have a responsibility
to help them rebuild it.

457
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,400
I'll inform the Captain.

458
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,985
Thank you.

459
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,823
I'm sure you'll
want to say good-bye
to the other children.

460
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:40,093
Inside, you'll find pads
containing data on
a variety of subjects

461
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,305
that will allow you to
continue your studies.

462
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,850
I've also included a
high-resolution telescope.

463
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,687
It's a poor substitute
for astrometric sensors.

464
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,647
I will use it every day.

465
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,992
Good-bye, Icheb, and good luck.

466
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,537
Thank you, Captain.

467
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,997
I hope you find a way home.

468
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,220
(<i> sighs</i> )

469
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,888
COMPUTER:
Warning.

470
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,224
Regeneration cycle incomplete.

471
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,355
What is it?

472
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,524
I can't regenerate.

473
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,986
Warning.
Explain.

474
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,862
Regeneration cycle incomplete.

475
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,073
I miss Icheb.

476
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,494
So do I...

477
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,995
but we'll adapt.

478
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,830
Now return to your alcove.

479
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,917
If you find my parents,
will I have to go with them?

480
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:40,005
We'll discuss that
when and if the time comes.

481
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,425
I hope you don't find them.

482
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,513
Regenerate.

483
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,230
Seven?
Yes?

484
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,066
What if the Borg try to
assimilate Icheb again?

485
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,820
His people lack resources.

486
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,364
The Borg have little reason
to return to their planet.

487
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,033
What if Icheb's on a ship?

488
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,743
Unlikely.

489
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,579
He was on a ship last time.

490
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:16,458
You're mistaken.
He was on the surface
when he was assimilated.

491
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,044
No. He wasn't.

492
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,087
A class-1 transport

493
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,090
was detected
in Grid 649...

494
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,344
one life-form...
species: Brunali.

495
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,984
This better
be important.
It is.

496
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,697
Sorry, I don't read Borg.
You'll have to translate.

497
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,491
This is tactical data
from the cube where we
found the children.

498
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,703
It says that Icheb was alone
aboard an unarmed
transport vessel

499
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,120
when the Borg took him.

500
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,914
Oh, why are you
telling me this

501
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,999
at 0300 hours?

502
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,210
Icheb's father told me
the boy was assimilated

503
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,795
on the planet's surface.

504
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,506
Is it possible
you misunderstood?

505
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,884
No. He was very specific.

506
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,678
That cube was disabled
by a deadly pathogen.

507
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,680
It suffered extensive damage.

508
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,015
Isn't it possible
these records were corrupted?

509
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:18,520
Perhaps, but I found
another inconsistency
in Leucon's story.

510
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,314
He told me Icheb was assimilated
four years ago,

511
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,276
but further analysis indicates
the Borg attacked three times

512
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,528
during the last decade--
nine years ago,

513
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,155
six years ago
and again last year.

514
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:32,576
All right.

515
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,537
Let's assume your information
is accurate.

516
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,539
What does it prove?

517
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:38,998
His father was lying.

518
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,209
Why would he do that?

519
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,713
I'm not certain, but
we have an obligation
to find out.

520
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,047
What are you proposing?

521
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,340
That we return
to the planet,

522
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,384
demand an explanation.

523
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,261
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Those people
have been through enough.

524
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,054
Do we really need
to interrogate them?

525
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,473
We have a
responsibility

526
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,225
to ensure
Icheb's safety.

527
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,478
He chose to stay
with his parents.

528
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,855
Maybe he didn't have
all the information.

529
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,357
Just because they weren't
completely candid with you

530
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,901
doesn't mean
they're unfit parents.

531
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:09,362
At some point...
you have to let go.

532
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,407
I know what you're thinking--

533
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,367
that I'm having
emotional difficulty

534
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,036
accepting my separation
from Icheb.

535
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,581
And you're correct,

536
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,668
but if there's a possibility
he's in danger,
even a remote one,

537
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,087
I have to do whatever I can
to protect him.

538
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,843
If I don't, I'll be no better
than my own parents.

539
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,472
Couldn't we at least
wait a few days?

540
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,307
What would that accomplish?

541
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,767
He's just
getting settled.

542
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,143
The longer we wait,

543
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,895
the harder it'll be
for everyone.

544
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,814
You know that.

545
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,399
Why do it at all?

546
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:50,403
There's nothing compelling us
to go through with it.

547
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,489
It's what he was born for.

548
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,908
Hasn't he been through enough?

549
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,077
Why not give him a chance
at an ordinary life?

550
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,372
He's not an ordinary child.

551
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,290
No, but he can help us
in other ways.

552
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,042
He's bright.
He-he's hardworking...

553
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,418
Leucon...

554
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,005
his return was a gift.

555
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,048
We can't waste it.

556
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,927
I don't want to lose him
a second time.

557
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,722
To survive, we all have
to make sacrifices.

558
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,724
You taught me that.

559
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,354
We won three
games in a row.

560
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,441
Sit down, Icheb.

561
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,366
We need to talk.

562
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,209
You know that
you're very important to us.

563
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,461
Yes.

564
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,551
What you don't know is why.

565
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,637
What do you mean?

566
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,188
What is that?

567
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,274
If you relax, it won't hurt you.

568
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,400
Father...

569
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,985
You'd better hold him.

570
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,948
(<i> grunts</i> ):
What are you doing to me?

571
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,532
No!

572
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,001
Prepare the launch.

573
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,388
Hail them.

574
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,017
We didn't expect
to see you again, Captain.

575
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,227
We'd like to ask you
a few questions,

576
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,813
if you don't mind.

577
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,314
Questions?

578
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,066
Regarding Icheb
and the circumstances

579
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,609
of his assimilation.

580
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,694
We've already
discussed that.

581
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,990
The story you told me
was inconsistent with our data.

582
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,450
We don't owe you
any explanations.

583
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,911
In that case,
I'd like to talk to Icheb.

584
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,871
LEUCON:
He's not here.

585
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,873
Where is he?

586
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,126
That's not
your concern.

587
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,252
Scan for his bio-signs.

588
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,715
He is not in the settlement.

589
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,093
I'm detecting
a Brunali transport vessel.

590
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,679
Distance:
nine million kilometers.

591
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,431
It's heading for the coordinates
of the transwarp conduit.

592
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,558
CHAKOTAY:
According to these readings,

593
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,686
that ship is traveling
at warp 9.8.

594
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,437
It only<i> looks</i> that way.

595
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,023
It's been designed to emit
a false warp signature--

596
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,775
strong enough to
penetrate subspace.

597
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,362
They're using it as bait
to attract the Borg.

598
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,865
Icheb's on that vessel,
isn't he?

599
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,367
He's fighting
for his people.

600
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,828
Alone, on an unarmed transport.

601
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,496
We don't have
particle weapons

602
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,707
or powerful starships
at our disposal.

603
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,835
We're forced to use
the only resource we have.

604
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,128
Your children?

605
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,462
YIFAY:
No.

606
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,631
Our genetic expertise.

607
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,842
Icheb's not bait.

608
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,426
He's a weapon.

609
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,929
The first cube that captured him

610
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,890
was infected
by a pathogen.

611
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,142
Icheb was the carrier,
wasn't he?

612
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:10,020
Every time we try to rebuild,
begin to make progress,

613
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,064
the Borg come
and take it away from us.

614
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,816
Tom, set a course
for that transport vessel,
full impulse.

615
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,359
PARIS:
Aye, Captain.

616
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,153
LEUCON:
You have no right to interfere.

617
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:20,113
We're trying to save
our civilization.

618
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,032
By taking away Icheb's future.

619
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,242
If we don't
stop the Borg,

620
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,786
the Brunali
have no future.

621
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,788
LEUCON:
Captain, a Borg ship

622
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,499
will emerge from that conduit
at any moment.

623
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,751
You'll be destroyed.

624
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,960
We'll take our chances.

625
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,420
End transmission.

626
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,716
Red Alert. Battle stations.

627
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,182
PARIS:
We're coming within range,
Captain.

628
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,017
KIM: I'm picking up
Icheb's life-signs.

629
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,144
Bio-scans indicate
he's unconscious.

630
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,854
Transport him
to Sick Bay.

631
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,606
I can't. There's some kind
of interference.

632
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,316
By my estimate,
It's the conduit.

633
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,778
a Borg vessel will emerge
in less than 40 seconds.

634
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,740
Transfer auxiliary power
to the transporters.

635
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,576
I still can't establish a lock,
not at this distance.

636
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:10,038
30 seconds.
Tom, get us closer
to that ship.

637
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,706
Yes, ma'am.

638
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,338
The conduit's opening.
20 seconds.

639
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,883
Seven?
Still out of range.

640
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,301
You heard her, Tom.

641
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,178
When that Borg ship
comes through,

642
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,013
I'm going to have a hell
of a time getting away from it.

643
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,306
One problem at a time.

644
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,891
TUVOK:
Ten seconds...

645
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,559
nine... eight...

646
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,187
I've got a lock.
Transport in progress.

647
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,273
...five... four...
He's in Sick Bay.

648
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,441
Get us out of here, maximum...

649
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,657
Target their tractor beam
generator.

650
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,617
Phasers targeted.

651
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,952
Fire.

652
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:53,957
No effect.

653
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,541
We are the Borg.

654
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,043
You will be assimilated.

655
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,920
Resistance is futile.

656
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,131
Perhaps not.

657
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,675
There is a way to get a weapon
through their shields.
I'm listening.

658
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,969
Transport a photon torpedo
to the Brunali vessel.

659
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,096
Set it to detonate as soon
as it's inside the sphere.

660
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,598
TUVOK:
That will occur
in approximately 20 seconds.

661
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,060
However,<i> Voyager</i> will be
inside less than
three seconds later.

662
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:17,314
Tom, full reverse thrusters.
It might buy us
a couple more seconds.

663
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,523
Do it.

664
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,903
Transport complete.

665
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,614
Detonation in
ten, nine...

666
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,954
...five... four...
Tom, go to warp on my mark.

667
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,707
Three, two...
All hands, brace for impact.

668
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,629
Now, Mr. Paris!

669
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,926
The Borg vessel has taken
heavy damage.

670
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,594
They are not pursuing.

671
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,847
(<i> sighs</i> )

672
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,273
Are you saying
his parents reinfected him?

673
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,483
No. They merely
sedated him.

674
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,943
I don't understand.

675
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,611
He was genetically
engineered

676
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:09,407
to produce the
pathogen... from birth.

677
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,702
Bred to kill Borg.

678
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,537
Is he in danger?

679
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,539
I can suppress
the pathogen.

680
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,625
He'll be fine...
physically.

681
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,382
He's going to need help
coming to terms with
what's happened.

682
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,758
Captain, I...

683
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,885
Use your maternal
instincts.

684
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,720
They worked before.

685
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:50,698
I thought you
were studying
spatial harmonics.

686
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,245
My parents suggested
I might have an aptitude
for genetics as well.

687
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,664
I see.

688
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,881
What have you learned?

689
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,551
This is the genome
of a typical Brunali male...

690
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,554
and this is<i> my</i> DNA.

691
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,182
They're nearly identical,

692
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,101
but do you notice
the differences

693
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,146
in the third, 13th
and 17th chromosomes?

694
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,688
Yes.

695
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,400
My parents made
microgenetic alterations

696
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:27,568
so I would produce
the pathogen.

697
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,946
Quite ingenious.

698
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,116
It's also barbaric.

699
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,243
They were trying
to defend themselves...

700
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,078
their way of life...

701
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,456
preserve their species.

702
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,125
I know how
difficult it is

703
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,044
to acknowledge
your parents' faults,

704
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,089
but what they did
was wrong.

705
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,467
You don't have
to forgive them.

706
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,304
Do you think
they will ever forgive<i> me?</i>

707
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,014
For what?

708
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,724
I could have destroyed
that sphere.

709
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,643
I failed them.

710
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,561
You would have been
reassimilated.

711
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,189
I know, but...

712
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,650
But what?

713
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,862
Maybe it was my destiny.

714
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,366
Maybe.

715
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,496
In the future, you may choose
to fight the Borg,

716
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,207
but you'll do it
in your own way.

717
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,668
You're an individual,

718
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,297
and you have the right
to determine your own destiny.

719
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,344
It's time to regenerate.

720
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,727
And if I prefer
to continue studying?

721
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,734
It's your decision.
