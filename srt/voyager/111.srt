1
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,760
Commander!

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,345
Look at this.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,972
I think they're
some kind of apple.

4
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,473
There are trees
filled with them

5
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,892
as far as the eye can see
just over that ridge.

6
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>Kaylos.</i> Ah.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,565
Aren't they gorgeous?
One bite'll kill you.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,860
Puff you up like a<i> vakolfish.</i>

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,570
Yeah, first
your windpipe

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,197
( gasping )
swells...

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,532
and just when you think

12
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,492
you're going to die
of suffocation...

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,411
Ow! Oh, you get a sharp pain
in your knees,

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,498
which begins to work
its way right up to...

15
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,292
I think we get
the picture.

16
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,169
Sorry, Mr. Carey.

17
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,046
Just remember the
old trader's axiom:

18
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,925
Never judge a
fruit by its skin.

19
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,012
On the other hand,
huh, take a bite.

20
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,429
What is it?

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,431
A leola root.

22
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,813
You expect us to eat this?

23
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,316
This is the reason
I brought you here, Commander.

24
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,568
There's no better source

25
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,069
of vitamins and minerals
in the Quadrant

26
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,112
than in this,
this ugly little root.

27
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,115
I'd find the second-best source
acceptable if it tasted better.

28
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,201
You humans!

29
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,537
You're not used to
roughing it, are you?

30
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,289
Well, take it
from one who knows.

31
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,333
The day may come
when you'll relish

32
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,794
every last crunch
of leola.

33
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,591
Stewed for a few hours
in a light herbal broth,

34
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,760
ah, you won't even notice
the mildew.

35
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,688
Captain, I don't
think we're alone.

36
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,733
Mr. Tuvok, run a lateral
EM scan for me,

37
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,819
coordinates 81
mark 40.

38
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,821
Running scan.

39
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,114
What do you see, Mr. Paris?

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,283
It's like a reflection.

41
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,743
Something in low orbit.

42
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,703
When it moves into
a certain angle from the sun...

43
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,957
He's correct. I am picking up
an ionization trail.

44
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,917
There is another ship in orbit.

45
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,961
Using some kind
of cloaking device?

46
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,463
It's not a cloaking device
as we know it, Captain.

47
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,172
I cannot say for certain
what it is,

48
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,341
but the ship does employ
some kind of masking circuitry

49
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,969
that has affected our sensors.

50
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,972
<i>Voyager</i> to away team.
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead, Captain.

51
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:23,685
Any unexpected life signs down
there, Commander?

52
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,312
Nothing but bloodworms.

53
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,439
Neelix wants to bring
some back for a tartar

54
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,233
he wants to make. I'm trying
to talk him out of it.

55
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,486
We're picking up an
unidentified ship in low orbit.

56
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,446
Collect your teams,
and prepare to transport back

57
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,657
while we investigate.
Acknowledged.

58
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,283
Chakotay out.

59
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:42,496
All units, report to transport
site A immediately.

60
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,498
Captain, I believe
a polaron burst

61
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,249
may give us visual contact.

62
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,502
Do it.

63
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,384
Kazon.
The hull design does conform

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,846
to known specifications
of the Kazon-Nistrim sect.

65
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,723
<i>Voyager</i> to away teams. Return
to the ship immediately.

66
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,391
Acknowledged, Captain.

67
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,770
Transporter Room, get ready
to begin on my command.

68
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,563
Where is
Ensign Seska?

69
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,276
Chakotay to Seska.

70
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,736
Transporter Room,
can you locate

71
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,613
Ensign Seska's
combadge signal?

72
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,906
Negative, Commander.

73
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,283
I'm not reading any sign of her.

74
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,201
She was picking berries
with our group,

75
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,954
over by the hillside.

76
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,580
There were caves nearby.

77
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,832
If she went inside one,

78
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,416
it might be blocking
her combadge signal.

79
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,335
The rest of you get
back to the ship.

80
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,753
I'm going
to look for her.

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,535
Oh, thank
the Prophets!

82
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,246
What are you
doing here?

83
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,957
Mushrooms. I saw them growing
by the mouth of the cave.

84
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,793
I wanted to teach Neelix
how to make your favorite soup.

85
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,544
I appreciate
the thought,

86
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,256
but we've got
to get out of here.

87
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,631
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48658.2.</i>

88
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,217
<i>We successfully left orbit</i>

89
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,136
<i>without further interference</i>
<i>from the Kazon.</i>

90
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,097
<i>Commander Chakotay was injured,</i>

91
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,058
<i>but is recovering</i>
<i>from his wounds.</i>

92
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,561
(<i> door chimes</i> )

93
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,563
Come in.

94
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,861
I didn't think
I'd make it.

95
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,987
Feeling better?

96
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,324
Yeah. What have
you got there?

97
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,787
Real food.

98
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,997
You got Neelix to make
some mushroom soup.

99
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,291
Are you kidding?

100
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,376
The man wanted
to stretch the mushrooms

101
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,543
with just a little...

102
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,003
leola root.
Leola root.

103
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,588
We got into
this tug of war

104
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,424
with the bag of mushrooms
in the middle.

105
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,759
It was the most ludicrous thing
you've ever seen.

106
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,594
Tuvok and Kes broke us up,

107
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,888
and then Neelix
threw me out of his kitchen.

108
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,140
So, how did you...?

109
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,809
Mm, strictly a Maquis operation.
Hmm!

110
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,104
First, we arranged
for a little morale crisis.

111
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,647
A couple of our people

112
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,400
suddenly came down
with severe homesickness.

113
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,819
Neelix, our devoted
morale officer,

114
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,655
responded to the call
and came in to cheer them up,

115
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,241
and while they were
all singing Rakan folk songs,

116
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,661
Jackson and I
broke into the kitchen.

117
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,207
You looted the
food reserves?

118
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,711
Well, if he's not going
to give us a decent meal...

119
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,548
I can't believe you did this.

120
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,094
Well, it's not like
we're hiding anything.

121
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,763
I did bring soup straight
to the First Officer, didn't I?

122
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,058
Thanks for including me
in a criminal conspiracy.

123
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,311
Does he know
about this yet?

124
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,064
Well, the morale crisis ended
a few minutes ago, so I'd say...

125
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,317
Neelix to Chakotay.

126
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,486
...that he probably does.

127
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,903
Go ahead, Neelix.

128
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,613
I'd like to report a crime.

129
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,033
Someone has broken into
my kitchen and stolen food--

130
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,660
Taken food out of the mouths
of their crewmates.

131
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,911
I know.

132
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,621
It was that Seska, wasn't it?

133
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,208
I promise you everyone involved
will be disciplined.

134
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,044
If you'd like my recommendations
for punishment...

135
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,795
Thank you.
I'll handle that.

136
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,299
Chakotay out.

137
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,885
Replicator privileges
revoked for two days.

138
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,887
Everyone, including me.

139
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,972
They're not going to do it.

140
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,725
Then I'll personally put them in
the Brig.

141
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,895
You'd put me in the Brig?

142
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,981
After all we've
been through?

143
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,282
The soup was worth losing
the replicator privileges

144
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,202
for two days. Admit it.

145
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,995
That's not the point.

146
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,122
I get the point.

147
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,750
Can we make up now?

148
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,050
Who else knows how to make
your favorite soup like I do?

149
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,553
No one...

150
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,346
but we agreed
a long time ago,

151
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,181
this wouldn't work.

152
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,644
Look around, Chakotay.

153
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,232
There aren't that many
potential mates out here.

154
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,449
Of course, if you're
not interested...

155
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,536
I have had my eye
on young Ensign Kim.

156
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,793
Janeway to all senior officers.

157
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,920
Please report to the bridge.

158
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,176
MALE:
We require help... immediately!

159
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,472
Anyone who can hear
this message, please help!

160
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,474
Long-range scanners

161
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,434
picked up the distress signal
three minutes ago.

162
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,269
TUVOK:
The ship's dimensions
are identical

163
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,937
to the vessel
we encountered at the planet.

164
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,564
It is a Kazon-Nistrim
ship, Captain.

165
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,358
Captain, this may be a trap.

166
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,487
The Kazon-Nistrim is one
of the most violent sects

167
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,780
in the entire Kazon Collective.

168
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,199
We need immediate assistance!

169
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,496
We have lost
all bridge operations.

170
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,415
Barely able to function.

171
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,127
Please... assist!

172
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,213
Mr. Kim, can you determine

173
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,091
if this ship
has sustained genuine damage?

174
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,385
There are fluctuating
nucleonic patterns.

175
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,805
It might indicate a
reactor breakdown on board.

176
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,933
Mr. Paris, run an extended
scanner sequence

177
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,560
to identify
any other Kazon ships

178
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,020
that might be in the area.

179
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,396
( console beeping )

180
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,148
Nothing showing up, Captain.

181
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,651
Maintain scans
and set a heading to intercept.

182
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,444
PARIS:
New heading entered.

183
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,571
I take your warning
seriously, Neelix,

184
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,156
and will act
with caution,

185
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,367
but if we can
help, we should.

186
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,700
Besides,

187
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,994
this may be
an opportunity

188
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,871
to make a friend,

189
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,789
and out here,

190
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,293
we can use all the friends
we can get.

191
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,934
TORRES:
What could do something like
this?

192
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,271
I'm showing high levels
of nucleonic radiation.

193
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,856
It seems to be isolated
in that area.

194
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,275
It is likely
that the ship's

195
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,193
automatic containment
systems were activated

196
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,530
when the radiation
entered the bridge.

197
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,282
We should be safe
as long as we stay

198
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,200
on this side
of the force field.

199
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,500
Someone's alive over here.

200
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,838
( groaning )

201
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,554
CHAKOTAY:
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>

202
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,014
We've got a single male Kazon
alive on the bridge.

203
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,183
Transport him
directly to sick bay.

204
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,935
Energizing.

205
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,566
It appears the explosion
emanated from this console.

206
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,610
Something look a little odd
about it to you?

207
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,612
The structural pattern
does not conform

208
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,071
to the rest of the bridge.

209
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,073
There's something else
strange about it.

210
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,369
The residue has a .41 percent
trace of a neosorium composite,

211
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,205
and I don't know anyone
who uses neosorium technology,

212
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,750
except for
the Federation.

213
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,295
So how did it get into
the hands of the Kazon?

214
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,259
Incredible.

215
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,845
Somehow, virtually every cell
in his body has been altered.

216
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,640
Altered?

217
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,224
His cells
have mutated,

218
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,477
or they've been fused
with inorganic matter.

219
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,522
I can't make heads or tails
of it. Look at this.

220
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,650
His blood cells have bonded
with metallic nuclei.

221
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,568
The crew members
closest to the explosion

222
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,780
were virtually melded with
huge pieces of metal fragments.

223
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,532
He was luckier
than the others.

224
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,492
That remains
to be seen.

225
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,952
I'm going to have to do
a complete pyrocyte replacement

226
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,746
if we're going
to keep him alive.

227
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,290
We'd better hope there are
compatible donors on board.

228
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,668
I'll run a cytological
screening of the crew.

229
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,586
We'll let you
know the results

230
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,087
as soon as we can.

231
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,844
Captain, there was an
apparent Federation signature

232
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,346
to the explosion.
What?

233
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,139
It looked like
they were trying to install

234
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,808
some new technology
that detonated.

235
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,184
You're saying
they have some kind

236
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,977
of Federation weapon
on board?

237
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,689
A console on the bridge
was the source of the explosion.

238
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,232
We're not sure
what its function was,

239
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,817
and it's going
to be hard to get to.

240
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,569
We can't
transport it out?

241
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,613
Not with those levels
of nucleonic radiation.

242
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,323
The transporter beam
would disperse

243
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,075
the moment it hit
the irradiated cabin.

244
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,661
How could they possibly
have Federation technology?

245
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,079
There are only
three alternatives

246
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,748
I can discern
at this time.

247
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,208
One: It is not
Federation technology at all,

248
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,210
but something
similar.

249
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,461
Bridge.

250
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,756
Two:
Another Federation starship

251
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,465
may have been brought
to the Delta Quadrant

252
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,800
prior to our arrival,

253
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,968
and they interacted
with the Kazon-Nistrim.

254
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,137
Were there any other
reports of missing starships?

255
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,472
Not to my knowledge.

256
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,641
Three: Someone
from this ship

257
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,352
has covertly given technology
to the Kazon.

258
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,272
Computer,
hold turbolift.

259
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,818
I don't like number three at
all, Tuvok.

260
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,780
Nevertheless, it is the most
probable explanation.

261
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,406
It may not
be a coincidence

262
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,784
that the Kazon ship
we encountered at the planet

263
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,744
was able to deceive
our sensors.

264
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,204
Perhaps someone transmitted
instructions to them

265
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,456
before we arrived.

266
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,374
( sighs )

267
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,126
I want you to personally

268
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,795
go through the
transmission logs, Tuvok.

269
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,755
Compare them to
the actual telemetry.

270
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,090
See if there's any
evidence of prior contact

271
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,217
with the Kazon.

272
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,886
Who would have had a chance
to meet with them

273
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,930
while you were on the surface?
A dozen people.

274
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,598
We were scattered
all over the area.

275
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,476
You did discover Ensign Seska
in proximity to them.

276
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,436
Seska almost killed me

277
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,104
because she thought
I was Kazon.

278
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,064
She wouldn't do
something like this.

279
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,818
Nevertheless, I urge you
to regard her with caution

280
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,277
for the time being.

281
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,825
Why would anyone
on this ship betray us?

282
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,869
We're all in this together.

283
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,497
We need to retrieve that console
and get some answers

284
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,666
before the rumors
get out of hand.

285
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,584
Computer, resume.

286
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,633
Releasing the force field
isn't an option.

287
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,093
That would just allow the
radiation into the whole cabin.

288
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,262
We could generate
a localized subspace bubble

289
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,806
to get past
the force field.

290
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,390
One minor
subspace disruption

291
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,351
and you're dead.
It's too risky.

292
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,060
I'd be willing
to risk it.

293
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,606
We could use an expander

294
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,984
to manipulate
the containment field.

295
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,195
Manipulate it how?

296
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,197
Move it out of the way.

297
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,448
Rotate the field,

298
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,074
and the radiation
trapped inside it

299
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,368
away from the console.

300
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,787
Once it's clear,
we have access.

301
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,331
How long will it take
to set this up?

302
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,417
We, uh, we should be able to
make an attempt by tomorrow.

303
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,294
I want it ready
by the end of the day.

304
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,629
No, Captain.

305
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,256
When I say tomorrow,
I mean tomorrow.

306
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,426
I don't exaggerate.
Tomorrow is the best I can do.

307
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,595
Understood, Lieutenant.

308
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,059
All right... we'll begin
on the Kazon bridge.

309
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,436
Carey, Nicoletti, Seska.

310
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,689
No. I want Ensign Seska

311
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,567
to coordinate the operation
from our bridge.

312
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,277
Okay, Henard,
you're with us.

313
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,988
Dismissed.

314
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,576
What was that all about?
What?

315
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,202
Oh, you know
what I'm talking about.

316
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,120
There's nothing important to do
on the bridge.

317
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,581
I disagree. We need someone
up there--

318
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,583
What the hell
is going on?

319
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,838
There's some concern
about you.

320
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,718
What kind of concern?

321
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,930
Concern because I found you
near the Kazon on the planet.

322
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,099
Oh, I see.
So now I'm a traitor.

323
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,351
I sell technology to the enemy?
I don't believe that.

324
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,687
No, you just take me off
my assignment.

325
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,731
I'm trying to take you out of
harm's way to protect you.

326
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,190
This is your idea
of protection?

327
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,734
You might as well
point a finger at me

328
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,444
in front of the entire crew.

329
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,364
You don't assign someone
you don't trust to the bridge.

330
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,075
Look, I'm sorry,

331
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,410
but if something goes wrong
over there, I don't want you

332
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,954
anywhere near it.

333
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,581
Thanks for
your concern.

334
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,175
How is he?

335
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,177
Not very good.

336
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,347
We need to completely
replace his blood.

337
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,820
Will he regain
consciousness?

338
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,404
I'm not sure.

339
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,406
Even if he does, there's no way
to predict

340
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,285
what kind of brain
damage there might be.

341
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,037
He's the only one
who really knows

342
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,289
what happened
on that ship, Doctor.

343
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,833
The only one
who can tell them

344
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,292
I had nothing
to do with it.

345
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,210
You? I don't
understand.

346
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,338
Would you call me
right away if he wakes up?

347
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,381
All right.

348
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,304
Ensign...

349
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,639
did you ever come in

350
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,724
to leave a blood
sample on file?

351
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,978
No. I never got around to it.

352
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,437
Why?

353
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,065
I've been running a crew
compatibility analysis,

354
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,859
and your file
never came up.

355
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,276
My blood won't help you.

356
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,113
I had a childhood disease
that infected it.

357
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,699
I was warned never to donate
blood for a transfusion.

358
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,869
All the more reason we should
have your blood on file.

359
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,287
I will.

360
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,957
Right now, I have something
more important to take care of.

361
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,087
Someone did make
an unauthorized transmission.

362
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,631
And whoever it was was an expert
at covering their tracks.

363
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,925
The signal was masked by a test
of the dorsal emitters

364
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,301
that we conducted
a week ago.

365
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,970
Who was working
on that test?

366
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,139
Only the whole Engineering crew.
We're trying to trace

367
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,765
the station where the signal
originated.

368
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,600
Again, the perpetrator
was skilled enough

369
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,853
to make the tracking process
extremely difficult for us.

370
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,397
It's like working backwards
through a maze of circuits.

371
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,024
We keep bumping
into dead ends.

372
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,692
Paris to Captain Janeway.

373
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,861
Please report to the bridge.

374
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,782
Captain, another Kazon ship
is approaching,

375
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,409
trying to hail
the disabled ship.

376
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,994
They're not within
visual range yet.

377
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,080
Perhaps someone else
picked up the distress call.

378
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,207
What's their ETA?

379
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,959
At their current speed,
four hours, 20 minutes.

380
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,420
Should I tell them we're here?
If we know about them,

381
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,882
it's a good bet
they know about us.

382
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,426
We don't have anything good
to tell them.

383
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,053
I think we'll wait.

384
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,180
Captain, I'm showing
an unauthorized autosequence

385
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,016
in Transporter Room 2. Someone's
left<i> Voyager.</i>

386
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,518
Computer, identify who just
beamed off the ship

387
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,853
from Transporter Room 2.

388
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,772
Ensign Seska.

389
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,288
Chakotay to Seska.

390
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,497
I really don't have time

391
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,166
to talk to you right now,
Chakotay.

392
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,918
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

393
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,087
Retrieving the console, my way.

394
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,838
I want you back
on this ship, and I mean now.

395
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,633
The Captain said she wanted
the console today.

396
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,176
Carey's plan
couldn't do it in time,

397
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,510
but mine can.

398
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,054
Captain, it is conceivable

399
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,639
that she has gone
to the Kazon ship

400
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,599
to destroy evidence
that might implicate her.

401
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,810
She's gone back to the Kazon
ship to prove herself to us.

402
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,937
Can't you see that?
I've got a lock on her, Captain.

403
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,438
Do you want me
to transport her back?

404
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,190
If we try to beam her out

405
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,733
while she's
manipulating subspace,

406
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,278
we might kill her.
(<i> screaming</i> )

407
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,241
Chakotay to Seska.

408
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,743
Seska, respond.

409
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,454
Get her out of there!
Send her to sick bay.

410
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,248
Energizing.

411
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,839
Prep three ccs kelotane.

412
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,884
I'll need a dermal regenerator.
Run a full blood scan.

413
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,014
(<i> moaning</i> )

414
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,570
Have a seat, Mr. Carey.

415
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,915
How have things been going
for you in engineering?

416
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,750
Fine.

417
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,377
Why, is there a problem?

418
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:02,380
You getting along all right
with Lieutenant Torres?

419
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,134
I think we've settled
our differences.

420
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,304
She was promoted to Chief
Engineer over you, Lieutenant.

421
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,555
That might be difficult

422
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,266
for someone in your position
to accept.

423
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,686
Captain, I accepted
your decision,

424
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,856
and I've worked as hard as I can
to make myself a valuable member

425
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,983
of Lieutenant Torres' team.

426
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,027
I can't believe
she'd have any complaints

427
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,528
about my performance.

428
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,988
She doesn't.

429
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:29,367
Then what am I doing here?

430
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,537
Lieutenant,
have you had any contact

431
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,788
with the Kazon-Nistrim

432
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,749
since we arrived
in the Delta Quadrant?

433
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,377
What?!

434
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,837
Y-You mean, me personally?

435
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,342
No. Of course not.

436
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,344
You were out of contact
for almost an hour

437
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,763
on the planet
where we encountered the Kazon.

438
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,516
You mean, when I was picking
those poison apples?

439
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,394
What about before
we arrived at the planet?

440
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:59,688
Did you have any reason
to signal a Kazon-Nistrim ship?

441
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,523
No.
Nevertheless,

442
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,360
a signal was sent to the Kazon
from your station in Engineering

443
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,528
during our
dorsal emitter test last week.

444
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,905
My station?

445
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,116
Were you not in Engineering
at that time?

446
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,619
Well, yes, I was, but...

447
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,454
you know how it is down there
during a systems analysis.

448
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,082
Did you see anyone else
at your station?

449
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,042
Honestly, I don't remember.

450
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,169
Maybe you should ask Seska.

451
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,796
Why Seska?

452
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:28,384
Everybody knows she was found
in the cave with the Kazon.

453
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,273
Look, I'm not saying
she did anything wrong,

454
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,024
but I didn't either.

455
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,236
I'd like to believe you,
Mr. Carey,

456
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,364
but somebody did contact
the Kazon,

457
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,074
and until we know who,

458
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,952
I'm going to have
to restrict you to quarters.

459
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,383
What do you think?

460
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,137
He had the motive
and the opportunity.

461
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,140
He's also had a distinguished
Starfleet career.

462
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,558
Seska spent most of
the last two years

463
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,394
as an enemy
of the Federation.

464
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,022
So have I.

465
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,986
KIM:
Captain, we're being hailed
by the approaching Kazon ship.

466
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,030
How soon will they be here?
Four minutes.

467
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,115
I wish we had something
more definitive to tell them.

468
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,950
Open a channel.

469
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,787
I am Kathryn Janeway,

470
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,999
Captain of the Federation
starship<i> Voyager.</i>

471
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:47,046
My name is Culluh,
First Maje of the Kazon-Nistrim.

472
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,756
What have you done to our ship?

473
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,427
We responded to a call for help.

474
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,013
Unfortunately, by the time
we were able to respond,

475
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,349
all but one of the crew
were dead.

476
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,310
I would like to speak
to the survivor.

477
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,895
He hasn't
regained consciousness.

478
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,562
We have him in our sick bay.

479
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,107
We'd be happy to beam you aboard
so you can see him.

480
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,818
You will prepare for my arrival.

481
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,280
Friendly sort.

482
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,834
DOCTOR:
Ah, Captain,
I'm glad you're here.

483
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,545
I was just about
to call you.

484
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,797
Doctor, this is
First Maje Culluh,

485
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,590
of the Kazon-Nistrim.
Could you give us

486
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,469
the latest condition report
on your Kazon patient?

487
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,888
Well, the good news is, we've
been able to stabilize him.

488
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,350
We had to completely
replace his blood.

489
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,310
Replace his blood?

490
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,937
With what?

491
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,356
The blood of volunteers
from our crew.

492
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,899
They saved his life.

493
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,026
His own blood cells
were killing him.

494
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,447
They were changed
by the accident on his ship.

495
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,031
Changed in what manner?

496
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,285
We haven't been able
to determine that yet.

497
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,660
We've been
working on a plan

498
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,996
to access the source
of the explosion,

499
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,458
which should answer
a lot of the questions.

500
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,625
That will no longer
be necessary.

501
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,879
We will take the damaged vessel
to our port for inspection.

502
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,342
I'm afraid I can't allow you
to do that just yet.

503
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:19,012
And what gives you the right
to interfere in our affairs?

504
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,974
There was a trace
of a Federation compound

505
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,017
in the remains
of the explosion.

506
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,895
We have reason to believe
that someone on board this ship

507
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,231
gave technology
to your people.

508
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:33,068
Until we have a better
explanation of what occurred,

509
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,446
I can't release
that ship to you.

510
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,364
That is not acceptable.

511
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,241
It will have to be.

512
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:43,537
Your unique technologies
make you brave, Captain,

513
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,206
but you have only one ship.

514
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,541
In less than a day,

515
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,419
there will be four Kazon vessels
off your bow.

516
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,713
Perhaps by then we'll have
the answers we need.

517
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,216
You will leave us with him.

518
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,811
I assume they'll want to
take him back to their ship.

519
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,480
I'd rather not let them
do it just yet,

520
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,981
in case
he regains consciousness.

521
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,858
There are a lot of questions
he can answer.

522
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,652
Can I tell them
it's not safe to move him?

523
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,862
It will be the truth.
Good.

524
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,708
( steady tone sounds )

525
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,169
He's dead.

526
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,505
Get off this ship.

527
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,177
There was some kind
of nerve toxin

528
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,680
in that needle.
He died instantly.

529
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,646
Captain, may we talk to you
in my office? 

530
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,737
It's about Seska.

531
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,574
Complications?

532
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,076
I was analyzing
her blood chemistry

533
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,995
to try to locate
a compatible donor.

534
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,498
But when I got the results,
her blood was lacking

535
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,958
all the common
Bajoran blood factors.

536
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,085
Meaning?

537
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,503
The only conclusion
we can reach

538
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,380
is that she is not,
in fact, Bajoran.

539
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,633
It appears Seska has been
genetically altered.

540
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:23,887
My suspicion is she
was born Cardassian.

541
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,442
You're asking me to believe
she's a Cardassian agent

542
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,901
who infiltrated the Maquis?

543
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,446
Starfleet Security has
documented several incidents

544
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,656
in which Cardassians
have used cosmetic alterations

545
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,491
for the purpose
of infiltrating an enemy.

546
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,993
This is crazy.
This is just impossible.

547
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,954
The Doctor has informed us
that there is no other

548
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,498
plausible explanation for the
medical anomalies, Commander.

549
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,500
If you don't mind,
I'd like to hear her explanation

550
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,210
before we dismiss it.

551
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,546
Has she been told?
No.

552
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,424
I'd like to be the one
who questions her.

553
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,926
I suggest we wait
until we retrieve the console.

554
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,094
Janeway to Torres.

555
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,639
Yes, Captain.
Your status.

556
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:09,141
We are finished
with the computer simulations.

557
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,351
Everything looks okay.
We're ready to beam over.

558
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,271
Good. Then let's get started.
Janeway out.

559
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,107
You were working for her,
Seska was working for them.

560
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,277
Was anyone on board
that ship working for me?

561
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,362
The Kazon ship
is hailing us.

562
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,989
Open a channel.

563
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,367
On screen.

564
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,079
Our sensors show that you are
trespassing on our vessel.

565
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,999
As I've already informed you,
we're attempting

566
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,794
to retrieve the console
that caused this explosion.

567
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:40,046
If you attempt to remove
anything from our ship,

568
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,800
it will be considered
an act of war.

569
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,009
You know,

570
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,885
I'm really easy
to get along with

571
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,638
most of the time...

572
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:51,183
but I don't like bullies,
and I don't like threats,

573
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,478
and I don't like you, Culluh.

574
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,652
You can try and stop us
from getting to the truth,

575
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,987
but I promise you, if you do,

576
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:07,324
I will respond with
all the "unique" technologies

577
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,784
at my command.

578
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,619
Janeway out.

579
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,372
Their weapons systems
are standing down.

580
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,166
They do not appear to be posing
a threat to us at this time.

581
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,418
At least not until
reinforcements get here.

582
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,546
Janeway to away team.
TORRES: Yes, Captain?

583
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,255
I don't want to rush you,
Lieutenant, but--

584
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,590
We're finished, Captain.

585
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,467
I beg your pardon?

586
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,927
Decontamination
went exactly as planned.

587
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,055
The console has been transported
to Engineering,

588
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,807
and we're on our way back now.

589
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,476
Acknowledged.
Well done, away team.

590
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,854
We'll meet you
in Engineering.

591
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,285
Of all the things to die for.

592
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,874
It's a food
replicator...

593
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,793
or at least
it was trying to be.

594
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,629
We may take replicators
for granted,

595
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,297
but imagine what it would mean

596
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,259
to a culture that doesn't have
this technology.

597
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,637
They didn't use a thick enough
interior shield casing.

598
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,098
Once the nucleonic radiation
leaked out,

599
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,100
a cascade reaction
was inevitable.

600
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,270
Can you tell if any part of
the console came from our ship?

601
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,188
There's no doubt about it,
Captain.

602
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,648
The pattern buffer relays

603
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,610
are clearly composed
of bioneural fibers.

604
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,695
No other Federation ship
would have them.

605
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:32,075
Somebody on board<i> Voyager</i> 
gave them what they needed.

606
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,870
I guess they just didn't know
what to do with it.

607
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,581
I want a complete report
on everything we've found

608
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:41,668
so I can share it
with our Kazon friends.

609
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,685
We've recovered
the console.

610
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,395
It's a replicator

611
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,775
constructed with materials
from<i> Voyager.</i>

612
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,401
I suppose now everyone thinks

613
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,195
I went over there
to destroy the evidence.

614
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,491
Did you?

615
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,577
I was only trying
to show everyone--

616
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,913
Show you...

617
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,627
You really think I had something
to do with this, don't you?

618
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:28,507
To be honest,
I'm not sure anymore.

619
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,259
I'm not sure of
a lot of things.

620
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,303
Then why don't you go talk
to your animal guide

621
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,763
and figure it all out?

622
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,055
I plan to.

623
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,685
Good. Get back to me when you
do.

624
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,063
You know, it's funny...

625
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,065
I've been thinking
about what's been real

626
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,609
and what's
not been real.

627
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,197
What is this about?

628
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,033
What's wrong with you?

629
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,576
Talk to me, Chakotay.

630
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,871
You owe me that much.

631
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,042
What would you say

632
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,628
I owed to a Cardassian
who infiltrated my crew?

633
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,506
What are you talking about?

634
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,924
Isn't that why
you never got around

635
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,134
to a blood analysis
when we came on board?

636
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,469
I didn't get around to it

637
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,804
because I didn't
get around to it.

638
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,096
Turns out your
blood is missing

639
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,182
all the common
Bajoran blood factors.

640
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,768
It's a side effect
of Orkett's disease.

641
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,687
Ask your doctor.

642
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,647
Orkett's disease?

643
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,525
A childhood virus that swept
through the Bajoran work camps

644
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,985
during the Occupation.

645
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,487
Thousands of children
didn't survive.

646
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,741
I did, thanks to
a bone marrow transplant

647
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,951
from a sympathetic
Cardassian woman.

648
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,913
Her name was Kattell.
When we get home,

649
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,957
you can ask her yourself.

650
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,048
You must think I'm horrible.

651
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:54,217
Do you think I gave you my...

652
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:58,555
my heart to get
your Maquis secrets?

653
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,225
I was starting to wonder.

654
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,522
Let me tell you something...

655
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,984
your secrets
weren't good enough.

656
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,652
They wouldn't have been worth
the trouble

657
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,447
for a Cardassian agent.

658
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,367
I had only one agenda
with you, Chakotay,

659
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,620
and I never kept it secret.

660
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,418
So you believe in me again?

661
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,799
I want to.

662
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,385
Good, because I want
to go back to work.

663
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,804
Let's not rush things.

664
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,764
No, I'm going stir-crazy
in here.

665
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,599
You're going to have
to stay confined,

666
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,017
at least until we find out

667
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,103
exactly where the
replicator components

668
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:49,397
were taken from.
Well, what'll that tell you?

669
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,357
There might be evidence
of who took them.

670
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,485
Oh, you don't think
whoever did this

671
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:57,072
is foolish enough to log in
using their own name?

672
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,576
Chief Inspector Tuvok
leaves no stone unturned.

673
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,289
I'll tell the Captain
what you told me.

674
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,417
Somehow, we'll try
to clear this up soon.

675
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,976
She said a Cardassian
bone marrow transplant

676
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,186
saved her life as a child.

677
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:32,107
Did you set our
plan in motion?

678
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,485
I gave Lieutenant Carey
the same information.

679
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:40,073
Now all we can do is wait
and hope someone takes the bait.

680
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,393
Gin.

681
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,479
I never knew Vulcans had such
a talent for cards.

682
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,940
It is simply a matter
of logical discards,

683
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,151
which give a false impression
of my own requirements

684
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,403
and deny the needed cards
to your hand.

685
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,697
I believe that's
94 points to me.

686
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,908
If you ever need a sponsor
in a gin tournament,

687
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,242
let me know.

688
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,327
We're picking up
two more Kazon warships,

689
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,621
about six hours away.
We're not going to be able

690
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,790
to stay here much--
( console beeping )

691
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,626
That sounds like
a nibble to me.

692
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,217
Someone is accessing
the inventory database.

693
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,384
And they're going straight to

694
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,261
the missing replicator
materials.

695
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,637
Should we start
the trace now?

696
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,931
Negative.
It might alert them.

697
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,891
They're entering data.
Intriguing.

698
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,018
It appears as though they're
trying to place evidence

699
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,230
at the scene of the crime
to indicate the guilty party.

700
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,440
They're entering
an encrypted security code

701
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,483
into the materials
requisition file.

702
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,819
Which would suggest
they're hiding it,

703
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,654
but not very well.

704
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:05,117
Anybody know whose security code
that belongs to?

705
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,786
I do.

706
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,871
It's Seska's.

707
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,334
Then it has to be Carey.

708
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:19,047
Carey is trying to point
the finger at Seska.

709
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,524
Chakotay...

710
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,527
is anything wrong?

711
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:46,532
It's over. We know who gave
the technology to the Kazon.

712
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,079
Who?

713
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,206
You did.

714
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,711
Look, I don't know what evidence
you think you've found, but...

715
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,215
We found the evidence
you put there for us to find.

716
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,050
Your own security code.

717
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,262
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

718
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,056
We already knew where the stolen
materials had been taken from

719
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,517
before I met with you.

720
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,061
We were monitoring
the inventory manifest,

721
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,231
hoping either you or Carey
would try to cover your tracks.

722
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,650
Hell of a way for me
to cover my tracks,

723
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,402
putting in my own security code
for you to find?

724
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,488
That's exactly what you did.

725
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,366
You knew no one would believe
you could be that careless.

726
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,659
You wanted us to believe

727
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,577
that someone else
was trying to frame you.

728
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,122
Ever consider
that maybe someone was?

729
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:38,501
We traced the computer station
used to enter the data.

730
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,129
Oh, you took us all around
the system and back again

731
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,422
before we could locate
the source,

732
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:47,552
but it was this station
in sick bay.

733
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:54,184
I'd almost say
it was a Maquis operation,

734
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:56,853
if I didn't already know
you were a Cardassian.

735
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:01,816
Computer, activate emergency
holographic medical program.

736
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,402
Ah.

737
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,740
Have I been called
to testify?

738
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,202
Before you even mentioned
Orkett's disease to me,

739
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,995
the doctor had
already discounted that

740
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,414
as a possible explanation
for your blood anomalies.

741
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,625
DOCTOR:
And may I say a doctor less
informed about Bajoran medicine

742
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,212
might have been fooled,
but my program includes

743
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:25,215
the complete Bajoran medical
text on Orkett's disease.

744
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,217
There's no way
any childhood virus

745
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,219
or Cardassian
bone marrow transplant

746
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,554
can explain away the genetic
markers in your blood.

747
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,890
You are Cardassian, Ensign.

748
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,934
But that didn't necessarily
make you the traitor

749
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,644
we were looking for.
We needed more evidence,

750
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:42,148
and you gave it to us.

751
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:46,361
The one thing
I still can't understand is...

752
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,071
why?

753
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,825
I did it for you.

754
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,288
I did it for this crew.

755
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,373
We are alone here,

756
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,500
at the mercy
of any number of hostile aliens

757
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,296
because of
the incomprehensible decision

758
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,798
of a Federation Captain.

759
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,008
A Federation Captain
who destroyed

760
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,095
our only chance to get home.

761
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,931
Federation rules,

762
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,558
Federation nobility,

763
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,852
Federation compassion?

764
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,104
Do you understand?

765
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,855
If this had been
a Cardassian ship,

766
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,441
we would be home now.

767
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,526
We must begin to forge
alliances.

768
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,529
To survive,
we must have powerful friends.

769
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,450
The Kazon-Nistrim were willing
to be our protectors

770
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,244
in return
for some minor technology.

771
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,079
Minor technology
that could change

772
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,082
the balance of power
in this Quadrant.

773
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,375
Change it in our favor.

774
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,336
That is all that matters
at this point,

775
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:47,588
building a base of power
in this Quadrant.

776
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:53,178
You are a fool, Captain.

777
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,972
And you're a fool
to follow her.

778
00:41:55,972 --> 00:42:00,935
I can't imagine
how I ever loved you.

779
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,022
Computer, Command XJL.

780
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,192
Computer, override
transport in progress.

781
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,611
Unable to comply.
Security lockout is in place.

782
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,031
Computer, identify destination
of transport.

783
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,451
A Kazon vessel,
14 kilometers off the port bow.

784
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,119
Bridge to Janeway.
Go ahead.

785
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,996
The Kazon ship
is powering up its engines.

786
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,956
It looks like they're
getting ready to go to warp.

787
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,876
Ready a tractor beam.
I've also got two Kazon warships

788
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,003
on an intercept course
less than ten minutes away.

789
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:30,256
TUVOK:
Captain, even with our superior
defense capabilities,

790
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:34,344
we cannot prevail against
three Kazon warships.

791
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:37,930
Awaiting your instructions,
Captain.

792
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,350
Power down the tractor beam.

793
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,228
Set a course out of here,
Mr. Paris, warp four.

794
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,854
Engage when ready.

795
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,731
Yes, ma'am.

796
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,568
We'll have to wait for another
day to settle up with Seska.

797
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,795
Can I ask you to be honest
with me, Lieutenant?

798
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:13,508
As a Vulcan, I am at all
times honest, Commander.

799
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,553
That's not exactly true.
You lied to me

800
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:19,222
when you passed yourself off
as a Maquis to get on my crew.

801
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,932
I was honest
to my own convictions

802
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,975
within the defined parameters
of my mission.

803
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,354
You damned Vulcans
and your defined parameters.

804
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,939
That's easy for you.

805
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,733
On the contrary. The demands
on a Vulcan's character

806
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,777
are extraordinarily difficult.

807
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,864
Do not mistake composure
for ease.

808
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,658
How may I be honest
with you today?

809
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,667
I'd just like to know,

810
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:53,047
from someone else who pulled
the wool over my eyes,

811
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,216
was I particularly naive?

812
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,926
Was I not
paying enough attention?

813
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,471
What the hell was it that
let all you spies get by me?

814
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,722
Like all humans,

815
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,559
you depend on feelings
and instincts to guide you,

816
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,437
and they invariably
let you down.

817
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,272
But "particularly naive"?

818
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,899
No, Commander,
and I've always considered

819
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,776
your attention span
to be adequate.

820
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,237
Did you ever see anything
about Seska

821
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,905
that made you suspicious?

822
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,617
No. She quite expertly

823
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:23,369
"pulled the wool"
over my eyes as well.

824
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,913
Well...

825
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,834
that makes me feel
a little better. Thanks.

826
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,377
Curious.

827
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,670
What?

828
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,713
That my failure,
added to your own,

829
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,509
should improve your feelings.

830
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,262
Misery loves company, Tuvok.
