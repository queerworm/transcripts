1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:04,546
I've been considering
naming him after my husband.

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,298
It's been a tradition
in his family

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,050
for over five
generations.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,219
I'm sure
he'd be very pleased.

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,349
My husband's name is..
Greskrendtregk.

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,020
He's Ktarean.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,272
Choosing a name
is no easy matter.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,983
I speak
from experience.

9
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,234
Have you had
any progress, Doctor?

10
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,905
( sighs )
I've reviewed
historical, literary

11
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,700
and anthropological databases
from over 500 worlds,

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,994
and have yet to find
a suitable name.

13
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,955
However, I may want
to give some thought to...

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,624
Greskrendtregk.

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,209
To be honest,

16
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:46,087
I've been thinking
of something simpler.

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,422
What do you think
of Cameron?

18
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,132
Oh, I like it.

19
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,592
Cameron. From
the ancient

20
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,889
Celtic term for one
whose nose is bent.

21
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,849
Well, what about Frederick?

22
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,059
Frederick.
Very distinguished.

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,520
However, it bears
a close resemblance

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,107
to a rather impolite term
on the Bolian home world.

25
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,238
Well, it doesn't have
to be a human name.

26
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,657
I like Sural.
It's Vulcan.

27
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,200
Yes. Unfortunately,

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,661
it was also the name
of a dictator on Sakura Prime,

29
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,332
famed for beheading his rivals
and his parents.

30
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,626
He won't have
an objection to Benaren.

31
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,378
You're right. I've never heard
that name before.

32
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,048
I think it's lovely.
Is it Ocampan?

33
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:32,300
Benaren was
my father's name.

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,469
He was the greatest
inspiration in my life.

35
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,305
JANEWAY:<i> All science officers</i>
<i>please report to your stations.</i>

36
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,059
Your scans look fine, Ensign.

37
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,185
We'll see you in a week.
Thank you.

38
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,273
Greskrendtregk
would make

39
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,275
a good middle name,
don't you think?

40
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,657
You never suggested
your father's name to me.

41
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,410
I-I thought you were only
considering human names.

42
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,539
Ah. Well, you
were mistaken.

43
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,041
If you like Benaren,

44
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,709
there's no reason
you can't use it too.

45
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,335
I'm sure she won't mind.

46
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,755
Won't mind that I just
usurped her baby's name

47
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,256
the moment I heard it?

48
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,634
Thank you, but
no, thank you.

49
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,637
My uncle's name
was Elrem.

50
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,555
I once knew
a boy named Tarrik.

51
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,725
PARIS:
There's not much left
of whatever it was.

52
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,560
From the amount of debris,

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,147
I'd guess it was a small ship,
no bigger than a shuttlecraft.

54
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,482
I'm not reading
any organic material

55
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,942
in the debris field.

56
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,526
It must have
been an unmanned vessel.

57
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,694
Possibly a probe.

58
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,154
Any idea
what happened to it?

59
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,197
The high residual
energy signature

60
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,533
indicates
repeated weapons fire.

61
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,995
Captain, the wreckage
is composed primarily

62
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,038
of duritanium polyalloy.

63
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,749
Duritanium?

64
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,959
I haven't seen many weapons

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,293
that could do
that kind of damage

66
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,586
to a duritanium hull.

67
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,296
Transport some samples
of the debris

68
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,007
to Engineering
for analysis.

69
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,092
Continuous scans,
Lieutenant.

70
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,217
We don't want
whoever did this

71
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,012
to catch us
by surprise.

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,147
Any conclusions?

73
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,439
Afraid so.

74
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,316
We've identified
the signature

75
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,860
left by the weapons fire.

76
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,028
There's no question.

77
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,320
It was Cardassian.

78
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,571
Cardassian?

79
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,824
Could Seska be responsible?

80
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,953
No, Captain.

81
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,371
I am.

82
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,964
<i>( dramatic</i>
<i>theme music playing )</i>

83
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,442
The probe was destroyed

84
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,527
by an experimental
Cardassian weapon

85
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,695
from the Alpha Quadrant.

86
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,157
( panting )

87
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,283
Sorry.

88
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,787
I recognized
its signature because...

89
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,414
because I know
this weapon very well.

90
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,833
Chakotay and I
got our hands on it

91
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,417
when we were fighting
the Cardassians.

92
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,086
How did it get here?

93
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,046
Probably the
same way we did.

94
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,090
The last time we saw it, it was
heading in the same direction

95
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,134
in the badlands where
the caretaker picked us up.

96
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,845
Originally, the Cardassians
sent this thing to destroy

97
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,554
a Maquis
munitions base.

98
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,473
We nicknamed it,
"Dreadnought."

99
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,600
It's a self-guided
tactical missile

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,312
carrying a charge
of 1,000 kilos of matter

101
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,772
and another 1,000
of antimatter.

102
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,066
Enough to destroy
a small moon.

103
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,985
Now, add to that,

104
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,864
one of the most sophisticated
computer systems I've ever seen.

105
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,616
They made this missile
adaptable, evasive,

106
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,743
armed with its own
defensive weaponry--

107
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,454
in other words, unstoppable.

108
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,291
So, how did you stop it?

109
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,376
We didn't.
It got through all our defenses.

110
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,630
Worked like it was supposed to,
except for one minor detail.

111
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,840
It didn't go off.

112
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,382
Leave it to the Cardassians

113
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,303
to build such an incredibly
advanced tactical weapon

114
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,722
and then arm the warhead
with an old kinetic detonator.

115
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,349
CHAKOTAY:
The missile skipped off

116
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,726
into the atmosphere and
quietly went into orbit.

117
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:37,272
I got inside it,
and reprogrammed the computer.

118
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,066
( sighs )

119
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,817
Hell, I didn't
just reprogram it.

120
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,527
I changed its identity.

121
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,571
I made it forget
about being Cardassian.

122
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,365
Now it was working
for the Maquis.

123
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,116
And we gave it
a new mission--

124
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,370
to destroy the Cardassian
fuel depot on Aschelan Five.

125
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,580
But it never made it
out of the badlands.

126
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,290
We thought it had
been destroyed in one

127
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,415
of the plasma storms.

128
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,001
So, how do we
stop this weapon

129
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,254
before it causes
any more damage?

130
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,963
Dreadnought
masks its warp trail

131
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,674
with a randomized EM field,
but I can modify

132
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,843
our navigational sensors
to cut through that.

133
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,845
And what are we going to do
with it once we find it?

134
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,680
I get back inside it.

135
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,640
I know all the security codes.

136
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,226
I installed them myself.

137
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,395
Lieutenant Paris
can assist you

138
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,355
with the navigational
sensors.

139
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,815
Keep me informed.
Dismissed.

140
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,364
Lieutenant? I expect everyone
to show up for meetings on time

141
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,408
and properly dressed.

142
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,413
Yes, sir.

143
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,587
There's still
a lot of distortion

144
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,300
in the upper frequencies.

145
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,136
Better. Now let's
try filtering out

146
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,553
the ion radiation.

147
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,350
B'Elanna.

148
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,900
You must be really worried
about catching this thing.

149
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,448
Chakotay wasn't telling
the whole truth.

150
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,991
<i>We</i> didn't send Dreadnought

151
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,410
on a mission
against the Cardassians.

152
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:19,291
<i>I</i> was the one who sent it...
without asking him.

153
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,376
You were afraid
he'd say no.

154
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,844
After I did it,
he pulled me aside, and...

155
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,887
I was ready to defend myself.

156
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,640
I was so sure
that I had anticipated

157
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,976
everything that could
possibly go wrong.

158
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,394
I even programmed it

159
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,356
to warn Federation ships
to stay out of its way.

160
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,440
In my own voice.

161
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,608
<i>Your</i> voice?

162
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,069
Listening to that
Cardassian computer's voice

163
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,113
was driving me crazy.

164
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,200
Heh. I don't blame you.

165
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,786
Anyway, Chakotay
looked at me--

166
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,332
I didn't know him
very well yet--

167
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,417
and all he said

168
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,670
in that damned
soft voice of his was...

169
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,882
that I'd hurt him.

170
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,971
That he thought he'd earned
my trust and loyalty.

171
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,892
I was so glad
when it disappeared

172
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,643
into the badlands.

173
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,271
I remember thinking,
"Thank God it's over."

174
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,774
But it's not.

175
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,197
And if anything happens here
because of Dreadnought...

176
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,410
it's my fault.

177
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,036
No one else's.

178
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,413
( sighs )

179
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,707
You took a risk.

180
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,334
You were thinking
like a Maquis.

181
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,169
That was a whole
different life.

182
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,171
( gasps )

183
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,298
Tell me about it.

184
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,800
You know...

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,261
I've been surprised

186
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,970
at how well you've been
able to fit in here.

187
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,517
A little envious too.

188
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,982
Tom...

189
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,485
what's been going on
with you lately?

190
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,279
Going on? How?

191
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,197
( scoffs )

192
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,575
People are starting
to talk.

193
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,825
Are they?

194
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,869
People like who? Chakotay?

195
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,248
No, I mean people
like me.

196
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,624
Like today.

197
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,376
Look at yourself.

198
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,087
Coming to
a briefing late?

199
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,505
And is it true

200
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,673
that you had a fight
with Lieutenant Rollins?

201
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,967
( chuckling )

202
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,760
The lieutenant
was unhappy

203
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,846
that my conn reports
weren't punctuated properly,

204
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,891
according
to Starfleet protocol.

205
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,684
I didn't like his attitude.

206
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,479
Was he right
about your reports?

207
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,149
We're in the Delta Quadrant;
nowhere near Starfleet.

208
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,233
What difference...?

209
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,492
Yeah. He was right.

210
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,953
I'm the one who's been wrong.

211
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,746
Wrong about a lot of things.

212
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,169
Why don't we try running
a multi-phasic sweep?

213
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,214
<i>( gentle</i>
<i>dramatic theme playing )</i>

214
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,387
Captain, I'm picking up
the trail again.

215
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,973
New heading: 1-9-6 mark 4.

216
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,057
I'm on it.

217
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,601
This course is erratic.

218
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,685
Are we sure we're following
a single warp trail?

219
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,564
Perhaps its navigational system
is malfunctioning.

220
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,858
It's been operating
for over a year, far longer

221
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,276
than it was designed
to function.

222
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,153
No. This is deliberate.

223
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,946
It's following
one of the evasive patterns

224
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,198
I programmed into it.

225
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,824
It must have
observed us following.

226
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,453
I think I've got it
on long-range sensors.

227
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,455
No, that's a sensor echo.

228
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,457
Dreadnought's programmed
to deflect its image

229
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,792
up to 100,000 kilometers
from its true location.

230
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,461
The next time
you get a heading,

231
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,047
look for a brief surge
in neutrino emissions

232
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,674
within 100,000-kilometer radius.

233
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,384
That'll be the real thing.

234
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,428
Got it.

235
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,430
Elevated neutrino levels.

236
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,931
Locking in coordinates.

237
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,600
It's within
visual range.

238
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,185
On screen.

239
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,698
Its targeting scanners
have been activated.

240
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,076
What's wrong?

241
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,578
It's not supposed
to do that

242
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,496
until it's locked
onto its final target.

243
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,625
It's heading for a planet

244
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,835
in a system
over ten light years away.

245
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,630
At its current speed,

246
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,216
it'll get there
in about three weeks.

247
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,051
The planet is Class M.

248
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,136
I'm reading several
heavily-populated areas.

249
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,223
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

250
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,112
Seska will want to know

251
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,988
about this Cardassian missile
immediately.

252
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,285
<i>Mr. Jonas, your enthusiasm</i>
<i>is appreciated,</i>

253
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,245
<i>but I would prefer</i>
<i>to know more about it</i>

254
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,788
<i>before I bring it</i>
<i>to Maje Culluh's attention.</i>

255
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,083
If I could just talk to Seska.

256
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,335
<i>As I explained,</i>

257
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,423
<i>I have now been</i>
<i>assigned to be your control.</i>

258
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,675
Look, has she been made aware of
how much I've been helping you?

259
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,762
<i>What the Maje chooses to share</i>
<i>with her is none of my concern.</i>

260
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,890
<i>But you are in good hands,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

261
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,311
<i>Now, tell me more about this</i>
<i>weapon your ship has found.</i>

262
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,146
Look, all you need
to tell Seska

263
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,982
is that missile is better armed
than entire Kazon-Nistrim sect.

264
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,110
( alarm beeping )
<i>That's very</i>
<i>interesting.</i>

265
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,987
<i>What more can you tell me</i>
<i>that I can...?</i>

266
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,989
Someone's about to make
a subspace transmission.

267
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,824
They may be able to detect
our comlink.

268
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,119
I have to terminate.

269
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,582
My name is Kathryn Janeway,

270
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,042
Captain of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

271
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,378
<i>First Minister</i>
<i>Kellan, Captain.</i>

272
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,837
<i>What is it you want?</i>

273
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,799
Our scans of your world

274
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,009
suggest you have
long-range tracking abilities.

275
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,429
<i>We have been observing your</i>
<i>course for the last two days.</i>

276
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,764
Have you also been able

277
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,724
to detect the missile
on a parallel course

278
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,392
off our starboard bow?

279
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,311
<i>We haven't been able</i>
<i>to identify</i>

280
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,854
<i>what it is, but yes.</i>

281
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,609
You have the right to know,
First Minister,

282
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,695
that this missile
is carrying a warhead

283
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,237
with a significant
destructive force, and--

284
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,032
<i>Is this some sort</i>
<i>of threat, Captain?</i>

285
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,242
On the contrary.
We want to help.

286
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,787
<i>I find that hard to believe.</i>

287
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,748
<i>Your reputation</i>
<i>precedes you, Captain.</i>

288
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,834
<i>We've been told that</i>
<i>you've threatened many races</i>

289
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,960
<i>since your arrival</i>
<i>in this quadrant.</i>

290
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,671
First Minister,
we're aware

291
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,798
the Kazon have been
telling that to people.

292
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,258
They'd like to prevent us
from making allies.

293
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,803
I assure you,
you've been misled.

294
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,889
<i>And yet here you are,</i>
<i>sending this missile toward us.</i>

295
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,141
The missile arrived here
from our quadrant

296
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,561
due to
a very unusual accident.

297
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,978
We haven't been able
to determine yet

298
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,272
why it chose Rakosa
as its target,

299
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,691
but my chief engineer
is preparing

300
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,735
to disarm it
before it reaches you.

301
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,320
<i>Perhaps</i>
<i>you are telling me this</i>

302
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,115
<i>in order to delay</i>
<i>our defensive response.</i>

303
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,577
I could have maintained
communication silence

304
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,370
and not given you
any warning at all.

305
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,955
<i>That's true.</i>

306
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,541
<i>Nevertheless,</i>
<i>be aware that</i>

307
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,335
<i>I am placing</i>
<i>our defense force on alert.</i>

308
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,880
I'd do the same in your place.

309
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,258
<i>We will be watching</i>
<i>your progress closely.</i>

00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,098
How soon
will you be ready to transport?

312
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,893
Dreadnought's shields
have responded to my codes.

313
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:35,976
I'm ready now, Captain.

314
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,104

Not so well,

my last systems access?

353
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,963
<i>Please be more specific.</i>

354
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,674
Did you encounter
a coherent Tetryon beam?

355
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,175
<i>Confirmed.</i>

356
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,053
<i>All attempts</i>
<i>to avoid the phenomenon failed.</i>

357
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,931
That beam carried you
into the Delta Quadrant.

358
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,184
I'm not surprised
it damaged your sensors.

359
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,360
( device turns off )
Dreadnought, reinitialize
your navigational systems.

360
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,195
Computer?

361
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,114
<i>Reinitialization sequence</i>
<i>is complete.</i>

362
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,283
Okay...

363
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,704
Now verify
our current position.

364
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,247
<i>Based on relative position</i>

365
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,041
<i>to known astronomical markers,</i>

366
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,376
<i>this vessel</i>
<i>is currently located</i>

367
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,920
<i>in the Delta Quadrant.</i>

368
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,339
And is Aschelan Five
located in the Delta Quadrant?

369
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,507
<i>Negative.</i>

370
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,134
Then reconfirm your target lock.

371
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,845
<i>Unable to verify.</i>

372
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,931
<i>Standing down</i>
<i>from Stage Three.</i>

373
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,683
<i>Target lock</i>
<i>has been deactivated.</i>

374
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,476
<i>Reestablishing Stage Four.</i>

375
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,272
<i>Janeway to Torres.</i> 
Go ahead, Captain.

376
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,399
We're showing a shut-down
of all your engines.

377
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,110
Can you confirm that? 
That and more.

378
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,571
I'll be ready to transport back
in a few minutes.

379
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,531
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Good work, B'Elanna.</i>

380
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,241
<i>Janeway out.</i>

381
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,746
Dreadnought,
return to Stage Five.

382
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,792
Initiate powersave program.

383
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,335
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Good night, B'Elanna.</i> 
( systems powering down )

384
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,296
Sweet dreams.

385
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,927
The Dreadnought's quantum
torpedoes could be modified

386
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,553
to be compatible
with our launchers.

387
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,305
What about its
engine components?

388
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,390
Easily converted
to Starfleet specs.

389
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,267
We'll have
spare parts for years.

390
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,686
We should also
download some files
from the computer core.

391
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,187
B'Elanna,
you can begin

392
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,773
the salvage operation
first thing in the--

393
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,900
<i>Paris to Janeway.</i> 
Yes, Lieutenant?

394
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,944
<i>The missile just took off.</i>
<i>It's going into warp.</i>

395
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,737
Stay with it, Tom.

396
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,282
Engaging warp drive.

397
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,951
This is impossible.
When I left,

398
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,661
it was
completely shut down.

399
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,790
We're back on a heading
to Rakosa Five.

400
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,167
It's increasing
speed to warp nine.

401
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,170
At this rate, it'll reach
the planet in 51 hours.

402
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,049
<i>( dramatic score playing )</i>

403
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,895
PARIS: It's still on course
for the planet at warp nine.

404
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,272
JANEWAY: Mr. Paris, bring us
within ten kilometers.

405
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,732
Maintain
a parallel position.

406
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,818
Bridge to Torres.
Your status?

407
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,820
I don't understand it, Captain.
Dreadnought's shields

408
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,114
are not recognizing
my security code anymore.

409
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,615
We can't
initiate transport.

410
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,035
<i>You better get back up here,</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

411
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,203
( sighs )

412
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,955
Aye, Captain.

413
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,544
Mr. Tuvok, let's take a shot
at disabling its drive systems.

414
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,005
Ready photons. Red Alert.

415
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,007
Torres programmed
the missile's shields

416
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,176
to adjust to all known
weapons, even Starfleet's.

417
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,553
<i>Voyager</i> wasn't in service
when she did it.

418
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,763
We're equipped
with Type-Six photon torpedoes.

419
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,182
They may just get through.

420
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,391
Fire.

421
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,732
No discernible
damage, Captain.

422
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,441
It must have
scanned our weapons,

423
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,027
adapted its shields.

424
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,279
Captain, it's maintaining
course and speed.

425
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,866
We're being hailed
by the missile.

426
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,784
Let's hear it.

427
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,705
DREADNOUGHT ( Torres' voice ):
<i>Unidentified Federation ship,</i>

428
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,957
<i>although this vessel</i>
<i>is Cardassian in design,</i>

429
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,626
<i>it has been appropriated</i>
<i>by the Maquis.</i>

430
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,171
<i>Please stand down</i>
<i>your weapons.</i>

431
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,591
You stand down your weapons
and I'll stand down mine.

432
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,885
<i>You are interfering</i>
<i>with a tactical mission</i>

433
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,803
<i>against Cardassian aggressors.</i>

434
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,722
<i>This vessel is programmed</i>

435
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,557
<i>to respond</i>
<i>with all necessary force</i>

436
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:10,061
<i>to prevent any disruption</i>
<i>to its mission.</i>

437
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,980
Dreadnought,
why have you resumed course?

438
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,857
<i>Hello, B'Elanna.</i>

439
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,151
<i>Course was resumed</i>
<i>once your safe departure</i>

440
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,486
<i>from this vessel</i>
<i>was confirmed.</i>

441
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:23,323
<i>It was a necessary response</i>
<i>to your deception.</i>

442
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,992
My "deception"?

443
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,246
<i>You are participating in</i>
<i>the Delta Quadrant deception.</i>

444
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,997
Explain, Dreadnought.

445
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,832
<i>False information</i>
<i>has been entered</i>

446
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,335
<i>into Dreadnought's</i>
<i>navigational sensor array.</i>

447
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,421
When a bomb starts talking
about itself

448
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,049
in the third person,
I get worried.

449
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,385
Why would I enter
false information?

450
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,512
<i>Probability assessment</i>
<i>indicates</i>

451
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,307
<i>you are being coerced</i>
<i>by Cardassian forces.</i>

452
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,184
You've already
identified<i> Voyager</i>

453
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,811
as a Federation ship,
Dreadnought.

454
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,062
Your scanners
must indicate

455
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,897
this is not
a Cardassian crew.

456
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,732
<i>Probability assessment</i>
<i>indicates</i>

457
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,818
<i>you are operating</i>
<i>within the parameters</i>

458
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,861
<i>of the Cardassian-Federation</i>
<i>alliance,</i>

459
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,657
<i>as described</i>
<i>in the Treaty of 2367,</i>

460
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,034
<i>a treaty rejected</i>
<i>by the Maquis.</i>

461
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,577
So when
I was just over there,

462
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,496
and you shut yourself off,

463
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,956
you were lying to me?

464
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,207
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

465
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:17,295
Heh. I never taught it
to do that.

466
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,088
<i>That is not correct, B'Elanna.</i>

467
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,423
<i>Your tactical subroutine</i>
<i>instructed Dreadnought</i>

468
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,800
<i>to prepare responses</i>

469
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,343
<i>for 39 potential</i>
<i>Cardassian threats.</i>

470
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:30,099
<i>The possibility of your capture</i>
<i>and coercion was number seven.</i>

471
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,893
Dreadnought, is there any way
we can prove to you

472
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,895
that you are actually
in the Delta Quadrant,

473
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,522
that this is
not a deception?

474
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,066
<i>The probability of being</i>
<i>in the Delta Quadrant,</i>

475
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,611
<i>75,000 light years</i>
<i>from last confirmed location,</i>

476
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,113
<i>is negligible.</i>

477
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,907
<i>The target is located</i>
<i>in the Alpha Quadrant.</i>

478
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,118
<i>Target lock</i>
<i>has been established.</i>

479
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,911
<i>There will be</i>
<i>no further warnings.</i>

480
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,122
<i>Terminating</i>
<i>communications link.</i>

481
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,332
( comm link beeps off )

482
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:04,217
The one possible
vulnerability I remember

483
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,635
is in the thoron
shock emitter.

484
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,387
If we can get it
to fire at full power,

485
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,766
that should destabilize
the reactor core for 30 seconds.

486
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,977
A single sustained
tachyon beam

487
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,188
might just penetrate that core
and destroy it.

488
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:20,149
What will it take to provoke
Dreadnought into firing?

489
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,400
It shouldn't be that difficult.
Once we go after it

490
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,071
with an all-out assault,
the emitter should fire.

491
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,614
Mr. Tuvok,
set your target.

492
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,326
JANEWAY:
Ready photons.

493
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,161
Ready, Captain.

494
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,454
Fire.

495
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,296
The missile's
thoron shock emitter has fired.

496
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,340
( rumbling )

497
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,175
Initiate the tachyon beam.

498
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,306
We have penetrated its shields.

499
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,974
Direct hit
to the core.

500
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,060
KIM: Reading an energy
build-up in its reactor.

501
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,396
It should overload
in about 30 seconds.

502
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,399
Wait a minute.

503
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,110
There's a plasma surge
coming from its core.

504
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,485
What the hell?

505
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,657
( electric zapping )

506
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,909
( rumbling )

507
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,580
Report!

508
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,124
It sent a plasma burst

509
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,960
along the tachyon beam
into our main power system.

510
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,837
We've got E.P.S. relays
burnt out all over the ship.

511
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,007
I'm not getting response
from warp or impulse drives.

512
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,176
Even maneuvering
thrusters are out.

513
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,137
TUVOK: The missile was
not significantly damaged.

514
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,555
It has maintained
its course for Rakosa.

515
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,809
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

516
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,816
Our engines will be back on line

517
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,567
in less than an hour,
First Minister.

518
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,944
Then we'll try again.

519
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,487
<i>Did you sustain</i>
<i>any casualties, Captain?</i>

520
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,740
A few. A broken arm,
a broken leg.

521
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,909
Fortunately, that's all.

522
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,620
<i>I'm pleased to hear that.</i>

523
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,622
<i>We are projecting casualties</i>

527
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:10,259
First Minister, we've analyzed
your offensive capabilities,

528
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,927
and they're no match
for what you're facing.

529
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,595
You must have
realized that yourself.

530
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,473
<i>And what</i>
<i>would you have me do?</i>

531
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,891

00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,863
<i>We weren't prepared</i>

536
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,656
<i>We are not a warlike race.</i>

537
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,367

539
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,454
First Minister...
<i>Please.</i>

540
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:41,915

She's still our best chance

545

Don't worry, we'll find a way
to get you back over there.

556
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,790
We wouldn't have to if
I'd done my job right
the first time.

557

You couldn't expect to guess
every move it made.

558
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,462
Why not? Dreadnought seems
pretty good at guessing mine.

559
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,880
It's only as smart
as you made it.

I'm not so sure
about that, Harry.

Its programs are adaptive,

562
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,428

all this time.

563
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,012

spend much time

It's a game, remember?

699
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,059

710
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,876
Let's have a look
at those data banks,

711
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:07,838
see if anything looks
at all... "compromised."

712
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,469
Is this
a complete file directory?

713
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,388

Oh, I'm hurt.

718
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,026
Hold on.
Pause the display.

719
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,153
What's that?

720
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,948

722
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,579
It looks like a backup file.

723
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,332

00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:48,837

750
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,571
I'm prepared to use this ship

751
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,949

reaches you.

752
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,117

00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,014
That's not a hard decision.

<i>Your reputation</i>

00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,935

Gentlemen,
I believe our best chance

780
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,085
at stopping Dreadnought now
is to set off

781
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,213
a large antimatter explosion
directly in its path.

782
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,714
To work, it would
take more energy

783
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,424
than all our photons
put together.

784
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,218
Or more to the point,

785
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,136
it would take
a warp core breach.

786
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,224
You'll be in charge
of the evacuation, Commander.

787
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,935
I'm not leaving you
on this ship.

788
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,770
Captain's prerogative.

789
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,521
Get the crew
to the escape pods.

790
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,647
I'll send
the senior officers

791
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,399

792
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,735

869

It is logical to have

871
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,885

This is your last chance

901
