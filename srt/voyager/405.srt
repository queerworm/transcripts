1
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,317
( beeping )

2
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,973
( console beeping )

3
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,727
To any vessels within range,
I hope this message reaches you.

4
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,605
I'm an HD-25
isomorphic projection.

5
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,399
There's been an accident.

6
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,026
My crew is dead.

7
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,069
I'm alone.

8
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,490
Please, help me.

9
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,442
So we rigged
the security console,

10
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,696
so that every time Tuvok
accessed the internal sensors,

11
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,405
it would play
a little message...

12
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,908
"Live long
and prosper."

13
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,201
PARIS:
No matter what button
he pushed:

14
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,871
"Live long and prosper."

15
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,789
KIM:
Naturally, no one
was available

16
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,415
to fix the malfunction, so...

17
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,002
So Tuvok had to stretch
his Vulcan patience to the limit

18
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,419
for the rest of the day.

19
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,505
I swear you could hear
him grinding his teeth

20
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,133
from across the Bridge.
( laughter )

21
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,801
Just when he thought
it was over,

22
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,761
when he went back
to his quarters,

23
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,555
and ordered a cup
of Vulcan tea,

24
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,098
the replicator says...

25
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,184
"Live long and prosper!"

26
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,477
( laughter )

27
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,229
The first time
I met Tuvok,

28
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,942
he dressed me down in front
of three Starfleet Admirals

29
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,778
for failing to observe
proper tactical procedures

30
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,697
during my first command.

31
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,658
My human ego took
a little bruising, but...

32
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,037
of course, he was right.

33
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:10,084
Over the past nine years,
I've come to rely

34
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:15,422
on his insightful
and unfailingly logical advice.

35
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,465
For outstanding service

36
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,969
as Chief Tactical
and Security Officer,

37
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,805
it's my pleasure
to grant you the rank

38
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,349
of Lieutenant Commander.

39
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,398
Congratulations, Tuvok.

40
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,316
Thank you, Captain.

41
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,402
Had I known
this commendation

42
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,072
entailed ritual humiliation,
I might have declined.

43
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,575
However, I accept
it with gratitude

44
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,160
and will honor
the responsibility

45
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,369
that comes with it.

46
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,038
During my three years on
<i>Voyager,</i>

47
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,624
I have grown to respect
a great many of you.

48
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,334
Others, I have learned
to tolerate.

49
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,003
As your
Tactical Officer,

50
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,630
I will continue
to do my best

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,049
to ensure a safe passage home.

52
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:04,345
As a Vulcan, I share
the following sentiment:

53
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,015
Live long and prosper.

54
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,561
JANEWAY:
Bravo! Well-deserved.

55
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,109
B'Elanna.

56
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,946
( anxious laughter )

57
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,031
This is ridiculous.
It's been three days,

58
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,741
and we haven't said
a word to each other.

59
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,493
I know, I know.
We have to talk.

60
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,080
About what you said,
I mean...

61
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,167
the part about
being in love with me.

62
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,419
I realize you were suffering
from oxygen deprivation,

63
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,923
and we were literally
seconds away from death,

64
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,967
so I know you probably
didn't mean it.

65
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,343
Oh, no, no.
I meant it.

66
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,765
But I don't expect you
to reciprocate, really.

67
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,684
Uh, you can just pretend
that I didn't say it.

68
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,020
In fact, let's just forget
that I even said anything.

69
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,729
Shut up.
I really--

70
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,610
DOCTOR:
Mr. Paris,
there you are.

71
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,823
TORRES:
I was just leaving. Lieutenant.

72
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,658
What can I do for you, Doc?

73
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,243
The Captain
has authorized me

74
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,537
to recruit someone with
advanced medical training

75
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,122
to help out in Sick Bay.

76
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,416
Unfortunately, the most
qualified crew member is you.

77
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,877
You want me to be
the new nurse?

78
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,129
If that's the title
you prefer.

79
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,797
It will only
be temporary,

80
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,299
three duty shifts
a week.

81
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,134
Report to Sick Bay
at 0600 hours.

82
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,261
Bring a tricorder
and a smile.

83
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,888
KIM:
What kind
of modifications?

84
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,764
We'd like to enhance
the Astrometrics Lab.

85
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,309
It hasn't been upgraded since
<i>Voyager</i> left Spacedock.

86
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,768
I'll start right away.

87
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,729
I've assigned Seven of
Nine to work with you.

88
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,189
She's agreed
to provide us

89
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,107
with all the navigational
data for this area

90
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,235
she acquired during
her time with the Borg.

91
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,571
Is there a problem?
No. No problem.

92
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,323
Try to make her feel
like part of the team.

93
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,116
Right.
Part of the team.

94
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,827
Have you made arrangements with
the Arritheans for tomorrow?

95
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,537
The delegate says
he's looking forward

96
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,331
to trading
with such an advanced starship.

97
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,791
You have done an excellent job
preparing for this mission.

98
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,335
I think we should
consider this

99
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,379
your first official
assignment as Ambassador.

100
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,714
<i>Ensign Culhane to the Captain.</i> 
Janeway here.

101
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,925
<i>We are receiving</i>
<i>an automated distress call</i>

102
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,551
<i>five light-years from here.</i>

103
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,054
<i>You might want</i>
<i>to bring the Doctor.</i>

104
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,768
<i>I'm an HD-25</i>
<i>isomorphic projection.</i>

105
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,062
<i>There's been an accident.</i>

106
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,563
<i>My crew is dead.</i>

107
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,981
<i>I'm alone.</i>

108
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,862
<i>Please, help me.</i>

109
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,614
He's a hologram.

110
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,157
We've got to help him.

111
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,368
Ensign, track the source
of the transmission.

112
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:35,455
Once we find his ship,
I'll lead an away team.

113
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,416
I don't recall
giving you a promotion today.

114
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,294
Oh... well, I'm
the obvious choice

115
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,670
to provide assistance
to a holographic being.

116
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,090
Doctor, I don't want you leaving
<i>Voyager</i>

117
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,301
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

118
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,220
I'm still concerned about
damaging your mobile emitter.

119
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,264
I understand.

120
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,974
But if this
is a hologram--

121
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,892
one of my own kind,
so to speak--

122
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,437
I'd like to meet him,
study him.

123
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,439
I'll bring Lieutenant Torres,
just to be safe.

124
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,650
She knows more about my emitter
than anyone.

125
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,279
The rest of us will meet
with the Arritheans.

126
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,365
We'll see you there
when you're finished.

127
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,368
Thank you, Captain.

128
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,583
( sighs )

129
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,012
Seven?

130
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,389
I am here.

131
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,852
Am I to work with you?

132
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,229
Oh, hi. Yes.

133
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,816
Uh, I thought we'd start
in Jefferies tube 32-B,

134
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,902
enhance the astrometric sensors,
if that's okay with you.

135
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,405
Unless this is a bad time.
Maybe I can come back later.

136
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,616
Ensign Kim, you seem...
apprehensive.

137
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,994
No, not at all.

138
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,496
The last time
we worked together,

139
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,997
I struck you at the base
of your skull

140
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,874
and attempted
to contact the collective.

141
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,667
These things happen.

142
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,961
I assure you,
it will not happen again.

143
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,464
That's good to know.

144
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,301
I've designed
new navigational sensors.

145
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,970
Some of the alphanumerics
are Borg.

146
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,391
No problem.

147
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,809
I always wanted
to learn Borg.

148
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,062
That is difficult to believe.

149
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,646
I was kidding.

150
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,315
It was a joke.

151
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,526
You know... humor.

152
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,028
I understand
the concept of humor.

153
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,321
It may not be apparent,

154
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,698
but I am often amused
by human behavior.

155
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,911
( wry laughter )

156
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,330
( sighs )

157
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,631
( Doctor sighs )

158
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,133
TORRES:
Relax, Doctor.

159
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,052
I'm sure
we'll find the ship.

160
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,263
That's not what I'm
concerned about.

161
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,722
I've been questioning the wisdom

162
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,350
of leaving Mr. Paris in charge
of my Sick Bay.

163
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,809
Tom will do fine.

164
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,937
He's a very responsible guy.

165
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,275
Well, I suppose you'd
know better than I would.

166
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,485
What's that supposed to mean?

167
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,573
You seem to have become
good friends.

168
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,366
Let's get one thing straight.

169
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,411
I don't appreciate you
or anyone else

170
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,538
speculating about the kind
of friendships I have.

171
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,582
Or who I have them with.

172
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,000
Sorry. I didn't realize
I'd struck a nerve.

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,877
Perhaps you'd like
a tranquilizer.

174
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,505
( console beeping )

175
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,549
There it is.
That's his ship?

176
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,343
Try hailing him.

177
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,677
No response.

178
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,346
Life signs?

179
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,932
A few energy readings,
but they're erratic.

180
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,101
Propulsion and main power
are down.

181
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,645
We're approaching
transporter range.

182
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,303
Hello?

183
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,138
Is anyone here?

184
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,435
We're here to help you.

185
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,782
No signs of life?

186
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,075
Not yet.

187
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,743
I'd like to check
your mobile emitter,

188
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,664
make sure you made it
through the transport okay.

189
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,878
For a Klingon, you have
a decent bedside manner.

190
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,297
Thanks.

191
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,299
DOCTOR:
I wonder what kind
of bedside manner

192
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,511
Mr. Paris
will exhibit.

193
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,222
That was a rhetorical
question, Lieutenant.

194
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,265
Your holographic matrix
is stable,

195
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,142
but let me check your
emitter's power cells.

196
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,645
DOCTOR:
You might want to consider
a career in medicine.

197
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,146
( clattering )

198
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,486
Where the hell
did this come--?

199
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,322
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

200
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,241
You sent the distress call?

201
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,992
Yes, yes. Yes, that's me.

202
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,078
It was me.

203
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,997
And you, you're an isomorph,
like myself?

204
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,584
We use the term
"hologram."

205
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,960
( sighs )

206
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,380
Holo... gram.

207
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,804
And you, y-you're
a hologram too?

208
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,056
No.

209
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,849
You're organic.

210
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,936
Uh... that's one way
of putting it, yes.

211
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,613
It looks like your program
is fairly compatible

212
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,114
with our holographic
technology.

213
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,865
Can you tell me
where I can access

214
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,076
your projection controls?
Why?

215
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,036
You're obviously
malfunctioning.

216
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,706
Maybe I can repair you.
Oh, of course.

217
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,832
I'd appreciate that.

218
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,834
Over there, you can
access my systems

219
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,462
from that console.

220
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,471
What happened here?

221
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,725
Oh, it was terrible,
just terrible.

222
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,102
You see, we left Seros
eight months ago--

223
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,229
Seros, that's
our home planet--

224
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,689
with a crew of six.

225
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,441
All isomorphic
projections?

226
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,776
No, just me.

227
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,278
I'm an HD-25
maintenance unit

228
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,572
with extreme-hazard
clearance.

229
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,325
I'm responsible for
cleaning the reactor core,

230
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,453
ejecting antimatter waste, that
sort of thing.

231
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,164
W-When the crew got sick, there
was nothing I could do.

232
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,207
I'm-I'm not designed
for medical functions.

233
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,834
I-I... I...
Try to calm down.

234
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,213
Explain what happened
one step at a time.

235
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:03,092
Two of the crew members
left to survey a planet.

236
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,427
When they came back,

237
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,887
they'd been infected
by a deadly virus.

238
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,598
It spread quickly

239
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,849
to the other
organics on board

240
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,353
and one by one...

241
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,229
well, I watched
them all die.

242
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,856
And then things started
to malfunction here.

243
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,736
I have limited knowledge
of the controls.

244
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,613
I don't know
what I would've done

245
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,199
if you hadn't come.

246
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,867
I think I've stabilized
your program,

247
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,994
but I'll need access
to your primary isomatrix.

248
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,206
Where is it?
On the lower deck.

249
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,749
You shouldn't go down there.

250
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,626
Why not?

251
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,252
Too dangerous.

252
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,921
That deck's been flooded
with antimatter radiation.

253
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,842
Organic flesh would
disintegrate within seconds.

254
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,386
You can access my isomatrix from
this deck.

255
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,806
There's an interface junction
in that compartment.

256
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,392
Thanks.

257
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,228
Mind if I run
a quick diagnostic?

258
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,401
What's your name?

259
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,820
I don't have a name.

260
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,614
It's a long story.

261
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,658
I'd like
to hear it...

262
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,744
and everything
else about you.

263
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,632
I'm ready to supply power
to the enhanced sensors.

264
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,300
What? Already?

265
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,927
Yes.

266
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,014
You believe that my work
is unsuitable.

267
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,142
Of course not. Just checking.
Standard procedure.

268
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,937
I may no longer possess
Borg perfection,

269
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,106
but my experience as a drone
has taught me

270
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,649
to be efficient
and precise.

271
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,318
Actually, you misaligned
this optical assembly.

272
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,780
Impossible.

273
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,783
Take a look. It's off by .5
degrees.

274
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,084
It must have been my humanity
reasserting itself.

275
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,589
I will correct the error.

276
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,845
So, what do you do for fun

277
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,847
down in Cargo Bay 2?

278
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,098
Fun?

279
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,476
You know, relaxation,
entertainment

280
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,103
during your
off hours?

281
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,815
I regenerate in my alcove,

282
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:25,359
I study
the Starfleet database...

283
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,570
or I contemplate my existence.

284
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,948
That's a lot of time
by yourself.

285
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,659
It is.

286
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,994
The optical assembly
is properly aligned.

287
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,204
I'm ready to access
the main power supply.

288
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,039
After you.

289
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,176
Wait! What are you doing?!

290
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,679
There are five million gigawatts
running through there!

291
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,681
The exoskeleton on this limb
can withstand it.

292
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,390
That's all well and good,

293
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,726
but there are safety procedures
we've got to follow.

294
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,269
Your procedures
are a waste of time.

295
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,229
Maybe so, but you've been
assigned to me,

296
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,149
and I say we do this
by the book, all right?

297
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,443
All right.

298
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,240
Well...

299
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,702
now that we've got
that cleared up.

300
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,045
You can use this emitter
to go anywhere?

301
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,048
Well, my Captain has imposed
a few restrictions,

302
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,800
but I'm free
to leave Sick Bay,

303
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,386
join away missions,
take a stroll.

304
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,471
Extraordinary.

305
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,641
I-I-I've, I've never left
this vessel before.

306
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,142
And until the crew got sick,

307
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,604
I never even left
the antimatter storage chamber.

308
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,105
Do you know what it's like

309
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,942
to spend your life trapped
inside a tiny room?

310
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,277
Not knowing what's
beyond the door?

311
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,405
What the world
is really like?

312
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,490
Nobody coming to see you
or talk to you

313
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,660
unless they want
something?

314
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,955
Actually, I know exactly
what it's like.

315
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,957
When I was first activated,
I was regarded

316
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,668
as little more than
a talking tricorder.

317
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,379
I had to ask for the
privileges I deserved:

318
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,965
the right to be included
in crew briefings,

319
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,385
the ability to turn
my program on and off.

320
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,013
It's taken some time,
but I believe I've earned

321
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,474
the respect of the
crew as an equal.

322
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,893
An equal?

323
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,395
I've also been pursuing
personal interests:

324
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,397
art, literature, music.

325
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,857
Perhaps you could do the same.

326
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,483
Oh, no, no, no.

327
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,028
My programmers on Seros
would never allow that.

328
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,073
Then you'll convince them. Maybe
they'll appreciate

329
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,950
how well you've coped
with this situation.

330
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,326
How you've managed
to find help.

331
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,871
Think about it.

332
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,332
You've already exceeded
the sum of your subroutines.

333
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,223
What are you doing?

334
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,684
Nothing. Oh, nothing.

335
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,937
I'm just sterilizing the ship.

336
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:09,398
I'm fastidious about germs.

337
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,067
I know that must sound strange

338
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,986
coming from an
artificial being.

339
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,570
Not at all.

340
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,823
I've been known to act
a little strangely myself.

341
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,265
Hungry?

342
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,102
You're organic.
You require nutrients.

343
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,771
They're only rations,
but our crew liked them.

344
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,564
TORRES:
Careful!

345
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,609
That's an isomagnetic conduit.

346
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,153
You could destabilize
your matrix.

347
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,904
Of course.
How stupid of me.

348
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,157
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have barged in here.

349
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,825
That's all right.

350
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,119
I could use a break.

351
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,955
Thank you.

352
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,713
You nibble...

353
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,007
like a fish.

354
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,591
I'll take that
as a compliment.

355
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,010
Oh, it is.

356
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,971
I've never seen a fish before,
not a real one,

357
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,058
but I've read about them
on our database.

358
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,852
Fish aren't like other organics.

359
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,897
They're more passive, I think,
most of them.

360
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,984
And so clean.

361
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,820
Um, is there anything I can do
to help with repairs?

362
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,739
Well, as soon as
I'm done with lunch,

363
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,408
you could help me access
your primary matrix.

364
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,036
Gladly.

365
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,166
Is something wrong?

366
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,420
Seeing the ship ripped apart
like this, it's...

367
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,549
I guess I can't help feeling
a kind of affinity

368
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,011
for this vessel.
It sustains my existence

369
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,847
and sometimes I feel
like it's a part of my body...

370
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,933
my soul.

371
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,020
That probably sounds
silly to you.

372
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,357
No. No, I understand
how you feel.

373
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,612
You couldn't possibly understand
how I feel, you're organic.

374
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,614
You exist apart from your ship.

375
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,366
"I understand how you feel."

376
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,078
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

377
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,496
You're the one who's trapped,
not me.

378
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,540
You spend your entire life

379
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,460
stuck inside a biological cage
of flesh and bone

380
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,003
and blood.

381
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,923
Right. I'm going to go
give the Doctor an update.

382
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,341
I exist as pure energy,

383
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,053
but you depend on food
and water to survive.

384
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,764
Frankly, I find it disgusting.

385
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,767
Look at you. Look at you!

386
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,770
Grinding up bits of plants
and animals with your teeth.

387
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,773
Secreting saliva
to force it down your esophagus

388
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,984
into a pit
of digestive acids.

389
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,278
You can't even stand
to think about it yourself.

390
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,947
What a repulsive creature
you are, constantly

391
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,531
shedding your skin
and hair,

392
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,742
leaving your oily sweat
on everything you touch.

393
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,494
You think
that you are the height

394
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,079
of intellect in the universe,

395
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,623
but you are no better
than any filthy animal,

396
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,584
and I am ashamed
to be made in your image!

397
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,548
My apologies.

398
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,176
My apologies.

399
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:29,265
I have acquired some hostility
toward organics.

400
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,391
It was not meant for you.

401
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,315
I was treated quite badly
by the crew here.

402
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,944
I'm sorry to hear that...

403
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:46,740
um, but you have to realize
that... we're here to help you.

404
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,914
Thanks for the rations.

405
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,431
We've got a problem.

406
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,850
Oh?

407
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,061
I think there's a problem
with our isomorph,

408
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,812
and I'm not talking
about his emitters.

409
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,522
Explain.

410
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,483
I just spent
the last ten minutes

411
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,777
hearing his views
on biological life.

412
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,321
Let's just say

413
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,323
they're a bit unconventional.

414
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,700
Did you realize
that we organics

415
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,578
are a bunch of inferior,
disgusting animals?

416
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,164
Now that you mention it.

417
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,999
He started ranting

418
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,001
about how much
he despises organics.

419
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,878
I didn't think I was going to
get out of there

420
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,213
without a fight.

421
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:45,132
I will admit he is
somewhat socially inept.

422
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,093
Inept? He's a lunatic.

423
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,095
That is hardly a sound
medical diagnosis.

424
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,056
He has also
been lying to us.

425
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,474
I just ran a tricorder scan
of the lower deck,

426
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,228
the one he said
was flooded with radiation.

427
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,854
Well, it's not.

428
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,690
Why would he lie
about that?

429
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,276
I don't know.

430
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,236
Maybe he doesn't want us
to go down there.

431
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:08,072
Maybe he's hiding
something.

432
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,286
I understand your
concerns, Lieutenant.

433
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,787
I've been talking
to him, as well,

434
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,957
and I recognize
that he has some...

435
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,666
behavioral difficulties.

436
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,377
But imagine what
he's been through:

437
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,504
Trapped in a room no bigger
than a storage compartment.

438
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,425
And he's had almost no
interaction with organic beings.

439
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,261
It's only natural he's developed
problems communicating,

440
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,012
even a little resentment.

441
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,932
Do you recall my own behavior
when I was first activated?

442
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,184
How could I forget? You were a
major pain in the--

443
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,314
My point is... I, too,
was somewhat alienated

444
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,940
from the rest of the crew.

445
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,611
It took me a few days
to master the social graces.

446
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,031
I realize that he
is a fellow hologram,

447
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,659
and that you are
committed to helping him,

448
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,453
but I want the ability

449
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,830
to shut down his program
if I have to.

450
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,750
If you really feel
that's necessary.

451
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,170
I'm going to search
the lower deck,

452
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,422
see if I can access
his primary isomatrix.

453
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,132
You keep him occupied
until I get back.

454
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,716
I don't think
he'd appreciate

455
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,760
a filthy animal like me
snooping around--

456
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,596
Am I interrupting?

457
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:19,268
No. Actually,
I was, uh, just leaving.

458
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,437
I'd like you
to meet someone.

459
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,939
Doctor,
this is Spectrum.

460
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,150
A holographic fish?

461
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,110
Magnificent, isn't he?

462
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,528
So peaceful and so content.

463
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,157
I programmed him
to keep me company.

464
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,992
Well, don't you
have a pet?

465
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,952
Oh, it wouldn't
be appropriate,

466
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,454
not in a medical
environment.

467
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,289
They wouldn't let me
have one, either.

468
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,416
I had to hide him.

469
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,710
He's very lifelike.
I didn't realize

470
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,087
you had such a talent
for holographic design.

471
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,508
Oh, I've programmed
all sorts of things.

472
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,309
This node contains Borg
navigational data.

473
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,560
How do we get it
out of here?

474
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,897
The proper instrument was
part of my thoracic assembly

475
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,648
before the Doctor
removed it.

476
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,859
I suggest a radical
dislocation.

477
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:13,072
A what?
We need to pull it out.

478
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,740
Assist me.

479
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,410
Okay. On three.

480
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,495
Three?

481
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,289
On the count of three,
we pull together.

482
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,208
Crude, but effective.

483
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,584
One, two...

484
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,046
three!
Oh...

485
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,715
I've been damaged.

486
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,343
Ooh, that looks
pretty bad.

487
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,053
You better get to Sick Bay.

488
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,473
As a drone, I would have
regenerated within seconds.

489
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,227
I've become weak.

490
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,522
No more than the rest of us.
You'll be fine.

491
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,400
Come on, I'll walk you there.

492
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,288
PARIS:
Another half a millimeter

493
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,415
and you would've severed
the carpal nerve.

494
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,292
Might've had to operate.

495
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,168
You are a mere mortal now.

496
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:12,714
As your family doctor,
I'd suggest you be more careful.

497
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,550
There. Good as new.

498
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,888
I'll see you
back in the cargo bay.

499
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,020
What kind of bedside
manner was that?

500
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,564
What are you talking about?

501
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,774
Can't you see she's
feeling vulnerable,

502
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,318
and here you are,
going on about

503
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,153
severed nerves
and major surgery?

504
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,738
Would you take it easy? I was
just trying to lighten the mood.

505
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,616
She wasn't upset by it.

506
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,950
Yes, she was.

507
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,577
I could see it
on her face.

508
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,245
You seem
a little protective.

509
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,080
This morning,
you were dreading

510
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,291
being in the same
room with her.

511
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,961
Well, I've gotten
to know her a little better.

512
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,421
I don't think most
people realize

513
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,923
she's not just
some Borg automaton.

514
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,344
She's actually very complex.

515
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,804
Oh, really?
Yes, she is.

516
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,722
She's even got
a sense of humor.

517
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,518
It's offbeat,
a bit subtle, maybe,

518
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,228
and she's incredibly
intelligent.

519
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,730
Well, she ought to be.
She assimilated enough people.

520
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,483
See? See what I mean?

521
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,610
It's Borg this, Borg that.

522
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,654
You can't resist making a joke.

523
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:20,491
There's a woman in there,
if you'd take the time to look.

524
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,370
Harry, you've got a crush
on her, don't you?

525
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,831
What? No. Not at all.

526
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,585
Maybe just a little.

527
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,630
I've seen this look
in your eyes,

528
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,965
right before you fall
head over heels.

529
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,592
You always go
for the tough ones.

530
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,386
What was it last time,
a hologram?

531
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,849
I don't know much
about Borg women,

532
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,894
but my advice to you is: Don't.

533
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,897
I'm just trying to make her feel
like part of the team.

534
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,691
"Part of the team"?

535
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,568
You sound like Chakotay.

536
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:59,821
Look, she's beautiful
and she's smart,

537
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,200
and I'm sure
she's a wonderful...

538
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,993
conversationalist,

539
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,912
but a month ago, she was Borg.

540
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,956
You don't really know
who she is.

541
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,668
It's great that you're trying
to make her feel comfortable.

542
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,336
Just be careful.

543
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,466
Thanks for the advice.

544
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,100
I just hope you take it.

545
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,114
Now that we're clear
on the helm controls...

546
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,616
This is a lot to learn.

547
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,242
You're doing fine.

548
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,077
It's vital that you
familiarize yourself

549
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,412
with all the
ship's systems,

550
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,830
so you can be more
self-sufficient.

551
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,541
Here are the
environmental controls,

552
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,251
and life support
functions.

553
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,379
Well, I won't need those
anymore. No crew to worry about.

554
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,047
Not at the moment.

555
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,426
59.2 percent.
I beg your pardon?

556
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,678
That's how much power
went into life support.

557
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:09,099
59.2 percent just to keep them
breathing, warm, comfortable.

558
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,436
They do require quite a bit
of maintenance, don't they?

559
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,147
I should know.
I spent my entire

560
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,065
existence cleaning up
after them.

561
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,777
When they were busy
sleeping or eating

562
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:24,448
or engaging in their
slovenly carnal pleasures.

563
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,158
And this is
the sensor grid.

564
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,034
You'll find it
most useful when--

565
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,829
They took advantage of me.

566
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,250
I wish I'd been
more like you.

567
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,210
You showed me
that I could be

568
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,255
more than a slave to these
biological creatures.

569
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,850
( door closing )

570
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,666
I'm not taking this ship
back to the organics.

571
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,293
I won't return
to that existence.

572
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,253
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

573
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,756
Join me. Leave<i> Voyager.</i>

574
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,508
Escape your prison.

575
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,593
Together,
we'll take this vessel

576
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,637
and explore the galaxy.

577
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,048
There you are.

578
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,054
( powering up )

579
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,188
( gasps )

580
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,783
( gasps )

581
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,704
Don't look so surprised.
You gave me the idea!

582
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,122
Me?!

583
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,207
You said I should be
more self-sufficient.

584
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,126
I agree that we should
be treated equally,

585
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,669
as members of the crew.

586
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,755
But we're still projections
of energy and light.

587
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,715
We have limitations!
No!

588
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,550
No, no, no, no, no!

589
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,804
We don't need nourishment,
we don't suffer disease.

590
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,264
We're the higher
form of life.

591
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,685
( alarm sounding )

592
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,229
What's that?
Lower deck.

593
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,482
Someone's trying
to access my matrix.

594
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,233
I'll be back.

595
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,289
You!

596
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,462
( screams )

597
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,797
( gasping )

598
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,214
( yells )

599
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,509
( grunting )

600
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,973
( gasping )

601
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,980
No!

602
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,649
( electronic stuttering):
N-N-N-No!

603
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,069
B'Elanna!

604
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:04,125
<i>Ensign Kim, Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51186.2.</i>

605
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,669
<i>Working with Seven of Nine</i>

606
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,754
<i>is starting to get</i>
<i>a little awkward.</i>

607
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,339
<i>Tom's right.</i>

608
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,676
<i>Anything more than friendship</i>
<i>is a bad idea...</i>

609
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,428
<i>but I can't stop thinking</i>
<i>about her.</i>

610
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,354
You wished to see me, Ensign.

611
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,064
I had this midnight
inspiration

612
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,358
about reconfiguring
astrometric projectors.

613
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,277
I hope you weren't...
regenerating.

614
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,863
I was not.

615
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,240
This is tricky stuff.

616
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,533
It could use your touch.

617
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,869
Your way of looking at things?

618
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,453
A fresh perspective?

619
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,665
Your data.

620
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,166
Why don't
you sit down?

621
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,668
I prefer to stand.

622
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,170
This could take a while. You'd
be more comfortable.

623
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,590
Comfort is irrelevant.
We're here to work.

624
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,550
Okay.

625
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,470
This light is insufficient.

626
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,890
But it's relaxing,
don't you think?

627
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,641
After hours, quiet.

628
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,435
<i>Voyager</i> isn't
all Jefferies tubes

629
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,604
and cargo bays,
you know.

630
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,856
Tell you what.
When we're done here

631
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,816
I'll take you to the holodeck.

632
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,611
We'll run the Ktarian moonrise
simulation. It's beautiful.

633
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,738
Beauty is irrelevant.

634
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,411
Unless you wish to change
the nature of our affiliation.

635
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,496
What do you mean?

636
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,665
I may be new
to individuality,

637
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,501
but I'm not ignorant
of human behavior.

638
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,003
I've noticed
your attempts

639
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,338
to engage me
in idle conversation,

640
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,507
and I see the way
your pupils dilate

641
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,009
when you look
at my body.

642
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,344
I don't know
what you're talking about.

643
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,639
Obviously, you've suggested
a visit to the holodeck

644
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,266
in the hopes of creating
a romantic mood.

645
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,768
Are you in love with me, Ensign?

646
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,562
Well... no.

647
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,856
Then you wish to copulate.
No!

648
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:53,443
( laughs awkwardly ):
I mean... I... I,
I don't know what I mean.

649
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:57,196
All of these elaborate rituals
of deception...

650
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,282
I didn't realize
becoming human again

651
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,493
would be
such a challenge.

652
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,454
Sexuality is
particularly complex.

653
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,456
As Borg, we had no
need for seduction,

654
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,084
no time for single-
cell fertilization.

655
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,502
We saw a species
we wanted,

656
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,337
and we
assimilated it.

657
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:16,800
Nevertheless, I am willing
to explore my humanity.

658
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,678
Take off your clothes.

659
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,139
Uh... Seven...

660
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,641
Don't be alarmed.
I won't hurt you.

661
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:28,020
Look, this is a little sudden. I
was just...

662
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,022
trying to...

663
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:33,025
part of the team, you know?

664
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,568
Uh...

665
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,279
Maybe we should
just quit for now.

666
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,991
All right.

667
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,703
Let me know when you wish
to resume our work.

668
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,042
( sighs )

669
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,055
It's all right, B'Elanna.

670
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,057
You're safe.

671
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,893
The isomorph?

672
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,897
Apparently, you deactivated him.

673
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,399
I took all of his emitters
off-line.

674
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,109
Not a moment too soon.

675
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,278
I found six corpses on this
deck, all of them murdered.

676
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,322
You almost became number seven.

677
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,242
( gasps )

678
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,994
Oh! What did he do to me?

679
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,413
He reached inside your chest,
grabbed your heart,

680
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,248
and perforated
your fourth ventricle.

681
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,583
Great.

682
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,251
I've stabilized
your pericardium,

683
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,503
but I'm concerned
about the internal bleeding.

684
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,796
Prognosis?

685
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,131
Less than stellar,

686
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,799
unless I can get you
back to<i> Voyager.</i>

687
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,426
Unfortunately,
I'm having trouble

688
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,720
accessing our transporters.

689
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,765
He must've disabled
our com-link to the shuttle.

690
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,226
Help me get
to the command chamber.

691
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,814
Looks like he set up
a dampening field.

692
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,734
I think I can cut
through it, but...

693
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,738
I'll need to open
this control panel.

694
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:05,324
My engineering kit...
is on that console.

695
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,249
B'Elanna, I thought you said

696
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:14,209
you took all of the emitters
off-line.

697
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,212
I did. Why?

698
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,464
I think you'd better
double-check.

699
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,424
( thud )

700
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,719
You said
you'd help me.

701
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,345
Put that down.

702
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,889
You lied.

703
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,600
You lied to me.

704
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,393
I thought you were
my friend.

705
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,895
It's for your
own benefit.

706
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,814
Someone needs to repair
your program.

707
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,483
It's malfunctioning.
You're unstable.

708
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,360
No, no, no! You're unstable!

709
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,948
You're a hologram
who thinks like an organic!

710
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,579
This could get tedious.

711
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,094
Freedom.

712
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:17,563
Oh... you're getting
blood everywhere.

713
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,028
I'm going to have
to deactivate you.

714
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,869
( panting )

715
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,517
( gasping )

716
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,766
( grunting )

717
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,442
( gasps )

718
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,278
( panting )

719
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,826
( emitter beeping )

720
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,168
Is he...?

721
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,212
Deactivated.

722
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,797
And you?

723
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,757
Ready to get
out of here.

724
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,151
( door chimes )

725
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,778
Come in.

726
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,823
We've completed the schematics
for the Astrometrics Lab.

727
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,574
Already?

728
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,201
You and Seven must
have been putting in

729
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,078
a lot of extra
hours on this.

730
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,414
She's not much
for procrastinating.

731
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,249
I'm sure she's not.

732
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,337
Looks like you're ready
to begin construction.

733
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,546
It might be better--

734
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,633
more practical-- to bring in
an engineering team for that.

735
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,635
Recruit all the help you need.

736
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,721
In fact, they should probably
take over at this point.

737
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,974
Don't you want to supervise
their work?

738
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,558
The Astrometrics Lab
is your baby.

739
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:02,603
I would. Of course.
Um, I just don't think

740
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,814
that that would be the best use
of ship's personnel.

741
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,732
Oh, I can rearrange
the duty shifts.

742
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,735
Oh, no, Commander,
you don't have to do that.

743
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,280
I'm sure Seven can handle things
without me.

744
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,409
Harry... are you having
some kind of problem with her?

745
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,661
Oh, no. No problem.

746
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,789
Because if you are,
I'd like to hear about it.

747
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,083
No, sir, there's no problem.
Not at all.

748
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,253
Absolutely not. Um...

749
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,339
So if you'll excuse me,
I'll be going now.

750
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,090
Ensign Kim...

751
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,885
let's have it.

752
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,678
( sighs )

753
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:42,352
We... We had a misunderstanding.

754
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:43,978
About?

755
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,022
Oh, it's nothing
really important.

756
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,900
Just your basic Borg-human
cultural differences.

757
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,902
Really?

758
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,862
That's not what she says.

759
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,740
You... Y-You...

760
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,742
You spoke--
You spoke to her.

761
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,537
She seems to think
you're making good progress.

762
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:03,081
She finds you
reasonably efficient,

763
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,957
and says you've been
helping her learn more

764
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,544
about our complex
social interactions.

765
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,754
Any idea what she meant by that?

766
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,798
I can't imagine.

767
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,427
You two make a good team.

768
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,803
I want to keep you together
on this project.

769
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,514
Sir...

770
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,100
Aye, sir.

771
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,685
And maybe others
in the future.

772
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,479
Have fun.

773
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,446
I've stopped
the internal bleeding

774
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,030
and repaired
the tissue damage.

775
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,242
Your pericardium is
clean as a whistle.

776
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,078
Which is more than I can say
for my Sick Bay.

777
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,371
I'm sorry about the mess.

778
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,291
I haven't had time
to clean up.

779
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,625
It was a hectic day.

780
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,544
I treated two
broken bones,

781
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,255
an upset stomach
and a lacerated hand.

782
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,799
Does this mean you're too tired
to meet later...

783
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,801
in my quarters?

784
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,387
Are you sure your
heart can take it?

785
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,639
DOCTOR:
I'm detecting
elevated hormonal levels.

786
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,433
If you two don't take it easy,

787
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,018
I'll have to declare
a medical emergency.

788
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,229
If you'll excuse me,

789
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,772
I have to go
check on Harry.

790
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,566
I hear he's having
a nervous breakdown.

791
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,900
It's a long story.

792
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,152
DOCTOR:
Not so fast, Mr. Paris.

793
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,404
You are going
to help me sterilize

794
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,157
every square millimeter
of this Sick Bay.

795
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,243
No doubt, you've left your oily
residue on every hypospray,

796
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:26,372
your sloughed secretions
on every console.

797
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,748
Just kidding.

798
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,542
In fact,
I've had a change of heart

799
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,419
about my fastidiousness.

800
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,921
A little clutter
never hurt anyone.

801
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,924
Sick Bay should have a more
organic touch, don't you think?

802
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,345
To help our patients feel...
more at home?

803
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,604
What's gotten
into him?

804
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,981
It's a long story.

805
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,318
( sighs )
