1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,010
[Naomi]
Hmm...

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,638
Hmm... There.

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,599
Excellent.

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,686
You recognized
the complementary base pair.

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,731
Actually, l just found
two pieces that fit together.

6
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,232
You're missing the point.

7
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,192
l thought the point was
to finish the puzzle.

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,945
And learn something about genetics.

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,905
lf you really want to help,

10
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,408
find me a green piece
that looks like Tuvok's ear.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,703
Commander.

12
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,705
At ease. I'm just passing through.

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,293
l apologize for the condition
of the cargo bay, sir.

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,919
I've been tutoring Naomi.

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,963
Looks like you found
a creative approach.

16
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,591
Thank you, but I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Seven.

17
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,512
l am supposed to be writing a paper
on transwarp instability.

18
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,890
Don't worry, your secret's safe...

19
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,349
as long as you keep mine.

20
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,684
[Icheb]
Sir?

21
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,811
Antarian cider.

22
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,605
Not the replicated stuff.

23
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,774
There are only
a couple of bottles left,

24
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,109
and l don't want Mr. Neelix
getting his hands on them.

25
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,279
Well, then you should store them
with the salvaged Borg components.

26
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,365
Neelix never inventories
those containers.

27
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,659
He says they give him the creeps.

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,828
Officer-level thinking, Icheb.

29
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,997
-Would you mind?
-Of course not.

30
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,834
[door chimes]

31
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,970
Come in.

32
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,600
You're late. Unfortunately, so is dinner.

33
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,061
Let me guess.
You burned the roast again.

34
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,188
Once, a long time ago,

35
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,649
l called this replicator
a glorified toaster.

36
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,983
It never forgave me.

37
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,613
l didn't realize replicators held grudges.

38
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,449
What's so funny?

39
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,286
l just left Icheb and Naomi assembling
a jigsaw puzzle in the cargo bay.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,371
[chuckling]

41
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,623
Find me the thermal regulator, please.

42
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,707
How is Icheb?

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,044
In a few years,
he may be running the ship.

44
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,339
l don't know about you,
but I'm not ready to retire just yet.

45
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,552
Janeway to the Bridge. Report.

46
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,096
That was some kind
of gravimetric surge.

47
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,473
It's overloading
our inertial dampeners.

48
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,559
-Source?
-That's a good question.

49
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,103
Seven's trying to localize it.

50
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,440
Engineering says the warp core
is destabilizing.

51
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,317
I'd better get down there.

52
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,284
A spatial rift is opening
directly in front of us.

53
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,870
It's emitting high levels
of neutrinos and chronitons.

54
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,580
On screen.

55
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,210
What is it?

56
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,421
[Kim]
I don't know.

57
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,259
We're losing containment.
Everyone out!

58
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,519
[grunting]

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,780
Torres to the Transporter Room.

60
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,909
Beam Commander Chakotay
directly to Sick Bay, now!

61
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,478
Welcome back.

62
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,109
{\an8}-Lie still.
-[sighs]

63
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,486
{\an8}What happened?

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,488
{\an8}You were transported here.

65
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,116
{\an8}Your body was in a state
of temporal flux.

66
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,327
{\an8}Temporal flux?

67
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,370
{\an8}You had the liver
of an 80-year-old man

68
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,789
{\an8}and the kidneys
of a 12-year-old boy.

69
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,460
{\an8}Fortunately, l was able to create
a chroniton-infused serum

70
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,503
{\an8}that brought you back
into temporal alignment.

71
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,756
{\an8}Anywhere else,

72
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,425
{\an8}that antidote would have
earned me a prestigious award.

73
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,676
{\an8}Of course, on <i>Voyager,</i>

74
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:48,181
{\an8}it's just another day in the life
of an under-appreciated EMH.

75
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,891
{\an8}What about the rest of the crew?

76
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,060
{\an8}-No other casualties?
-Not that I'm aware of.

77
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,645
{\an8}I've tried calling the Bridge,
but no one answers.

78
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,272
{\an8}Were we attacked?

79
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,692
{\an8}l don't think so.
We ran into some sort of anomaly.

80
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,323
{\an8}[sighs] Naturally, no one
thought to inform me.

81
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,700
{\an8}What do you think you're doing?

82
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,410
{\an8}Leaving. And you're going with me.

83
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,703
{\an8}l am?

84
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,121
There may be other injured crewmen.

85
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,206
In case you've forgotten,

86
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,541
I'm a prisoner of these walls.

87
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,876
Where's your mobile emitter?

88
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,169
My what?

89
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,091
I'll be back.

90
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,300
Wait.

91
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,969
Tell me about this mobile emitter.

92
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,685
{\an8}Bridge.

93
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,955
Harry...

94
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,414
what's going on?

95
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,959
Sir? I'm afraid l don't know you.

96
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,085
Take him into custody.

97
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,214
How did you get aboard this ship?

98
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,800
Kathryn...

99
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,011
Oh, l didn't realize
we were on a first-name basis.

100
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,764
We should have known
that the Maquis were involved.

101
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,182
Maquis?

102
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,267
Involved in what?

103
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,604
Just when we're about to chase your ship
into the Badlands,

104
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:23,443
our systems start malfunctioning
and you step off the turbolift.

105
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,989
Captain,
l know this may be hard to believe,

106
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,076
but l think I've somehow been
thrown seven years into <i>Voyager's</i> past.

107
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,872
Really? Let's try another theory.

108
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,000
You learned <i>Voyager</i> had been
assigned to capture you,

109
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,878
and you managed to get
on board to sabotage her.

110
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,963
Check your sensors.

111
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,299
See if they're showing
any strange temporal readings.

112
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,010
Captain, the environmental
controls are fluctuating.

113
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,722
Take him to the brig.

114
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,235
Halt turbolift.

115
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,071
Engineering.

116
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,829
Seska.

117
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,997
[grunting]

118
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,216
Hold him still.

119
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,185
You didn't really think
I'd hurt you, did you?

120
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,147
How'd you get here?

121
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,400
Don't tell me that little bump
on your head gave you amnesia.

122
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,320
It's time you accepted
that I'm in control of <i>Voyager</i> now.

123
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,407
That was five years ago.

124
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,326
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,869
Listen, Seska,

126
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,956
there's some kind
of temporal anomaly going on here.

127
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,834
l want to know how many more
of your people are back on board.

128
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,672
All right, I'll tell you.

129
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,424
I've got a dozen officers with me.

130
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,010
We've already locked you out
of every key system.

131
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,054
In less than an hour,
we'll be in control again.

132
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,890
In less than a minute,
you're going to be dead,

133
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,726
if you don't give me
access to those systems.

134
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,982
I'll need to use that console.

135
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,819
Just don't do anything you'll regret.

136
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,823
Move.

137
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,499
Stop him!

138
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,501
[computer]
<i>Warning. Coolant system breach.</i>

139
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,548
Don't make me kill you.

140
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,687
No. Scan the perimeter.

141
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,023
Report any anomalous readings.

142
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,025
There's something wrong here.

143
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,876
Whoever you are,
l suggest you surrender.

144
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,794
I'm armed!

145
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,005
It's only me, Doc.

146
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,465
Commander.

147
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,884
Please tell me what's going on.

148
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,260
lf you tell me the stardate.

149
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,095
49624.

150
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,015
No wonder you didn't know
about the mobile emitter.

151
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,516
You don't get it for another year.

152
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,976
l don't understand.

153
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,312
I'm not sure l get it myself,

154
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,606
but the ship seems
to have been fractured somehow.

155
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,774
Fractured?

156
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,068
Different areas seem to exist
in different time periods.

157
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,279
How many of these
''time periods'' are there?

158
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,572
I'm not sure.

159
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,034
On the Bridge, it's before <i>Voyager</i>
even left the Alpha Quadrant.

160
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,870
In Engineering, it's the time
when the Kazon took over the ship.

161
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,498
-Kazon? We've got to protect ourselves.
-Don't worry.

162
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,210
So far, I'm the only one who can cross
from one zone into another.

163
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,629
That serum you gave me...

164
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,673
it must have made me immune.

165
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,676
Normal technology won't pass
through the barriers.

166
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,430
Can you replicate
a chroniton-infused hypospray casing,

167
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,766
using the same principles
you used to make the serum?

168
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,226
l think so. Why?

169
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,977
l have to take some of it with me.

170
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,145
What for?

171
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,606
lf I'm going to put the ship
back together again,

172
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,857
l need help.

173
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,074
Captain.

174
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,910
Where are my officers?

175
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,704
The turbolift passed
through a temporal barrier.

176
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,665
They couldn't get through.

177
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,875
lf you're willing to hear me out,
l can explain...

178
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,293
at least partly.

179
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,212
You mean about your being
from the future?

180
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,675
Your first Starfleet posting
was on the Al-Batani,

181
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,510
where you once knocked out power
to six decks

182
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,595
by misaligning the positronic relays.

183
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,806
Nice try,

184
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,309
but you could have read that
in the Maquis intelligence file.

185
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,647
How's Molly, your Irish setter?

186
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,191
You rescued her
from a pound on Taris Seti IV.

187
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,362
She was the runt of the litter,
but you thought she had spunk.

188
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,031
You love music, but you never learned
to play an instrument--

189
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,117
something you still regret.

190
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,744
How do you know these things?

191
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,291
Because you told me,
about three years from now.

192
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,837
My ready room.

193
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,018
It's a fascinating story,
but as the Ferengi say,

194
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,062
''A good lie is easier to believe
than the truth.''

195
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,731
So, you're saying no one on your crew

196
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,358
has encountered
one of these temporal barriers?

197
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,321
My helmsman disappeared
when she tried to walk down that corridor,

198
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,782
but that doesn't prove she passed
through a temporal barrier.

199
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,203
lf you inject yourself,
l can take you down that corridor

200
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,039
and show you everything
that I've said is true.

201
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,210
Have Mr. Kim run
a full-spectral analysis.

202
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,961
For all l know, this is poison

203
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,089
and Mr. Chakotay is trying
to assassinate me.

204
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,595
She's right. It's poison and I'll use it.

205
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,480
Let her go.

206
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,273
Lower your weapon.

207
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,777
[groaning]

208
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,153
Captain!

209
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,075
Andrews to the Bridge.
l need help here.

210
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,701
-Andrews!
-He can't hear you.

211
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,246
We've moved
into a different time frame.

212
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,123
Scan the area,
but don't go past that bulkhead.

213
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,960
You want more proof?
It's right down that corridor.

214
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,294
You just have to trust me.

215
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,172
It isn't easy
when you're holding me hostage.

216
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,845
Stay or go. It's your choice.

217
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,348
Now that I'm inoculated,

218
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,517
l can go anywhere on the ship l want.

219
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,851
That's right.

220
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,729
Then l suppose
l don't need you anymore.

221
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,732
Without me,
you'll be walking into a future

222
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,401
you know nothing about.

223
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,028
Where are we going?

224
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,488
The Astrometrics Lab.

225
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,157
<i>Voyager</i> doesn't have
an Astrometrics Lab.

226
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,535
Harry designed it or will design it.

227
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,995
Harry Kim?

228
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,164
l realize, from your perspective,
he's new to the job,

229
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,458
but he's going to become
one of our best people.

230
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,752
Deck 8.

231
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,837
''Our'' people?

232
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,464
I'm going to be your first officer.

233
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,800
Really?

234
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,763
What's the reason
we're going to this, uh, Astrometrics?

235
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,349
It has temporal sensors
that can help us map the ship

236
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,435
and tell us how many
time frames we're dealing with.

237
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,188
Now, you're trying to tell me
Harry Kim invented temporal sensors?

238
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,984
No. We used Borg technology for that.

239
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,319
Borg?

240
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,195
It's a long story.

241
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,740
Maybe you'd better keep it to yourself.

242
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,824
[sighs]

243
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,326
The Temporal Prime Directive.

244
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,078
The less l know about the future,
the better.

245
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,128
She's got a pulse.

246
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,385
I'm detecting
an active neurogenic field.

247
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,804
This could be the day
the telepathic pitcher plant

248
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,514
put us all into comas.

249
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,601
Or it might be the time
aliens invaded our dreams.

250
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,810
We've got to get them help.

251
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,103
Don't worry.

252
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,648
We managed to get out
of both situations.

253
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,041
-Captain?
-I'm sorry--

254
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,251
l don't recognize you, Lieutenant.

255
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,088
It's me...

256
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,508
-Naomi Wildman.
-How did you...?

257
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,842
Are you Icheb?

258
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,469
Yes.

259
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,764
Something tells me
you weren't expecting us.

260
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,557
No, ma'am.

261
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,267
You both died...

262
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,811
Seventeen years ago.

263
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,195
The Captain and l
haven't risen from the grave.

264
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,031
The ship's been fractured
into different time frames.

265
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,616
Thirty-seven, to be exact.

266
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,159
How did you calculate that?

267
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,787
We've had 17 years
to upgrade the sensors.

268
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,833
A chronokinetic surge
interacted with the warp core.

269
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,460
It shattered the space-time
continuum aboard the ship.

270
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,255
The accident that occurred
in your time frame.

271
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,258
The question is:
Can we repair the damage?

272
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,178
lf we could get to a section of the ship

273
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,389
that still exists in that time period,

274
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,016
maybe we could counteract the surge,

275
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,517
stop it from happening.

276
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,228
That section was
the focal point of the surge.

277
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,189
It seems to have been... obliterated.

278
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,568
It's too bad Seven's not here.

279
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,778
Seven?

280
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,032
Someone who knows more
about temporal mechanics than any of us.

281
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,285
Unfortunately,
she hasn't been found, either.

282
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,413
Maybe we can find her
in another time frame.

283
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,000
l have an Ensign Samantha Wildman
on my crew.

284
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,084
My mother.

285
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,087
Naomi was the first child
born on <i>Voyager.</i>

286
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,674
A few years later,
we rescued Icheb from the Borg.

287
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,262
When l was little,
there was nothing l wanted more

288
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,139
than to be the assistant captain.

289
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,808
We should get moving.

290
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,269
Commander.

291
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,314
ln case you were wondering,

292
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,150
l never told Neelix
where you hid that cider.

293
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,247
So, why are we looking
for this... Seven in the cargo bay?

294
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,624
She spent a lot of time there.

295
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,542
-Working?
-Regenerating.

296
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,764
Maybe you'd better fill me in.

297
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,563
This looks like the time you forged
a temporary alliance with the Borg.

298
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,899
What's happened to this vessel?

299
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,236
Captain Janeway...

300
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,196
meet Seven of Nine--

301
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,074
Tertiary Adjunct
of Unimatrix Zero One.

302
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,371
When a Borg cube travels
through a transwarp corridor,

303
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,748
the temporal stresses are extreme.

304
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,627
To keep the different sections
of the cube in temporal sync,

305
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,046
we project a chroniton field
throughout the vessel.

306
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,131
How?

307
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,135
Each cube has
specially designed conduits.

308
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,429
lf we install similar conduits
throughout this vessel

309
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,473
then generate
a sufficiently powerful field,

310
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,393
we may be able to force <i>Voyager</i>
back into temporal sync.

311
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,395
Temporal sync with what?

312
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,692
The vessel will return to the moment
of the original chronokinetic surge.

313
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,528
Since the surge will last
for six to seven seconds,

314
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,446
Commander Chakotay
will have a short time

315
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,741
in which to try to counteract
the warp core reaction.

316
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,494
Even if we could replicate these conduits,

317
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,663
we'd have no way to get them
through the temporal barriers.

318
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,916
The bio-neural circuitry.

319
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,668
Captain?

320
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,462
It runs through every section of the ship,
almost like a nervous system.

321
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,216
lf we could inject the gel packs
with your serum,

322
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,386
we could use them
to transmit the chroniton field.

323
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,639
The warp core could be recalibrated
to generate that field.

324
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,433
Work on it.

325
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,560
Chakotay and l will see
about modifying the serum.

326
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,520
Your plan is inefficient.

327
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,230
Why?

328
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,773
There are only two of you.

329
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,276
lf l were to assimilate you
into a small Borg collective,

330
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,944
you could then assimilate others.

331
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,280
The work would proceed more quickly.

332
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,949
Sorry, but l like my plan better.

333
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,743
We'll be back.

334
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,711
That was an interesting experience.

335
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,129
lf it makes you feel any better,

336
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,423
you're going to develop quite a knack
for dealing with the Borg.

337
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,717
You mean we're going
to be seeing more of them?

338
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,261
We'll run into them on a few occasions.

339
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,306
Why do l get the feeling
that's an understatement?

340
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,436
It doesn't seem like my first command
is shaping up the way l expected.

341
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,606
In the middle of the journey of our life,

342
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,734
l found myself astray in a dark wood

343
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,112
where the straight road had been lost.

344
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,325
l didn't know Dante's <i>Inferno</i>
was on the Maquis reading list.

345
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,245
Actually, l borrowed your copy.

346
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,831
My fiancé gave me that book
as an engagement gift.

347
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,667
I've never lent it to anyone.

348
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,126
Not yet.

349
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,588
Anyway, l agree with Dante.

350
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,799
lf you always see
the road ahead of you,

351
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,509
it's not worth the trip.

352
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,679
A soldier and a philosopher.

353
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,724
Your intelligence file
doesn't do you justice.

354
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,144
I've replicated these belts
to resist the effects

355
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,398
of the temporal barriers,
just like the hyposprays.

356
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,150
l didn't realize you were programmed
to be so versatile.

357
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,362
l wasn't, but when you are thrown
into the deep end of the galaxy

358
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,739
and left running
for as long as I've been,

359
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,575
it helps to develop
a few extra subroutines.

360
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,411
How long have you been running?

361
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,998
Almost three years
since our original doctor was killed.

362
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,000
Killed? How?

363
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,335
In the incident that stranded us
here in the Delta Qua--

364
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,712
Doctor.

365
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,092
The Temporal Prime Directive, remember?

366
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,802
Of course.

367
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,138
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,018
The Delta Quadrant?
Is that what he was about to say?

369
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,978
Ready?

370
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,566
I'll take the upper decks,
you take the lower.

371
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,526
l don't think splitting up's a good idea.

372
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,153
We'll get the job done faster.

373
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,739
As your first officer,
it's my duty to protect you.

374
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,033
l know a lot more about
what's out there than you do,

375
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,702
and we have no way of communicating
if something goes wrong.

376
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,871
It may take a little longer,

377
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,956
but we should go together.

378
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,667
After you...

379
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,753
Commander.

380
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,519
Can I ask you something?

381
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,148
I started off with a crew of 153.

382
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,151
I already know I lost my doctor.

383
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,445
How many others?

384
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,823
We'll suffer casualties
like any other starship,

385
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,659
but you'll also gain
new crewmen as well.

386
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,119
Like you.

387
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,122
How do you get to be my first officer?

388
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,210
Our crews will be forced to work
together after we get stranded.

389
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,087
In the Delta Quadrant?

390
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,881
How does that happen?

391
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,093
Are you sure you want to know?

392
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,225
[loud buzzing]

393
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,186
Run!

394
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,652
What the hell was that?

395
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,614
A macro virus. They infected the ship
a few years ago.

396
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,828
It sounds like it's going to be one
disaster after another on this ship.

397
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,372
You once told me
that Starfleet captains

398
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,375
don't choose their missions,
the missions choose them.

399
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,418
You're going to have
the opportunity to study things

400
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,337
no human has ever seen before.

401
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,090
Including some very large germs.

402
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,310
A monochromatic environment?

403
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,354
It's called "black and white."

404
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,065
It's one of Tom Paris'
holodeck programs.

405
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,986
He based it on some old
science fiction serials.

406
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,238
Interesting technology.

407
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,323
Captain Proton's rocket pack.

408
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,284
Captain Proton?

409
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,994
The savior of the universe.

410
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,289
Doesn't sound like Mr. Paris'
tastes are very sophisticated.

411
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,207
That's why we love having him around.

412
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,543
The access port should be in there.

413
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,313
Here. I think I found the panel.

414
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,731
Give me a hand.

415
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,989
Halt in the name of Chaotica!

416
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,783
-Seize them!
-Oh, no.

417
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,161
-Computer, deactivate program.
<i>-Unable to comply.</i>

418
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,370
Surrender.

419
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,247
[computer]
<i>Holodeck controls are off-line.</i>

420
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,916
Hold on. Now, wait a minute.

421
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,417
Seize! My liege!

422
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,836
Do not resist.

423
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,507
They were attempting
to rob your laboratory!

424
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,051
Fool!

425
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:16,806
Don't you recognize
the Queen of the Spider People?

426
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,560
Arachnia...

427
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,188
my bride.

428
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,734
I knew you'd return to me one day...

429
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,946
so I could watch you die.

430
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,114
[sinister chuckling]

431
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,158
[laughing]

432
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,039
[laughing continues]

433
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,462
Raise the lightning shield!

434
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,090
Power the death ray!

435
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,509
Her fleet may be lurking nearby.

436
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,386
[Chaotica]
We must defend ourselves.

437
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,971
I'm open to suggestions.

438
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,640
Our best bet is to play along.

439
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,308
Don't let me stop you.

440
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,686
I'm not the one he's in love with.

441
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,020
[Chaotica]
Arachnia...

442
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,650
you beguiled me once
with your foul potions.

443
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,403
Did you think you could toy
with my affections again?

444
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,947
Were these characters
always this ridiculous?

445
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,992
If I order Lonzak to pull that lever,

446
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,577
you'll never mock me again.

447
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,748
Arachnia.

448
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,670
Please, my liege.

449
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:34,718
I meant it was ridiculous to think
I would ever try to deceive you.

450
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,264
I've come to warn you
of a fiendish plot.

451
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,394
By aliens from
the Eighth Dimension.

452
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,396
[laughter]

453
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,524
Eighth?

454
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,445
Everyone knows
there are only five dimensions.

455
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:01,286
If you don't believe us,
examine their handiwork for yourself.

456
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:06,124
There's a hidden panel over there,
behind those rocks.

457
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,126
Very well.

458
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,961
I'll humor you.

459
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,379
Lonzak!

460
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,805
I've found it, Highness!

461
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,641
They've sabotaged my laboratory.

462
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,354
That vial you're holding,
it's a neutralizing potion.

463
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:32,025
If you inject their device,
you'll render it harmless.

464
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:46,039
Release me,
and I'll disarm all their devices

465
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,041
throughout your realm.

466
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,794
Oh, Arachnia.

467
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,214
You do love me.

468
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,095
How could I resist your...

469
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,888
magnetism?

470
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,182
Or I, yours.

471
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,436
Together, we'll rule the cosmos

472
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,898
and grind our enemies into dust.

473
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,530
If we restore the timeline,

474
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,699
remind me to cancel
Mr. Paris' holodeck privileges.

475
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,875
What the hell's going on?

476
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,295
And what are you doing
in that uniform?

477
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,839
It's a little complicated.

478
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,883
I'm not going anywhere.

479
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,971
<i>Voyager's</i> had an encounter
with an anomaly.

480
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,640
It's fractured the ship
into different time periods.

481
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,726
We're trying to undo the damage,

482
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,061
but we need access to that panel.

483
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,857
First, she destroys our only way out
of the Delta Quadrant,

484
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,567
and now, you're collaborating with her?

485
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,193
Try to understand.

486
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,154
I'm from a time period in your future

487
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,197
when all of us
will be working together.

488
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,074
That's pretty hard to believe.

489
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,662
B'Elanna, I've never lied to you before
and I'm not lying now.

490
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,519
That woman blamed me
for stranding<i> Voyager</i>

491
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,937
in the Delta Quadrant.

492
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,147
She was angry.

493
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,899
But was she right?

494
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,109
You had good reasons
for doing what you did.

495
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,819
What reasons?

496
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,238
You were trying to save lives.

497
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,823
Whose?

498
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,660
An alien culture, the Ocampans.

499
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,915
In other words,
I'm going to choose to help strangers

500
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,500
at the expense of our own people.

501
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,919
It's not like you
to second-guess yourself.

502
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,880
In this case,

503
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,966
I'm second-guessing a decision
I haven't made yet.

504
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,436
Keep dispensing the netrazine
until we run out,

505
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,896
then switch to the analeptics.

506
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,272
Yes, Lieutenant.

507
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,567
How did you get in here?

508
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,860
There isn't time to explain.

509
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,695
What happened to these people?

510
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,573
Radiation poisoning.

511
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,743
The EPS relays overloaded
when we ran into the anomaly.

512
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,329
We need the Doctor
and medical supplies,

513
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,289
or we're going to have
a lot more casualties.

514
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,916
I'm afraid that isn't possible right now.

515
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,334
Do the best you can.

516
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,419
[sighs]
Yes, sir.

517
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,048
There's an access panel in the galley.

518
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,770
Coffee, black.

519
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,147
How do you know
how I like my coffee?

520
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,317
Well, you haven't changed
your standing order in seven years.

521
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,196
Thanks. It's just what I needed.

522
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,741
Don't worry, Captain.
You'll get us out of this.

523
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,076
You always do.

524
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,787
All done here.

525
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,205
[Tuvok]
Captain.

526
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,416
Tuvok?

527
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,216
I am pleased you are here.

528
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,761
I didn't think
I would see you again.

529
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,805
[gasping]

530
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,141
I want you to know,

531
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,687
it has been an honor
to serve with you...

532
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,273
and to be your friend.

533
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,528
Mr. Paris!

534
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,666
Live long and prosper.

535
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,049
[tricorder beeping]

536
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,551
[steady tone sounds]

537
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,990
Deck 11.

538
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,535
I can't let this happen, not again.

539
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,245
What are you talking about?

540
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,122
<i>Voyager</i> getting stranded,

541
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,125
all these deaths this entire future,
it's my fault.

542
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,794
I've got to do something to change it.

543
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,253
What do you have in mind?

544
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,465
Maybe we can find a way
to modify Seven of Nine's plan.

545
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,218
Put<i> Voyager</i> into temporal sync
with my time frame.

546
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,220
-Captain...
-Now that I know what's going to happen,

547
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,973
I could avoid getting trapped
in the Delta Quadrant in the first place.

548
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,307
Halt turbolift.

549
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,936
Seven's plan is dangerous enough.
Trying to alter it is too risky.

550
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,396
It's worth the risk.

551
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,730
If Seven's idea works,

552
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,691
Tuvok and those other crewmen
will be fine.

553
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,360
They'll still be stuck
in the Delta Quadrant.

554
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,029
If a temporal anomaly doesn't kill them,
something else will--

555
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,074
the Borg, telepathic pitcher plants,
macroviruses.

556
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,951
The Delta Quadrant is a death trap.

557
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,078
What about the Temporal Prime Directive?

558
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,204
To hell with it.

559
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,917
With all due respect,
it's a little presumptuous to think

560
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,294
you have the right
to change everyone's future.

561
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,046
From what I've seen, they'll thank me.

562
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,090
All you've seen are bits and pieces.

563
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,676
-You're not getting the whole picture.
-Really?

564
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,094
Just what am I missing?

565
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,430
It's not what, it's who.

566
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,682
People like Seven of Nine,

567
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,269
a Borg drone
who'll become a member of this crew

568
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,479
after you help her
recover her humanity.

569
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,024
Or Tom Paris, a former convict

570
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,528
who'll be our pilot, chief medic
and a husband to B'Elanna Torres.

571
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,363
That angry woman I just met?

572
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,615
She's going to be your chief engineer.

573
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,369
Two crews, Maquis and Starfleet,
are going to become one,

574
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,872
and they'll make as big a mark
on the Delta Quadrant

575
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,540
as it'll make on them,

576
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,375
by protecting people
like the Ocampans,

577
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,544
curing diseases, encouraging peace.

578
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,463
Children like Naomi and Icheb

579
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,090
are going to grow up on
this ship and call it home.

580
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,968
And we'll all be following a captain
who sets a course for Earth

581
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,304
and never stops believing
that we'll get there.

582
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,224
Are you going to be
lecturing me like this

583
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,893
for the next seven years?

584
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,188
Don't worry,
you'll always get the last word.

585
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,815
In that case,
let's get back to work.

586
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,737
So, who is this Seska?

587
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,699
She was a member of my crew
who turned out to be a Cardassian spy.

588
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,619
She made an alliance with the Kazon
and took over the ship.

589
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,662
It's all right. We got it back.

590
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,916
Sounds like she's not going to be
as cooperative as the others.

591
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,710
I suggest we take a page
out of your rule book.

592
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,253
We try diplomacy.

593
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,839
Fine, but the next page
in that book says

594
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,093
that when diplomacy fails,
we need a backup plan.

595
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,303
Something tells me
you already have one.

596
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,765
We've already injected the gel packs
in the other time frames.

597
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,558
That just leaves the ones here.

598
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,895
It's in both our interests
to work together.

599
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,357
I agree.

600
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,192
Let him go.

601
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,860
You believe him?

602
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,822
His story is too preposterous
to be a lie.

603
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,708
I'll admit, it's an ingenious solution.

604
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,294
I'm glad you're cooperating.

605
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,298
Oh, I believe in cooperation,
as long as it benefits me.

606
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,637
You know, it's true what they say...

607
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,432
What's that?

608
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,394
Men just get more distinguished
as they get older.

609
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,605
A few lines here, a little gray there.

610
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,941
It adds character.

611
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,695
Too bad their minds start to go.

612
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,365
The last time you were here,
you had that nasty head injury

613
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:03,077
and you mumbled something about
my taking over the ship five years ago.

614
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,329
If that's true, then you're from
a future time frame,

615
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,914
which means that, at some point,

616
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,417
your crew is going
to regain control of <i>Voyager.</i>

617
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,793
I can't allow that to happen.

618
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,172
Step away from the console.

619
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,719
An ingenious plan.

620
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,846
It just needs a slight modification.

621
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,389
What are you doing?

622
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,765
Recalibrating your pulse

623
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,476
to bring the ship into temporal sync
with my time frame.

624
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,353
That's not possible.

625
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,772
When will you learn
to stop underestimating me?

626
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,858
If you make even
the slightest miscalculation,

627
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,860
you'll destroy the ship
and kill everyone.

628
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,695
What other choice do I have?

629
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,156
If I can get<i> Voyager</i>
into my own time frame,

630
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,034
then I'll be able to ensure
that you never retake the ship.

631
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,040
Don't worry. I won't hurt you.

632
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,335
You can start fresh with me.

633
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,462
Sorry.

634
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,422
That's not the future I have in mind.

635
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,926
In that case...

636
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,180
Good-bye, Chakotay.

637
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,270
It's too dangerous.
There are too many variables.

638
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,272
-[Seska] You're not pleading for your...
-Do it.

639
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,234
[Chakotay] I'm telling you,
you're endangering your own life.

640
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,777
[Seska]
I'm touched by your concern.

641
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,886
Stop.

642
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,348
Put down your weapons.

643
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,892
Don't listen to her.

644
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,020
Your faithful first officer
isn't going to let you die.

645
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,981
Are you?

646
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,362
Very clever, Chakotay--

647
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,906
inoculating them with your serum.

648
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,033
Well, now it's time
to inoculate my people,

649
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,077
so we can have access
to the rest of the ship.

650
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,662
I won't do that.

651
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,914
Then you just lost your captain.

652
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,089
[Chakotay]
Now, drop your weapons.

653
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,966
Thanks.

654
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,894
Seska and the Kazon
are secure in the Jefferies tube.

655
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,938
-The last gel packs?
-They're ready.

656
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,357
The rest of us should
return to our sections.

657
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,068
After Chakotay initiates the warp pulse,

658
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,988
he should find himself back
at the moment <i>Voyager</i> encountered

659
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,281
the chronokinetic surge.

660
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,035
He's only going to have a few seconds
to reset the deflector polarity.

661
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,495
If the timeline is restored,

662
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,707
the rest of us should have no memory
of what's happened here.

663
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:59,003
So, I'd like to thank you now
for putting your doubts aside

664
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,922
and helping me
put mine aside as well.

665
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,550
Good luck to each of you.

666
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,979
Mind if I ask you one last question?

667
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,150
Will I have to break
the Temporal Prime Directive to answer it?

668
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,361
Maybe... just a little.

669
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,157
For two people who started off
as enemies,

670
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,160
it seems we get to know each other
pretty well.

671
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,828
So, I've been wondering...

672
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,333
just how close do we get?

673
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:45,257
Let's just say there are some barriers
we never cross.

674
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,682
See you in the future.

675
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,778
Ensign?

676
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,864
Chakotay should be initiating the pulse
in ten seconds.

677
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,914
Five, four, three, two...

678
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,052
Reroute main power to the deflector

679
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,721
and set the polarity
to the frequency I'm inputting.

680
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,014
Why?

681
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,766
Have you ever heard
of a lightning rod?

682
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,769
In about three seconds,
we're going to need one.

683
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,026
What is it?

684
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,028
I don't know.

685
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,699
Main power's being rerouted
to the deflector dish.

686
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,992
Who gave that order?

687
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,584
Damage?

688
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,464
The deflector's been burned out,
but we're okay.

689
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,479
Do you mind telling me why B'Elanna
burned out the deflector dish?

690
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,272
Actually, I ordered her to do it.

691
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,107
[Janeway]
Why?

692
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,443
Trust me, it was better
than the alternative.

693
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,028
Which was what, exactly?

694
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,780
-I can't tell you.
-Why not?

695
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,782
The Temporal Prime Directive.

696
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,078
B'Elanna's already got a team
working on repairs.

697
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,039
What do you say we finish our dinner?

698
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,922
Forget particle fountains
and subspace inversions.

699
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,592
There isn't an anomaly scarier
than a thunderstorm on the plains,

700
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,761
especially when you're six years old.

701
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,472
I remember watching a bolt of lightning

702
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,642
split an oak tree
in my grandfather's yard.

703
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,894
I'd climbed it just a few hours before.

704
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,354
Good timing.

705
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,524
So, what would have happened
if you hadn't turned our deflector dish

706
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,275
into a lightning rod?

707
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,111
We've been down this road before.

708
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,655
Have we?

709
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,366
You wanting answers to questions
you shouldn't ask.

710
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,452
But something did happen...

711
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,081
outside the normal
space-time continuum.

712
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,710
It's strange...

713
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,756
thinking there's a piece of your life
you don't know anything about.

714
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,092
Sounds a lot like the future.

715
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,885
Any predictions?

716
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,347
Only that in a few minutes,
this bottle will be empty.

717
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,767
Then maybe you should go
to the cargo bay and grab another one.

718
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,979
How do you know
that's where I keep it?

719
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,480
Oh, I can't tell you.

720
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,482
Why not?

721
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,401
Temporal Prime Directive.
