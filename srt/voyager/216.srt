1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,007
Game!

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,467
PARIS:
Why don't we

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,678
make it interesting
this time?

4
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,011
Let's add some table stakes.

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,889
What kind of stakes?

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,182
I don't know.

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,769
Mm, a couple of replicator
rations, maybe?

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,896
Don't do it, Harry.
He's hustling you.

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,357
Wait a minute.

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,985
Are you saying
he deliberately let me win?

11
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,361
( scoffs )

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,865
That would be dishonest,
Harry.

13
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,784
I won that game,
and I'll beat you again.

14
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,871
How many rations are you
willing to bet on that?

15
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,999
CREW: Come on, Harry.

16
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,876
A week's worth.

17
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,005
Harry, Harry, Harry.

18
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:47,965
Never, ever play
with anyone--

19
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,884
not even
your best friend--

20
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,553
if he says,
"Let's make it interesting."

21
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,555
Now, you want
a little action?

22
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,598
I'll give you
a little action.

23
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,684
How about an honest game
of chance?

24
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,435
Never play with anyone--

25
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,563
even your best friend--
if he offers you

26
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,148
"an honest game
of chance," Harry.

27
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,109
One replicator ration
is all it takes to play,

28
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,195
and the only thing
you have to do to win

29
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,072
is pick a number.

30
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,991
Just predict

31
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,035
what the radiogenic
particle count will be

32
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,578
at 1200 hours tomorrow,

33
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,121
and if you hit,
the pot is yours...

34
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,124
minus a small handling fee
for the bank, of course.

35
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,793
MAN 1:
I'll take a piece of that!

36
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,545
Jones, uh...
Harry, get a pad.

37
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,213
Take down these names
and numbers.

38
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,548
I'm in too.

39
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,132
MAN 2:
Lewis-- 2100.

40
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,676
MAN 3:
I'll back that bid up.

41
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,302
MAN 4:
Rogers...

42
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,768
Ensign Hogan, still no luck
with the warp drive?

43
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,187
No, Lieutenant.
The manifold just won't fire up.

44
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,189
We finally narrowed it down

45
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,358
to some kind of a problem
in EPS conduit 141.

46
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,360
Was there any indication
yesterday

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,071
that there was
something wrong?

48
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,699
Suder was monitoring
the EPS flow in the CCF.

49
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,994
He says everything
was fine.

50
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,330
Well, I guess we'll just
have to get in there

51
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,416
and track it down.

52
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,586
( indistinct chatter )

53
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,434
Happy<i> Kal Rekk,</i> Mr. Vulcan.

54
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,270
The holiday of<i> Kal Rekk</i> 
is not for two weeks.

55
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,481
But it's the<i> Kal Rekk</i> season.

56
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,524
There is no<i> Kal Rekk</i> season.

57
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,526
<i>Kal Rekk</i> is a day of atonement,

58
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,945
solitude and silence.

59
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,490
Atonement. Solitude.

60
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,242
All your Vulcan holidays
are the same.

61
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,662
I've been doing
some research. I know.

62
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,039
Why would you need to do
research on Vulcan holidays?

63
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,875
It's part of my job
as Morale Officer.

64
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,711
Morale is irrelevant
to a Vulcan.

65
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,338
Oh, please.

66
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,757
There's no one on this ship
requires my services more

67
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,342
than you do.

68
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,220
I will not rest
until I see you smile.

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,681
Then you will not rest.

70
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,724
I don't suppose
you've ever heard

71
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,602
of the Vulcan Rumarie?

72
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,313
The Rumarie
is an ancient pagan festival.

73
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,818
Full of barely clothed
Vulcan men and women

74
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,113
covered
in slippery Rillan grease,

75
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,991
chasing one another.

76
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,035
That has not been observed
for a millennium.

77
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,870
Well, it's time
to bring it back.

78
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,245
TORRES:
<i>Lieutenant Tuvok,</i>

79
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,456
<i>report to Engineering</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

80
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,750
Acknowledged.

81
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,377
I've been thinking
of a Rumarie theme

82
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,087
for the mess hall
next week--

83
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,755
lots of high-fat, greasy foods,

84
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,008
and if people want
to take off their clothes

85
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,968
and chase one another,

86
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,013
well, it certainly wouldn't hurt
morale around here.

87
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,019
Is there a problem,
Lieutenant?

88
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,028
(<i> suspenseful music playing</i> )

89
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,913
(<i> series theme playing</i> )

90
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,058
98 percent of his body suffered
third-degree plasma burns.

91
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,144
If the circuit
hadn't failed,

92
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,229
he would have
been vaporized.

93
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,397
It appeared that Mr. Darwin
had entered the conduit

94
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,234
to repair a faulty circuit
when the accident occurred.

95
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,819
A perfectly good theory.

96
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,904
Unfortunately, it's wrong.

97
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,493
This contusion
is the result

98
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,288
of a hard blow
to the back of the skull.

99
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,623
Perhaps he fell
and hit his head in the conduit.

100
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,625
The coup-contrecoup
pattern of breakage

101
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,878
should tell us whether
the blow is a result

102
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,297
of a moving head hitting
a stationary object

103
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,966
or a moving object
hitting a stationary head.

104
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,011
In this case, the pattern
clearly indicates the latter.

105
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,681
I'm sorry to report
Crewman Darwin was murdered.

106
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,391
(<i> dramatic music playing</i> )

107
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,606
At first glance,
there is no obvious motive.

108
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,735
Crewman Darwin didn't have
any known enemies on board.

109
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,778
I've been looking over
his Starfleet record.

110
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,864
His training instructor
recommended him

111
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,448
as an officers candidate.

112
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,450
He turned it down
to come with us.

113
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,161
He has three sisters
back home.

114
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,371
( doors open )

115
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,747
Sorry I'm late.

116
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,916
These are the duty logs
from last night.

117
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,918
Lon Suder was the only one
in Engineering

118
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,004
when Frank Darwin
came on duty.

119
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,422
Something wrong?

120
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,466
No, not really.

121
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,594
I've just never been comfortable
with Suder, that's all.

122
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,930
It's not like he ever
did anything wrong.

123
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,014
It's just...

124
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,349
As a Maquis,

125
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,642
he did what he had to do
a little too well.

126
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,603
As in?

127
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,979
As in killing Cardassians.

128
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,773
I don't recall observing
anything unusual

129
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,400
about Mr. Suder's
behavior

130
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,068
while I was
on your ship.

131
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,945
You weren't with him
in battle.

132
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,947
Around us,
he was the quietest

133
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,990
most unassuming guy
you'll ever meet.

134
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,993
Typical Betazoid.
Kept to himself.

135
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,870
I never knew much
about him.

136
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,081
In the Maquis,
we didn't ask for résumés.

137
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,791
We needed all the help
we could get.

138
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,876
A lot of us were doing
what we were doing

139
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,461
to protect our families,

140
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,797
but Suder had
his own reasons.

141
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,091
I wish I could tell you
what they were.

142
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,343
In combat, there was
something in his eyes.

143
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,096
Maybe he had something personal
against Cardassians.

144
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,181
Sometimes I had to
pull him back,

145
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,183
stop him from going
too far,

146
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,185
and once or twice
when I did,

147
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,354
he looked at me
with those cold eyes,

148
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,231
and I just knew

149
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,275
he was this far away
from killing me.

150
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,693
I find it curious
that none of this was included

151
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,155
in your initial crew evaluation,
Commander.

152
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,740
I don't put down hunches
or bad feelings

153
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,492
in my crew evaluations,
Lieutenant.

154
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,494
A Vulcan
should appreciate that.

155
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,787
Considering the fact

156
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,623
that your Maquis crew
included malcontents,

157
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,625
outlaws and mercenaries,

158
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,752
I believe it would
have been appropriate.

159
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,422
I wasn't gonna make it harder
for any of them here.

160
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,799
Suder did his job
when he was serving with me,

161
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,344
and he's done his job
since he's been on this ship.

162
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,387
It seems clear
where your investigation

163
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,888
should begin, Lieutenant.

164
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,104
You wish to see me,
Mr. Tuvok?

165
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,939
Sit down.

166
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,568
You were alone
in Engineering

167
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,821
when Crewman Darwin reported
for duty last night.

168
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,156
Yes, sir.

169
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,657
Did you speak to him?

170
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,868
No, we just sort of looked
at each other,

171
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,079
and he did whatever he had to do
and I did what I had to do.

172
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,081
And what was that?

173
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,251
I was, um, running
a fuel-consumption analysis

174
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,962
for Lieutenant Torres.

175
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,672
She can tell you.

176
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,217
Are you accusing me
of killing him?

177
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,722
I have accused no one
at this time.

178
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,807
Did you kill Crewman Darwin?

179
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,935
No.

180
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,355
No. I barely knew him.

181
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,067
You know,
just because I'm a Maquis

182
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,609
doesn't make me a killer.

183
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,696
I will be speaking to everyone
in Engineering--

184
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,614
perhaps everyone on this ship--

185
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,076
not just former members
of the Maquis.

186
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,578
We all know how you feel
about the Maquis.

187
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,122
I assure you, I have no feelings
about the Maquis.

188
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,083
No, you just spied on us

189
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,168
and were gonna turn us all
over to Starfleet.

190
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,379
As hard as it may be
for you to understand,

191
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,465
that did not require
any feelings on my part.

192
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,679
The doctor places
the time of death at 2214.

193
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,724
Do you remember
what you were doing then?

194
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,436
I was still running
the fuel analysis.

195
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,021
I worked on it
until I went off duty.

196
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,898
Would you be surprised
to know

197
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,901
that your console
was logged off at 2209?

198
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,236
That's not possible.

199
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,155
Do you have a criminal record,
Mr. Suder?

200
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,199
Now, that would be
sort of difficult

201
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,700
to check on, wouldn't it?

202
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,911
Why would you have
any reason to lie?

203
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,662
I don't.

204
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,915
Do you have
a criminal record?

205
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,125
No.

206
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,834
How would you describe

207
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,962
your relationship
with Crewman Darwin?

208
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,216
I had no relationship.

209
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,842
No disagreements?
No.

210
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,137
No fights?
No.

211
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,639
No reason to kill him?
No.

212
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,392
You are dismissed, crewman.

213
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,312
I may have more questions
for you later.

214
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,440
(<i> suspenseful music playing</i> )

215
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,651
( intercom beeps )

216
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,736
DOCTOR:
<i>Medlab to Lieutenant Tuvok.</i>

217
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,322
Go ahead, Doctor.

218
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,492
<i>I think I've found something</i>
<i>that will help you.</i>

219
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,868
Do you see the DNA strands
on the lower border?

220
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,329
TUVOK:
Yes.

221
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,789
They were retrieved
from inside the head wound

222
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,374
by nanites that I designed

223
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,418
to recognize
unusual DNA patterns.

224
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,170
This DNA was isolated

225
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,339
because it didn't belong
to the victim.

226
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,383
Have you matched it
to a member of the crew?

227
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,388
Are you certain?

228
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,308
DNA doesn't know how
to lie, Lieutenant.

229
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,478
(<i> dramatic music playing</i> )

230
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,988
I must advise you that
under Starfleet Directive 101,

231
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,449
you do not have to answer
any questions.

232
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,171
No.

233
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,717
No, there's no point
in denying it anymore.

234
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,973
Uh...

235
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,268
I used a 2-kilo coil spanner.

236
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:13,858
He was sitting at the...
impulse system control panel.

237
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,944
He didn't even look up
when I moved in behind him

238
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,865
and I swung the spanner
as hard as I could.

239
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,536
Crewman, I suggest you speak
to counsel.

240
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,664
There was practically no blood.
I was surprised at that.

241
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,919
I figured that the EPS conduit

242
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,754
was the easiest way
to dispose of the body,

243
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,633
but I must have damaged one
of the circuits

244
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,469
when I put him inside.

245
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,054
Oh...

246
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,140
I hid the spanner
behind a com line access panel

247
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,892
on Deck 7.

248
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,521
Why did you kill him,
Mr. Suder?

249
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,449
( sighs )

250
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,912
No reason.

251
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,625
That is not
a satisfactory answer.

252
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,627
You must have had some motive.

253
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,382
I didn't like the way
he looked at me.

254
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,679
(<i> suspenseful music playing</i> )

255
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,536
No doubt about it.
This is the murder weapon.

256
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,456
Mr. Suder is apparently
telling the truth.

257
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,500
You don't seem satisfied,
Lieutenant.

258
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,793
No.

259
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,795
You have a confession
and the murder weapon.

260
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,588
And no established motive.

261
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,256
Does it matter?

262
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,967
A crime must have
a logical purpose.

263
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,595
Ah, yes, I see--
how to close the case

264
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,264
without understanding the logic
of the crime.

265
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,435
For a Vulcan, that would be
a dilemma, wouldn't it?

266
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,689
Doctor, is it possible
that Mr. Suder is psychotic?

267
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,315
I doubt it.

268
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,901
Kes, call up
his genetic profile.

269
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,154
The neuro-genetic markers
are normal.

270
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,073
There's no tendency
toward bipolar disorder.

271
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,618
So he's not insane,
per se.

272
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,746
What do the elevated
norepinephrine levels suggest?

273
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,665
Aggressive,
even violent tendencies.

274
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,667
Why didn't you
report this immediately

275
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,335
after your examination,
Doctor?

276
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,295
These readings
are not significantly different

277
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,506
from those
of the other Maquis crewmen.

278
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,800
Obviously, it takes
a certain personality type

279
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,260
to be attracted
to the life of an outlaw.

280
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,262
Don't you believe
his confession, Tuvok?

281
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,472
In fact, I do.

282
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,891
Nevertheless, my job
is not finished

283
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,934
until I determine
a motive.

284
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,103
And what if
there was no motive?

285
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,606
One may not recognize
the motivation,

286
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,525
but there is always
motivation.

287
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,026
I think you are trapped

288
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,070
in your own Vulcan logic,
Lieutenant.

289
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,155
All of us
have violent instincts.

290
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,157
We have evolved from predators.

291
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,659
Well, not me, of course.

292
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,703
I've just been programmed
by you predators.

293
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,788
The question is,
in a civilized world,

294
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,623
can we suppress those instincts?

295
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,458
Most of the time, we can.

296
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,377
Vulcans certainly can.

297
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,379
You've got
your violent feelings buried

298
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,005
underneath centuries
of control,

299
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,049
but the rest
of the humanoid races

300
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,552
aren't always so skilled
at self-discipline.

301
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,763
Crewman Suder
may have violent impulses

302
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,890
that he just can't control.

303
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,684
Do you believe that a look
by Mr. Darwin

304
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,561
could provoke
such a violent reaction?

305
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,271
It has been known to happen.

306
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,276
I do not accept
that explanation.

307
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,157
( sighs )

308
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,079
I already told you
why I killed him, Lieutenant.

309
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,123
You didn't like
the way he looked at you.

310
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,207
Right.

311
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,834
Just how did he look at you?

312
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,420
Like a lot of people
in Starfleet do.

313
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,839
So this murder
could in fact be explained

314
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,341
as an outburst of rage
against Starfleet.

315
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,302
( snickers )

316
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:13,055
Look, if that's how you want
to look at this...

317
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,015
I want the truth.

318
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,812
I don't like Starfleet.

319
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,106
I won't deny that.

320
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,483
But...

321
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,984
Yes?

322
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,362
I have killed people
who weren't in Starfleet

323
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,948
for the same reason--

324
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:34,118
I did not like the way
they looked at me.

325
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,664
I've thought about
killing you, Lieutenant.

326
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,916
In my case,
you have a motive--

327
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,918
my previous mission as a spy,

328
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,920
my role as your accuser--

329
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,672
but to my knowledge,

330
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,382
Crewman Darwin
had done nothing to you.

331
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,926
That's true.

332
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,178
Then why choose him
as a victim?

333
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,515
I don't know.

334
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,475
Do you feel remorse?

335
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,560
( chuckles )

336
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,648
I don't seem
to feel anything at all.

337
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:07,986
Most Betazoids can sense
other people's emotions.

338
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,615
I can't even sense my own.

339
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,159
So what's gonna happen
to me now?

340
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,872
I'll have to discuss that
with the captain.

341
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,499
I know what I'd do
if I were her.

342
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,547
Guess I'm lucky.

343
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,551
The Federation
doesn't execute people.

344
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:36,180
(<i> suspenseful music playing</i> )

345
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,588
It is important
that I understand

346
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,340
why you killed Mr. Darwin.

347
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,718
I wish I could help you,
Lieutenant.

348
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,762
You can,
and indirectly,

349
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,472
I may be able to help you
as well.

350
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,308
Do you know
what a mind-meld is?

351
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,644
It's that... Vulcan thing

352
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,105
where you grab someone's head.

353
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,733
We would be
telepathically linked,

354
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,610
exchanging our thoughts,

355
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,696
in essence,
becoming one mind.

356
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,115
One mind? You and me?

357
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,200
I wouldn't recommend that,
Lieutenant.

358
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,953
It is not without risk,

359
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,246
but as a Vulcan,
I have internal processes

360
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,916
that allow me
to control violent instincts.

361
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,167
I believe I will be able
to suppress

362
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,378
whatever feelings I draw
from you.

363
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,339
And how will I be helped
by all this?

364
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,384
It is likely that you will gain,
at least for a time,

365
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,428
some of my self-discipline

366
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,098
to better control
your own violent nature.

367
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,648
What do I have to do?

368
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,233
Release the force field.

369
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,376
My mind to your mind...

370
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,546
your thoughts
to my thoughts.

in the Paris

377
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,991
Computer?

378
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,076
<i>There is no winner today.</i>

379
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,412
What? No winner?

380
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,247
Computer, are you positive?

381
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,416
<i>Try your luck again.</i>

382
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,460
<i>Tomorrow you could be a winner.</i>

383
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,046
Very funny.

384
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,630
You heard
the little lady.

385
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,674
Try your luck again,
folks.

386
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,385
The pot grows daily
until we have a winner.

387
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,346
Enter your name on the pad
and pick a number.

388
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,348
Can I buy you lunch,
Mr. Kim?

389
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,559
I have an extra ration
today.

390
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,435
Two, by my count.

391
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,021
Ten percent
of the day's action.

392
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:33,566
The only one who wins
every day is you.

393
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,651
I think I'll have
some prime rib--

394
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,944
medium rare--

395
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,906
mashed potatoes,
creamed spinach.

396
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,116
And maybe
some Yorkshire pudding...

397
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,744
and a Raktajino
with whipped cream on top.

398
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,829
So it ultimately
turned out

399
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,208
to be a worthwhile
and enlightening experience.

400
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,044
Did you get any of the answers
you were after?

401
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,462
It is difficult
for me to accept, Captain,

402
00:20:55,462 --> 00:21:00,051
but Mr. Suder was telling
the truth as he knew it.

403
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,803
He is a man with
an incredibly violent nature

404
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,138
living in an environment

405
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,182
without any outlet
to express it.

406
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,350
I am surprised he was able
to maintain his self-control

407
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,769
for as long as he did.

408
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,520
I guess in his earlier life,

409
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,606
he always found ways
to release those impulses,

410
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,858
like volunteering
for the Maquis.

411
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,610
What do we do with him?

412
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,988
If we were home,
he'd be sent to prison.

413
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,365
The brig is the closest thing
we have,

414
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,743
but I don't think
we can just leave him

415
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,121
down in our dungeon
for the rest of the trip.

416
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,956
Nor would it be appropriate

417
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,708
to leave him in the custody
of someone in this quadrant.

418
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,252
I agree.

419
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:37,255
Captain...

420
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,382
he is prepared to die
for his crime.

421
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,223
An execution?

422
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,225
You're not seriously
suggesting that we--

423
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,768
I only mention it

424
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,937
because of the extenuating
circumstances

425
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,438
and because he feels

426
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,607
it would be
an appropriate punishment.

427
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,151
I don't.

428
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,528
I prefer to rehabilitate him,
not to end his life.

429
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,239
We'll confine him to quarters.

430
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,117
Work with Kim to install
maximum-security containment.

431
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,077
Pardon me, Captain,

432
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,080
but allowing him the comfort
of his own quarters

433
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,583
doesn't seem an appropriate
punishment for murder.

434
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,627
If we don't get home soon,

435
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,630
he'll be in that room
a long time, Mr. Tuvok.

436
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,882
I think this is the best
we can do

437
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,592
under these circumstances.

438
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:28,181
Crewman Darwin's three sisters
might not agree.

439
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,648
How is Suder
since the mind-meld?

440
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,692
Quite calm and controlled.

441
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,443
Clearly, the meld initiated

442
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,030
some high cortical activity
in his brain.

443
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,200
And you, Tuvok--
any adverse effects?

444
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,618
I will admit
that I am more disconcerted

445
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,162
than I anticipated.

446
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:54,040
Why don't you take a day or two
off for meditation?

447
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,334
Thank you,
but I am already taking steps

448
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,544
to purge
these residual feelings.

449
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,505
I don't believe time off
will be necessary.

450
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,301
I will, of course, advise you
of any further complications.

451
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,929
Tuvok.

452
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,725
Take care of yourself.

453
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,905
(<i> dramatic music playing</i> )

454
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,705
I would prefer
to be alone.

455
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,123
Okay. All right.

456
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,042
Far be it from me
to bother anyone.

457
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,169
If you really
want me to leave,

458
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,962
I'll leave.

459
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,964
I really want you to leave.

460
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,549
I don't believe you.

461
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,885
Your voice says, "go away,"

462
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,221
but your heart wants me
to make you smile.

463
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:54,641
Please, go away.

464
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,396
Come on. A little smile.

465
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,689
How is it gonna hurt?

466
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,649
I won't tell anyone.

467
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,361
What must I do
to convince you to stop?

468
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,948
Come on. Just a little,
itty-bitty smile.

469
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,908
Just let the mouth curl
a little there.

470
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,659
Ha-ha. That's g--

471
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,954
You know,
there's an old Talaxian song

472
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,248
my mother used to sing me
as a child.

473
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:20,918
I'm gonna sing it to you
every day from now on. It goes--

474
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,963
( choking )

475
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,005
Mr. Vulcan, I--

476
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,300
Oh, I can't breathe.

477
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,467
Can't-- I can't breathe.

00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,971

Oh, come on, Chakotay.

We were just having
a little fun,

the recreational facilities
of the Delta Quadrant

490

being what they are.

491
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,574
I've heard you're responsible
for this, Lieutenant.

492
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:38,329
I didn't think Starfleet
would have a problem with it.

493
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,289
With a senior officer
running a gambling operation

494
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,291
and skimming profits
from each day's proceeds?

495
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:46,295
Now, why would Starfleet
have a problem with that?

496
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,256
Since you all seem to have
extra replicator rations,

497
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,841
you won't be needing these.

498
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,676
Today's pot
is hereby confiscated.

00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,928
CREWMAN 1: Oh, come on.
CREWMAN 2: Jeez, wait a minute.

500
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,474
The captain's put a lot of faith
in you, Mr. Paris.

501
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,185
She'll be disappointed.

502
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,603
You're on report.

503
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,773
Now, there's a tough job--

504
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,151
filling out reports.

505
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,737
But somebody's gotta do it.

506
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,371
Thanks a lot.

507
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,932
I did not hear you come in,
Lieutenant.

508
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,101
How are you feeling?

509
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,730
Centered.

510
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,274
Don't be misled.

511
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,568
Your violent instincts
still exist.

512
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,694
You are simply suppressing them,
as Vulcans do.

513
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,197
I can feel the difference.

514
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:59,617
It is almost as if I can observe
the violence inside me

515
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,995
without letting it
get too close.

516
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,914
It is quite remarkable

517
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:07,293
what you Vulcans
have learned to do.

518
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,379
Understand that this will not
be a permanent change

519
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,340
unless you commit
to a strict daily regime

520
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,594
of meditation
and mental exercise.

521
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:19,555
I also believe that a series
of holodeck programs

522
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,141
designed to allow
your violent tendencies

523
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,268
to be released
in a safe environment

524
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,979
may help to purge
your aggressive impulses.

525
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,898
Holographic violence

526
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,527
does not give
the same... sensation

527
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,154
as the real thing.

528
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,738
I've tried it.

529
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,617
Has anyone ever suggested
targeted neuro-synaptic therapy?

530
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,868
That didn't work either.

531
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,580
Our doctor is programmed
with the medical knowledge

532
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,540
of every Federation world.

533
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,043
Perhaps he'll know of some
treatment you haven't tried.

534
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:54,965
Since the meld, I feel capable
of controlling myself.

535
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:58,885
Perhaps with your help,
I can learn to stay this way.

536
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,225
It must be difficult for you.

537
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,485
Difficult?

538
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,655
Knowing violence
as I've known it.

539
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,698
I have studied violence
for over 100 years.

540
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,493
Studying it
and knowing it

541
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,037
are two different things,
aren't they?

542
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,958
It's attractive, isn't it?

543
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,004
Attractive?

544
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,048
Violence.

545
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,175
On the contrary.

546
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,469
I find it disturbing.

547
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,679
You're right.

548
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,222
It is disturbing--

549
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,432
never knowing
when that impulse may come

550
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,227
or whether or not
you can control it when it does.

551
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,229
You live on the edge
of every moment,

552
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:55,234
and yet, in its own way,
violence is attractive too.

553
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,945
Maybe because
it doesn't require logic.

554
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:03,075
Perhaps that's why
it's so liberating.

555
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,244
Ironic, isn't it--

556
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,121
that I can share with you,
of all people,

557
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:13,126
what I have hidden from everyone
all my life.

558
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,546
Can we do it again, Tuvok?

559
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:18,798
Again?

560
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,134
Meld.

561
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,846
That would not be advisable.

562
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,936
I understand.

563
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,772
Really, I do.

564
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,692
I have thought about it a lot.

565
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:42,030
In a way, a mind-meld is almost
an act of violence, isn't it?

566
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,741
I don't understand
why you would--

567
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:44,908
Penetration.

568
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,952
Your will dissolving mine.

569
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,079
The joining.

570
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,915
It seems to me
that a mind-meld

571
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,586
might be fatal
if you lost control.

572
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,310
Computer, place level one
security seals on this room.

573
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,605
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Security seals in place.</i>

574
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,649
Delete security clearance

575
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,443
Tuvok 1-4-9-4 lambda.

576
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:24,030
<i>Specified</i>
<i>security clearance deleted.</i>

577
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,408
Please inform the captain

578
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,868
that I am no longer fit
for duty.

579
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,829
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

580
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,799
Computer, lift
the security seal

581
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,842
from Lieutenant Tuvok's
quarters.

582
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,637
( electronic beep )

583
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,514
Wait here.

584
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,817
( labored breathing )

585
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,528
I would advise you
not to enter, Captain.

586
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,870
Tuvok.

587
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,207
Please, do not come any closer.

588
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,298
Talk to me.

589
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,550
I said...

590
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,677
don't come any closer.

591
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,639
We need to get you to Sick Bay.

592
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,893
It would be safer for the crew

593
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:39,022
if I were to remain
in these quarters.

594
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:43,068
I remind you, I am trained
in the martial arts

595
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,029
of many Alpha Quadrant
cultures.

596
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,532
Sitting here,
attempting to meditate,

597
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,950
I have counted
the number of ways

598
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,370
I know of killing someone

599
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,706
using just a finger,

600
00:31:55,706 --> 00:32:00,043
a hand... a foot...

601
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,756
I had reached 94
when you entered.

602
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:07,551
The doctor is fully versed
in Vulcan medicine.

603
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,518
( labored breathing )

604
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:23,108
Again, for safety reasons,

605
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,277
I recommend you sedate me

606
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,447
before you initiate transport.

607
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,534
KES:
Levels of neuropeptides
in the limbic system

608
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,788
are down 15 percent.

609
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:38,206
There's a definite
neurochemical imbalance

610
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,917
in the mesiofrontal
cortex.

611
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,418
Which means what?

612
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,961
That's where the Vulcan

613
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,046
psycho-suppression systems
are located.

614
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,674
This may be the result
of a incompatibility

615
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,093
with the Betazoid
telepathic neural center.

616
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,721
I'm not sure.

617
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,014
( sighs )

618
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:58,852
Vulcan mind-melds.
Utter foolishness.

619
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,979
Anybody with an ounce
of sense

620
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,356
wouldn't share his brain
with someone else.

621
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,400
Would you?
I certainly wouldn't.

622
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,486
And of course,
when something goes wrong--

623
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,779
And believe me, it does,

624
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,864
more often than they'd like
to admit--

625
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,032
the first thing they call out
is, "Doctor."

626
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,076
Can you help him?
I wish I could tell you.

627
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,036
There's a recommended course
of treatments

628
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,414
that should begin immediately.
What does it involve?

629
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,375
First we have to take away his
ability to control his violence.

630
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,628
We do this in short bursts
over a period of time

631
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,088
and hope it provides a shock
to his system.

632
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,674
If it works,

633
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,635
his own neural controls
will take over again.

634
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,475
I believe we're about ready.

635
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,310
Revive him.

636
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,812
( electronic beep )

637
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,447
Something has changed.

638
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,407
We've temporarily removed all

639
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,910
of your emotional suppression
abilities, Lieutenant.

640
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,077
How do you feel?

641
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,580
( gasping )

642
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,834
I... feel.

643
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:07,337
Tuvok, do you know
where you are?

644
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,340
( laughs )

645
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,969
Of course I know where I am,
Captain.

646
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:18,390
I'm just not sure I know
who I am.

647
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,975
Try to relax.

648
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,144
The treatment still has
about three minutes to go.

649
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:27,024
Oh, it must be working,

650
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:30,694
because I feel very strong.

651
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:36,575
Very... powerful.

652
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,410
Quite euphoric.

653
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,371
This must be how
my ancestors felt.

654
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,373
Doctor, would you
consider allowing me

655
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,417
to remain this way
for a while?

656
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,377
It would be
a valuable opportunity

657
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,295
for me to study
primal Vulcan behavior.

658
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,964
Sorry, I'm not prepared
to do that.

659
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,133
The course of treatment
is very specific.

660
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,595
You are not invulnerable,
hologram.

661
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,972
A few well-chosen commands
to the computer,

662
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,683
and you will cease to exist.

663
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,520
( grunts )

664
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,563
( electronic beep )

665
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,981
Two minutes,
30 seconds left.

666
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,651
You look shocked, Captain.

667
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:16,782
You must be asking yourself,
what if this doesn't wok?

668
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,867
What do we do then?

669
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,829
I have an idea.

670
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,833
I'll just stay in my quarters
for the rest of the trip.

671
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,794
I'll just relax

672
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,921
and read,

673
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,756
eat the ship's food,

674
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,716
use the ship's energy,

675
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,676
all in the comforts
of my own room.

676
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,720
Why, even Mr. Suder and I
could get together

677
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,764
for a few hands
of Cardassian Pinochle

678
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,140
once or twice a week.

679
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,267
That is how we treat
violent offenders

680
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,811
on this ship, isn't it?

681
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,521
You are not
a violent offender, Tuvok.

682
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,231
I could be.

683
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,651
Just like Suder.

684
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,946
You know, Captain, I don't mind
telling you something

685
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,658
the other Tuvok never would.

686
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,743
You are wrong.

687
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:06,623
Sparing Suder's life
is a sign of weakness.

688
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,750
You disgust me.

689
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,422
All you humans do.

690
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,424
Admit it.

691
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,552
Part of you feels as I do.

692
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,889
Part of you wants him to die
for what he did.

693
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,641
No part of me feels that way.

694
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,685
Liar!

695
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:31,815
He has killed,
and you know he deserves to die!

696
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,734
On behalf
of the victim's family, Captain,

697
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,154
I beg you to reconsider.

698
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:41,240
Give them the satisfaction
of his execution.

699
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,835
I have a radical suggestion,
Captain.

700
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:55,213
Release the force field,

701
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,717
and I'll kill him for you.

702
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,848
Release the force field.

703
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,270
My student--

704
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,191
my protégé.

705
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,234
There is so much to learn

706
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,611
for each of us today,
isn't there?

707
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,155
You'll be all right, Tuvok.

708
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,407
This will be over
in 30 seconds.

709
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,450
Listen to what I tell you.

710
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,494
Release the force field.

711
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:32,209
I'm sorry. I had them disable
your telepathic abilities too.

712
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,211
You can't reach me, Tuvok.

713
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,296
Release the force field!

714
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,175
( grunting )

715
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,801
Ten seconds.

716
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,017
Five seconds.

717
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,353
( gasps )

718
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,315
It's over.

719
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,859
He's lost consciousness.

720
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,903
He might be able
to fool the sensors.

721
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,030
Sedate him again.

722
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,032
Computer, remove
the force field.

723
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,034
( electronic buzz )

724
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,411
Help me get him
back on the bed.

725
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,292
How many treatments
do you think will be necessary?

726
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,419
I wish I knew, Captain.

727
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,422
In a sense, Mr. Tuvok's mind
is fighting a classic battle

728
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,007
between good and evil.

729
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,343
The battle may be won
in a day, a year,

730
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,930
or it may never be won.

731
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,861
(<i> suspenseful music playing</i> )

732
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,230
( groaning )

733
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,567

( thump )

738
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,115
Tuvok?

739
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,503
I wondered
what happened to you.

740
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,547
They wouldn't tell me
anything.

741
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,593
There were some complications
from the meld.

742
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,096
I wondered about that.

743
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,224
I've been undergoing
neuro-synaptic therapy

744
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,934
in Sick Bay.

745
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,103
It didn't work.

746
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,730
No.

747
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,987
Have you come to kill me?

748
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,782
To execute you for your crime.

749
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,661
To execute me. I see.

750
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,291
And calling it that makes it
more comfortable for you.

751
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,168
I will take no comfort in this.

752
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,048
A most logical use
of violence--

753
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,634
to punish the violent.

754
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:16,057
We both know
that I am prepared to die,

755
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,476
but are you prepared
to kill?

756
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,519
It needs to be done.

757
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,897
To release
your violent impulses?

758
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,899
To serve justice.

759
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,818
Justice or vengeance?

760
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,195
Understand one thing,
Tuvok.

761
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,696
I can promise you

762
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,699
this will not silence
your demons.

763
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,119
If you can't control
the violence,

764
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,246
the violence controls you.

765
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,833
Be prepared to yield
your entire being to it,

766
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,211
to sacrifice your place
in civilized life,

767
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,588
for you will no longer
be a part of it,

768
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,758
and there's no return.

769
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,385
( grunts )

770
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,511
I...

771
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,180
seek...

772
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,722
no return.

773
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,225
Of course. You would not
be able to live with yourself.

774
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,019
Then we are both to die,

775
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,813
and that will end
the torment.

776
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,233
My mind to your mind.

777
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,235
My thoughts

778
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,404
to your thoughts.

779
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,617
My mind... to your mind.

780
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:21,122
My thoughts
to your thoughts.

781
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,500
( both gasping )

782
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,805
( groans )

783
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,907
Crewman Suder to the bridge.

784
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,617
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Suder, what are you doing</i>
<i>with a com-badge?</i>

785
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,661
You better get down here,
Chakotay.

786
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,039
Lieutenant Tuvok needs help.

787
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,097
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

788
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,224
<i>Ensign Suder</i>
<i>has been incarcerated</i>

789
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,017
<i>in secured quarters,</i>

790
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,853
<i>where he will likely spend</i>
<i>the rest of our journey home.</i>

791
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,147
<i>Lieutenant Tuvok remains</i>
<i>under observation</i>

792
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,275
<i>in Sick Bay.</i>

793
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,445
It may be hard for you
to believe, Lieutenant,

794
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,696
but what happened
is encouraging.

795
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,408
Your inability
to complete the act of murder

796
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:41,911
shows your suppression systems
are starting to function again.

797
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,539
You're on your way back
to being normal.

798
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,999
Although I'm not sure
how the word "normal" applies

799
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,961
to a species that suppresses
all their emotions.

800
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,552
( hoarsely ):
Captain...

801
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,556
I must apologize
for my inappropriate behavior.

802
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:05,684
I'm just glad
we have you back, Mr. Tuvok.

803
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:09,522
I was most... insulting to you.

804
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,023
Don't worry about it.

805
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,568
I've been insulted before.

806
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,736
I hope you understand

807
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,029
that I have always had

808
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,741
the greatest respect
for you as a captain

809
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,829
and consider you... a friend.

810
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,417
That means a great deal to me.

811
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,919
Enough said.

812
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,255
Get some rest.

813
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,141
Tuvok.

814
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,646
No more mind-melds
without my permission.

815
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,439
Understood?
