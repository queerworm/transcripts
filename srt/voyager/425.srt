( people chattering
indistinctly )

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,516
Lieutenant, Ensign.

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,725
Hey, Seven.

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,977
Have some dinner.

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,728
The potato salad
isn't half bad.

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,606
I do not require
nutrition at this time.

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,984
I would like
to talk with you.

9
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,110
Okay.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,029
Ensign Kim,
what is your place of origin?

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,280
You mean where am I from?

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,324
Well,
I was born in South Carolina--

13
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,826
Lieutenant Torres, explain

14
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,077
why you became a
member of the Maquis.

15
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,122
Um, it was through Chakotay.

16
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,333
I met him... Well, actually,
he saved my life--

17
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,627
List the sports you play.

18
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,922
I've dabbled in quite a few...
tennis, parrises squares...

19
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,423
but my favorite is volleyball.
It's--

20
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,384
SEVEN:
Specify the foods
you find enjoyable.

21
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,260
Seven, what is this?

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,763
Describe the nature
of your sexual relationship

23
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,056
with Lieutenant Paris.

24
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,683
Okay, that's it.

25
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,226
Computer,
freeze program.

26
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,896
Would you care to explain
what you're doing?

27
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,439
I'm doing exactly
what you instructed me to do.

28
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,400
I hardly think so.

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,985
I created this program
to help you become

30
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,111
more comfortable
in social situations,

31
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,031
not to practice
alienating people.

32
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,034
You made recommendations about
how to carry on a conversation.

33
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,994
That's true.
You said it's helpful if people

34
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,412
feel you're interested
in them.

35
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,997
Correct.
And that drawing them out

36
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,540
by asking them about
themselves is one

37
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,208
way to demonstrate
that interest.

38
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,045
That doesn't mean subjecting
them to an interrogation.

39
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,337
You have to let them answer.

40
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,964
Listen to what
they're saying.

41
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,090
Ask another question
on the same subject.

42
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,843
Take your time.

43
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,135
Shall we try again?

44
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,804
I believe I am overdue

45
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,305
for my weekly
medical maintenance.

46
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,849
We should go.

47
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,351
Seven, you've never volunteered
for a checkup before.

48
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,021
It is preferable
to remaining here.

49
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,317
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

50
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,572
What have we got here?

51
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,991
Looks like a
Mutara-class nebula

52
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,200
with a few trace
constituents

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,702
that aren't in
our database,

54
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,537
but they're showing up
in minute quantities.

55
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,163
The nebula is vast,
Captain.

56
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,083
It extends beyond the reach
of our sensors.

57
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,501
Huh. Then I guess we
won't try to go around it.

58
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,504
Tom, take us in
at one-half impulse.

59
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,214
Yes, ma'am.

60
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,174
I'm detecting a slight
radioactive field.

61
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,552
It's...
( gasping )

62
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,100
Harry?

63
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,601
Nothing. Uh...

64
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,270
it's just a headache coming on.
( winces )

65
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,897
Maybe you should
go to Sickbay.

66
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,316
Yeah, maybe so.
( grunts )

67
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,985

00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,614
Tom, turn us around.

78

Get us out of here.

00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,250
DOCTOR:<i> Yes, Captain.</i> 
We need help.

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,127
What happened?
I'm being inundated with calls!

00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,295
JANEWAY:<i> Hurry!</i> 
Seven, go to the Bridge.

84
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,464
Use the dermal regenerator
to treat the burns.

88
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,352
( beeping )

00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,396

( panting )

92
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,283
We've cleared the nebula.

00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,329

He's dead.

( sighs )

98
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,020
The nebula extends for at least
110 light-years, possibly more.

99
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,729
JANEWAY:
At the least it
would take us

100
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,731
well over a month
to get through it

101
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,318
and more than a year
to get around it.

102
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:02,196
The crew was unable
to tolerate the nebula

103
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,697
for even a few minutes.

104
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,365
They certainly could not
survive a month.

105
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,827
We've come
15,000 light-years.

106
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,412
We haven't been stopped
by temporal anomalies,

107
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,790
warp-core breaches
or hostile aliens,

108
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,750
and I am damned
if I'm going

109
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,544
to be stopped
by a nebula.

110
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,255
I'll be in Sickbay.

111
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,219
I've analyzed a sample of
the gases from the nebula.

112
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,096
I think the damage came
from subnucleonic radiation.

113
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,430
Even the briefest exposure

114
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,432
is devastating
to organic tissue.

115
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,810
Can you give us any protection
against the effects?

116
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,604
Yes.
Stasis chambers.

117
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,898
Independent life support

118
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,816
for each unit.

119
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,609
Are you suggesting...

120
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,402
that the entire crew

121
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,155
be put in suspended
animation?

122
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,405
Yes.

123
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,908
I, of course,
would stay on line

124
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,201
in order to monitor everyone.

125
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,161
Well, this is
a drastic step, doctor.

126
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,787
Are there
any other options?

127
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,873
Adjusting the shields,
inoculations?

128
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,917
I assure you, I've considered
all possibilities.

129
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,253
This is the only way.

130
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,338
There's more to getting
through the nebula

131
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,298
than monitoring the crew.

132
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,592
Who would regulate ship systems,
make course adjustments?

133
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,054
I think I've demonstrated
that I have a command

134
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,223
of the rudimentary aspects
of piloting.

135
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,142
Of course you have,
and I know that you could do it,

136
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,476
but you'll need backup.

137
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,229
We have no idea what

138
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,898
effect the nebula radiation
might have on your holo-matrix.

139
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,316
What if you went off-line?

140
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,027
There was only one
crew member besides myself

141
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,238
that seemed unaffected
by the nebula.

142
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,907
JANEWAY:
I want you to understand
the seriousness

143
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,826
of this responsibility.

144
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,704
The lives of the entire crew
will be on your shoulders.

145
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,332
You doubt my ability
to fulfill this task.

146
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,666
Ordinarily, not at all,

147
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,919
but this is
an unusual situation.

148
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,424
After being in the collective...

149
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,886
...it wasn't easy for you
to adjust to a ship

150
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,056
with only 150 people on it,
was it, Seven?

151
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,349
How would you feel

152
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,643
with only the doctor
for company?

153
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,519
I will adapt.

154
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,772
Most humans don't react
particularly well

155
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,941
to long periods
of isolation.

156
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,610
Borg drones have
even more difficulty.

157
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,530
As you pointed out,
I am neither human nor Borg.

158
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,702
I can do this, Captain.

159
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,498
All right.

160
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,541
I'll work with
my senior staff

161
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,919
to draw up a list of duties,
but let me make it clear.

162
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,712
The doctor will be
in command.

163
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,381
You will follow
his instructions

164
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,049
just as you would
follow mine.

165
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,051
Follow the orders
of a hologram.

166
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,095
He's our Chief Medical Officer,

167
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,889
and he is thoroughly grounded
in Starfleet protocols.

168
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,891
You will report to him.

169
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,561
I understand.

170
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,859
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

171
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,781
The doctor's preparing
the stasis units now.

172
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,201
They should be ready
by 1700 hours.

173
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,452
And...

174
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,454
how long
will this be for?

175
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,165
We don't know for certain.
At least a month,

176
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,584
maybe longer if the nebula
is larger than we estimate.

177
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,753
I've never been
in long-term stasis.

178
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,464
Are there
any side effects?

179
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,008
The doctor assures me
it'll be just like taking a nap.

180
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,426
We'll go into the units,

181
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,553
our cardiopulmonary systems
will be slowed,

182
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,639
neural activity suspended,
and we'll wake up feeling

183
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,141
as though we'd had
a good night's sleep.

184
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,893
There are things
that can go wrong.

185
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,269
At least,
that's what I've read.

186
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,521
JANEWAY:
We will be carefully

187
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,814
monitored by Seven
and the doctor,

188
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,691
who will check our vital signs
four times a day

189
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,318
and take care of any
other problems.

190
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,861
( nervous laugh )

191
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:34,199
I assume that we've explored
all the alternatives.

192
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,910
I think we're all feeling
uneasy about this,

193
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,913
and I'd be lying if I said
I don't have concerns myself,

194
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,873
and I think it's about
loss of control.

195
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,543
We always feel better
if we think we're in charge

196
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,294
of our own circumstances.

197
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,172
In stasis,
we're giving up that control,

198
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,050
and no Starfleet officer
likes to do that.

199
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,762
But crews have been in stasis
much longer than a month.

200
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,472
I think we can handle this.

201
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,681
All right?

202
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,767
You're free
until 1700 hours.

203
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,185
I'll make a shipwide
announcement

204
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,854
when the doctor's ready.
Dismissed.

205
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,942
( door opens )

206
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,569
Something else?

207
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,070
( door closes )

208
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,239
I want you to tell me
that this isn't a mistake.

209
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,157
Your turn to get
reassurance?

210
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,576
Maybe.

211
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,453
But my concern
isn't about going into stasis.

212
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,788
It's about who you're
leaving in charge.

213
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,582
You're worried about Seven.

214
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,751
Maybe you need to step outside
yourself for a minute.

215
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,253
Look at the fact
that here's someone

216
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,421
who's butted horns with you

217
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,089
from the moment
she came on board...

218
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,883
who disregards authority
and actively disobeys orders

219
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,385
when she doesn't agree
with them.

220
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,387
And this is the person
I'm giving responsibility

221
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,889
for the lives of
this entire crew.

222
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,016
I suppose you want me
to tell you I'm not crazy.

223
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,436
In a nutshell.

224
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,728
( sighs )

225
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,064
I know your bond
with Seven is unique,

226
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,690
different from everyone else's.

227
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,152
From the beginning,
you've seen things in her

228
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,403
that no one else could.

229
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,489
But maybe you
could help me understand

230
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,532
some of those things.
I don't know if I can.

231
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,908
It's just instinct.

232
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,785
There's something
inside me that says

233
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,412
she can be redeemed.

234
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,500
In spite of her
insolent attitude,

235
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,211
I honestly believe she
wants to do well by us.

236
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,590
( sighs )

237
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,342
That's good enough for me.

238
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,303

If I have to take
a nap for a month,

242
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,481
I really would rather do it
in my quarters.

243
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,108
Everyone's being relocated
here to Deck 14,

244
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,860
so we can monitor you
more easily.

245
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,778
Hop in.

00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,948
Come on, Tom.
Sleepy time.

What if we...

00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,243
had to get out in a hurry?

249
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,954
You can unlock the unit
from inside, Tom.

Do I detect a hint

You'll go to sleep,

260
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,688
I'll be standing over you,

we're through the nebula.

Apparently, he's more
claustrophobic than I thought.

288
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,712
But he doesn't seem to have
suffered any ill effects.

Is this likely
to happen again?

It's not unheard of
for people to come

out of stasis
and start wandering.

292

Leave it to
Mr. Paris to be

00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,471

as when he's awake.

you'd realize
I was making a small joke.

Very small.

299
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,982

This isn't frivolous.
It's essential.

So have you.

I'm here.

317
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,440
This isn't a suggestion,
and it's not a request.

Oh, thank you.

Join the party, Seven.

327
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,926
It's no fun to stand
there by yourself.

328
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,344
I have no desire
to have fun.

329
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,555
No?
I'm attempting to recalibrate

330

00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:21,564
I understand you have some
knowledge of warp field theory.

Perhaps you could assist me.

333
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,571
I'd be happy
to give it a try.

334
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,281
Let's see...

335
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,451
the subspace field matrix
looks right...

336
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,702
Captain?

337
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,203
Excuse me a minute.

338
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,080
Perhaps you could help,
as well.

339
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,666
We're attempting
to find

340
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,709
a stronger warp field
calibration.

341
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,210
How interesting.

342
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,255
Maybe if we vary
the EM stress parameters,

343
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,715
the warp field

344
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,091
dynamic would increase.

345
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,927
Excellent idea, Captain.

346
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,179
And if the warp coils
were re-phased,

347
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,807
it would increase power
to the nacelles.

348
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,183
There is an
additional problem.

349
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,559
We must compensate

350
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,937
for a subspace induction
drag on the engines.

351
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,147
Pardon me, Captain,
Mr. Neelix.

of conversation.

00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,081
You know very well
what purpose

360
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,667
this program is
supposed to serve.

361
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,794
I find that it serves
no purpose whatsoever.

362
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,754
Because you're being
intentionally perverse.

363
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,548
Holodecks are
a pointless endeavor,

364
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,758
fulfilling some human need
to fantasize.

365
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,176
I have no such need.

366
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,261
What you need is
some editorial skill

367
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,889
in your self-expression.

368
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,725

there is a realm of good taste

370
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,145
I find your
self-expression ponderous.

371

And I can't put up with this

Unfortunately,
you have to report to me

informed about the crew.

376
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,823

A cascade effect

The warp field coils

384
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,555
primary deuterium tank

385
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,390
and the plasma conduits
are ready to breach.

386
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,641
This is awful.

387
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,435
We have to eject
the antimatter tanks.

388
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,270
We've got to coordinate
the effort.

389
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,689
You go to Engineering.
I'll go to the Bridge.

390

391
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,742
Yes, doctor.
<i>It's worse than we thought.</i>

392
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,160
Engineering is flooded with
plasma. You'll never get in.

393
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,455
I believe I can survive long
enough to eject the assembly.

Seven! There's been another
plasma discharge in Engineering!

400
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,385
The hull is breaching.
Get out!

403
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,436
It's all right, doctor.

404
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,730
False alarm.

(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

406
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,115
DOCTOR:
Look here.

407
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,033
I think I've found
the problem.

408
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,787
There are malfunctions
in a number of neural gel packs.

409
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,456
As a result, false readings
were fed to the sensors,

410
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,625
which detected an emergency
when there was none.

411
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,461
We must repair them.

412
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,797
They seem to be
in sequence six-theta-nine.

413
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,508
We'll need replacement packs
and a repair--

414
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,843
Repair kit.

415
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,804
( door opens )

416
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,639
These tubes certainly
weren't designed

417
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,058
with creature comfort
in mind.

418
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,602
It seems to me the shipbuilders
should've created a space

419
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,979
in which one
could walk upright.

420
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,355
But they did not.

421
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,024
It doesn't help to
complain about it now.

422
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,067
I'll complain if I want to.

423
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,443
It's comforting.

424
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,945
We can access sequence

425
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,489

from this junction.

427
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,333
Odd.

428
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,085
I've never seen this kind
of neural activity

429
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,963
in the gel packs.
In what sense?

430
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,215
The neurodes are discharging
in random bursts.

431
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,760
I would imagine the nebular
activity is causing it.

432
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,637
I'll take this back
to Sickbay for further study.

433
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,681
I will reroute
the command processors

434
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,683

( sighs )

436
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,645
This journey certainly
hasn't lacked excitement.

437
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,647
I can't complain
about being bored.

438
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,274
Since you find it comforting,
you'll undoubtedly

439
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,985
find something else
to complain about.

440
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,112
No doubt.

441
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,697
You really should try it.

442
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,282

I am hurrying.

447
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,375
If the mobile emitter goes
off-line while I'm out of

448
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,002
Sickbay, my program
may be irretrievable!

449
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,587
Don't panic.
It's counterproductive.

450
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,380
That's easy for you to say.
You're not facing

It's worthless.

it now. I'm stuck here.

00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,495
How did you get it?

537
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,455
It was my Borg
designation.

538
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,581
Borg?

539
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,876
Never heard of them.

540
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,585
Are you alone

541
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,129
on this ship?

542
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,756
No. The entire crew
is here in stasis

543
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,633
and our doctor is in Sickbay.

544
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,802
I'm both pilot
and crew on my ship.

545
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,680
Fortunately,
I happen to be resistant

546
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,765
to the effects
of the nebula.

547
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,934
What about your technology?

548
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,937
The radiation is causing
damage to ours.

549
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:08,025
I've had to rebuild
my engines twice already.

550
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,444
If you've been in
the nebula for three weeks,

551
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,071
you're doing well.

552
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,281
I am hopeful
our propulsion system

553
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,450
will remain operational
for the next six days.

554
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,868
I'll admit I was surprised

555
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,996
to find another ship
headed toward me.

556
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,581
No one has ever managed
to cross the nebula.

557
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,251
If it weren't necessary,

558
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,668
we wouldn't be
attempting it.

559
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,170
I'm here by choice.

560
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,796
I'm determined
to be the first

561
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,131
to get through.

562
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,009
I've tried five times
before and failed,

563
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,304
but this time
I'm sure I'll make it.

564
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,390
I want to see
what's on the other side.

565
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,100
It is nothing remarkable.

566
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,894
But I'll be the first
of my kind to see it.

567
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,772
Tell me,
how are you handling

568
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,399
the loneliness?

569
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,318
What do you mean?

570
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,070
You know what I mean.

571
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,197
No matter what you say...

572
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,325
you're all alone here.

573
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,501
The microfusion chamber
you requested.

574
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,670
I've heard the drones
can't stand being alone.

575
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,756
They're too used
to the collective.

576
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,674
How could you know that?

577
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,843
It's true, isn't it?

578
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,305
You said you'd never
heard of the Borg.

579
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,933
Don't be offended.
I've no grudge with them.

580
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,812
You have what you
asked for, now leave.

581
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:30,357
I thought we could keep
each other company for awhile,

582
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,942
maybe have
something to eat.

583
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,277
No.

584
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,821
And if I want to stay longer?

585
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,908
You will not
be accommodated.

There's no need for this,
you know.

588
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,461
I mean you no harm.

589
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,921
I think maybe you're
a little paranoid.

590
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,549
That's what loneliness
can do to you.

591
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,802
You'd be a lot better off
to spend some time with me.

592
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,554
We could get to know
each other.

710
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,737
But your days
of power are gone.

711
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,155
You're all alone now...

712
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,075
weak, pathetic.

713
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,036
Don't come any closer.
I'll kill you.

714
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,245
Seven?

715
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,830
Be careful, doctor!
He's dangerous!

716
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,293
Who are you talking to?

717
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,257
Where did he go?

718
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,592
There's no one else here.

719
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,260
He was.
He was right here.

720
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,636
Seven...

721
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,179
you're hallucinating.

722
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,556
No, I saw him!

723
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:03,101
There was no one else
in this room.

724
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,436
( sighs )

725
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,731
You mean I imagined him.

726
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,357
Yes.

727
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,902
I heard Lieutenant Paris
call for help.

728
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,987
I saw him and the others.

729
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,033
Did I imagine them, as well?

730
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,534
I believe so.

731
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,119
When I studied the gel pack,

732
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,539
I discovered the radiation
was producing a degradation

733
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,958
in the synaptic relays.

734
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,834
I'm guessing there's been
a similar effect

735
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,753
on your Borg implants.

736
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,296
The radiation

737
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,339
could be altering
the neurotransmitter levels

738
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,926
in your sensory nodes.

739
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,929
That would explain why
you're hearing voices...

740
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,513
seeing images.

741
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,140
But they seemed real.

742
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,559
Hallucinations
usually are.

743
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,394
That's what makes them
so frightening.

744
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,820
Once, when I was a drone...

745
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,323
I was separated from
the collective for two hours.

746
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,410
I experienced panic...

747
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,162
and apprehension.

748
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,793
I am feeling that way now.

749
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,796
I'll do everything
I can to help you.

750
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,297
We'll get you to Sickbay.

751
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,258
An anti-psychotic may help,
at least until I determine

752
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,136
just what neural functions
are being affected.

753
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,013

It was a foolish decision.

788

Now you are alone.

You have lost the many.

You have become human, weak,

795
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,127
No.

You cannot survive

By becoming weaker,

less perfect.

799
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,759

One. One alone.

801
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,304
A Borg cannot be one.

802
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,014
I will become stronger.

803
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,515
A Borg cannot be one.

804
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,767

One Borg cannot survive.

808
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,984
I am an individual.

809
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,443
I will survive alone.

810
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,904
No. You are weak.

811
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,623

You don't even have to ask.

820

All you have to do
is make a choice.

821
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,606

889
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,423
They won't last that long.

890
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,716
What do you do now,
Seven?

891
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,218
It's all up to you.

892
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,765
Computer, cut life support
to all decks

893
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,185
and reroute available power
to the stasis units.

894
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,980
That will keep them alive,
but what about you?

895
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,898
No oxygen,

896
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,360
no heat.

897
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,071
Goodbye, Seven.

898
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,537
( panting )

899
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,789
I am Seven of Nine.

900
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,211
I am alone...

901
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,254
but I will adapt.

902
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,259
I will...

903
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,939
She's coming to.

904
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,236
DOCTOR:
Not so fast.

905
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,405
Get your bearings
first.

906
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,613
The crew?

907
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,199
We came through
the nebula

908
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,950
in fine shape,
thanks to you.

909
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,577
You were the one
we almost lost.

910
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,204
When the ship
cleared the nebula,

911
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,831
the doctor came back on line
and found you unconscious.

912
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,459
He reinitiated life support
and woke the crew.

913
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,753
He tells us you've had
quite an adventure.

914
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,463
It was...

915
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,966
...interesting.

916
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,429
Well, when you're rested,
I'd like to hear about it.

917
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,310
I'm proud of you,
Seven.

918
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,896
You performed admirably.

919
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,982
I am glad
I was able to help.

920
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,698
KIM:
Neelix, this soup is great.

921
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,866
What is it?

922
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,452
It's my
secret recipe.

923
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:41,786
I've never told anyone
what's in it.

924
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,580
PARIS:
Why does that make me nervous?

925
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,706
Oh, come on, Tom.
Where's your sense of adventure?

926
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,041
PARIS:
Not in my stomach.

927
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,626
Food and mystery
don't go together.

928
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,919
I like to know
what I'm eating.

929
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,421
Coward.

930
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,590
Lieutenants Paris and Torres,
Ensign Kim.

931
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:56,634
Seven. I'm surprised
to see you here.

932
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,178
May I join you?

933
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:01,473
Sure. Have a seat.

934
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,015
Have some soup.

935
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,309
It's actually edible.

936
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:08,020
I don't require nourishment
at this time.

937
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,189
I...

938
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,109
felt the need
for companionship.

939
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,195
Well, after a month

940
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,905
with only the doc
for company,

941
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,115
I can understand it.

942
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:22,285
Yeah. Uh, what was
that like, anyway?

943
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,702
Just the two of you?

944
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,205
The doctor was very helpful.
I cannot fault him.

945
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,415
Well, we owe you one.

946
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,749
PARIS:
Yeah.

947
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,460
Just think,

948
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,629
we could've died
in those coffins.

949
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:35,465
SEVEN:
I suspect you would've found a
way out before that, Lieutenant.

950
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:36,841
What do you mean?

951
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,968
Lieutenant Paris refused
to stay confined.

952
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,638
On four separate occasions,
the doctor and I

953
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:43,764
had to put him back
into his stasis unit.

954
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,643
Were you, um, locked
in dark closets

955
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,561
or something as a child?

956
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,356
I just don't like
closed places.

957
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,649
I never have.

958
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:53,899
I don't know why.

959
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:58,446
Perhaps you dislike
being alone.

960
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,323
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

961
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,374
