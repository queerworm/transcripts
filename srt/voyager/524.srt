1
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,070
You're late.
Sorry, sir.

2
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,573
What's the threshold
of the H2 molecule?

3
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,575
14.7 electron volts.

4
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,827
Third brightest
star in Orion?

5
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,371
Viewed from where?
Earth.

6
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,956
Gamma Orionis,

7
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,667
or Bellatrix if you prefer
the original Arabic name.

8
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,335
Not bad.

9
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,879
Now, give me a hug, Katie.

10
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,087
That's an order.

11
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,674
I wasn't expecting a pop quiz.

12
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,384
Just wanted to make
sure all those pips

13
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,093
haven't made you forget
you're a scientist first.

14
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,013
How could they?

15
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,348
I still have nightmares about
your fractal calculus final.

16
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,683
(<i> chuckles</i> )

17
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,727
There's still some work
to be done,

18
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,271
but once the sawdust clears,
I think you'll be impressed.

19
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,606
<i>Voyager</i> may not be

20
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,650
as big as a
Galaxy-class ship,

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,318
but she's
quick and smart--

22
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,820
Like her Captain.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,572
700,000 metric tons,

24
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,657
15 decks,
computer systems

25
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,159
augmented with
bio-neural circuitry.

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,870
Top cruising speed--
Warp 9.975.

27
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,496
Deck 1.

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,374
Of course, I expect to get
that up another notch or two.

29
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,793
Sounds like you already know
your ship pretty well.

30
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,503
I've been buried in
<i>Voyager's</i> schematics

31
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,922
for the past three months.

32
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,591
I could walk the corridors
blindfolded.

33
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,261
You might not want
to shut your eyes just yet.

34
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,138
Captain on the Bridge.

35
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,349
As you were.

36
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,812
It's bigger
than I expected.

37
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,566
Schematics never fully prepare
you for the real thing.

38
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,990
Try it on.

39
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,832
Don't get
too comfortable.

40
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,418
I have more to show you.

41
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,097
Your home away from home.

42
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,347
Coffee?

43
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,516
Oh, no, thanks.

44
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,685
Coffee. Black.

45
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,523
Any word from Tuvok?

46
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,275
Not yet.

47
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,277
Shouldn't he have
made contact by now?

48
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,279
We know he's aboard
Chakotay's ship.

49
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,697
He's probably decided

50
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,407
not to risk exposure
until he has to.

51
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,534
Catching up with him
in the Badlands

52
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,911
is going to be tricky,

53
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,204
even in a ship as quick
and smart as<i> Voyager.</i>

54
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,291
I've heard about a pilot
who might make the job easier.

55
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,502
Who's that?

56
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,545
Tom Paris.

57
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,714
Admiral Paris's son?

58
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,215
Correct me

59
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,426
if I'm wrong, but he's
serving a sentence for...

60
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,428
He's made some mistakes.

61
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,475
But everybody deserves
a second chance.

62
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,603
I'll look into it.

63
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,691
If it's not too late,

64
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,985
I'd like to recalibrate
the navigational sensors.

65
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,528
I think I can
enhance the range.

66
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,863
Your coffee's
not even cold,

67
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,739
you're already
making changes.

68
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,074
Excuse us, Ensign.

69
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,618
I like a ship that knows
where it's going.

70
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,997
I assure you,<i> Voyager</i> has
the best sensors in the fleet.

71
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,041
There's always room
for improvement.

72
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,984
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

73
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,205
The Bridge is clear.
There's no sign of the weapon.

74
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,498
MALE:
<i>Continue scanning.</i>

75
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,000
Acknowledged.

76
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,046
Your briefing room.

77
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,673
Starfleet's

78
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,009
most up-to-date vessel
and they still can't design

79
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,136
a comfortable place
to hold a meeting.

80
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,720
What do you
think, Ensign?

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,306
Captain?

82
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,933
What's your opinion
of this room?

83
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,728
It is an efficient design.

84
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,606
Well, there you
have it, Admiral.

85
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,318
It's efficient.
I must be wrong.

86
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,610
Carry on.

87
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,914
We've added
a new system

88
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,625
we're thinking of installing
throughout the fleet.

89
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,294
The Emergency
Medical Hologram.

90
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,130
I'm up-to-date.
Computer, activate EMH.

91
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,923
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

92
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,424
It's programmed

93
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,552
with over four million
surgical procedures.

94
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,013
Five million and
the medical knowledge

95
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,430
of over 3,000 cultures.

96
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,932
Impressive.

97
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,100
Did you call me to chitchat

98
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,810
or is there
an actual emergency?

99
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,394
His personality
could use some work.

100
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,688
I'm designed
to practice

101
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,690
medicine as efficiently
as possible.

102
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,109
Small talk only compromises
my performance.

103
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,361
Thank you, Doctor.

104
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,029
Computer, deactivate EMH.

105
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,368
Thank you.

106
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,880
Hello.

107
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,090
Sir.

108
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,674
Lieutenant Carey.

109
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,219
I don't think
we've met.

110
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,678
Jameson, Anna.

111
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,680
Service number 860790.

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,015
I'm not security.

113
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,434
I'm just... trying
to get to know

114
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,895
all the new faces
around here.

115
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,981
What are you working on?

116
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,944
I am attempting to realign
the EPS manifolds.

117
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,486
Do you need a hand?

118
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,905
No.

119
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,782
Well, maybe I'll see you
in the Mess Hall later.

120
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,033
Unlikely.

121
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,368
Hmm?

122
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,245
I am not a member
of<i> Voyager's</i> crew.

123
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,663
I'm on assignment here
at Utopia Planitia.

124
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,998
Too bad.

125
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,043
Well... next time
I'm in the neighborhood,

126
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,129
I'll drop by and say hello.

127
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,315
I wish Starfleet would give me
more than three weeks.

128
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,523
With a little more time,

129
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,984
we could really
explore the Badlands.

130
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,568
You haven't
changed a bit.

131
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,655
Main Engineering.

132
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,825
Class-9 warp drive,
tricyclic

133
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,285
input manifold.

134
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,248
You'll be the first to
test it in deep space.

135
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,765
I've localized
the temporal distortions--

136
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,767
Deck 4, Section 39.

137
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,045
I've found the weapon.

138
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,629
MALE:
<i>Begin the procedure.</i>

139
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,847
(<i> console beeping</i> )

140
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,977
Problem?

141
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,897
One of the EPS relays
just went off-line.

142
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,899
<i>Voyager's</i> first malfunction.

143
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,192
I'm sorry, Captain.

144
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,403
I tested those systems
this morning.

145
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,987
As you were, Lieutenant.

146
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,323
I've been looking forward
to getting my hands dirty.

147
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,200
Hmm.

148
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,252
The weapon is out of phase.

149
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,628
You've sent me
to the wrong time frame.

150
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,382
MALE:
<i>At least we know</i>
<i>where the weapon was placed.</i>

151
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,342
<i>Now we have to determine when.</i>

152
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,306
This hatch is locked
from the inside.

153
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,599
This isn't
a secure area.

154
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,518
None of these hatches
should be sealed.

155
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,271
I'm reading some kind
of chroniton flux.

156
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,772
Chronitons?

157
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,567
It's coming from inside
this Jefferies tube.

158
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,903
Patterson to Security.
Seal off Deck 4.

159
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,322
(<i> beeping</i> )

160
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,074
I've been detected.
I must leave.

161
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,410
<i>There's too much interference</i>
<i>from the weapon.</i>

162
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,328
<i>Recalibrate</i>
<i>your temporal transport beacon.</i>

163
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,662
Understood.

164
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,291
We can access Section 39
through here.

165
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,799
MALE 2:
<i>Scramble the locking mechanism</i>
<i>before they get in.</i>

166
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,926
<i>Hurry. They're approaching</i>
<i>your coordinates.</i>

167
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,095
<i>You'll need to reset</i>
<i>the command controls.</i>

168
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,973
MALE:
<i>Stand by. We're trying</i>
<i>to get you out of there.</i>

169
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,617
MALE 2:
It's time.

170
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,160
Pull her out.

171
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,120
There's too much interference.
If I transport her now,

172
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,788
we'll damage
her bionetic implants.

173
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,457
If we don't, Captain
Janeway's going
to find her.

174
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,791
It'll contaminate
the timeline.

175
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,168
Sir...
Now.

176
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,922
MALE:
Temporal transport in progress.

177
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,939
Question, Admiral.

178
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,860
What causes
a chroniton flux of .003?

179
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,987
I don't know.

180
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:41,284
Neither do I, but whoever
or whatever it was...

181
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,078
it's gone now.

182
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,585
MALE:
The subject is approaching
the temporal threshold.

183
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,853
I told you
this was going to happen.

184
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,397
She's dead.

185
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,913
Any luck reviving her?

186
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,122
No, sir.

187
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,790
We'll have to
recruit her again.

188
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,627
Sir, a fourth jump,
she could suffer neural damage--

189
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,212
Even temporal
psychosis.

190
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,297
Unless we repair the timeline,
she's going to die.

191
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,259
We're giving her another chance
to save her crew and herself.

192
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,177
We'll go back
and retrieve Seven of Nine

193
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,929
a microsecond
before the explosion.

194
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,098
That way no one will
notice she's gone.

195
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,434
Tempus fugit, Lieutenant.

196
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,768
Raise shields.

197
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:55,983
Time frame-- Stardate 52861.274.
Delta Quadrant.

198
00:12:55,983 --> 00:13:01,322
Spatial coordinates--
87-Theta by 271.

199
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,992
Target-- USS<i> Voyager.</i>

200
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,249
Follow the light

201
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,627
to the left,

202
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,670
right,

203
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,423
and up,

204
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,758
and down.

205
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,345
Hmm.

206
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,184
I ran
a complete self-diagnostic.

207
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,728
Mm-hmm?

208
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,021
At first, I thought
my ocular implants

209
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,189
were malfunctioning.

210
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,650
However, after
consulting

211
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,234
the Starfleet
medical database,

212
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,819
I realize it's a flaw
in my human physiology.

213
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,281
Specifically?

214
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,907
I'm experiencing
dizziness, double vision.

215
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,409
After considering

216
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,077
all potential environmental
and genetic factors,

217
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,870
I've concluded
that I am suffering

218
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,665
from Albright-Salzman syndrome.

219
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,625
A rare neurological condition

220
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,336
that hasn't affected
a single human being

221
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,629
for over two centuries.

222
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,255
Unlikely.

223
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,132
Human physiology is imperfect--

224
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,677
Susceptible
to a variety of disorders.

225
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,386
True, but in this instance,

226
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,305
we can safely say
you're suffering

227
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,390
from a mild case
of sensory aphasia...

228
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,268
a minor disruption
to your neuro-receptors.

229
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,103
Neither rare,
nor life-threatening.

230
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,732
Apparently I was in need
of a second opinion.

231
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,234
That's the danger
of self-diagnosis--

232
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,529
Patients always
assume the worst.

233
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,071
This should clear it up.

234
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,830
How do things look now?

235
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,414
Normal.

236
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,958
<i>Doctor,</i>
<i>please report to Sick Bay.</i>

237
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,251
On my way.

238
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,337
Next time your human
physiology fails you,

239
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,755
don't consult the database.

240
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,423
Just call me.

241
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,509
You are the database.

242
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,887
With two legs
and a splendid bedside manner.

243
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,773
A curious exercise.

244
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,525
Yeah, Ping-Pong.

245
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,860
You should try it.

246
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,654
It's a great test
of hand-eye coordination.

247
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,113
I don't require testing.

248
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,824
Yeah, so the Doc
tells me--

249
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,244
A visual acuity
index of 99.6.

250
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,955
You know, you'd be
great at this game.

251
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,249
Why don't you
be my partner

252
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,584
in the doubles
tournament tonight?

253
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,210
Chapman was supposed
to play,

254
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,588
but he's come down with
a nasty case of space sickness.

255
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,922
I'm busy.

256
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,173
Oh.

257
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,466
Too bad.

258
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,093
Well, I guess I'll have
to tell B'Elanna

259
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,803
that you thought
you couldn't beat her.

260
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,598
You're attempting to
appeal to my vanity.

261
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,224
Is it working?

262
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,518
I will consider
your request.

263
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,605
It's yes or no, Seven--
The tournament's tonight.

264
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,400
Yes.

265
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,610
Great.

266
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,403
Meet me in the Mess Hall
at 1900 hours.

267
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,864
We'll get in a little
practice first.

268
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,872
Captain, you don't
look well.

269
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,331
Come in, please.

270
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,750
I'm sure it's
nothing serious.

271
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,959
Symptoms?

272
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,002
Nausea, dizziness.

273
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,589
It looks like a simple case
of space sickness--

274
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,006
The third one
I've treated today.

275
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,634
That's odd.
We haven't run

276
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,885
into any turbulence.

277
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,219
It's possible
the inertial dampers

278
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,721
are out of alignment.

279
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,473
Even so, I've been
on some pretty rough rides.

280
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,600
It's never affected me
like this.

281
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,059
It happens
to everyone.

282
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,312
20 milligrams
of inaprovaline

283
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,105
should restore
your space legs.

284
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,440
I'll check the dampers.

285
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,733
Double-check your bio-readings.

286
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,944
See if there's
another explanation.

287
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,988
(<i> groans</i> )

288
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,582
Point, server.

289
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,960
It's all in the wrist.

290
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,377
Score?

291
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,379
19-18.

292
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,851
Say good night, Harry.

293
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,273
What do you call
that shot?

294
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,277
I'm reading
temporal distortions.

295
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,632
Report.
The temporal distortions

296
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,217
are fracturing space-time
throughout the ship.

297
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,427
Cause?
Unknown.

298
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,680
They appear to be emanating
from Deck 4, Section 39.

299
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,390
We've already
erected force fields,

300
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,058
but they're not
having much effect.

301
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,977
If we can't find
a way to stop them,

302
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,729
they'll tear
the ship apart.

303
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,897
How much time do we have?

304
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,565
Two hours,
at most.

305
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,734
Go to Deck 4 and find out
what we're dealing with.

306
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,570
Let's see if we can find a way
to enhance the force fields.

307
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,536
An injection a day keeps
space sickness away.

308
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:02,081
You try to be funny
after treating 37
cases of nausea.

309
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,917
<i>Janeway to Sick Bay.</i> 
Go ahead.

310
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,626
<i>We've found the source</i>
<i>of our epidemic--</i>

311
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,127
<i>Temporal distortions.</i>

312
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,672
I was beginning to suspect
some kind of anomaly.

313
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,090
I've designed a treatment

314
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,717
that seems to be inhibiting
the symptoms.

315
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,343
<i>Keep me posted.</i> 
Aye, Captain.

316
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,054
NEELIX:
<i>Neelix to the Doctor.</i>

317
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,638
<i>I've got a medical emergency</i>
<i>in the Mess Hall.</i>

318
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,058
<i>Ensign Mannus</i>
<i>is violently ill.</i>

319
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,350
On my way.

320
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,685
Take over here.

321
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,692
Doctor, shall I whip you
up a photonic snack?

322
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,193
Where's the medical emergency?

323
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,153
I hope you're not referring
to this pot roast.

324
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,655
You called me
a few minutes ago.

325
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,449
You said Ensign Mannus
was ill.

326
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,867
I did?
Yes.

327
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,452
Ensign Mannus is
right over there.

328
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,828
He came in
an hour ago.

329
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,830
He looks
perfectly norm...

330
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,090
Acute space sickness.

331
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,633
Good thing
you were here.

332
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,594
I wouldn't have been,
if you hadn't...

333
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,554
Temporal distortions.

334
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,764
Doctor?

335
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,183
This is all starting
to make sense.

336
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,313
In Sick Bay, it's
1500 hours, 43 minutes,

337
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,525
but in the Mess Hall,
it's 1536.

338
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,778
Seven minutes earlier.

339
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,195
I did get a
call from you.

340
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,031
You just haven't
made it yet.

341
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,202
Coffee, black.

342
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,123
(<i> door chimes</i> )

343
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,373
Come in.

344
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,501
Before you say anything,

345
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,544
let me remind you what happens
to bearers of bad news.

346
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,254
Don't kill the messenger.

347
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,923
Go ahead, fire.

348
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,842
It looks like these space-time
fractures are growing stronger.

349
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,844
We're detecting temporal
paradoxes throughout the ship.

350
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,137
Paradoxes?

351
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,639
Internal chronometers show

352
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,851
it's 0600 on Deck 9
and 0605 on Deck 13.

353
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,854
Time's passing more quickly
in some parts of the ship

354
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,105
and slowing down in others.

355
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,940
Maybe that explains
why this coffee

356
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,525
tastes like it's
three days old.

357
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,694
The same thing's been
happening in the Mess Hall.

358
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,071
Food replicated less than an
hour ago is already spoiled.

359
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,866
I've been working on a way to
enhance our containment fields

360
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,534
to keep the fractures
from spreading.

361
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,328
I'll get a team on it
right away.

362
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,830
In the meantime,
we should evacuate

363
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,165
the affected areas.

364
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,415
See to it.

365
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,834
There's one other problem.

366
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,418
Turbolifts...Turbolifts...
2 and 3...

367
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,171
2 and 3 are off-line...
are off-line... so we've

368
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,964
been using... so we've been
using... the Jefferies tube.

369
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,632
...using
the Jefferies tube.

370
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,682
Captain?

371
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,893
There's a temporal distortion
intersecting this room.

372
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,227
It's expanding.

373
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,437
Time to test your
new containment fields.

374
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,609
This is where
they're coming from.

375
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,197
I still can't tell
what's causing them.

376
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,997
What is it?

377
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,749
A piece of technology.

378
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,292
It's emitting
temporal distortions.

379
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,128
Why can't I see it?

380
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,422
My ocular implant
can detect

381
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,716
irregularities
in space-time.

382
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,967
Torres to Bridge.

383
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,677
We've found the problem.

384
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,805
<i>There's some kind of device</i>
<i>in Junction Beta-28.</i>

385
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,348
Beam it off the ship.

386
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,935
I can't get a lock.

387
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,939
The distortions are beginning
to demolecularize the hull.

388
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,858
Hull breach--
Ventral Section 14.

389
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:21,530
(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

390
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,535
Captain, I'm picking up
a strange reading on Deck 4.

391
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,037
What kind of reading?

392
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,455
It's a chroniton flux--
.003.

393
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,373
CHAKOTAY:
More distortions?

394
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,333
I don't think so.

395
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,839
Dry dock.

396
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,549
Ma'am?

397
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,676
The first time
I saw these readings was...

398
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,344
five years ago?

399
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,055
<i>Voyager</i> was still
in dry dock.

400
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,723
Same readings,
same location.

401
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,183
What caused them?

402
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,019
I never found out.

403
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,149
We're losing
structural integrity.

404
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,067
Multiple breaches-- All decks.

405
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,111
Emergency systems are failing.

406
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,863
The distortions
are ripping us apart.

407
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,698
We have to abandon ship.

408
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,287
All hands, this is the Captain.

409
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,081
Proceed to the escape pods
and abandon ship.

410
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,583
Repeat: Abandon ship.

411
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,004
<i>Program the pods for a heading</i>
<i>of 178 mark 4.</i>

412
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,714
<i>We'll rendezvous in orbit</i>
<i>of an M-Class planet</i>

413
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,049
<i>at those coordinates.</i>

414
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,384
<i>Repeat: All hands,</i>

415
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,929
<i>proceed to the escape pods</i>
<i>and abandon ship.</i>

416
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,145
Identify yourselves.

417
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,688
No time.

418
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,074
(<i> sighs</i> )

419
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,219
Welcome back.

420
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,803
Why have you
brought me here?

421
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,848
For some reason, I always
think you'll remember.

422
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,308
I'm Captain Braxton.

423
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,893
This is
Lieutenant Ducane.

424
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,687
You're aboard the Federation
Timeship<i> Relativity.</i>

425
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,981
I'm no longer in
the 24th century.

426
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,440
No.

427
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,609
For you, it's almost
500 years later.

428
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,904
We've brought you here
to help us solve a mystery.

429
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,239
Someone--
We don't know who--

430
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,282
Has planted a weapon
aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

431
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,659
It's designed
to fracture space-time

432
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,912
within a radius of 150 meters.

433
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,412
Why do you need me?

434
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,789
Your ocular implant.

435
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,833
It can detect disruptions
in space-time

436
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,585
better than our sensors.

437
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,171
BRAXTON:
You're more familiar
with<i> Voyager</i> and her crew,

438
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,965
less likely to arouse suspicion.

439
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,096
So far you've been quite useful.
So far?

440
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,806
We've recruited you twice
before for this mission.

441
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,183
Take a look.

442
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,647
A force-3 temporal disrupter.

443
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,941
Your previous attempts

444
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,650
to disable it have
been unsuccessful.

445
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,361
DUCANE:
We're trying
to catch the saboteur

446
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,821
before he places the weapon
on<i> Voyager.</i>

447
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,073
Do you have a suspect?

448
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,283
Not yet.

449
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,492
Do you know
when the device was placed?

450
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:16,038
Not precisely, but we've
narrowed the window to a period

451
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,291
two years
before you joined the crew

452
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,751
when the ship was under attack.

453
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,544
Species 329-- The Kazon.

454
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,171
Our database indicates
that<i> Voyager</i>

455
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,132
was boarded twice
during that period.

456
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,674
The Kazon are
an inferior species.

457
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,343
They don't possess
the technology to create

458
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,844
such a complex weapon.

459
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,097
We believe the saboteur
infiltrated this time frame

460
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,015
because<i> Voyager's</i> shields
were down.

461
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,392
It was the perfect opportunity

462
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,228
to evade detection.

463
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,188
If I fail, you will
recruit me again.

464
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,316
If necessary.

465
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,067
But this will be
the third time

466
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,653
you're going to be removed
from your time frame.

467
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,156
If we do it a fourth,
there could be certain...

468
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,408
side effects.
Side effects.

469
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,411
You might experience
sensory aphasia.

470
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,079
It affects the cerebral cortex

471
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,539
and can lead
to temporal psychosis.

472
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,958
But in your case,

473
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,876
we're hoping third
time's a charm, eh?

474
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,337
I'll do my best.

475
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,921
Bring her up to date
on our protocols.

476
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,589
Aye, sir.

477
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,717
When you're finished here,
meet me in Holo-Matrix 1.

478
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,386
I've prepared
a simulation.

479
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,893
DUCANE:
Let's see how much
you've assimilated.

480
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,228
The Dali Paradox?

481
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,189
Also known as the
melting clock effect.

482
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,898
It refers to a
temporal fissure

483
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,860
which slows the passage
of time to a gradual halt.

484
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,153
The Pogo Paradox?

485
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,404
A causality loop

486
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,530
in which interference
to prevent an event

487
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,824
actually triggers
the same event.

488
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,242
Excellent.

489
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,952
Can you give me an example?

490
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,079
The Borg once
traveled back in time

491
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,373
to stop
Zephram Cochrane

492
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,957
from breaking
the warp barrier.

493
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,667
They succeeded,
but that, in turn,

494
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,961
led the Starship<i> Enterprise</i>
to intervene.

495
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,505
They assisted Cochrane

496
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,007
with the flight the Borg
were trying to prevent.

497
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,258
Causal loop complete.

498
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,219
So in a way,
the Federation owes

499
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,428
its existence to the Borg?

500
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,929
You're welcome.

501
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,973
The Seven of
Nine Paradox.

502
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,475
I beg your pardon?

503
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,852
How we do know that
my presence on<i> Voyager</i>

504
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,561
will not alter
the timeline?

505
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,065
You know, you've asked
me this every time?

506
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,649
What's been
your response?

507
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,069
That uncertainty is
part of the equation.

508
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,905
We don't know
what's going to happen.

509
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,074
I don't enjoy
uncertainty.

510
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,952
Neither do I, but I trust
Captain Braxton's instincts

511
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,415
just as you trust
Captain Janeway's.

512
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,999
BRAXTON:
This is a simulation

513
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,126
of Junction 49 on
<i>Voyager's</i> fourth deck.

514
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,255
Thanks to you, we've learned
that the temporal disrupter

515
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,964
was, and will be,
concealed here.

516
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,633
I gave up trying
to keep my tenses straight

517
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,094
years ago.

518
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,429
How will I disarm it?

519
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,014
You've already tried...
unsuccessfully.

520
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,058
The weapon's
out of phase.

521
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,060
You'll have to find
the saboteur

522
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,228
before he plants it.

523
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,439
This will detect
any chroniton flux

524
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,233
other than your own,
and I'm authorizing you

525
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,860
to use whatever force
may be necessary.

526
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,946
Understood.

527
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,116
One more thing-- Watch
out for the Janeway factor.

528
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,659
I am not familiar
with that protocol.

529
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,204
Your Captain has a knack
for sticking her nose

530
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,621
where it doesn't belong,

531
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,041
especially when it
comes to time travel.

532
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,960
Captain Janeway is
quite resourceful.

533
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,628
Has it occurred to you
that she may be helpful?

534
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,965
Helpful? That woman
has been responsible

535
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,592
for three major
temporal incursions.

536
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,135
No doubt creating
numerous paradoxes.

537
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,763
And who do you think
had to repair the damage? Me.

538
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,099
She's reckless;
she has no regard

539
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,184
for the integrity
of the timeline.

540
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,478
I asked for her help once.

541
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,480
She refused,
and I ended up stranded

542
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,939
in the late 20th century.

543
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,983
Have you ever been
to that time frame?

544
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,985
No.

545
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,736
Well, I don't recommend it.

546
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,198
After three decades with those
post-industrial barbarians,

547
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,784
I had to go through
extensive rehabilitation

548
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,495
before I could return to duty.

549
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,163
Avoid contact
with Janeway.

550
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,582
That's an order.

551
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,251
Yes... sir.

552
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,925
This will occlude
your Borg implants.

553
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,177
Ready?

554
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,428
Yes.

555
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,305
We have a saying
in our line of work:

556
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,307
"There's no time
like the past."

557
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,850
Raise shields.

558
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,480
Time frame-- Stardate
49123.5621. Delta Quadrant.

559
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,234
Spatial coordinates--
21 Alpha Prime by 936 Zeta.

560
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,988
Target-- USS<i> Voyager.</i>

561
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,659
CHAKOTAY:
All hands to battle stations.

562
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,035
We're under attack.

563
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,078
Repeat: All hands
to battle stations.

564
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,105
Return fire.

565
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,233
They're dropping
spatial charges.

566
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,694
Evasive maneuvers.

567
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,906
Shields down to 20 percent.

568
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,450
Another Kazon ship
is approaching.

569
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,205
<i>Janeway to Engineering.</i>
<i>We need warp engines.</i>

570
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,789
I can't give them to you--

571
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,791
Not until I've repaired
the containment generator.

572
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,001
<i>Time?</i>

573
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,753
I'll need ten minutes,
at least.

574
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,338
(<i> console beeping</i> )

575
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,798
Captain, I'm picking up
a strange reading on Deck 4.

576
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,175
What kind of reading?

577
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,178
It's a chroniton flux--
.003.

578
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,392
Any idea what's causing it?

579
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,352
Not yet.

580
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,314
It could be random interference
from Kazon

581
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,233
weapons fire.
I don't think so.

582
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:40,279
I've seen
these readings before.

583
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,547
There's no sign of the weapon.

584
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,173
Any uninvited guests?

585
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,760
Not yet.

586
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,389
The lead vessel's been disabled;
the others are regrouping.

587
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,183
B'Elanna, status?<i> </i>
<i>Warp drive's on line,</i>

588
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,311
<i>but the containment field's</i>
<i>still unstable.</i>

589
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,354
<i>Warp 2 is the best</i>
<i>I can give you.</i>

590
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,689
I'll take it.

591
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,524
Engage.

592
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,242
They're not pursuing.

593
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,494
Dry dock.

594
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,329
Ma'am?

595
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,373
The first time I saw these
readings was over two years ago

596
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,250
when<i> Voyager</i> was in dry dock.

597
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,127
Same readings, same location.

598
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,379
What caused them?

599
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,673
I never found out.
The signal vanished

600
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,132
before we could isolate it.

601
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,092
Erect a level-10 force field
around that section.

602
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,095
Is this really the
time to be chasing
sensor ghosts?

603
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,848
Something tells me
this is more than a coincidence.

604
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,434
Seal off Deck 4.
Tuvok, you're with me.

605
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,646
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

606
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,234
They've erected force fields
around my location.

607
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,611
I may have been detected.

608
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,903
How shall I proceed?

609
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,114
(<i> faint static</i> )

610
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,324
Lieutenant, respond.

611
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,867
What's wrong?

612
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,952
The force fields are blocking
our transmissions.

613
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,287
Compensate.

614
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,499
Seven of Nine, report.

615
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,875
SEVEN:
Relativity,<i> are you there?</i>

616
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,877
It's no use, sir;
she can't hear us.

617
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,267
I don't believe
we've been introduced, Ensign.

618
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,935
Lower the force field.

619
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,271
I stand corrected.

620
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,065
We have met.

621
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,817
Utopia Planitia.

622
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,109
<i>The briefing room.</i>

623
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,361
<i>You told me</i>

624
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,779
it was "efficient."

625
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,406
Janeway...

626
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,741
You've mistaken me
for someone else.

627
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,283
Oh, I don't think so.

628
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,745
<i>So here you are,</i>
<i>two years later</i>

629
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,120
on the other side
of the galaxy.

630
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,664
Imagine that.

631
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,250
You are preventing me
from completing a vital mission.

632
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,919
Who are you, and what are
you doing on my ship?

633
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,212
Don't say anything.

634
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,089
She can't hear you, sir.

635
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,258
<i>My designation is irrelevant,</i>
<i>but I assure you I have</i>

636
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,760
no hostile
intentions.

637
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,553
Somehow, I don't find that
very comforting.

638
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,179
Are you working with the Kazon?

639
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,514
No, I am not.

640
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,307
I'm detecting
biomechanical implants.

641
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,185
They have a
Borg signature.

642
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,729
Janeway to the Bridge.

643
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,105
Scan the vicinity
for Borg ships.

644
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,190
CHAKOTAY:<i> Did you say</i> Borg?
Do it.

645
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,650
You will find none.

646
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,984
Then how did you get here?

647
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,153
I'm no longer Borg.

648
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,822
Then who are you?

649
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,075
I can't answer your questions.

650
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,993
Good.
JANEWAY:<i> Why not?</i>

651
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,538
It would be a violation
of the Temporal Prime Directive.

652
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,206
You're from another time?

653
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,041
Yes.

654
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,628
No...
JANEWAY:<i> Who sent you?</i>

655
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,003
I can't tell you that.

656
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,714
I would be risking damage
to the timeline.

657
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,466
I don't care if history itself
comes unraveled.

658
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,718
I want to know why
you're on my ship.

659
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,512
(<i> beeping</i> )

660
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,931
What's that?

661
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,933
You must release me.

662
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,392
Why?

663
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,270
<i>Voyager</i> is in grave danger.

664
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,647
So we've noticed.

665
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,774
Not from the Kazon,
from an act of sabotage.

666
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,067
I've been sent here to stop it.

667
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,069
The intruder has already
boarded the ship.

668
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,447
Please, your lives
depend on it.

669
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,533
You're not going anywhere until
you tell me what's happening.

670
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,287
My name is Seven of Nine.
I'm a member of your crew--

671
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,123
Rather, I will be
a member of your crew.

672
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,501
<i>I've traveled back in time</i>
<i>to try to prevent a disaster</i>

673
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,752
<i>that will destroy</i> Voyager.

674
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,796
Get her out of there.
I'm trying.

675
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,007
Let's see if I've got
this straight.

676
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:33,136
You're a Borg drone attempting
to prevent a disaster

677
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,681
that won't occur
for another three years.

678
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,433
Three years, six months,
and two days.

679
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,144
Does this make
any sense to you?

680
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,438
Like most time paradoxes,
it's implausible,

681
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,983
but not necessarily
illogical.

682
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,734
Captain...

683
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,946
when you take me from the Borg,
you are going to tell me

684
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,824
that part of being human
is learning to trust.

685
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,869
Trust me. Now.

686
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,545
Lower the force field.

687
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,093
Seven of Nine
to Braxton. Respond.

688
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,137
Stay where you are.
We're pulling you out.

689
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,640
<i>That would be unwise.</i>
<i>I am pursuing the saboteur...</i>

690
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,851
with Captain Janeway's
assistance.

691
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,271
Tempus fugit.

692
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,192
Proceed.

693
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,610
Yes, sir.

694
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,197
The intruder is
in Junction 52 Beta.

695
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,699
Take the starboard hatch.

696
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,784
Aye, Captain.

697
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,043
Captain Braxton...

698
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,762
Lower
the temporal disruptor.

699
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,472
It's armed.

700
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,641
I'll activate it.

701
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,435
Lower your weapons.

702
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,190
Janeway...

703
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,026
Have we met?

704
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,486
Too many times,
but you wouldn't remember.

705
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,863
They haven't occurred yet.

706
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,698
BRAXTON:
<i>Seven of Nine, report.</i>

707
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,867
I have located the saboteur.

708
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,077
<i>Who is it?</i>

709
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,412
It's you, Captain Braxton.

710
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,998
Me?
More accurately, a future you.

711
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,918
<i>Now, let me complete</i>
<i>our mission.</i>

712
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:31,004
Our mission? I don't know
what you're talking about.

713
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,632
Listen very carefully.

714
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,634
The circumstances
of your life

715
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,803
are going to change
in the next few years.

716
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,888
You'll be sent
into rehabilitation again,

717
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,180
forced to retire.

718
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,349
And it's all because of<i> Voyager.</i>

719
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,811
Captain, I believe
your future self

720
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,146
is suffering
from temporal psychosis.

721
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,775
Well, of course, I am,
you pedantic drone.

722
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,152
The only way for me...
for us to recover

723
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,904
is to obliterate<i> Voyager</i>
from the timeline.

724
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,531
That way, none of the events
that caused this illness

725
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,951
will have occurred.
What events?

726
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,412
30 years of exile
on 20th century Earth,

727
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,666
the temporal inversion
in the Takara Sector,

728
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:11,086
three violations
that I had to repair.

729
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,046
Can you get a lock on him?

730
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,882
DUCANE:
Negative. He's activated
a dispersal node.

731
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,678
I should say... you've activated
a dispersal node.

732
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,054
Don't be absurd.

733
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,389
I have no wish
to sabotage<i> Voyager.</i>

734
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,975
Not yet.

735
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,810
Remodulate the transporters.

736
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,229
Find a way to cut
through the interference.

737
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,274
I gave you an order,
Lieutenant.

738
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,527
I'm sorry, sir.

739
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,654
I'm taking command
of this vessel...

740
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,280
and I'm relieving
you of duty

741
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,241
for crimes... you're
going to commit.

742
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,119
I haven't done anything.

743
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,955
Seven of Nine...

744
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,540
<i>apprehend Braxton.</i>

745
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,628
No.

746
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,342
<i>Relativity,</i> he's escaped.

747
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,760
I'm tracking him.

748
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,013
He's traveled
to another time frame...

749
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,556
two years earlier.

750
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,516
<i>Transport me</i>
<i>to those coordinates.</i>

751
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,518
That would be
your fourth jump.

752
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,146
<i>I am aware of the risks.</i>

753
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,106
Stand by.

754
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:16,317
Thank you for your
assistance.

755
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,956
(<i> groans</i> )

756
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,716
There's still some
work to be done,

757
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,426
but, uh, once the
sawdust clears,

758
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,011
I think you'll
be impressed.

759
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,429
<i>Voyager</i> may
not be as big

760
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,972
as a Galaxy-class ship,

761
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,724
but she's...

762
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,352
Take cover!

763
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,609
Security, report to
Deck 4, Section 12.

764
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,612
Erect force fields around
all access points.

765
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,074
Is this part of the tour?

766
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,497
(<i> grunts</i> )

767
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,213
(<i> groans</i> )

768
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,933
SEVEN OF NINE:<i> I've lost him.</i>
He's still on<i> Voyager,</i>

769
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,601
<i>but he's gone</i>
<i>five years ahead.</i>

770
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,438
Initiate transport.

771
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,789
Point, server.

772
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,167
It's all in the wrist.

773
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,584
Score?

774
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,586
19-18.

775
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,132
Who are you?

776
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,681
Bridge, intruder alert,
Deck 2.

777
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,061
(<i> groans</i> )

778
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,738
Explain.

779
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,782
No time. You must
apprehend him.

780
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,784
He's trying
to destroy<i> Voyager.</i>

781
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,286
DUCANE:
<i>Seven of Nine, status.</i>

782
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,746
I am incapacitated--
It's sensory aphasia.

783
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,956
<i>Stand by.</i>

784
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,708
I'm pulling you out.

785
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,501
Stop him.

786
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,086
Your future depends on it.

787
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,850
Braxton?

788
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,434
I disabled his tricorder.

789
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,769
He's trapped there.

790
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,855
Seven of Nine
is pursuing him.

791
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,106
She is efficient.

792
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,941
She will succeed.

793
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,193
Let's hope so...

794
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,653
because we've
run out of options.

795
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,332
You again.

796
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,168
I don't believe
we've met, Ensign.

797
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,963
No, I'm wrong.

798
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,632
We have met.

799
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,426
Captain Braxton.

800
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,886
Not anymore.

801
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,555
I've lost my rank,
thanks to you.

802
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,350
<i>Seven of Nine to Seven of Nine.</i>
<i>What's your status?</i>

803
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,977
We've apprehended
Braxton.

804
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,520
How shall we proceed?

805
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,189
<i>Stand by.</i>

806
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,995
Long time no see.

807
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,960
Are you all right, Seven?

808
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,129
I believe we've
just prevented

809
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,089
<i>Voyager's</i> destruction.

810
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,674
Would you care
to explain how you...

811
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,443
The Timeship<i> Relativity.</i>

812
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,069
We need your help.

813
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,738
This Seven of Nine stopped
Braxton, but she created

814
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,949
several temporal incursions
along the way.

815
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,618
She instigated a phaser fight
at Utopia Planitia;

816
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,912
she was seen by you
and Lieutenant Tuvok

817
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,664
two years before
she joined your crew;

818
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,958
and she interacted
with her past self

819
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,961
in front of 15 crew members
at a Ping-Pong tournament

820
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,088
approximately
six minutes ago--

821
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,215
Your time frame,
of course.

822
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,675
Of course.

823
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,011
Needless to say, we need
to clean up the timeline.

824
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,887
Someone must go back
to the beginning

825
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,973
and prevent the chain of events
from occurring

826
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,516
in the first place.

827
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,602
I can't make another jump
without damaging myself.

828
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,065
I get the feeling
I'm about to be drafted.

829
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,943
In exchange for leniency,
Captain Braxton informs us

830
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,196
of the precise moment
he boarded<i> Voyager</i>

831
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,447
to plant the weapon.

832
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,865
We'll be sending
you to stop him.

833
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,116
Tell her.

834
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,452
Deck 4, Section 38.

835
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,954
I'll stumble over
a wounded crew member.

836
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,998
That will be your chance
to capture me.

837
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:25,418
Don't miss it, or we'll have
to do this all over again.

838
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,962
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

839
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,007
I'm going back in time
to stop Braxton...

840
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,386
But you already have him.

841
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,346
And there's a third one
in our brig.

842
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,806
I arrested him
earlier today.

843
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,933
But don't worry.
They'll all be reintegrated

844
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,643
in time for the trial.

845
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,939
And Seven?

846
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,149
Oh, I assure you

847
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,526
when all this is over,

848
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,319
there'll be just one
Seven of Nine.

849
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,071
All right.
Let's get started

850
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,323
before my headache
gets any worse.

851
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,750
TORRES:
Captain, a Kazon torpedo

852
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,919
just blew out the
containment generator.

853
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,628
Do you want me to
reroute emergency power

854
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,839
or take the warp core off-line?
Use your best judgment.

855
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,883
I thought you were on
your way to the Bridge.

856
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,134
I have to take care
of something first.

857
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,136
Now, get moving,
Lieutenant.

858
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,273
(<i> doors open, close</i> )

859
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,278
JANEWAY:
Send damage control teams
to Decks 9 through 14.

860
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,904
Seal the breaches if you can.

861
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,197
I'll be on the Bridge.

862
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,449
Keep me informed.

863
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,783
Yes, ma'am.

864
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,134
Come here often?

865
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,647
Incursion factor-- .0036.

866
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,150
That's better
than I expected.

867
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,277
Glad we could lend a hand.

868
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,654
When do we go home?

869
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,906
You'll both be returned
to your time frame.

870
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,116
You'll be
reintegrated

871
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,867
with the other
Seven of Nine.

872
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,369
Since none of
your time-jumps

873
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,122
were to your foreseeable
future-- Only the past--

874
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,541
I see no reason to resequence
your memory engrams.

875
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,169
But remember the Temporal
Prime Directive.

876
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,962
Discuss your experiences
with no one.

877
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,089
Understood.

878
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,136
Oh, Captain...

879
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,180
Braxton was right
about one thing--

880
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,266
<i>Voyager</i> shows up on our sensors
far too often.

881
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,186
Try to avoid time travel.

882
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,606
See you in the 24th century.

883
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,608
I look forward to it.

884
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,443
Or should I say backward?

885
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,529
Don't get started.
