From the first time you spoke up
in my classroom,

23
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,473
I knew you'd go far.

24
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,434
A little farther than
I expected, Professor.

I have my Admiral hat

Me, too.

35
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,296
I even built a model
of the probe.

36
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,882
Then this should look familiar.

37
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,182
It was launched in 2067.

38
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,601
Just four years
after Zefram Cochrane

39
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,478
tested his first warp engine.

40
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,272
What was it
designed to do?

41
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,023
Reach out to other species.

42
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,860
Pave the way for all the manned missions
that would follow.

43
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,486
They packed it
with information--

Computer chip designs, instructions
for building transceivers.

47
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,162
It's practically a how-to manual.

[Seven] If the Borg
had intercepted this probe,

49
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,875
humanity would have been assimilated
centuries ago.

50
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,169
Our ancestors had no idea
what was out here.

51
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,005
This must have been before
your Prime Directive.

52
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,174
It was before Starfleet existed.

53
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,969
In any case, we lost contact
with the probe 130 years ago.

54
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,513
But its last-known coordinates...

55
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,767
[Torres] Let me guess.
We're in the neighborhood.

56
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,854
Starfleet's mapped out
a search grid.

57
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,981
It'll take us
a little off course,

58
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,858
but if the probe
is still intact,

59
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,818
and we're lucky enough
to find it,

60
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,905

solar winds, ionic interference,

72

He's not six months pregnant.

114
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,470
Being pregnant doesn't
make me an invalid.

[sighs]
No, it doesn't.

116
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,353
But there's a toxic atmosphere
down there,

117
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,812

you carry it,

122
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,242

Sorry for the bumpy ride.

125
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,590
We'll be clearing the stratosphere
in about a minute.

126
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,721
I had a cousin who used
to transport disulfides

He claimed
to love the turbulence.

129
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,898
Of course, disulfides
are known to cause delusions.

130
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,733
Hang on.

131
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,905
I thought it was uninhabited.

down there now.

are at 6,000 isorems.

134
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,914
I've localized the signature
to a three-kilometer radius.

Transfer the coordinates
to the helm.

136
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,502
When we find the probe,
we'll beam it to the cargo hold.

137
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,379
That may not be easy
with all this radiation.

138
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,506
We'd better bring
transport enhancers.

139
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,675
Set us down, Tom.

140
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,051
Yes, sir.

00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,286
I should have brought
a holo-camera,

so I could show B'Elanna
she's not missing anything.

Can you believe she actually wanted
to come with us?

145
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,252
[Carey] When my wife was pregnant,

146
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,421
she didn't want
to be coddled, either.

147
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,132
[laughs]
And she's not half Klingon.

148
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,675
Oh, maybe it's us.

149
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,762
Something about fatherhood
seems to regress the male psyche

It wouldn't have taken
many of these

to trigger a nuclear winter.

172
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,480
[Neelix] People must have
taken shelter here.

00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,982
[Carey] Well, it makes sense.

The magnesite in these caves

175
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,610

partial shielding

00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,159
[Paris] Over here!

179
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,035
[Carey] What'd you find?

180
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,414
[Paris] Some kind of control room
or laboratory.

181
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,082
[Carey] Laboratory?

182
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,876
[Paris] Lots of diagnostic equipment.

183
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,128
Looks like it was salvaged
from a junk heap.

184
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,297
[Neelix] Or scavenged
from the ruins.

185
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,098
[Carey] Particle scanners,

186
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,933
circuit analyzers.

187
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,935
Most of it's still functional.

188
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,775
They were working on something.

189
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,865
[Paris] This is what we came for.

190
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,200
Whoever lived here

191
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,493
must have been studying it.

192
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,330
The datacore is still intact.

193
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,250
Start setting up
the transport enhancers.

194
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,709
[Paris] Paris to Chakotay.

195
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,045
Go ahead.

196
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,463
<i>We found the probe.</i>

197
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,548
<i>Well, pieces of it, anyway.</i>

198
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,967
We're getting ready to beam it
back up to the Flyer.

199
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,469
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

200
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,803
[rattling]

201
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,390
[Neelix] Hello?

202
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,934
Is someone there?

203
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,896
The tricorder isn't
reading any life signs.

204
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,066
[weapons being charged]

205
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,914
[console beeping]

206
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,427
[sighs]

207
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,892
[grunting]

208
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,019
Don't move.

209
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,647
[grunts]

210
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,193
-[grunts]
-You okay?

211
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,698
Delta Flyer to Paris.

212
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,951
Chakotay to away team.
Respond.

213
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,287
[explosion]

214
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,300
They're antimatter weapons.

215
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,219
Shields are off-line.

216
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,139
What are you doing?

217
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,265
Getting us out of here.

218
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,599
What about the others?

219
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,809
We can't do them any good
if we're dead.

220
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,103
We'll come back for them.

221
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,230
Look, you're making a mistake...

222
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,232
[grunting]

223
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,526
[groans]

224
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,237
[Verin] Leave them alone!

225
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,243
Who are you?

226
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,162
I'm Lieutenant Tom Paris.

227
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,497
We're from the Federation
Starship Voyager.

228
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,042
What are these?

229
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,962
They're transport enhancers.

230
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,423
We were going to use them
to retrieve our probe.

231
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,343
Your probe?

232
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,973
Too bad you didn't come
for it sooner.

233
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,517
You would have saved us
a lot of suffering.

234
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,982
We still can't contact the others
or get a fix on their life signs.

235
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,525
Why didn't we detect the aliens?

236
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,693
I don't know.

237
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,196
Whoever they are,
they have antimatter weapons.

238
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,364
Antimatter?

239
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,740
[Tuvok]<i> Bridge to Captain Janeway.</i>

240
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,949
Go ahead.

241
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,534
<i>We are being hailed</i>
<i>from the surface.</i>

242
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,702
The away team?

243
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,204
<i>No.</i>

244
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,297
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway.
Who am I speaking with?

245
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,008
My name is Verin.

246
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,010
Your crewmen are my prisoners.

247
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,429
Why? We haven't done
anything to harm you.

248
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,056
You committed genocide.

249
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,226
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

250
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,520
-We arrived here just...
<i>-You're from Earth?</i>

251
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,021
Yes.

252
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,649
Then you're going to pay
for what your people did to us.

253
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,652
<i>I'm sorry, I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

254
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,572
We're not as naive as you seem
to think we are, Captain, not anymore.

255
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,785
What is it you want?

256
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,665
I want you
to get us off this planet.

257
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,167
Find us a new home.

258
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,629
Release my crewmen and
we can talk about it.

259
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,172
No more talking.

260
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,883
Your people won't be safe
until mine are.

261
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,719
Listen, I don't
respond well to threats.

262
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:33,182
And I don't want to kill anyone,
but I will if you don't cooperate.

263
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,185
You have three hours
to begin evacuating us.

264
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,278
Start scanning
for the nearest M-Class planet.

265
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,988
You intend
to meet his demands?

266
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,615
I'm just keeping my options open.
You're with me.

267
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,745
I've analyzed his garment.

268
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,664
It's lined with magnesite.

269
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,000
A makeshift environmental suit.

270
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,461
Unfortunately, the protection
it offers is limited.

271
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,173
His tissues are saturated
with antimatter radiation.

272
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,300
It explains why we couldn't
detect his life signs.

273
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,595
They're virtually indistinguishable
from the environment.

274
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,556
Now that we know that, maybe we can
adjust our sensors to detect them.

275
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,724
Let's wake him.

276
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,196
[soft groaning]

277
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,615
What were you doing
aboard our shuttle?

278
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,994
Trying to undo the damage
you caused.

279
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,663
If you're referring
to what's happened on your planet,

280
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,207
we had nothing to do with it.

281
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,875
Your people sent the probe...

282
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,294
[wheezes]
...didn't they?

283
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,755
Our ancestors sent it
300 years ago,

284
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,049
to make contact
with other species.

285
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,967
They did a little more than that.

286
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,720
Am I your prisoner?

287
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,557
No. You're suffering from
prolonged radiation exposure.

288
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,725
I can treat you.

289
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,352
You can?

290
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,853
I believe I can.

291
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,607
In exchange for what?

292
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,442
Nothing.

293
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,822
I have a wife, friends.

294
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,825
We might be able
to help them, too,

295
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,204
but not while our crewmen
are being held hostage.

296
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,083
You said you were trying
to undo the damage we caused.

297
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,709
What did you mean by that?

298
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,588
I was aboard your shuttle
looking for technology

299
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,758
that might help us
neutralize the radiation.

300
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,677
We saw missiles
on the surface.

301
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,845
Was the destruction
caused by war?

302
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,932
Those missiles were built for defense.
They were never launched.

303
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,684
Then what accounts
for the devastation?

304
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,813
A containment failure
in our power grid.

305
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,024
Once the antimatter was released,
it destroyed everything.

306
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:51,445
I'm sorry, but I still don't see
how we're responsible.

307
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,073
Before the probe,

308
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:59,036
my people never conceived
of anything like antimatter.

309
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,248
"We offer this information freely
with the hope

310
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,042
that one day
we will stand on your soil

311
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,670
and extend our hands
in friendship."

312
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,880
I'm sure you recognize those words.

313
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,841
The recording from the probe.

314
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,178
Your people sent us technology
that they knew would destroy us.

315
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,222
I don't understand.

316
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,182
We didn't either at first,

317
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,892
but we had decades
to think about it,

318
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,854
and now it seems so obvious.

319
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:29,317
You send us new technology,
encourage us to use it,

320
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,902
and then you wait for us
to obliterate ourselves.

321
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,529
Why would we do that?

322
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,115
Because it's easier
than invading us.

323
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,161
Do you really believe we'd contaminate
a world we intended to conquer?

324
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,204
I'm a scientist.

325
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,624
I believe what I see.

326
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,251
And today, I saw your people
standing on our soil

327
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,461
just as you promised,

328
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,881
and they were wearing equipment that
protected them from the radiation,

329
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,468
because they knew
exactly what to expect.

330
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:01,599
If you were in my position,
what would you believe?

331
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,941
He might have a concussion.

332
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,277
I need the medkit
from my pack.

333
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,489
I was told not to let you
use your equipment.

334
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,658
[sighs]

335
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,872
When's your baby due?

336
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,670
My wife's pregnant, too.

337
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,631
We're expecting a little girl
in a couple of months.

338
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,675
How do you know it's a girl?

339
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,218
Well, we have technology

340
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,179
that allows us to
examine the fetus.

341
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,265
She has my eyes
and her mother's cranial ridges.

342
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,105
Is this your first?

343
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,858
No.

344
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,235
Oh.

345
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,237
Boys? Girls?

346
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,907
Two boys and a girl.

347
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,035
What are their names?

348
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,207
They were all stillborn.

349
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,546
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,299
You're... a doctor?

351
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,510
No, I'm just a medic.

352
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,598
But we have the best doctor
in the Quadrant back on<i> Voyager.</i>

353
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,644
-He might be able to help...
-I shouldn't be talking to you.

354
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,358
[Tuvok] Our current coordinates

355
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,446
and the nearest M-Class planet--
132 light-years away.

356
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,866
At maximum warp, that's about
two months round trip.

357
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,118
How many people
are we talking about?

358
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,162
If these sensor modifications
are correct,

359
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,914
about 5,500.

360
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,958
It would take
at least 17 trips--

361
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,919
almost three years--
to complete the relocation.

362
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,796
We've made sacrifices
to help people before.

363
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,506
What about Tom
and the others?

364
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,133
Are they supposed
to rot down there

365
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,634
until this relocation's finished?

366
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:04,388
I don't think Verin's going to let go
of his only bargaining chips.

367
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,183
Then we may have
to use force.

368
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,311
Not until we've exhausted
every other option.

369
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,314
These people believe
that we're violent.

370
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,734
I'm not going to do anything
to reinforce that belief,

371
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:21,197
unless it becomes
absolutely necessary.

372
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,707
-I've extracted the nanoprobes.
-I'll begin reprogramming them.

373
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,878
Nanoprobes?

374
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,296
Microscopic machines.

375
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,674
Hopefully they'll help us
repair your damaged tissue.

376
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,219
You said you extracted them.

377
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,804
From where?

378
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,096
My bloodstream.

379
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,390
They maintain
my cybernetic implants.

380
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:52,019
Nanoprobes, cybernetic implants.

381
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,356
Are others on your crew like you?

382
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,859
No, I'm... unique.

383
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,736
You certainly are.

384
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,698
I need a word
with your patient.

385
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,784
You told me you've been
looking for ways

386
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,285
to neutralize the radiation.

387
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,579
All my life.

388
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,415
Tell me about your work.

389
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,126
[low, indistinct chatter]

390
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,671
[groaning]

391
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,506
Lieutenant?

392
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,841
I'm okay.

393
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,801
My stomach's just
a little queasy.

394
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,136
Our inoculations
must be wearing off.

395
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,430
I thought these caves
were naturally shielded.

396
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,475
They're no substitute
for an environmental suit.

397
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,478
These people have lived here all
their lives without environmental suits.

398
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,897
These people have lived here
without much of anything.

399
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,691
[rattling]

400
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,734
Hello.

401
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,236
Hello.

402
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,030
It's all right.
We're not going to hurt you.

403
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,699
What's your name?

404
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,076
Yun.

405
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,995
Uh, mine's Tom.

406
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,872
This is Joe and Neelix.

407
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,921
You're not like them.

408
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:05,676
We're different species,
but they're my friends.

409
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,430
They say you're going
to take us on your ship

410
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,932
and find us a new home.

411
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,060
I'm sure our Captain
is trying to help you.

412
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:19,315
Neelix...
where's our "souvenir"?

413
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,943
In my pack.

414
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,321
Uh, excuse me.

415
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,657
Um, we'd like to
give her something.

416
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,409
It's in the equipment bag.

417
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,412
It's a toy.

418
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,225
[Vivaldi's Spring Concerto playing]

419
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,524
That could be a weapon.

420
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,528
[music stops]

421
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,780
It's harmless.

422
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,330
These men are dangerous.

423
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,332
I want you to stay away
from them.

424
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,000
Understood?

425
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,718
Well, so much
for making friends.

426
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,054
Mr. Verin?

427
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,305
What are you doing?

428
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,848
My job.

429
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,309
I'm<i> Voyager's</i> ambassador, remember?

430
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,896
Can I have a word with you?

431
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,494
Just between us...

432
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,124
I understand why you
don't trust humans.

433
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,960
Then why are you with them?

434
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:07,214
They're not so bad once
you get to know them.

435
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,216
When I first met them,

436
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,553
I thought they were arrogant,
self-righteous.

437
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,556
I suppose you're going to tell me
you've changed your mind.

438
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,725
Well, not completely.

439
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,394
I still think
they take themselves

440
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,730
far too seriously
for my taste.

441
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,318
But one thing they don't do
is harm other people.

442
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,654
Are you blind?

443
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:34,450
No, I see very clearly
what's happened to you,

444
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,952
and I'd like to help.

445
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,328
How?

446
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,497
My Captain listens to me.

447
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,583
I can speak to her
on your behalf,

448
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,460
help her understand your situation.

449
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:48,213
What do you know
about our "situation"?

450
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,218
I know what you've been through.

451
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,554
My planet was destroyed
by a weapon

452
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,599
called a metreon cascade.

453
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,770
Hundreds of thousands
of people were killed...

454
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,855
including my family.

455
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,108
How did you survive?

456
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,988
I was on a neighboring planet
when the weapon was detonated.

457
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:18,118
I went back with a rescue team,
but there was no one left.

458
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,954
I'm sorry about what happened
to your family...

459
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,042
but don't compare your life
to mine.

460
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,178
The nearest suitable planet
is simply too far away,

461
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,639
so I'd like to propose
an alternative.

462
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,474
There is no alternative.

463
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,642
<i>Please, hear me out.</i>

464
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,938
<i>We have one of your people</i>
<i>aboard, a Mr. Otrin.</i>

465
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,689
<i>He has some interesting ideas</i>

466
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,650
<i>about counteracting the radiation.</i>

467
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,237
Otrin has too many ideas.

468
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,365
I think his theories have merit.

469
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,911
What he's lacked until now
is the means to carry them out.

470
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,789
If you release the hostages,
we can work together.

471
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,541
There's a good chance

472
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,669
we could undo some of the damage
to your environment.

473
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,379
This isn't a negotiation.

474
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,339
<i>You don't seem to understand.</i>

475
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,175
<i>It would take years to evacuate</i>
<i>the entire planet.</i>

476
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,594
So instead,
you once again offer us

477
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,888
the benefits of your technology.

478
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,851
What I'm offering you
is a realistic alternative.

479
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,396
If I release the hostages,

480
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,648
what's to prevent you
from leaving or attacking us?

481
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,027
Look, I know you've suffered,
and I know you don't trust us.

482
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,238
You haven't given me
any reason to.

483
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,075
Then why don't we start
with a small step?

484
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,744
You return one of the hostages,

485
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,290
and I'll send you a supply
of food and medicine.

486
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,515
You... what's your name?

487
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,185
Joe Carey.

488
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:10,856
Set up your...
transport enhancers.

489
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,720
I'm sorry... Mr. Carey.

490
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,891
Sorry?

491
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,269
Your crewman's ready, Captain.

492
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,396
Transport him to Sick Bay.

493
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,442
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?!

494
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,319
<i>-[fires weapon]</i>
-Tom?

495
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,739
[Doctor]<i> Sick Bay to Bridge.</i>

496
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,284
-[steady tone sounds]
-They've killed Lieutenant Carey.

497
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,837
If you think murdering
one of my crewmen

498
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:19,800
is going to make me more receptive
to your demands, you're mistaken.

499
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,387
Don't force me
to kill anyone else.

500
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:31,019
All right.
I'll evacuate your people.

501
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:35,148
But our transporters aren't designed
to accommodate large groups.

502
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,484
<i>We'll need time to modify them.</i>

503
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,778
We'll be ready within the hour.

504
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,781
If you're not...

505
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,034
I understand.

506
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,160
My ready room.

507
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,289
You have radiation poisoning.

508
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,207
This will make you feel better.

509
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,376
Thank you.

510
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,005
Why are you helping us?

511
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,216
Your child's going to need a father.

512
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:03,719
Isn't she?

513
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,561
The first phase
of your therapy is complete.

514
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,023
How do you feel?

515
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,358
I can breathe more easily.

516
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,152
Your lungs were damaged
by the radiation.

517
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,779
The nanoprobes are repairing them.

518
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,783
It's incredible.

519
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,786
If we could manufacture
more of these,

520
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,622
we might be able
to treat everyone.

521
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:36,335
Unfortunately, Mr. Verin
has refused our help.

522
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,920
Did you expect him to cooperate?

523
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,007
His behavior is irrational.

524
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,426
To you, maybe,

525
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,303
but you haven't lived like we have.

526
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,138
No, but that doesn't mean

527
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,599
that we're responsible
for what's happened here.

528
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,268
You can't deny
your people sent the probe.

529
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,479
They made an error in judgment.

530
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,982
They failed to anticipate
the consequences of their actions,

531
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,151
but they never meant
to destroy your world.

532
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,905
Human culture has evolved,
learned from its mistakes.

533
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,782
So can yours.

534
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:13,914
Even if I believed you,
Verin never would.

535
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,251
Then your people may need
a change of leadership.

536
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,005
Someone more open
to new ideas.

537
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,965
I'm not a leader.

538
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,842
But you're a scientist.

539
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,721
Someone who can see a problem
and envision a solution.

540
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,099
The same definition
could apply to a leader.

541
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,188
[Paris] Doesn't seem fair, does it?

542
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,858
My daughter...
she'll have food,

543
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,027
medical care,
everything she needs.

544
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,863
-[female groans]
-What's wrong?

545
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,408
[woman] We need help.

546
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,119
-It's the baby.
-[gasping]

547
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,539
It's too soon.

548
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,918
Let him help me.

549
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,173
Can you?

550
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:10,387
I think so,
but I'll need my medkit.

551
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,814
Inform Verin.

552
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,446
I'm losing the heartbeat.

553
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,488
Oh, no!

554
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,699
-What are you doing?
-Speeding up the contractions.

555
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,951
[groaning]

556
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,414
Their ship's returned.

557
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,337
Send out patrols.

558
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,673
Double the guard
at the entrance.

559
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,177
[female groaning]

560
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,353
[groaning]

561
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,279
[shouting]

562
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,907
I've got him!

563
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,911
He's not breathing.

564
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,746
Cardio-stimulator.

565
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,292
Three millijoules.

566
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,254
Now.

567
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,303
Don't move.

568
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,642
I'll take him to Verin.

569
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,560
Find the others.

570
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,689
This way. Move!

571
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,487
Increase the charge
to five millijoules.

572
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,324
-[female crying]
-Again.

573
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,037
I'm reading a heartbeat.

574
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,956
[gasps]

575
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,378
Oh!

576
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,381
[baby crying]

577
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,177
You have a son.

578
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,931
Oh.

579
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,726
One of the patrols
took another prisoner.

580
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,855
Put him with the others.

581
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,864
[baby crying]

582
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,242
We need to get him
to<i> Voyager.</i>

583
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,994
He stays here.

584
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,122
[Neelix] Mr. Tuvok?

585
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,627
Your Captain was foolish enough
to think she could rescue you.

586
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,005
Instead, she's given me
another hostage.

587
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,258
[grunting]

588
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,219
[grunting]

589
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,516
-[sighs]
-Doc?

590
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,394
When you need to infiltrate
a toxic environment,

591
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,104
it helps to be a hologram.

592
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,857
Prepare the transport enhancers.
Tuvok to Chakotay.

593
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,692
<i>We've secured the hostages.</i>

594
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,193
Good work.

595
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:17,115
Chakotay to Delta Flyer.
Two to beam out.

596
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,207
Thank you.

597
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,086
Now, Mr. Paris.

598
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,552
Your baby won't survive
without treatment.

599
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,721
I promise we'll bring him back.

600
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,691
Take good care of him.

601
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,360
I will.

602
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,248
Tuvok to<i> Voyager.</i>

603
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,751
Five to beam up.

604
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,390
[Doctor] Cute little fellow,
isn't he?

605
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,476
He's already responding
to treatment.

606
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,521
Once he's stabilized,
we'll transport him to the surface,

607
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,190
and send along some food
and medical supplies.

608
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,608
We're leaving?

609
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,403
As soon as I report to Starfleet.

610
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,409
Captain.

611
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,119
Once the baby's back
in that environment,

612
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,453
he's just going
to get sick again.

613
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,497
I'm sorry, we can't keep him
from his mother.

614
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,209
I'm not suggesting that.
You told those people

615
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,253
that we might be able to
neutralize the radiation.

616
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,380
-Was that true?
-Yes, but they didn't want our help.

617
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,466
-I can't force it on them.
-Maybe you should.

618
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,802
If we help them without
asking anything in return,

619
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,470
it'll prove they're wrong about us.

620
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,223
You're forgetting something.
They killed Mr. Carey.

621
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,934
I'm not about to risk any more lives
to help murderers.

622
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,103
Captain, it was one man
who killed Carey.

623
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,898
If you saw how they were living,
how desperate they are...

624
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,025
I'm not saying we should
ignore what happened,

625
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,194
but humans did play a part
in their suffering.

626
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,948
Intentional or not, that probe had
a terrible impact on these people.

627
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,908
If there's anything we can do
to make up for that now,

628
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:28,288
we at least have to try.

629
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,039
[Otrin] I've adjusted
the radiation levels

630
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,333
to match the conditions
on the surface.

631
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,919
Watch.

632
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,255
An isolitic chain reaction.

633
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,759
It recombines the nucleonic particles
in the atmosphere.

634
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,433
How do we apply your methods
on a planetary scale?

635
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,019
Atmospheric processors
are one possibility.

636
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,855
Too bad we don't have a corps
of engineers to build them.

637
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,067
What if we encased
the catalytic agent

638
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,277
in photon torpedoes,

639
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,696
used the concussive force
to start the reaction?

640
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,951
It would require multiple detonations
at low altitude,

641
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,078
but I believe it could work.

642
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,956
Captain, an isolitic reaction
of that magnitude

643
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,833
would expand exponentially.

644
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,794
Your ship might not survive.

645
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,714
We'll have to modify our shields,
reinforce structural integrity.

646
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,800
Well, let's get started.

647
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,471
He's beautiful.

648
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,891
And they can give us enough medicine
to treat everyone.

649
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,893
Can they rebuild our cities?

650
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,062
Bring back the people who died?

651
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,730
They're offering to help,

652
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,982
and this time
no one's coercing them.

653
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,109
We can't trust these people.

654
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,654
They just sent armed men
to attack us.

655
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,239
They only wanted
to rescue their hostages.

656
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,574
Who knows what they wanted?

657
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,493
You're being irrational.

658
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,080
What's irrational
is cooperating with the enemy.

659
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,541
Look at my child.

660
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:58,044
They said that
they would treat him,

661
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,880
and they kept their word.

662
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,845
Shield modifications on line.

663
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,888
Torpedoes?

664
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,432
-Ready.
-Hail them.

665
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,271
-Listen to me.
-[Janeway]<i> Otrin, we're ready to begin.</i>

666
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,691
Understood.

667
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,987
Good luck.

668
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,989
Tom, take us down.

669
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,126
We're 10,000 meters
into the troposphere.

670
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,086
Fire the first sequence.

671

[grunting]

673
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,434
They're attacking us!

674
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,561
It's only the shock wave
from the detonations.

675
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,230
-[booming]
-[female] No.

676
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,110
Shields?

677
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,904
Holding at 18 percent.

678
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,242
Are you going to stand there
while he helps them destroy us?

679
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,244
[indistinct chatter]

680
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,916
-[alarm sounds]
-What are you doing?

681
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,460
Fighting back.

682
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,175
Captain, they're opening
missile silos.

683
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,509
They're targeting<i> Voyager.</i>

684
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,930
At 18 percent, our shields won't withstand
an antimatter explosion.

685
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,723
We should return to orbit.

686
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,058
Not yet.

687
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,601
Fire the next sequence.

688
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,396
You can't launch those missiles!

689
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,731
Hold him!

690
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,441
Stop!

691
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,861
What are you doing?

692
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,280
I won't let you ruin
our only chance for survival.

693
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,659
You'd kill me?

694
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,995
To save my child...

695
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,997
yes.

696
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,708
Get that weapon away from her.

697
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,544
No... sir.

698
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,172
I've kept you alive...

699
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,548
all of you!

700
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,051
And we're grateful for that.

701
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,846
But survival isn't enough anymore.

702
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,057
Are you in command now?

703
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,560
If I have to be.

704
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,940
Everyone,
come outside! Hurry!

705
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,192
-[female] All right, come on.
-[male] What's going on?

706
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,360
Bring him.

707
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,569
[female] This way.

708
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,321
[indistinct chatter]

709
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,293
[Yun] It's beautiful.

00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,595
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

712
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,015
<i>We've retrieved Friendship I</i>

713
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,434
<i>and resumed our course</i>
<i>to the Alpha Quadrant,</i>

714
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,312
<i>but the success of our mission</i>
<i>had a very high price.</i>

715
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,526
Impressive, isn't it?

716
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,945
The detail's amazing.

717
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,116
Carey spent months
working on it.

718
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,452
He used to joke
that it wouldn't be finished

719
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,203
by the time
we got back to Earth.

720
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,998
He only had
one nacelle to go.

721
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,129
We were able to download
the probe's memory core.

722
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,050
We'll transmit the telemetry
in the next datastream.

723
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:37,055
I think about our ancestors...
thousands of years

724
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,974
wondering if they were alone
in the universe,

725
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,226
finally discovering they weren't.

726
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,730
You can't blame them
for wanting to reach out,

727
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,900
see how many other species
were out there

728
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,985
asking the same questions.

729
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,529
The urge to explore
is pretty powerful.

730
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:57,492
But it can't justify
the loss of lives...

731
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,994
whether it's millions...

732
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,245
[clinking]

733
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,915
...or just one.
