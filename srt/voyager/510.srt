00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,801
The Devore ships are assuming
a tactical formation.

2
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:11,052
Bridge to Transporter Room.
Status?

3
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,472
All set here, Captain.
Pattern cohesion looks stable.

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,307
JANEWAY:
<i>Cargo Bay 1, report.</i>

5
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,558
The bay is clear.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,226
They're powering weapons.

7
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,227
Why do they bother?

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,521
They know we won't resist.

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,356
Protocol, Mr. Paris.

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,482
(<i> console beeping</i> )

11
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,733
They're hailing.

12
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,071
Gaharay<i> vessel,</i>

13
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,615
<i>Crew members are instructed</i>

14
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,241
<i>to step away</i>
<i>from their stations.</i>

15
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,451
We know the drill.

16
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,870
<i>Side arms</i>
<i>and scanning equipment</i>

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,204
<i>are to be set aside.</i>

18
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,498
<i>Deviation from this</i>
<i>or any other</i>

19
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,834
<i>inspection protocols will</i>
<i>not be tolerated.</i>

20
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,753
All hands, this is the Captain.

21
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,756
Prepare to be boarded
by Devore inspection teams.

22
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,341
Give them your full cooperation.

23
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,050
Let's get this over with.

24
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,636
Their soldiers
have materialized

25
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:57,683
on Decks 15, 11, 4 and 1.

26
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,895
(<i> Mahler's Symphony #1 playing)</i>

27
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,898
MALE:
<i>Captain Janeway,</i>

28
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,025
<i>report to your ready room.</i>

29
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,072
Good morning, Captain.

30
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,324
I took the liberty
of playing this music

31
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,576
throughout your ship.

32
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,119
I thought it might help
your crew relax.

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,623
Sometimes these inspections
can be stressful.

34
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,291
How thoughtful.

35
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,962
I've replicated some coffee.

36
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,047
Black, as usual?

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,425
Black.

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,512
Prax here still
refuses to try it,

39
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,641
but then, he's a man
of few pleasures.

40
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,066
Captain,

41
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,984
please make yourself at home.

42
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,887
(<i> Mahler's</i>
<i>Symphony #1 continues</i> )

43
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,610
(<i> instrument beeping</i> )

44
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,603
Those cell cultures
are extremely fragile.

45
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,645
Please...

46
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,992
You've been routing power
through your transporter system.

47
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,535
Why?

48
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,121
It's a routine diagnostic.

49
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,456
We've been having trouble
with our imaging scanners.

50
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,375
The problem is in
the primary energizing coils.

51
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,919
Focus your efforts there.

52
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,715
Thanks for the tip.

53
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,071
Contaminated antimatter.

54
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,615
This material could interfere
with our readings.

55
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,246
A bionetic implant?

56
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,789
An interlink node.

57
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,168
It permits communication
with other Borg drones.

58
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,669
You are not a telepath.

59
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,629
No.

60
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,634
Remarkable.

61
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,927
How old is this?

62
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,386
About 600 years.

63
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,223
My grandfather gave it
to me when I was a child.

64
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,892
It seems you have
a long-standing obsession

65
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,477
with exploration, Captain.

66
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,939
I, on the other hand,
have much more in common

67
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,691
with this ancient soldier.

68
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,484
He's from Earth's
classical period.

69
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,279
It produced some of our
greatest artists as well.

70
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,033
Your culture has
many contradictions.

71
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:10,037
Violence and beauty,
science and faith...

72
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,081
all somehow mingled
harmoniously.

73
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,374
Like the counterpoint
of this music.

74
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,460
Mahler, Symphony #1.

75
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,087
Am I correct?

76
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,379
You're getting to know

77
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,049
my musical database
better than I do.

78
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,301
I've had time to review it
since our last encounter.

79
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,720
Tell me, are all of your
inspections this personal?

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,930
I'm just trying to get
to know you, Captain.

81
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,974
There's no reason for us
to be adversaries.

82
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,433
I could be your friend

83
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,103
and, right now,
you could certainly use one.

84
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,231
Really? Why is that?

85
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,565
Your predicament.

86
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,568
I don't expect
it's been easy.

87
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,863
Thousands of light-years
from home,

88
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,199
navigating by strange stars,

89
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,701
trespassing in
other people's space,

90
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,578
ignoring their laws.

91
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,788
We're just trying
to get back to Earth, Inspector.

92
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,249
Through the Devore Imperium?

93
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,833
It's tough to avoid.

94
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,752
Still, most people
make the effort.

95
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,712
We don't exactly embrace
outsiders.

96
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,214
<i>"Gaharay."</i>

97
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,925
It means "strangers."

98
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,760
Which brings me to a matter

99
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,763
that could threaten
our friendship.

100
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:16,103
I've examined your crew manifest
from our last inspection.

101
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:20,232
Commander Tuvok,
Ensign Vorik-- Vulcans.

102
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,609
Ensigns Suder
and Jurot-- Betazoids.

103
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,278
All telepaths...

104
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,655
and yet for some reason,
you neglected to mention them.

105
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,366
For a very simple reason.

106
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,784
They're dead.

107
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,203
Tuvok, Vorik and Jurot
died in a shuttle crash

108
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,955
about two months ago.

109
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,625
Suder was killed in a conflict
with a species called the Kazon.

110
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,335
That's fortunate...

111
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,920
for you, I mean.

112
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,755
If I'd found you
were harboring telepaths,

113
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,174
I would have had to arrest you

114
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,343
for breaking
our Cardinal Protocol.

115
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,221
They were valued members
of my crew, Inspector,

116
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,639
not criminals.

117
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,724
Perhaps.

118
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,394
Captain...

119
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,229
do you trust me?

120
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,439
Not for a second.

121
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,815
Exactly.

122
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,483
And why should you?

123
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,818
Trust has to be earned.

124
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,361
It's gradual,

125
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,656
and yet it's the foundation
of every relationship,

126
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,783
professional and personal.

127
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:17,164
It's also a concept
alien to the telepathic races.

128
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,498
Why take someone at their word

129
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,001
when you can simply read
their mind?

130
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,252
(<i> door opens</i> )

131
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,129
We've completed
our inspection.

132
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,214
There are no
telepaths aboard.

133
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,758
However, their sensor logs
indicate they deviated

134
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,636
from their assigned
course on two occasions.

135
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,349
In both cases,
to avoid ion storms.

136
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,853
Imperative 32, Codicil 626:

137
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,729
"All<i> gaharay</i> vessels

138
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,898
"that deviate
from prescribed flight vectors

139
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,443
will be impounded, their crews
detained and relocated."

140
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,944
Prax, it's clear

141
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,198
the Captain didn't
intend to break protocol.

142
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,825
I expect we can overlook
these infractions.

143
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,076
Sir?

144
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,247
Yes, sir.

145
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,835
Captain, I'm
a reasonable man

146
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:08,048
and you've been cooperative,
but consider this a reminder.

147
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,925
You have a long trip
through Devore space

148
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,053
and good friends
can be an asset.

149
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,638
I'll keep it in mind.

150
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,365
The Devore vessels are
out of range.

151
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,576
Bridge to Transporter Team.
You're clear.

152
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,375

00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,378
Pattern enhancers are in place.

Initiating rematerialization
sequence.

155
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,467
Harry, I'm routing maximum power
to the transporters.

156
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,096
KIM:
Got it.

157
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,266
Align the confinement
beam to ten angstroms.

158
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,892
Energizing.

(<i> power fluctuating</i> )

160
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,940
Ensign Kim, the confinement beam
is unstable.

161
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,608
We're trying to correct it now.

162
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,110
What's the problem?

163
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,195
We're unable to consolidate
their patterns.

164
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,697
They've been
in suspension too long.

165
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,286
Harry, increase power
to the imaging scanners.

166
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,454
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

167
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,915
It's working.

168
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,228
Nice work, Harry.

169
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,523
All our guests are present
and accounted for.

170
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,568
Captain...
They're gone... for now.

171
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,700
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

172
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,828

176
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,964
Back to your
old self again?

177
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,924
Each time we do this,
I feel as though I've left

178
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,717
a few molecules behind
in your cargo bay.

179
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,303
Well, I'll have someone
scan the room

180
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,638
if it'll make
you feel better.

181
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,473
Kir, we just received
an encoded message

182
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,849
from the transport vessel.

183
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,934
They've changed the
rendezvous point again.

184
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,144
I'm afraid so.

185
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,686
Did they send the
new coordinates?

186
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,980
We're still waiting
for them.

187
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,232
Captain, we may have
another problem.

188
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,568
I just treated Tuvok
and two of the refugees

189
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,278
for acute
cellular degradation.

190
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,572
I've repaired
most of the damage,

191
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,698
but unfortunately,
the effect is cumulative.

192
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,783
Meaning?

193
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,076
If we continue to go

194
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,453
into transporter
suspension,

195
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,829
some of us
may not survive.

196
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,207
CHAKOTAY:<i> Bridge to Captain.</i>
Go ahead.

197
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,125
<i>We're receiving</i>
<i>another transmission.</i>

198
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,168
Acknowledged.

199
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,048
SEVEN:
The new coordinates are here

200
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,550
within a Mutara-class nebula,

201
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,968
2.36 light-years
from our current position.

202
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,679
It's definitely
out of the way--

203
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,472
less chance of
being discovered--

204
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,599
but it'll take two
more days to get there.

205
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,518
Two days--
that increases the chances

206
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,228
that we'll run into
another inspection.

207
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,146
Given the frequency
of patrols in that area,

208
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,939
it's likely we'll be
stopped at least once.

209
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,567
Just what the Doctor
didn't order.

210
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,569
Tuvok, Seven, I want you
to lay in a course

211
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,904
that'll attract
as little attention as possible.

212
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,906
We'll avoid their colonies,
space stations,

213
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,492
tourist attractions--
if they have any.

214
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,997
The Ogre of Fire's castle
hovered over the forest

215
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,668
like a great, black spaceship,
turning day into night.

216
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,921
Now, Flotter and Trevis
knew they had to find a way

217
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,048
to keep the Ogre from
burning the forest down,

218
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,968
but his castle-- it was
higher than the tallest tree.

219
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,303
It seemed hopeless

220
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,846
until they discovered...

221
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,847
A door.

222
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,307
A door, right.

223
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,768
A mysterious door,
right in the middle of a...

224
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,104
The clearing.

225
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,606
You know, it's...

226
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,066
it's not nice
to read people's thoughts

227
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,943
when they're telling a story.

228
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,777
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,778
It's all right.

230
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,322
(<i> door opens</i> )

231
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,202
Why don't you all go play
by yourselves for a while?

232
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,746
We'll finish the story later.

233
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,041
How are they doing?

234
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,792
Oh, fine, more or less.

235
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,463
They don't understand
what all the fuss is about,

236
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,506
but they're
telepaths, Captain.

237
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,092
If the parents are
concerned or fearful,

238
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,970
the children feel it, too.

239
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,388
You did the right thing.

240
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,515
If we hadn't taken them
off that freighter,

241
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,934
they'd be in a detention
center by now.

242
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,520
Well, we're going to make sure
that doesn't happen.

243
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,648
Is the kitchen still open

244
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,400
or are you
just serving stories?

245
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,486
For you,
it's always open.

246
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,906
Commander,
I'm detecting a vessel,

247
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,533
300,000 kilometers
and closing.

248
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,743
The signature is Devore.

249
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,036
Red Alert. Shields up.

250
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,331
Bridge to Captain.

251
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,332
More company, Commander?

252
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,625
<i>Looks like it.</i>

253
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,168
Get our visitors
to the cargo bay.

254
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,295
Stand by
for transporter suspension.

255
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,338
Aye, Captain.

256
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,339
Neelix.

257
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,298
Right away.

258
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,549
Come on, now.

259
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,842
We're going to go
see your parents.

260
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,219
Let's go.

261
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,972
Report.

262
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,891
It's a scout ship.
One pilot; no other crew.

263
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,520
The vessel hasn't raised shields
or charged weapons.

264
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,895
If this is
another inspection,

265
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,606
it's certainly
a different approach.

266
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,982
We're being hailed.

267
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,442
Open a channel.

268
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,569
<i>Captain.</i>

269
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,029
Inspector.

270
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,447
<i>It's urgent that we speak.</i>

271
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,409
You know the way
to my ready room.

272
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,669
It's all right,
Ensign.

273
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,174
I submitted
to your previous inspections

274
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,551
because you outgunned me,

275
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,553
but I don't see
any of your warships nearby.

276
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,095
I have no intention
of cooperating.

277
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,682
I'm not here
to search<i> Voyager.</i>

278
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,851
Then what
do you want, inspector?

279
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,144
Call me Kashyk, please.

280
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,438
I never liked that title.

281
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,816
In fact, I've left it behind.

282
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,484
Did somebody offer you

283
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,404
a promotion, or are you
just having a bad day?

284
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,199
I'm defecting,
and I need your help.

285
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,868
Me?

286
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:14,539
I've come to ask asylum--
safe passage out of Devore space

287
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,542
before I end up
in a detention center myself.

288
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:22,004
Now, why would I risk
the safety of my crew

289
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,424
by harboring a defector?

290
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,467
Because of what
I'm about to tell you.

291
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:30,096
If you continue
on your present course,

292
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,973
you'll be intercepted
by a squadron of my warships.

293
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:37,144
<i>Voyager</i> will be seized,
your crew imprisoned or worse.

294
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,481
The nebula is a trap, Captain,

295
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,610
to catch vessels
smuggling telepaths.

296
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,071
You've inspected my ship
three times.

297
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,950
You know we aren't smuggling
telepaths or anyone else.

298
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,746
What I know is that you have
12 refugees aboard right now,

299
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,832
that you rescued them
from a freighter three weeks ago

300
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,834
and that you've
been concealing them

301
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,211
in Cargo Bay 1,
using your transporters.

302
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,421
I could have exposed them

303
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,131
at any time,
but I wanted them

304
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,758
to escape
as much as you do.

305
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,217
I can still protect them,

306
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,511
but only if you
take me with you.

307
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,348
My people know
about the wormhole.

308
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,310
It's only a matter of time
before they find it.

309
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,316
You have no choice, Captain.

310
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,860
I'm your only hope.

311
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,998
This is our
rendezvous point

312
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,416
inside this nebula.

313
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,335
Unfortunately,
the transport vessel

314
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,545
we're supposed to meet
is no longer there.

315
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,588
Inspector.

316
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,262
TUVOK:
A Devore warship.

317
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,722
One of a dozen

318
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,390
positioned
throughout the nebula--

319
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,892
all invisible
to our sensors

320
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,019
until Kashyk showed
me how to compensate

321
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,688
for their refractive shielding.

322
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,273
Your soldiers intercepted
the transport ship?

323
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,358
Over a week ago.

324
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,193
We were the ones
who changed

325
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,903
the rendezvous
coordinates.

326
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,697
Two vessels carrying refugees

327
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,365
have already been seized.

328
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,617
<i>Voyager</i> would
have been next.

329
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,202
All right, Inspector,

330
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,329
you helped us avoid
this ambush. What now?

331
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,914
We'll have to get
your passengers

332
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,499
to the wormhole on our own.

333
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,084
These are the schedules
and routes of our patrols,

334
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,880
along with tactical
data on our shield

335
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,882
and weapons configurations--
enough to ensure

336
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,800
that you avoid
another inspection.

337
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,343
How long before you're missed?

338
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,012
Well, I took two weeks' leave.

339
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,347
Enough time, I hope,
to find the wormhole

340
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,683
and get your passengers
safely through it,

341
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,184
and myself, as well.

342
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,561
Your data is useful,

343
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,312
but it doesn't guarantee
our success.

344
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:48,484
No. For that, you'll need
my guidance and some luck.

345
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,320
I'll have to take this
up with the Brenari...

346
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,073
see what they think of
their new benefactor.

347
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,158
I'll let you know
what they decide.

348
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,037
I'll have to insist
you remain under guard.

349
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,496
No hard feelings.

350
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,122
No hard feelings.

351
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,336
It's unusual...
but not unheard of.

352
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,338
There have been
sympathizers before.

353
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,465
Kashyk may be
telling the truth.

354
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,300
Maybe you should
just read his thoughts.

355
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,635
Devore soldiers undergo

356
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,846
years of mental training
to prevent that.

357
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,681
He might be telling
the truth,

358
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,726
but he also might be using us
to find the wormhole.

359
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,520
So what do we do,
throw him in the brig?

360
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,647
No.

361
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,025
We take him up on
his offer to help,

362
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,401
see how it plays out.

363
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,653
But I want 'round-the-clock
security.

364
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,739
We need to watch
his every movement.

365
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,991
That leaves us with
our next question:

366
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,785
How do we find
the wormhole?

367
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,994
I've given it some thought.

368
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,288
There's a scientist named Torat.

369
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,957
He's from a nearby system.

370
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,085
He's rumored to know more
about the wormhole than anyone.

371
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,837
He might help us... for a price.

372
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,798
A price?
His species power

373
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,300
their ships with a fluidic alloy
that's difficult to find.

374
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,551
Perhaps we can
replicate it.

375
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,511
I have some data
on its composition.

376
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,679
See what you can do.

377
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,180
In the meantime,
we'll set a course

378
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,892
for Torat's planet,
try to track him down.

379
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,736
Nervous?

380
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,237
(<i> sighs</i> )

381
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,031
Let's just say...

382
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,159
I'm not used to other people
deciding my fate.

383
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,335
Until today,
you were part of a government

384
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:34,090
responsible for persecuting
thousands of innocent people.

385
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,216
Why the sudden change of heart?

386
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,177
There's nothing sudden about it.

387
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,721
I've been looking for
a way to escape for years.

388
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,849
<i>Voyager</i> was
the perfect opportunity.

389
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,017
How so?

390
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,726
Well, what are you suggesting...

391
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,979
I ask a Brenari vessel
for assistance?

392
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,856
They'd throw me out an airlock.

393
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,941
Besides...

394
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,611
you're something
of a humanitarian, Captain.

395
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,155
I've read your database.

396
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,699
I know all about
Starfleet philosophy,

397
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,242
unless you left
those ideals behind

398
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,828
in the Alpha Quadrant.

399
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,540
I certainly don't grant asylum
to every person I meet,

400
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,750
especially ones
who ransack my ship

401
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,836
and terrorize my crew.

402
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:16,465
You're asking me to believe
you're someone else...

403
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:21,554
and... that's a leap of
faith I'm not ready to make.

404
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,848
You're turning me away.

405
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:24,932
No.

406
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,560
No.

407
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,439
I'm going to give you safe
passage to the wormhole...

408
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,234
in return for your help
in getting us there,

409
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,778
but I'm also imposing
some restrictions.

410
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,864
You'll have your
own quarters,

411
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,575
but limited access
to<i> Voyager's</i> systems,

412
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,162
and your whereabouts will
be monitored at all times.

413
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,498
I'm used to being surrounded
by armed guards.

414
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,875
Makes me feel secure.

415
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,129
Only this time,
they answer to me.

416
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,591
Consider them a reminder that
<i>Voyager</i> is my ship.

417
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,968
I don't think anyone
could doubt that.

418
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,234
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

419
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,277

420
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,279
<i>but we've managed</i>
<i>to locate Torat,</i>

421
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,199
<i>the man who's supposedly</i>
<i>an expert on wormholes.</i>

422
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,034
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>he seems reluctant</i>

423
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,994
<i>to share his expertise.</i>

424
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,495
He's trying to evade us.

425
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,789
Hail him again.

426
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,707
Mr. Torat doesn't
seem too trusting.

427
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,210
Maybe he's been through
one inspection too many.

428
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,669
No response.

429
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,338
He's deactivated
his communications system.

430
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,883
I think I can tap into his
computer, override the lockout.

431
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,968
Do it.

432
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,432
<i>Go away!</i>

433
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,310
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

434
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,479
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

435
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,772
We have no hostile intent.

436
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,857
<i>Then why are you pursuing me?</i>

437
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,817
We'd just like to ask...

438
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,194
<i>Federations, Imperiums...</i>

439
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,197
<i>Why do you people</i>
<i>feel such a need</i>

440
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,742
<i>to align yourselves with</i>
<i>monolithic organizations, hmm?</i>

441
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,286
I'd be glad to discuss that

442
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,496
and any other philosophical
issue you care to raise,

443
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,498
if you would just
slow down and talk.

444
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,958
<i>Sorry. Can't do that.</i>

445
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,544
<i>I'm late for</i>
<i>a very important conference!</i>

446
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,922
This is a waste of time.
Disable his ship.

447
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,757
That's what we call
overkill, Inspector.

448
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,550
Ensign, can we transport
at this range?

449
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,970
Absolutely. Energizing.

450
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,601
Welcome aboard.

451
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,770
Your reputation precedes you.

452
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,695
JANEWAY:
20 centiliters of mercurium
isochromate-- no impurities--

453
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,404
and this is just a sample.

454
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,450
We've synthesized enough
to power your ship for a year.

455
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,994
It doesn't matter.

456
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,080
I never heard of this...
wormhole you're looking for,

457
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,874
or these so-called refugees.

458
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,250
Well, they've heard of you.

459
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,669
Well, no doubt-- my
research is famous.

460
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,339
Think of all the stars
you could research

461
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:04,508
once you've infused your
propulsion system with this.

462
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,426
There's no point
in bribing me.

463
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,638
He's right. He couldn't
help us if he wanted to.

464
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,389
What do you
mean by that?

465
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,935
I doubt you'd know a wormhole
from a dark matter inversion.

466
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,521
Professor... Kashyk
is another expert

467
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,107
I've retained to help
us with this matter.

468
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,359
I'm afraid he's not

469
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,694
as impressed with
your work as I am.

470
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,613
In fact, he discouraged me
from seeking you out.

471
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,992
Professor<i> Kashyk?</i>
Never heard of you.

472
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,409
Not surprising,

473
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,829
considering you toil
in scientific obscurity.

474
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,540
Obscurity?!

475
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,626
I-I've discovered over
60 astronomical phenomena!

476
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,838
(<i> scoffing</i> ):
Not worth the sensors
they were recorded on.

477
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,964
Oh...

478
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,966
There's no need
to insult the man.

479
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,427
Just because he doesn't know how
to find an interspatial flexure.

480
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,013
Interspatial flexure?

481
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,640
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

482
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,518
He said wormhole--
a layman's term

483
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,563
that... that covers
any number of phenomena.

484
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,191
I am familiar
with a certain anomaly

485
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,528
that could be categorized
as an "interspatial flexure."

486
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,115
Where is it?

487
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,950
Actually,
a better question would be,

488
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,034
where is it now?

489
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,535
It's really quite
interesting.

490
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,122
The aperture of
the phenomenon--

491
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,539
which I prefer to call

492
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,793
an intermittent
cyclical vortex-- is unfixed.

493
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,544
It manifests infrequently,

494
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,672
for only brief periods of time
and in varying locations.

Perhaps you can extrapolate
the next one...

if you're as accomplished
a scientist as you<i> claim</i> to be.

500

Think.
I'm thinking.

Think harder.
Four wormhole appearances

less than 20 light-years apart--
there's no pattern.

503
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,787
Did you apply a
fractal coefficient?

504
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,705
Didn't work.
Neutrino flux parameters?

505
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,873
Mm-hmm.

506
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,916
Statistical algorithms?

I could find.

508
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,919

defies analysis.

was right--

00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,216
Think harder.

513
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,051
How do you predict...

514
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,970
a random occurrence?

515
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,639

frequency, location, timing--
but each of those parameters

524
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,118
could have a counterpoint
in subspace.

525
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,163
If we could run an algorithm
based on subspace harmonics,

526
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,873
it might reveal our pattern.

00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,268
Thank you.

535
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,021
You don't sound too
happy about leaving.

536
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,565
The Brenari aren't about
to embrace a former Inspector.

537
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,568
I'll be feared,
hated for what I represent.

538
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,821
Anxiety doesn't
become you, Inspector.

539
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,156
Try to relax a little.

540
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,574
I suppose you liked
me better in uniform.

541
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:20,371
I haven't decided whether
I like you at all.

542
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:32,674
We call them the Kolyan Kolyar--
Infinite Spirals.

543
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,093
Beautiful.

544
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:38,347
As a boy, I spent years
gazing at these lights.

545
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,598
This is the last time
I'll ever see them.

546
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,852
We have something
similar back on Earth--

547
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,187
the Aurora Borealis.

548
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,398
Which you, too,
may never see again.

549
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:51,193
I suppose we're both
refugees, in a way.

550
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,738
I'm still counting
on getting this ship home.

551
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,242
Are you sure you'll be
welcome when you do?

552
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,537
I came across something
else in your database--

553
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,331
the "Prime Directive."

554
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,166
The Federation's
"Cardinal Protocol."

555
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,543
It seems

556
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,421
you violated it when you
rescued these telepaths.

557
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,466
Well, let's just say I usually
go with my instincts...

558
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,218
and sort it out later
at the Board of Inquiry.

559
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,472
Those Admirals and I were
on a first-name basis, you know.

560
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:21,390
Ah.

561
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,477
You're risking
a lot, too. Why?

562
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,482
Three months ago,

563
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,568
my teams were inspecting
a plasma-refining vessel.

564
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,445
We found a family of telepaths

565
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:37,072
hiding in one of
the extraction tanks.

566
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,617
There was a child...
very young.

567
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:44,246
She'd been inside it for days,
barely able to breathe.

568
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,872
When I lifted her out

569
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,792
and set her down
on the deck...

570
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,629
she thanked me.

571
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:54,756
I sent her to a relocation
center with the others,

572
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:59,219
knowing full well
what would happen to her.

573
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,680
After that, I could think
of nothing else,

574
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,476
and when I couldn't
stand it any longer...

575
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,688
You're my deliverance, Captain.

576
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,650
<i>Analysis complete.</i>

577
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,203
It worked.

578
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,498
It looks like it'll appear
in about three days...

579
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,833
less than eight
light-years from here.

580
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,959
The Tehara system.

581
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,044
Is that a problem?

582
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,795
There's an automated
sensor array

583
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,963
between here and Tehara.

584
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,131
Can we go around it?

585
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,675
We'd never make it in time.

586
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,968
We'll have to find a way
to avoid detection.

587
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,555
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Let's do it
in the morning.

588
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,265
We've done enough
for tonight.

589
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,313
Are you saying good-bye?

590
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,899
There'll be
other spirals.

591
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:58,945
They've just never looked
quite so... beautiful before.

592
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,949
Could be the company
I'm keeping.

593
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,244
Or the polarization
axis of the windows.

594
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,746
That must be it.

595
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,252
How often does this array
emit a scanning pulse?

596
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,420
Every 40 seconds.

597
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,462
Range?

598
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,130
Ten light-years.

599
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,632
The pulse is designed

600
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,552
to track warp fields
and impulse signatures.

601
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,303
If we lower our power output

602
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,389
to beneath its
detection threshold...

603
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,391
We could drift
past undetected.

604
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,726
It's worth a try.

605
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,608
Well, good night.

606
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,276
Captain...

607
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,569
why don't you...

608
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,238
join me?

609
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,990
I've been looking forward
to trying your replicator.

610
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,076
Well, I'm sure that I can
come up with something

611
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,327
to toast the evening.

612
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,329
We've accomplished
quite a bit today.

613
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,081
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

614
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,083
I had your replicator
taken off-line.

615
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,336
In case I decided to
replicate a weapon.

616
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,422
A safety precaution,
you understand.

617
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,799
Better than anyone.

618
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,259
Sleep well.

619
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,344
And you.

620
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,101
As you were.

621
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,489
15 seconds.

622
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,740
KASHYK:
Our power output 

623
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,325
is below the detection
threshold.

624
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,701
Ten seconds.

625
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,332
Five... four...

626
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,667
three...

627
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,834
two...

628
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,840
We weren't detected.

629
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,592
Ten minutes
and we'll be out of range.

630
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,428
TORRES:
<i>Engineering to Bridge.</i>
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

631
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,930
That pulse triggered a variance
in the antimatter stream.

632
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,057
It's not much, but it'll
light us up like a beacon

633
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,267
when the next pulse hits.

634
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,352
JANEWAY:
<i>Options?</i>

635
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,645
I can't correct it in time.

636
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,481
So that leaves shutting down
the core.

637
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,482
Do it.

638
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,483
The array has released

639
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,734
another pulse.
Time?

640
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,860
28 seconds.

641
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,320
Get down
to the plasma injectors.

642
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,572
Grab a tricorder
and monitor the antimatter flow.

643
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,657
Aye, sir.

644
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,869
20 seconds.

645
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,995
B'Elanna...

646
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,330
Almost there, Captain.

647
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,207
I'm having a problem
with the injectors.

648
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,916
15 seconds.

649
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,920
Ten seconds.

650
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,637
Four... three... two...

651
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,266
(<i> console beeping</i> )

652
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,434
We've been detected.

653
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,061
The array's transmitting
an alert.

654
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,354
Can we block it?

655
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,438
Negative.

656
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,606
Stand down grey mode.

657
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,233
B'Elanna, fire up the core.

658
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,735
We're getting out of here.

659
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,737
Warships will be
on their way,

660
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,864
but we can still
reach the wormhole.

661
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:47,989
If we can find it.

662
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,200
Tom, how long
to the Tehara system?

663
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,077
11 hours at maximum warp.

664
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,287
Engines are
back on line.

665
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,539
Engage.

666
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,961
Using the model
we developed,

667
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,672
we were able to narrow
down the location

668
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,758
of the wormhole's next
appearance to a radius

669
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,217
of 200,000 kilometers.

670
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,844
KIR:
We can't determine

671
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,179
its exact position
until we reach the system,

672
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,265
but we know it will open
in roughly six hours.

673
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,893
And will remain open
for two minutes at most.

674
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,644
I've devised a new
shield modulation,

675
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,897
which should protect us
against their weapons.

676
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:22,357
You're not planning to fight
your way to the wormhole?

677
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,483
If I have to.

678
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,943
PARIS:
<i>Bridge to Captain Janeway.</i>

679
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,612
Go ahead.

680
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,030
<i>Long-range sensors have</i>
<i>picked up two Devore warships</i>

681
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,783
<i>heading right for us.</i>

682
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,409
Time to intercept?
Six hours.

683
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,244
Take the Bridge.
I'll be in Engineering.

684
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,287
Kashyk.

685
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,249
First, we'll check those
shield modifications.

686
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,376
Then we'll see if we
can adjust our phasers

687
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,253
to penetrate the
Devore shields.

688
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,672
If torpedoes don't work,
I want an alternative.

689
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,049
Captain, we have to talk

690
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,760
but not here.

691
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:59,478
I'm going back
to rejoin the warships.

692
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,772
It's the only way that I
can guarantee your safety.

693
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,022
Kashyk...

694
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,650
I'm still a ranking officer.

695
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,277
I can take command
of the inspection teams,

696
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,154
make sure the refugees
aren't discovered.

697
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,864
You said yourself
they're suspicious.

698
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,866
Return now and you
risk being caught.

699
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,576
I can keep them off track
long enough to

700
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,829
get you through the wormhole.
It's too dangerous.

701
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,163
Kathryn...

702
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,332
You asked for safe passage
and I agreed,

703
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,584
under the condition
that you follow my orders.

704
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,003
You may stand a chance
against one of our warships,

705
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,129
but not against two.

706
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,422
If I stay, your
best chance

707
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,048
of escape will be lost.

708
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,514
I could confine you to quarters.

709
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,974
(<i> chuckles</i> )

710
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,559
I was planning on asking you
to stay with us,

711
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,603
once we got through
the wormhole.

712
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,939
I wouldn't mind having
someone around

713
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,984
who appreciates a bit
of Tchaikovsky now and then.

714
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:50,529
Generous, but...

715
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,657
something tells me I wouldn't
fit in any better on<i> Voyager.</i>

716
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,075
Well...

717
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,620
you wouldn't be
the first wayward soul

718
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,455
we've folded into our ranks.

719
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,253
Your shuttle will be ready
for launch within the hour.

720
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,094
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

721
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,597
Our course will put us
just outside the Teharan system

722
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,182
by the time
the warships arrive.

723
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,226
Your inspection teams
have to be off<i> Voyager</i>

724
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,811
before that wormhole opens.

725
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,271
Believe me, it'll be the
quickest inspection on record.

726
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,648
I'll be on the Bridge.

727
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,734
Your efforts have been
greatly appreciated.

728
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,736
My pleasure.

729
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,154
Live long and prosper.

730
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,781
Thank you.

731
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,121
(<i> doors open</i> )

732
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,293
KASHYK:
Begin preignition sequence.

733
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,926
I've made one adjustment
to your plan.

734
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,844
After the inspection,
we're going to wait

735
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,679
at the wormhole
for as long as we can...

736
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,598
until it begins
to collapse.

737
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,517
I may not be able
to join you this time.

738
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,310
Try.

739
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,398
(<i> engines powering up</i> )

740
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,183
They're assuming
a tactical formation.

741
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,101
Shields?

742
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,393
No. We follow
protocol.

743
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,604
Bridge to Transporter Room.

744
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,981
<i>Status?</i>

745
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,066
Ready, Captain.
Pattern cohesion stable.

746
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,275
<i>Cargo Bay 1?</i>

747
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,360
Clear.

748
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,319
They're hailing.

749
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,821
On screen.

751
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,407
JANEWAY:
We've been through

752
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,742
three inspections.

753
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,619
Please explain
why another is necessary.

754
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,205
<i>Crew members are instructed to</i>
<i>step away from their stations.</i>

755
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,124
<i>Side arms</i>
<i>and scanning equipment</i>

756
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,709

757
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,585
<i>Deviation from this</i>
<i>or any other</i>

758
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,588
<i>inspection protocols</i>
<i>will not be tolerated.</i>

759
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,298
All hands, this is the Captain.

760
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,301
Prepare to be boarded
by Devore inspection teams.

761
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,303
Give them
your usual warm welcome.

762
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,098
Devore soldiers
have materialized

763
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,642
on Decks 15, 12, 8, 4...

764
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,435
And... 1.

765
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,063
(<i> Tchaikovsky symphony playing)</i>

766
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:15,025
KASHYK:
<i>Captain Janeway,</i>
<i>report to your ready room.</i>

767
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,364
Captain.

768
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,533
Good to see you again.

769
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,202
Likewise.

770
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,500
(<i> instruments beeping</i> )

771
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,920
(<i> music continues</i> )

772
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,648
Tchaikovsky.

773
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,110
Of all the selections
in your database,

774
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,653
this remains my favorite.

775
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,572
Mine, too.

776
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,866
I'm afraid Prax
isn't impressed.

777
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,827
He's solely concerned
with his work, aren't you, Prax?

778
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,204
As you say, sir.

779
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,207
Yes, he's curious why
you entered this sector.

780
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,666
You're aware
it's restricted.

781
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,834
We were planning to study

782
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,129
a supernova remnant
not far from here.

783
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,338
You strayed a full light-year
from your course

784
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,591
in order to observe
an astronomical phenomenon?

785
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,009
We're explorers.

786
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,010
Yes, I remember.

787
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,470
I also remember warning you

788
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,764
about going where
you don't belong.

789
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:32,602
Exploring can sometimes
be hard to resist, Inspector.

790
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,813
Well, it's a romantic notion,
Captain,

791
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,398
but one I can't allow you
to indulge.

792
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,942
I'm afraid I'll
have to ask you

793
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,360
to leave our space
immediately.

794
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,570
Prax, why don't
you check

795
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,656
on our teams,
while I reiterate

796
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:48,160
our protocols for
Captain Janeway.

797
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,582
Do they suspect
anything?

798
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,542
Not yet, but our warships

799
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,461
have been monitoring
<i>Voyager's</i> movements

800
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,130
for the past few days,
and mine as well.

801
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,589
I don't think
we have much time.

802
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,092
The Brenari?

803
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,718
They're in transporter
suspension.

804
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,428
And the wormhole?

805
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,638
We found it.

806
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,349
It's 20,000 kilometers
off our port bow.

807
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,143
We've determined
that a photon torpedo,

808
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:16,313
properly calibrated,
will force open the threshold

809
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,148
long enough for<i> Voyager</i>
to get through.

810
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,526
Congratulations, Captain.

811
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:25,322
For awhile, I wasn't sure
if even you could find it.

812
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,698
Prax.

813
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,954
Go to Cargo Bay 1.

814
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,789
You'll find
the transporter patterns

815
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,415
for more than
a dozen telepaths.

816
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,876
Rematerialize them.

817
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:38,918
Yes, sir.

818
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,547
Impressive.

819
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,342
You gave a masterful
performance.

820
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,802
I'm the one
who's impressed

821
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,639
with your selflessness,
your humanity.

822
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,809
It made all this
so much easier.

823
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,187
Oh, but what about
your selflessness?

824
00:39:57,187 --> 00:40:00,232
That touching story
about the little girl--

825
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,192
was that a fabrication, too?

826
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,069
Oh, that incident
was real.

827
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,737
What I didn't tell you

828
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,489
was that after wrestling
with my ethics,

829
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,159
I realized that I'd
done the right thing

830
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,328
in order to
protect my people

831
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,913
from a very real threat.

832
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,539
Please.

833
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,130
I insist.

834
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,119
Captain...

835
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,085
Access their forward
sensor array.

836
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,963
You should find
neutrino emissions

837
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,383
at roughly 20,000 kilometers
off the port bow.

838
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,842
On screen.

839
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,014
Target two photon torpedoes.

840
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,850
When the first one
detonates,

841
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,060
the wormhole will open.

842
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,270
Use the second one

843
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,563
to destabilize
its subspace matrix.

844
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,607
That will destroy it.

845
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,734
Prax, report.

846
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,987
I've isolated
the bio-patterns.

847
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,666
Fire.

848
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,258
It should have detonated.

849
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,345
Those aren't neutrino emissions.

850
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,264
They're antimatter
residue signatures.

851
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,475
There's no
wormhole here.

852
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,354
You created false readings.

853
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:06,858
That is the theme
for this evening, isn't it?

854
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,694
Prax, do you have
the telepaths?

855
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,030
I have cargo containers...

856
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,952
filled with vegetables.

857
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,456
Return to the Bridge.

858
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,500
Computer,
change music selection.

859
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,918
Mahler's Symphony #1,
second movement.

860
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,962
Maybe this will help you relax.

861
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,508
DEVORE SOLDIER:
<i>Inspector, we've completed</i>
<i>our inventory of the vessel.</i>

862
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,385
<i>Two of their shuttlecraft</i>
<i>are missing.</i>

863
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,011
They couldn't have gone far.

864
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,430
Why didn't they appear
on our long-range scans?

865
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,806
Of course!

866
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,059
Adjust their scanners
to compensate

867
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,436
for refractive shielding.

868
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,188
Well, you gave us
the specifications.

869
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,482
Seemed a shame to waste them.

870
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,485
<i>We've located</i>
<i>the two shuttlecraft.</i>

871
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,987
<i>Range 20 million kilometers.</i>

872
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,240
Order our ships to pursue.

873
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,366
Maximum speed!

874
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,453
We're approaching
the coordinates.

875
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,372
I'm firing the torpedo.

876
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,763
The shuttles have disappeared
from sensors.

877
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:19,931
We've scanned for a wormhole.

878
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,850
If there was one,
it's gone.

879
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,269
(<i> sighs</i> )

880
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,188
I'll order Janeway
and her crew removed.

881
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,148
We'll confiscate the vessel,

882
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,277
deliver them to the nearest
detention center.

883
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,612
You're dismissed.

884
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,448
Imperative 12, Codicil Six
requires...

885
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:39,742
To hell with protocol, Prax!

886
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,369
Do you think either
of us will benefit

887
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,204
from having this failure
on our records?

888
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,039
As far as you're
concerned,

889
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,250
this incident never occurred.

890
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,709
Make sure
your teams share

891
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,795
that understanding.

892
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,840
(<i> music continues</i> )

893
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,396
Well played, Captain.

894
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,316
It seems I never did
earn your trust.

895
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,568
I had to take
a few precautions.

896
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,777
You understand.

897
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,196
Better than anyone.

898
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,990
I never lied to you.

899
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,950
My offer to take you with us
was genuine,

900
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,494
and it would still stand

901
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:25,037
if you'd kept
your part of the bargain.

902
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,916
For what it's worth...

903
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,420
you made a tempting offer.

904
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:40,303
The Bridge is yours.
