1
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,433
(<i> door chimes</i> )

2
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,059
Come in.

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,646
Seven of Nine's shipwide
efficiency analysis.

4
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,773
Did we get a passing grade?

5
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,151
Barely. She wants to present it
to the senior staff.

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,111
Put her on the schedule.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,947
We'll be passing
by a Class-T cluster

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,616
in the next couple of days--
gas giants,

9
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,744
radiogenic sources.
I'm not sure it's worth
altering course.

10
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:39,540
At the very least, we should
send the<i> Delta Flyer</i>
<i>for a look,</i>

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,793
and let's get a full range of
sensor scans as we get closer.

12
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,549
We'll go to a level-3
analysis of the cluster.

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,968
Tom, get the<i> Flyer</i> ready
and assemble an away team.

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,345
Harry, start
continuous scans.

15
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,724
Kim to Seven of Nine.
Proceed, Ensign.

16
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,977
Any chance you can increase
radiogenic resolution
in the long-range sensors?

17
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,103
The Captain wants
to get a cleaner look

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,189
at that cluster
coming up off starboard.

19
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,816
Acknowledged.

20
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,321
Take these specifications
to Lieutenant Torres.

21
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,698
Right away.

22
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,585
Deck 11.

23
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,930
What's our Borg
queen want now?

24
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,892
We need to route at least
another five terawatts

25
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,810
to the sensor array.

26
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,233
Deck 15.

27
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,868
Hello.

28
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,125
Sorry to interrupt.

29
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,961
I'm about to disprove

30
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,838
Schlezholt's theory
of multiple big bangs.

31
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,508
Of course, I had to demolish
Wang's second postulate
to do it.

32
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,761
Power transfer requisition.

33
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,139
You're standing in the way
of cosmological history.

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,559
The cosmos is
16 billion years old.

35
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,896
It can wait another few minutes.

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,990
Schlezholt would thank you
for the reprieve.

37
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,159
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53753.2.</i>

38
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,661
<i>Long-range scans</i>
<i>of the T-cluster</i>
<i>have indicated</i>

39
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,956
<i>a number</i>
<i>of tantalizing anomalies.</i>

40
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,832
<i>The away team should have</i>
<i>a field day.</i>

41
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,086
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>I may even join them myself.</i>

42
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,214
FEMALE (<i> whispering):</i>
<i>Billy...</i>

43
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,258
Mm...

44
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,177
Billy, wake up.

45
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,887
BILLY:
What do you want?

46
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,181
I need help.
Good night.

47
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,143
Billy, don't you dare
go back to sleep.

48
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,813
What's the problem?

49
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,564
I'm in trouble.

50
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,732
Go to sleep.

51
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,400
Help me first.

52
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,736
With what?

53
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,738
This level-3
sensor analysis.

54
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,033
I've got four hours of subspace
infrared to interpret.

55
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,495
Long-range scans
on that cluster up ahead?
Yes.

56
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,789
It's too complicated
to do over the com.

57
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,333
Either we meet in the Mess Hall,
or we wait until tomorrow.

58
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,418
(<i> groaning above</i> )
I don't want to get dressed,

59
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,962
and it can't wait
until tomorrow.

60
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,214
Your only options.

61
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,261
I've given operations
an efficiency rating of 76

62
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,180
out of a possible 100.

63
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,140
Not exactly flying colors.

64
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,975
The crewmen you assign
to the night shift

65
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,685
are frequently left
with little to do

66
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,854
once the ship's course
has been locked in.

67
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,897
The devil finds work
for idle hands.

68
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,399
Religious metaphors
are irrelevant.

69
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,861
Perhaps you should consider
assigning them additional tasks.

70
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:06,116
What's this I'm guilty of:
"failure to utilize expertise"?

71
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,163
Crewman Mortimer Harren.

72
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:15,125
He has five advanced degrees
in theoretical cosmology,

73
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,337
but you've assigned him
to the... Plasma Relay Room.

74
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,797
His talents could be put
to better use.

75
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,008
B'Elanna?
Believe me, I've tried.

76
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,593
When I give him
more responsibility,
he doesn't do the work.

77
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,555
Harren<i> wants</i> to be
down on Deck 15.

78
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,933
It gives him more time
to repostulate the origins
of the universe.

79
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,687
As you can see,
security is functioning
at near-perfect efficiency.

80
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,691
However, Commander,
if you arrange the phasers
in the weapons lockers

81
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,609
so that the smaller rifles
were in front, they could be

82
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,945
more easily removed
in the event of an emergency.

83
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,115
I'll look into it.

84
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,577
Crewman William Telfer.

85
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,163
Billy. He certainly
ruined<i> my</i> score.

86
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,917
He visits the Sick Bay
almost once a week
complaining of illness.

87
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,295
Invariably, you examine him
and find nothing wrong.

88
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,172
Mr. Telfer is a hypochondriac.

89
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,800
I'd treat him for it,
but he's afraid of medication.

90
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,302
Have you tried counseling?

91
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,096
He's afraid of that, too.

92
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,348
All I can do is scan him
and offer him reassurance.

93
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,059
Wasting your time
and medical resources.

94
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,353
What about Astrometrics?

95
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,480
Looks like you could use some
improvement yourself, Seven.

96
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,483
You're correct,
unfortunately.

97
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,364
Tal Celes,
Sensor Analyst, grade-3.

98
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,324
Her work must be
constantly double-checked.

99
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,785
She should be removed from
Astrometrics and reassigned

100
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,371
elsewhere-- perhaps
to Engineering.

101
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:38,375
Forget it. I've got my own
problems to fix, remember?

102
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,668
That'll be all, Seven.
Thank you.

103
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,255
Dismissed.

104
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,429
Captain?

105
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,099
They've never been
on an away mission.

106
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,685
Mortimer Harren...

107
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,731
William Telfer, Tal Celes--
none of them.

108
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,567
They get off the ship
whenever we have general leave.

109
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,611
I mean a working away mission.

110
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,488
Harren never volunteers,

111
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,366
Celes can't get past
the proficiency requirements,

112
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,702
and Telfer always seems
to get a note from his doctor.

113
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,455
Something's got to be done
about this.

114
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,832
What can we do?
There are always a few

115
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,251
who don't make it past
their first year on a starship.

116
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,295
Normally, they're reassigned.

117
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,173
But in our case, maybe we
should relieve them of duty

118
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,091
and let them pursue
their own interests.

119
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,302
It certainly wouldn't hurt
general efficiency.

120
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,805
They aren't drones, Chakotay.
We can't just deactivate them.

121
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,100
Is the<i> Delta Flyer</i> ready?

122
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,812
Flight-checked with provisions
for a 72-hour away mission.

123
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,649
What have you got in mind,
Captain?

124
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,866
Three people have slipped
through the cracks on my ship.

125
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,742
That makes it my problem.

126
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,171
The analytical aspects
of the subspace infrared
algorithm are fourfold.

127
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,465
Unfortunately, I have
a threefold brain.

128
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,384
You just have
to break it down.

129
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,719
Think of it as
four smaller algorithms.

130
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,762
Okay. But what's
the sequence?
It's...

131
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,140
Zero-G Is Fun.

132
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,766
As you were.

133
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,772
Zeta particle derivation.
Gamma wave frequency.

134
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,484
Ion distribution.
Flow rate of positrons.

135
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,278
Z.G.I.F.-- Zero-G Is Fun.

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,988
That's how you remember
the sequence.

137
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,448
Thank you,
Captain.

138
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,242
I'll try.
Good...

139
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,785
because where we're headed,
you're going to need it.

140
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,788
I'll be briefing you
this afternoon
in Astrometrics.

141
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,208
We'll leave first thing
in the morning.

142
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,338
(<i> sighs</i> )

143
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,303
Deck 15.

144
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,325
Captain on the deck!

145
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,993
At ease.

146
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,664
Junction Room 16?

147
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,625
Over there, Captain.
Of course.

148
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,964
Crewman Mitchell,
how have you been?

149
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,550
Uh, never better, ma'am.

150
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,218
Yourself?

151
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,555
Not bad. Not bad at all.

152
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,604
Uh, to the left, ma'am.

153
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,147
Thank you.

154
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,450
Crewman Harren.

155
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,203
Captain Janeway... are you lost?

156
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,789
I was, for a minute.

157
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,293
I'll be briefing you
this afternoon.

158
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,379
Well, there's been a mistake.

159
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,006
Excuse me?

160
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,716
You have me assigned
to an away mission.

161
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,512
I have my duties here.
I'd prefer not to leave my post.

162
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,639
Ensign Culhane
will cover for you.

163
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,058
The preflight schedule
is all there.

164
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,229
If this is charity, Captain,
I don't want it.

165
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,024
I didn't ask you what you want.

166
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,942
I'm taking
the<i> Delta Flyer</i>

167
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,861
on an astronomical
survey mission,

168
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,737
and your expertise
is needed.

169
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,115
What do you know
about my expertise?

170
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,742
As much as I need to.

171
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,329
Well, then you might be
interested to know

172
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,999
that I'm about to disprove
Schlezholt's theory
of multiple big bangs.

173
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,001
Really?

174
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,795
Wang's second postulate has more
lives than a cat, doesn't it?

175
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,755
Once you think
you've eliminated it,

176
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,299
bam, it pops
up again.

177
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,385
I'll give you a hand,
if you'd like,

178
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,637
when the away mission is over.

179
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,279
Once we reach the cluster,

180
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,281
we'll drop out of warp
and maintain

181
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,201
one-quarter impulse
on the sweep through
the protostars.

182
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,203
I'll be piloting
the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

183
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,665
Celes, you're going
to run an ongoing
sensor analysis,

184
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,042
providing data for
your colleagues.

185
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,836
Mr. Harren, you'll be
looking at subspace
particle decay

186
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:38,174
for anything new
we might learn
about star formation.

187
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,009
And, Mr. Telfer,

188
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,178
your job will be to
look for signs of life,

189
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,514
a long shot in
this environment.

190
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,850
But if it's out there,
I'm sure you'll find it.

191
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,644
You'll have the
rest of the evening

192
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,854
to familiarize yourselves
with the mission.

193
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,482
Excuse me, Captain.
If we find a planet,

194
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,444
we're not planning
on exploring the
surface, are we?

195
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,945
That's a
stellar nursery.

196
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,821
Any planets will
be gas giants.

197
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,199
They may have moons.
JANEWAY: Don't worry.

198
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,201
We'll run a complete scan
for pathogens

199
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,785
before we set foot anywhere,

200
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,705
and the<i> Delta Flyer</i>
<i>is fully equipped</i>

201
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,665
to deal with
medical emergencies.

202
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,709
We'll be fine.

203
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:16,504
Shuttle Bay 1,
0600 hours.

204
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,005
Dismissed.

205
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,973
Celes is unreliable.

206
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,559
Her sensor analyses
will be full of errors.

207
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,561
You could be putting
your lives at risk.

208
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,938
Don't worry, Seven,
I'll check her work.

209
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,774
This mission could be
better served

210
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,484
with a more
experienced crew.

211
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,901
No...

212
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,445
not<i> this</i> mission.

213
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,240
Ever hear the tale
of the Good Shepherd?

214
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,744
If even one sheep strayed
into the wilderness,

215
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,996
the shepherd left the
safety of the flock

216
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,665
and went after it.

217
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,917
So, you're intending
to<i> rescue</i> them?

218
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,670
In a manner
of speaking.

219
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,505
Maybe all it will
take will be

220
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,508
some personal attention
from their Captain,

221
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,718
maybe something more,

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,388
but I won't abandon
a member of this crew,

223
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,266
no matter what their
problems might be.

224
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,703
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Poor guy...

225
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,912
rotting away
down on Deck 15,

226
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,458
counting the years
till we get out of
this godforsaken Quadrant.

227
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,378
It's a shame he doesn't have
a superior officer who cares.

228
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,046
It's not my job

229
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,174
to make everybody
who works for me happy.

230
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,510
Some people just
don't want to fit in.

231
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,221
I'll bet you haven't
said two words to him.

232
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,890
Two words,<i> exactly.</i>

233
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,728
We collided in the corridor
during a Borg attack.
I said, "Excuse me."

234
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,522
Since we were at Red Alert
and about to be destroyed,

235
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,106
I think it was
very considerate of me.

236
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,775
Well, Mr. Considerate,

237
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,402
why don't you go
over there right now

238
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,822
and offer him
some encouragement?

239
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,782
His first away mission.

240
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,784
I'm sure he could use it.

241
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,463
Brushing up
on the<i> Delta Flyer</i> specs?

242
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm not a mechanic.

243
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,927
Oh.

244
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,346
Then, what<i> are</i>
<i>you doing?</i>

245
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,315
Very interesting.

246
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,986
What do you find
most interesting about it?

247
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,158
Your creative use
of the minus sign.

248
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,538
I see you have
a, uh, appreciation

249
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,498
for multivariate analysis.

250
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,709
Maybe you missed
your calling.

251
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,419
It's a shame.

252
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,838
I imagine it gets tedious
up at the helm.

253
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,633
I enjoy the view.

254
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,932
Well?

255
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,183
I invited him over

256
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,144
to watch our
television set tonight.

257
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,313
You don't mind,
do you?

258
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,780
TELFER:
Celes, Celes...

259
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,030
(<i> Celes mumbles sleepily</i> )

260
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,617
Respond. Celes, respond.

261
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,497
You're not sick.

262
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,081
Yes, I am.

263
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,249
No, you're not.

264
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,250
Really...

265
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,502
I am.

266
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,837
We have to sleep.

267
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,713
I can't go on this mission.

268
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,214
Yes, you can.
No, I can't.

269
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,758
Yes.
No.

270
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,844
Bye.
Wait.

271
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,098
See?

272
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,100
It's nothing.
It's a fever.

273
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,604
Your temperature is
.2 degrees above normal.
That's right.

274
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,107
A typical deviation
easily prompted by
emotional stress.

275
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,067
Or a multiphasic prion.

276
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,362
You have not been infected
by a prion.

277
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,239
They attach themselves
to the mitochondrial walls,
and they just...

278
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,201
I've already scanned you.
You can barely see them.

279
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,661
They aren't there.

280
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,579
If they migrate
to my cell membranes

281
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,289
while I'm on the away mission,
they could rupture and I...

282
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,042
Crewman, I am not giving
you a medical excuse...

283
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,670
not this time.

284
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,755
Try to get some sleep.

285
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,424
You shouldn't
even<i> have</i>
<i>a medical tricorder.</i>

286
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,594
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Believe me...

287
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,014
you'll be so caught up in
the excitement of exploration,

288
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,392
there won't be any time
for worrying about infections,

289
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,435
mitochondrial
or otherwise.

290
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,145
There's nothing like
an away mission

291
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,357
to remind a person
of why we're out here.

292
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,037
I'm going
to one-quarter impulse.

293
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,121
Should I start
the sensor sweeps?

294
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,541
We don't want
to miss anything.

295
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,125
Engine status?

296
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,377
Within parameters.

297
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,754
That wasn't us.

298
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,380
Anything on sensors?

299
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,759
.005 fluctuation in
the spatial continuum.

300
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,011
It looks like simple
background noise.

301
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,806
I agree.

302
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,349
TELFER:
Anybody for lunch?

303
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,060
Are you volunteering,
William?

304
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,937
Yes, ma'am.
I'll help.

305
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,772
What would you
like, Captain?

306
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,648
Mortimer?

307
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,609
Even my mother
didn't call me that.

308
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,152
Well, then, Mr. Harren,
are you hungry?

309
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,487
No.

310
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,656
Thank you.

311
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,784
I'll have
the pasta soup.

312
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,536
It should be listed
under Neelix 651.

313
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,080
Maybe I'll try that, too.

314
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,873
I'm sure you'll like it.

315
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,834
I'm sure I will.
Thanks for the suggestion.

316
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,923
I'd better get
back there.

317
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,473
Neelix 651,
two servings.

318
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,477
Neelix 651,
two servings.

319
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,022
What's wrong?

320
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,068
The Captain checks
every single thing I do.

321
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,029
Oh... that's
just standard procedure.

322
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,074
Then, why isn't it
standard procedure
for you or Harren?

323
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,242
Maybe she's giving you
special attention.

324
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,037
Yeah, because she
knows I need it.

325
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,000
I wish I could go
back to<i> Voyager.</i>

326
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,710
Me, too.

327
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,130
There's always the escape pods.

328
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,924
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Can you imagine?

329
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,178
I understand you grew up
on Vico V.

330
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,848
No wonder you became
a cosmologist.

331
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,183
Wildest sky in
the Alpha Quadrant.

332
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,935
So they say.
I've never been there.

333
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,687
Do you really believe

334
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,396
that childhood environment
is more important

335
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,025
than genetically driven
behavior patterns?

336
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,027
Just making conversation.

337
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,487
Conversation filled
with unspoken assumptions,

338
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,031
which I don't agree with.

339
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,158
I'm a product of
my nucleic acids.

340
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,785
Where and how
I was raised
are beside the point,

341
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,829
so if you're trying
to understand me better,

342
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,498
questions about my home planet
are irrelevant.

343
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,209
All right, then.

344
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,336
How's your 13th chromosome?

345
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,507
Missing a couple of base pairs
in gene 178?

346
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,220
I signed onto<i> Voyager</i>
<i>because I needed a year</i>

347
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,805
of hands-on experience.

348
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,431
It was a requirement for getting

349
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,267
into the Institute of Cosmology
on Orion I.

350
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,270
If we hadn't gotten lost
in the Delta Quadrant,

351
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,356
I'd be there right now.

352
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,817
Sorry to have delayed
your career plans,

353
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,277
but all of us have had
our lives interrupted.

354
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,823
That's the nature
of space exploration.
It's unpredictable.

355
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,035
Which is why I don't
like space exploration.

356
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,788
Stumbling from star to star
like a drunken insect

357
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,540
careening toward
a light source

358
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,543
is not my idea of a
dignified existence.

359
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,337
Pure theory is all
that concerns me.

360
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,507
Well, I'm not trying
to change that.

361
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,968
I'm simply trying to get
every member of my crew working

362
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,344
to their full capacity.

363
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,971
That includes you,
Mr. Harren.

364
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,974
You don't feel responsible,
Captain...

365
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,769
for having three misfits
aboard your ship?

366
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,437
Well, if there's
anything I can do

367
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,981
to help relieve your guilt...

368
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,983
please let me know.

369
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,278
I'll keep that in mind.

370
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,951
Maybe I will join my
colleagues for lunch.

371
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,662
All this<i> exploration</i>
<i>has given me</i>
<i>an appetite.</i>

372
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,543
(<i> console beeping</i> )

373
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,760
Computer, identify the source
of that spatial fluctuation.

374
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,553
Source unknown.

375
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,601
Red Alert!

376
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,603
Aft section, report!

377
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,981
Report!

378
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,738
Captain, are you all right?

379
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,531
We need to get
propulsion back on line

380
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,909
and figure out what hit us.

381
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,037
What's out there?
I don't know,
but whatever it was,

382
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,290
it tore a plating section
off the outer hull.

383
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,708
90 percent of our antimatter's
been neutralized.

384
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,335
The reaction's cold.

385
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,920
So much for warp drive.

386
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,630
I'm bringing
the impulse engines on line,

387
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,132
but they've
been damaged.

388
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,969
We'll be able
to do one-eighth
impulse, no more.

389
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,512
That should get us
to the rendezvous point

390
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,555
with<i> Voyager</i>
<i>in about ten years.</i>

391
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,099
Think they'll wait for us?

392
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:33,769
Is the subspace
transmitter on line?

393
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,479
<i>Voyager,</i> this is
the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

394
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,481
We've been hit
by an unknown phenomenon

395
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,193
and taken heavy damage.
We require immediate assistance.

396
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,778
Repeat: we require
immediate assistance.

397
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,865
Transmit that continuously
on all subspace frequencies.

398
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,950
Anything on
active scans?
Not yet.

399
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,036
It was a dark-matter
protocomet.

400
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,206
I read a paper
on that phenomenon once.
Written by me.

401
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,749
Well, enlighten us,
Mr. Harren.

402
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,794
I hypothesized
that a tertiary product

403
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,671
of stellar consolidation
would be

404
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,923
a comet-like assemblage
of dark matter.

405
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,800
It would be attracted
to any source of antimatter

406
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,927
and neutralize it
upon contact.

407
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,763
So, one of these things detected
the antimatter in our warp core?

408
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,974
The term "detected" suggests
a consciousness.

409
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,728
This is a mindless
astrophysical phenomenon,
nothing more.

410
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,271
We should eject
our remaining antimatter

411
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,190
or we could suffer
another impact.

412
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,774
I can't do that,

413
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,985
not on the basis
of an unproven hypothesis.

414
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,529
The forces involved
are nontrivial--
if we're hit again,

415
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,531
we could lose
our entire outer hull.

416
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,616
Eject the warp core,
and we lose any hope

417
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,160
of getting warp drive back.

418
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,661
I need more evidence,

419
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,121
and right now,
sensors aren't talking.

420
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,040
Maybe they<i> are</i> talking,

421
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,791
but somebody doesn't know
how to listen to them.

422
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,417
You're out of line, crewman.

423
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,212
This isn't the time
to be worried

424
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,172
about her feelings, Captain.
We're in trouble.

425
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,715
Captain, that hull plate--

426
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,508
it's less
than ten kilometers away.

427
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,219
Impact from a dark-matter body

428
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,929
might've left a quantum
signature in the alloys.

429
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,014
JANEWAY:
That's the evidence
we're looking for.

430
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,059
Do we have transporters?
Yes, I've locked on
to the plate.

431
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,852
JANEWAY:
Beam it directly
to the aft section.

432
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,145
Celes, you're with me.

433
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,772
Continue the repairs.

434
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,241
No sign of burns...

435
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,786
or plasma residue.

436
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,874
It seems to have been
sheared off.

437
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,210
Download this
into the main computer.

438
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,889
Captain, I'm sorry.
For what?

439
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,933
I thought that
spatial fluctuation

440
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,851
we ran into was
background noise.

441
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,519
Some noise.

442
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,688
I saw the same
sensor readings you did

443
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,523
and came
to the same conclusion.

444
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,110
You don't have to doubt
yourself all the time.

445
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,195
Yes, I do, and
you should, too.

446
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,864
You're right to
always be looking
over my shoulder.

447
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,575
We all make mistakes,
even me.

448
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,786
Every day?

449
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,456
Every time you
report for duty?

450
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,207
On<i> Voyager,</i>
<i>it doesn't matter,</i>

451
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,335
because nothing I do
is that critical.

452
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,628
Seven doesn't trust me
with anything important.

453
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,006
The crew is protected
from my mistakes

454
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,383
by the people
around me, but...

455
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,760
out here I could
get us killed.

456
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,472
You went through
Starfleet training courses.

457
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,974
I had to cram for every exam.

458
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,353
At the Academy, I was infamous
for my all-nighters.

459
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,856
Every night?
Because that's what it took.

460
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,317
That's the only way
I made it through.

461
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,735
Not to mention
the sympathy votes.

462
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,405
The conflict on Bajor
worked in my favor.

463
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,907
The Federation was so eager
to have Bajorans in Starfleet

464
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,119
that my instructors gave me
the benefit of the doubt.

465
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,580
So did you, when you accepted
my application.

466
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,460
You showed evidence
of unconventional thinking.
I liked that.

467
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:48,047
Not everybody would've thought
to retrieve that hull plating.

468
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,840
Well, just don't trust me
with the analysis.

469
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,549
I guarantee I'll get it wrong.

470
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,719
Well, with that attitude,
I'm sure you will.

471
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,972
This has nothing to do
with attitude, Captain.

472
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,683
You and I are wired differently.

473
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,478
To you,
this is nothing but data.

474
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,316
To me, it... it's a monster
with-with fangs and claws.

475
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:11,111
In my nightmares,
I am chased by algorithms.

476
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,073
My brain just wasn't built
to understand this.

477
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,327
We can find you
another post on<i> Voyager.</i>

478
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:22,831
(<i> sighs</i> ):
There isn't another post
on<i> Voyager,</i> not for me...

479
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,625
unless you need a waitress
in the Mess Hall.

480
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,253
You know...

481
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,797
there's more to duty
than the ability

482
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,342
to manipulate algorithms.

483
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,511
Everybody on<i> Voyager</i>
<i>has showed</i>

484
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,596
a courage far beyond
what I could've expected.

485
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,391
So have you.

486
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,268
If we were still
in the Alpha Quadrant,

487
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,602
would that be enough
to keep me on board?

488
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,732
I can't answer that.

489
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,319
I don't deserve to be
on your ship, Captain.

490
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,613
And I'm not really
a part of <i> Voyager.</i>

491
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,408
I just live there.

492
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,500
Pressure's increasing.
The EPS relays are fused.

493
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,668
Cut the plasma flow.

494
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,712
Cut the plasma...!

495
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,470
I could've been killed.
What's wrong with you?

496
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,513
Everything.

497
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,849
If you want something
to fantasize about,

498
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,768
try imagining how it'll feel
if our hull is breached

499
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,353
and we die of vacuum exposure.

500
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,063
Our blood
will vaporize,

501
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,149
and our cell membranes
will rupture.

502
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,318
Surely you know the symptoms
better than I do.

503
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,612
Let's not talk
about it, all right?

504
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,863
Nothing disagrees with me

505
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,032
more than having to put theories
into practical use,

506
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,328
but there's no choice,
so pay attention to what
we're doing here.

507
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,746
You can check yourself
into Sick Bay when we get back.

508
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,915
And you can go back
to Deck 15.

509
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,251
That's right...

510
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,003
where I don't have
to rely on you

511
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,297
or your intellectually
deficient friend.

512
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,800
At least I have a friend.

513
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,598
Don't you ever get
lonely down there?

514
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,101
In the company
of my own thoughts?

515
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,769
Never.

516
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,272
I don't believe that.

517
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,359
Spend some time with us
when we get back.

518
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,277
You might enjoy yourself.

519
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,322
A hypothesis
that would require testing.

520
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,283
I'm a theoretician,
remember?

521
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:26,205

<i>Stardate 53764.3.</i>

522
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,582
<i>We've been running on</i>
<i>minimal power for six hours.</i>

523
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,626
<i>Still no response</i>
<i>to our distress call,</i>

524
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:33,086

525
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,297
<i>For now, it looks like</i>
<i>we're on our own.</i>

526
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,966
Our scans of the hull fragment
were inconclusive.

527
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,843
We found
some displaced positrons

528
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,304
that could indicate
a dark-matter impact.

529
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,515
But could've been caused
by something else?

530
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,684
Proof enough.
Not enough for me.

531
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,270
Not enough to jettison
the remaining antimatter.

532
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,189
There's a gas giant

533
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,483
only a few hours
from our current position.

534
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,194
T-class, surrounded
by orbital rings,

535
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,572
including one
that's radiogenic.

536
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,365
We could use those particles

537
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,492
to reinitialize
our warp reaction.

538
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,411
With ten percent of
our antimatter left,

539
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,329
we'd only be able
to make warp 2,

540
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,623
but it would be enough to
get us back on the road.

541
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,166
Set a course.

543
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,131
Another spatial
fluctuation.

544
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,592
Can you localize it?

545
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,093
It's somewhere within
the distance

546
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,136
of 10,000 kilometers.

547
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,891
Another one, closer,
about 7,000 kilometers.

548
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,560
It's being drawn
toward our antimatter.

549
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,061
Eject the core.

550
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,398
Open a channel.
All hailing frequencies.

551
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,235
This is Captain Janeway
of the Federation Vessel
<i>Delta Flyer.</i>

552
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,987
We are on a mission
of peaceful exploration.

553
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,989
Please identify yourself.

554
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,036
No response.

555
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,663
Of course not.
It's a natural phenomenon.

556
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,123
Captain, we only have
a few seconds.

557
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,792
I'm firing a photon torpedo.

558
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,961
There's enough antimatter
in the detonation chamber

559
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,047
to draw that protocomet,
if that's what it is.

560
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,009
The torpedo's away.

561
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,887
Distance: 1,000

562
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,223
1,500.

00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,267
No spatial disruptions.

Oh, no.

That's not possible.

JANEWAY:
Where is he?

569
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,752
I can't locate
his bio-signature.

570
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,295
He's not out there.

571
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,172
He's not in space,
not in subspace.

572
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,757
It doesn't make sense.

Try to get a lock on

00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,712
Tricorder isn't
picking up anything.
But I can feel it.

579
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,465
I-I can't get a lock.
It's like something's there,
but it's not there.

00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,924
Oh, it's there.

(<i> gasping</i> )

582
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,054
Unfortunately,
I have to agree.

583
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,015
Obviously, whatever hit us
was no protocomet. I was wrong.

584
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,684
Maybe you weren't,
not entirely.

585
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,310
Sensors can't scan it;

586
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,270
transporters
can't lock on to it.

587
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,106
Maybe this is some kind
of dark-matter life-form.

588
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,442
That's impossible.
Molecules that complex

589
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,237
would collapse
under their own weight.
They could never support life.

590
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,197
Might be time
to revise your theory.

591
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,324
Where did
they take you?

592
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,327
I don't know.
It was dark.

593
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,496
Hot, I could feel breathing
all around me.

594
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:58,041
Did anyone try to
communicate with you?
I couldn't see.

595
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,920
I tried to say something,
but there wasn't enough air.

596
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,049
I tried to move, but something
was pressing down on me.

597
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,801
(<i> panting</i> )

598
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,095
The hypospray-- tetrovaline.
It'll put me out.

599
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,557
If I sedate you, it could
lower your immune response,

600
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,392
and you need to stay conscious.

601
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,894
Do you understand?

602
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,355
Billy...

603
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,733
if it wanted to kill you,
it would've done it by now.

604
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:25,193
It never would've
sent you back here.

605
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,112
Maybe it was trying
to scan you or something.

606
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:31,742
If it wanted
to get to know me better...

607
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,952
it should've just asked me out
for a drink.

612
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,437
I'm setting a course
for those rings.

613

Shunt as much power as you can
to the impulse engines.

614
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,107
We never should've
left<i> Voyager.</i>

615
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,776
I've got news
for you, crewman.

616
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,360
<i>Voyager</i> isn't exactly
a safe haven.

617
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,237
We've been chased
across the Quadrant

618
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,448
by far worse
than whatever's out there--

619
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,285
the Vidiians,
Species 8472, the Borg--

620
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,413
but I guess if somebody's
hiding down on Deck 15,

621
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,165
they may not
be aware of it.

622
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,375
I wasn't meant
to be an explorer.

623
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,337
And I wasn't meant
to guide a ship across
an unknown Quadrant.

624
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,840
Then we're both victims
of circumstance.

625
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,008
Oh, I've seen things
I've never imagined,

626
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,594
grown closer to people
than I ever thought possible.

627
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,387
I wouldn't call myself a victim,

628
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,015
and I wouldn't trade
the last six years for anything.

629
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,433
Then you've
been deluded

630
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,101
by the inexhaustible
human capacity

631
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,228
to avoid the truth.

632
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,230
You're the one hiding, not me.

633
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,067
I've got you three
more percentage
points of impulse.

634
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,194
I'll take it.

635
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,070
Setting a course.

636
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,162
Isn't there any part of you
that feels a bond

637
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,747
with the rest of us?

638
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,165
When we escape
from the Borg

639
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,876
or discover
a new type of star,

640
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,004
don't you feel
some pride of accomplishment?

641
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,006
When you're
in the Mess Hall,

642
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,091
alone at your table
in the corner,

643
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,219
don't you see
the friendships around you

644
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,390
and wish even for a microsecond
you were part of them?

645
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,062
You don't know me at all.

646
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,148
No, but I'd like to.

647
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,359
That was the whole point
of this mission.

648
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:35,073
But I guess it hasn't
worked out like I planned.

Maybe not. There's a .005

You don't know that.
We were at risk.

00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,931
I could hear

what it was thinking.

692
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,357
"Do not belong."

693
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,901
That's what it said:
"Do not belong."

694
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,695
We don't belong here.

695
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,238
Or it didn't belong
in the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

696
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,575
Maybe that's why it was tapping
into the environmental controls.

697
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,996
It was trying to survive
in a place it didn't belong.

698
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:49,332
That's speculation.
Based on direct observation.

699
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,250
You murdered an alien being
and destroyed

700
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,962
any chance we had
to make first contact.

701
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,799
(<i> computer beeping</i> )

702
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,968
We just lost
another section of hull.

703
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,928
How far are we
from the gas giant?

704
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,889
200,000 kilometers.

705
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,099
I'm taking the<i> Flyer</i>
<i>into the radiogenic ring.</i>

706
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,226
With any luck,
they won't follow.

707
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,353
We can't survive in there
for more than a few minutes.

708
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,565
That should be enough
to reinitialize the warp core.

709
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,168
Start continuous transport
of radiogenic particles

710
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,128
directly into
the reaction chamber.

711
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,881
When it's approaching
critical mass, let me know.

712
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,926
Watch for any sign
of pursuit.

713
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,011
How are you doing?

714
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:46,514
I always had this alarm
in my head,

715
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:50,227
sort of an internal
Red Alert.

716
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,979
It was like a warning system

717
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,733
that would tell me
I was sick or dying...

718
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,610
of something.

719
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:03,573
Mitochondrial prions,
food poisoning, a head cold.

720
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,202
It was always there.

721
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,370
And now it's not?

722
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,582
It's gone.

723
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,461
I don't understand.

724
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:20,132
Maybe I do.

725
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,717
When I was a girl, I was
afraid of the ocean.

726
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,220
I liked to swim, but,
uh, in a pool or a pond,

727
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,055
where I knew exactly
what was beneath me.

728
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,640
But in the open water,

729
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,309
with no way to know
what was down there...

730
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,936
it scared me to death.

731
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,648
It wasn't until my first
year at the Academy,

732
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,735
after I went through zero-G
training in the Coral Sea...

733
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,572
that I finally
got over it.

734
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:50,411
I think you just came up
from your first deep dive.

735
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,081
(<i> computer beeping</i> )
They're in pursuit.

736
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,756
Three minutes, 20
seconds to intercept.

737
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,342
We'll need twice that
to reinitialize warp reaction.

738
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,427
Get into the escape pods.

739
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,971
Captain.

740
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,931
Plot a course
away from the planet.

741
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,599
I'm going to fire
a phaser volley

742
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,643
and hopefully set off
a chain reaction

743
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,270
of the radiogenic particles.

744
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,272
It might be enough
to disable our friends.

745
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,607
You'll be disabled, too.
Not if I go to
full thrusters

746
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,400
and keep in front
of the shock wave.

747
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,112
If I don't make it,

748
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,989
head for the L-Class moon
in the next system.

749
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,200
You could survive there
for weeks if you have to--

750
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,618
enough time
for<i> Voyager</i> to pick up
your distress signal.

751
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,330
Now get moving.
No.

752
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,623
You'll have
a better chance
if we're with you.

753
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,458
Go.

754
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,711
We might not have
contributed much
on<i> Voyager,</i>

755
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,796
but what we do here matters.
We're the crew here,

756
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,465
and the crew does not abandon
its captain.

757
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,520
All right, it's your choice.

758
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,690
Then I'll be going alone.

759
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,318
Good luck.

760
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,947
Charge phaser banks.

761
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,076
Stand by to divert
all power to thrusters.

762
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,704
Escape Pod 1 is occupied
and ready, Captain.

763
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,539
Launch Pod 1.

764
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,250
Escape pod away.

765
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,918
How close are
our pursuers?

766
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,669
65 seconds to intercept.

767
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,171
Stand by to fire.

768
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,050
Captain, the escape pod
is altering course.

769
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,134
It's heading for the aliens.

770
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,844
Janeway to Harren.

771
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,179
What are you doing?

772
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,972
If they have to deal with me,

773
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,808
it should give you
a few more seconds to get away.

774
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,227
That's my theory, anyway.

775
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,978
Resume your escape course now.

776
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,813
It's too late for that.

777
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,191
You made a mistake, Harren.
Don't make another one.

778
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,817
I'm done hiding, Captain.

779
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,320
A few seconds of exposure
to real life...

780
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,906
maybe I'll understand
what I've been missing.

781
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,534
He closed the channel.

782
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,745
Get a transporter
lock on that pod.

783
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,206
I-I can't. We're out of range.

784
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,292
More power to
the thrusters.

785
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,882
Celes.

786
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,801
We're still not close enough.

787
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,344
Thrusters at maximum.

788
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,352
Got him.
Fire.

789
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,987
Shock wave approaching.

790
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,448
Contact in four... three...

791
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,992
two... one.

792
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,912
More or less.

793
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,081
(<i> groaning</i> )

794
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,267
My crew...
Easy.

795
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:05,648
They're sleeping.

796
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,400
No serious injuries.

797
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,610
Everyone's
all right...

798
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,363
though you gave us
a good scare for a while.

799
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,449
We received
your distress call.

800
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:17,327
We found the<i> Flyer</i>
<i>drifting above a gas giant.</i>

801
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,371
You were all unconscious.

802
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,789
Any sign of...

803
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:25,084
another vessel or
some kind of entity?

804
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,461
No.

805
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,963
(<i> sighs</i> )

806
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,134
What happened?

807
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,556
The Good Shepherd went
after some lost sheep...

808
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,977
and ran into a wolf.

809
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,523
Did she find them?

810
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,118
I think she did.
