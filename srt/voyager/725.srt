Voyager <i>captivated the hearts</i>

[indistinct conversation]

12
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,629
Hi! Good to see you!

13
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,130
-[woman] We must get together.
-[man] Dinner next week, then.

14
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,840
-Great.
-I'm looking forward to it.

15
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,966
Okay.

16
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,845
Hello.

17
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,724
-What's your name?
-Harry. What's yours?

18
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,685
Sabrina.

19
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,603
-Naomi's daughter?
-Uh-huh.

20
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,271
You've gotten so big.

21
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,690
I don't remember you.

22
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,943
I haven't come to one of these
reunions in four years.

23
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,069
Why?

24
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,238
I've been on
a deep space assignment.

25
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,197
For four years?

26
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,659
Compared to how long
I was on<i> Voyager,</i>

27
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,411
it seemed like a long weekend.

28
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,663
Can you find your mother for me?

29
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,540
-Uh-huh.
-I'd like to say hi.

30
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,000
Oops. Here you are, Captain.

31
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,836
Thank you, Admiral.

32
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,963
I haven't seen her
since she was a baby.

33
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,716
It's amazing how fast you've all grown.

34
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,635
How's Tuvok?

35
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,262
Not well.

36
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,597
I thought maybe
I'd go see him tomorrow.

37
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,808
Oh, that would be nice.

38
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,185
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.

39
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,729
I should have been there.

40
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,023
You were on a mission.
Everyone understood.

41
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,276
It's so good to see you, Harry.

42
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,574
-Doc.
-Mr. Paris!

43
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:05,287
<i>Voyager's </i>pilot, medic,
and occasional thorn in my side.

44
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,788
Where have you been
hiding yourself?

45
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,457
I've been busy.

46
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,916
New holo-novel?

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,587
I'll make sure to get your input
before I send it off to my publisher.

48
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,299
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your date?

49
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,428
Mr. Paris, meet Lana,
my blushing bride.

50
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,846
You're married?

51
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,098
Tomorrow is our two-week
anniversary.

52
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,350
Well, congratulations.

53
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,187
My invitation must have gotten
lost in subspace.

54
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,605
Oh, you should be flattered.

55
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,690
We took a page from your book
and eloped.

56
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,860
Joe has a real flair
for romantic gestures.

57
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,986
Joe?

58
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,405
I decided I couldn't
get married without a name.

59
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:45,035
It took you 33 years
to come up with Joe?

60
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,287
It was Lana's grandfather's name.

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,832
Oh. Oh, so you're not a...

62
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,918
A hologram? No.

63
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,921
Frankly, Mr. Paris,
I'm surprised you'd even ask.

64
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,173
I thought we were beyond
those sorts of distinctions.

65
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,591
Are you kidding?
I think it's great.

66
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,676
I'm in a mixed marriage myself,
remember?

67
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,553
Speaking of which,
where is that wife of yours?

68
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,223
The High Council
had a lot of questions.

69
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,141
What did you tell them?

70
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,561
The truth... with a Klingon twist.

71
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,189
I told them that my beloved
former captain,

72
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,359
who had saved my life
many times in glorious battle,

73
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,570
would be honored to submit
Korath's House for consideration.

74
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,863
Do you think it will work?

75
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,907
I'm just the Federation liaison,

76
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,535
but I'd like to think
I have some influence.

77
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,248
You still haven't told me
why you're trying to help Korath.

78
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,208
He's an old friend.

79
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,711
Would this old friend
have anything to do

80
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,505
with the mission
that you sent my daughter on?

81
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,716
Sorry, B'Elanna, but you know
I can't talk about that.

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,593
Couldn't you at least have
waited until after the reunion?

83
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,596
-She really wanted to be here.
-She'll be home soon, I promise.

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,515
[tapping on glass]

85
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,935
[Barclay] May I have
everyone's attention, please?

86
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,232
Ten years ago tonight,

87
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,358
this crew returned home

88
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,737
from the longest away mission
in Starfleet's history.

89
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,281
[laughter]

90
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,576
23 years together
made you a family,

91
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,704
one I'm proud
to have been adopted by.

92
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,832
So let's raise our glasses...

93
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,333
To the journey.

94
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,168
[all]
To the journey.

95
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,297
And to those who aren't here
to celebrate it with us.

96
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,514
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet the Borg.

97
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,726
Over the course of this term,

98
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,479
you're going to become intimately
familiar with the Collective.

99
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,024
You'll learn
about the assimilation process,

100
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,777
the Borg hierarchy,
and the psychology of the Hive mind.

101
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,072
And when it comes
to your performance in this class,

102
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,658
my expectations are
going to be no different

103
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,368
than the Borg queen herself--
perfection.

104
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,329
[all laugh]

105
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:56,166
This semester,
we are<i> very</i> fortunate

106
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,627
to have a special guest lecturer--

107
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,505
the woman who literally
wrote the book on the Borg--

108
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,299
Admiral Kathryn Janeway.

109
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,260
-[applause]
-Thank you, Commander.

110
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,471
I'm glad to be here.

111
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,265
A question already, Cadet?

112
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,976
I suppose it could wait
until after class, Admiral.

113
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,896
As they say in the Temporal
Mechanics Department,

114
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,481
there's no time like the present.

115
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,194
In the year 2377, you aided
the Borg resistance movement

116
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,487
known as Unimatrix Zero.

117
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,656
Sounds like someone's
been reading ahead.

118
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,033
I thought you had a question, Cadet.

119
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,828
Yes, ma'am.
When you informed the Queen

120
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,581
that you were going to liberate
thousands of her drones,

121
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,583
could you describe
the look on her face?

122
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,169
[group chuckles]

123
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,671
[female cadet]
Admiral?

124
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,466
Some of us were talking before class,
and we were curious.

125
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,303
How extensive was Seven of Nine's
involvement with Unimatrix Zero?

126
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,890
I'd, uh...

127
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,559
prefer not to discuss Seven of Nine.

128
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,853
Yes, ma'am.

129
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,355
Sorry.

130
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,903
[indistinct whispering]

131
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,530
Excuse me.

132
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:18,081
Okay. Uh, who can tell me
a little about nanotechnology?

133
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,585
<i>I'm sorry to pull you</i>
<i>out of class, Admiral.</i>

134
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,754
-Did you see it?
-<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

135
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,965
-And?
-<i>It works.</i>

136
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,260
Korath has agreed to the exchange?

137
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,262
<i>Yes.</i>

138
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,055
But?

139
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,266
<i>He's insisting on handing it</i>
<i>over to you personally.</i>

140
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,146
I'll be there as soon as I can.

141
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,647
Good work, Ensign Paris.

142
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,919
Hello, Tuvok.

143
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,963
-The light.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

144
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,684
-I know you.
-That's right. I'm your friend.

145
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,978
Kathryn Janeway, remember?

146
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,273
You're an impostor.

147
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,400
No, Tuvok. It's me.

148
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,738
Admiral Janeway visits on Sunday.
Today is Thursday.

149
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,075
Logic dictates that you are not
who you claim to be.

150
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,416
How are you?

151
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,627
I am close to completing my work.

152
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,253
I'm glad to hear it.

153
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,799
It is difficult
with so many interruptions.

154
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,384
I'm sorry.
Would you like me to leave?

155
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,971
You may stay.

156
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,728
[quietly]
Tuvok.

157
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,857
There's something I need to tell you.

158
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,902
It's very important.

159
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,456
I'm going away...

160
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,043
and I may not see you again.

161
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,678
Commander Barclay and the Doctor
will continue to visit you.

162
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,763
They'll bring you anything you need.

163
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,852
The Doctor comes on Wednesdays.

164
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,229
Commander Barclay's visits are...

165
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,648
e-erratic.

166
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,181
Goodbye, Tuvok.

167
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,209
You must be the<i> only </i>doctor
who still makes house calls.

168
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,501
What are your symptoms?

169
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,170
I'm perfectly fine.

170
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,088
For 33 years you fought me

171
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,840
every time you were due
for a physical.

172
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,635
Now you ask me to give you one
ahead of schedule.

173
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,261
I'm taking a trip. I just wanted

174
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,513
to get our appointment
out of the way before I left.

175
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,307
-That's all?
-That's all.

176
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,018
Hmm. The good news<i> is</i>

177
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,104
you're as healthy as you were
the first day I examined you.

178
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,399
Well, now that's out of the way,
have a seat.

179
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,277
We didn't get to talk much
at the party.

180
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,446
No. I don't suppose we did.

181
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,823
So, how's married life?

182
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,741
Wonderful. You should try it.

183
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,743
Oh, I think
it's a little late for that.

184
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,622
Marriage is for the young,
like your wife.

185
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,418
I can only hope she ages
as gracefully as you have.

186
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,879
I, of course, will be the same
handsome hologram

187
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,339
20 years from now as I am today.

188
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,008
I've been meaning to ask you.

189
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,095
Are you familiar
with a drug called chronexaline?

190
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,389
We've been testing it
at Starfleet Medical

191
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,141
to determine if it can protect
biomatter from tachyon radiation.

192
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,643
And?

193
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,852
It's very promising.

194
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,187
Why do you ask?

195
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,857
I need 2,000 milligrams
by tomorrow afternoon.

196
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,529
-Why?
-That's classified.

197
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,322
Will you get it for me?

198
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,575
[sighs]

199
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,037
Of course, Admiral.
You'll have it by 0900.

200
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,163
Thank you.

201
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,088
<i>Download complete.</i>

202
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,549
This should be everything you need.

203
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,927
The shuttle?

204
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,846
Waiting for you
at the Oakland shipyard.

205
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,225
-I wish you'd let me come with you.
-Sorry, Reg, but this is my mission.

206
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,269
Besides, if you leave,
there won't anyone

207
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,439
to teach those eager young
cadets about the Borg.

208
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,690
Oh.

209
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,448
I made you some fresh tea for the trip,
not that replicated stuff.

210
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,076
Thank you. For everything.

211
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,495
I wouldn't have been able
to do this without you.

212
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,289
Oh, don't remind me.

213
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,426
Any final words of advice
for your old captain?

214
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,596
Wait. Don't tell me.
I'm being impulsive.

215
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,931
I haven't considered
all the consequences.

216
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,641
It's too risky.

217
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,729
Thanks for the input,

218
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,274
but I've got to do
what I think is right.

219
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,570
I know it wasn't easy

220
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,239
living all these years
without her, Chakotay.

221
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,997
But when I'm through,
things might be better for all of us.

222
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,128
Trust me.

223
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,807
Tom?

224
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,433
[sleepy mumbling]

225
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,977
Tom.

226
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,687
I'm sleeping.

227
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,398
It's time.

228
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,525
For what?

229
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,527
I'll give you one guess.

230
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,904
Ohh.

231
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,159
Paris to...

232
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,705
Paris to Sick Bay. It's time.

233
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,708
[Doctor]
<i>Remain calm, Mr. Paris. Can she stand?</i>

234
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,837
Affirmative.

235
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,089
<i>Then I suggest</i>
<i>you report to Sick Bay.</i>

236
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,215
Right.

237
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,593
What about B'Elanna?

238
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,761
<i>Her, too.</i>

239
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,221
Right, of course.

240
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,473
Maybe we should take
the transporter.

241
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,183
Hey, wait for me!

242
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,566
Hmm...

243
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,317
What do you mean by "hmm"?

244
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:47,280
You're going to have
a very healthy baby,

245
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,906
but not tonight.

246
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,658
Tell me you're joking.

247
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,660
You're experiencing false labor,
Lieutenant.

248
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,079
-Again?
-As I explained the last time,

249
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,748
it's a common occurrence,
especially among Klingons.

250
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,252
I want this thing out of me<i> now!</i>

251
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,670
Misdirected rage--

252
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,839
another common occurrence
among Klingons.

253
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,592
-Can't you induce?
-I wouldn't recommend it.

254
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,219
If this keeps happening,
we'll never get any sleep.

255
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,096
You think it's bad now?

256
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,807
-When?
-0400.

257
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,684
How many false alarms
does that make?

258
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,852
Three that we know of.

259
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,187
That baby is as stubborn
as her mother.

260
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,481
Harry's starting a pool
to see who can guess

261
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,150
the actual date and time of birth.

262
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:29,780
Tell him to put me down
for next Friday, 2300 hours.

263
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,617
-Anything else?
-Crewman Chell's asked

264
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,077
about taking over
in the mess hall full-time.

265
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,164
Neelix left some pretty big pots
and pans to fill.

266
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,666
Does Mr. Chell feel
he's up to the challenge?

267
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,711
Apparently so.
He's prepared a sample menu.

268
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,299
"Plasma Leek Soup."

269
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,968
"Chicken Warp Core-don Bleu"?

270
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,637
[both laughing]

271
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,890
If his cooking's as bad as his puns,
we're in trouble.

272
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,101
Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't mind
giving his "Red Alert Chili" a try.

273
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,228
Feel like having lunch?

274
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,897
I'd love to,
but I've already made plans.

275
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,732
-Rain check?
-Absolutely.

276
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,412
What's all this?

277
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,331
A picnic.

278
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,293
According to my research,
this is an appropriate third date.

279
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,673
You didn't have to go
to this much trouble.

280
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,718
If this makes you uncomfortable,
I could prepare a less elaborate meal.

281
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,846
No, no, don't change a thing.

282
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,559
This is perfection.

283
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,777
[Kim coughing]

284
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,290
In the interest of fair play,
I should inform you

285
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,126
that Mr. Kim has never
defeated me at Kal-toh.

286
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,466
You should've listened to me.

287
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,227
Kal-toh is as much a game
of patience as it is of logic.

288
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,896
An experienced player will
sometimes take several hours

289
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,440
to decide his next move,

290
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,234
and in some cases, even days
may be necessary to...

291
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,486
Kal-toh.

292
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,113
You beat him.

293
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,742
Congratulations.

294
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,411
I'm sure it was
just beginner's luck, sir.

295
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,706
I'd offer you a rematch,
but I'm due in Astrometrics.

296
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,416
Another time, perhaps.

297
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,676
He may have to go,
but I'm free and feeling lucky.

298
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,511
If you'll excuse me, Ensign.

299
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,599
It's just a game, Tuvok.

300
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,728
Icheb's an exceptionally
bright young man.

301
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,023
Did it occur to you that he might
simply be a better player?

302
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,027
My loss was the result of another
lapse in concentration.

303
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,614
I am detecting
lower neuro-peptide levels.

304
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,157
As I suspected.

305
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,202
My condition is deteriorating.

306
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,080
It's a minor change.

307
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,499
We knew it would happen.

308
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,543
I simply have to increase
your medication.

309
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:31,796
[sighs]

310
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,174
Thank you, Doctor.

311
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:40,012
Commander, I understand
your desire for privacy,

312
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,265
but maybe it's time
we informed the Captain.

313
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,435
I will inform her
if and when the disorder

314
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,688
begins to affect the performance
of my duties.

315
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,398
Of course.

316
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,860
Your move.

317
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,906
<i>Green, grid 1210.</i>

318
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,912
Red, grid 313.

319
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,789
<i>Tricky.</i>

320
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,374
How's Brax?

321
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,252
<i>Wonderful. Thanks for asking.</i>

322
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,088
<i>I know I can never replace</i>
<i>his father, but...</i>

323
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,298
I have no doubt
the boy looks up to you.

324
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,262
<i>Orange, grid 1012.</i>

325
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,765
<i>I haven't told anyone,</i>

326
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,017
<i>but I'm thinking of asking Dexa</i>
<i>to marry me.</i>

327
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,936
She'd be wise to accept.

328
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,857
<i>That's enough of my love life.</i>
<i>How about yours?</i>

329
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,067
I don't have a love life.

330
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:39,155
<i>Oh? What about your relationship</i>
<i>with Commander Chakotay?</i>

331
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,740
It's your turn.

332
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,200
<i>Actually, it's yours.</i>

333
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,578
<i>At least tell me</i>
<i>how he liked the picnic.</i>

334
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,750
It was an enjoyable activity
for both of us.

335
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,293
Thank you for suggesting it.

336
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,336
<i>Any time.</i>

337
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,339
[alarm beeping]

338
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,550
<i>What is it?</i>

339
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,345
Long-range sensors are detecting
extremely high neutrino emissions,

340
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,016
accompanied
by intermittent graviton flux

341
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,059
approximately three light-years away.

342
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,187
<i>A wormhole.</i>

343
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,648
I'm not sure.
I'll need to conduct more scans.

344
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,941
<i>We can finish our game tomorrow.</i>

345
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,110
I'll contact you at the usual time.

346
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,866
The emissions are occurring
at the center of the nebula.

347
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,577
There appear to be hundreds
of distinct sources.

348
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,288
Which could translate
to hundreds of wormholes.

349
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,749
The radiation is interfering
with our sensors,

350
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,085
but if Ensign Kim's enthusiasm
turns out to be justified,

351
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,087
it would be the most
concentrated occurrence

352
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,506
of wormholes ever recorded.

353
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,965
Any idea where they lead?

354
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,219
Not yet, but if just one of them
leads to the Alpha Quadrant...

355
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,762
Who knows, Harry?

356
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,598
It might take us right into
your parents' living room.

357
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,850
Alter course, Mr. Paris.

358
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,727
Ensign, when you speak
to your mother,

359
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,355
tell her we may need her
to move the sofa.

360
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:04,865
7153...5331...7153...

361
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,076
5331...7153...

362
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,161
I'm sorry if I pulled you away
from something important, sir,

363
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,038
but he won't let anyone near him,
and I thought you might...

364
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,498
You did the right thing.

365
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,167
His condition's never been
associated with violent behavior.

366
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,002
He seems more frustrated
than violent.

367
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,213
Long-range sensors
have detected no trace.

368
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,298
Her disappearance
remains a mystery.

369
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,675
I am deeply concerned.

370
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,635
What are you concerned
about, Tuvok?

371
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,053
-Her disappearance.
-Whose?

372
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,223
5331...7153.

373
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,725
He's been repeating those same
numbers over and over again--

374
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,812
533171.
It might be a stardate.

375
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,023
Stardate 53317...

376
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,608
If my memory files are accurate,

377
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,194
that was the day Captain Janeway
was abducted by the Kellidians.

378
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,446
Is that who you're talking about,
Tuvok? Captain Janeway?

379
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,906
Her disappearance
remains a mystery.

380
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,493
No, you solved that mystery, Tuvok.
You rescued the Captain

381
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,370
and brought her back to<i> Voyager</i>
safe and sound, remember?

382
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,748
I am deeply concerned,
deeply concerned.

383
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,668
Maybe if the Admiral paid him a visit,
showed him that she was all right?

384
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,753
Unfortunately,
she's out of town right now.

385
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,171
I'm not sure when she'll be back.

386
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,465
She's never coming back!

387
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,926
Her disappearance
remains a mystery.

388
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,761
I'm deeply concerned...

389
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,223
deeply concerned.

390
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,437
[Doctor]
<i>Voyager</i> to Pathfinder.

391
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,688
Come in, Pathfinder.

392
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,397
Doctor, what a pleasant sur...

393
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,942
Oh! I've forgotten about
our golf game again, haven't I?

394
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,528
Relax, Reg. It's not until next week.

395
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,239
I'm here because I need to get
in touch with Admiral Janeway.

396
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,241
Oh, she's out of town.

397
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,328
I know. Did she tell you
where she was going?

398
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,373
Uh, I'm afraid it--it never came up.
I mean, is something wrong?

399
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,375
I'm not sure.

400
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,920
I paid a visit to Tuvok this morning.

401
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,421
He seemed to think that she
was in some sort of danger.

402
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,176
Well, you know better than anyone
how confused Tuvok can get.

403
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,137
Yes, but I've been worried
about the Admiral, too.

404
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,598
-Why?
-Two days ago, she asked me

405
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,976
for a large quantity
of an experimental medication.

406
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,480
When I asked her why she needed it,
she said it was classified.

407
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,816
Then you shouldn't be telling me
about it, should you? [laughs]

408
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,694
I spoke to Director Okaro
at Starfleet Intelligence.

409
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,030
He assured me that the Admiral
hasn't been involved

410
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,283
in any classified work since she
began teaching at the Academy.

411
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,036
You know how sneaky
these intelligence people can be.

412
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,663
Maybe he was just trying
to throw you off.

413
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:20,584
Maybe, but still,
she's been talking for months

414
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,128
about how excited she is
to be teaching with you.

415
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:27,049
Then, just as the semester begins,

416
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,886
she goes away
without even telling you where.

417
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,931
Don't you find that...a little strange?

418
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,809
I...I'm...

419
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,477
sure that there is a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

420
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,855
Doctor, I'm sorry.

421
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,191
I have some...

422
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,026
papers to grade.

423
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,154
-You're stammering, Reg.
-So?

424
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,076
I haven't heard you do that in years.

425
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,537
I think you do know where she is.

426
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,622
She is one of the most
decorated officers

427
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:03,002
in all of Starfleet history.
I'm...I'm...

428
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,004
sure she can take care of herself.

429
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,380
You wouldn't be saying that

430
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,298
unless she was doing
something dangerous.

431
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,050
You are putting words in my mouth.

432
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,928
Tell me where she is, Reg.

433
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,615
Welcome to the House of Korath,
Admiral.

434
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,659
I love what he's done with the place.

435
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,078
[speaking Klingon]

436
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,873
[speaking Klingon]

437
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,292
[growling]

438
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,378
What was that about?

439
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,173
He says your demeanor
was disrespectful.

440
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,467
I hope you told him
I didn't mean to be rude.

441
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:55,262
I told him if he didn't show you more
respect, I would break his arm.

442
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,265
You are your mother's daughter.

443
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,558
Korath is waiting. We should go in.

444
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,853
Sorry, but this is
where we part ways.

445
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,563
-Excuse me?
-You're dismissed, Ensign.

446
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,733
But, Admiral, I really think that...

447
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,485
I can take care of myself.

448
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,653
With all due respect,

449
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,405
I've been working on this
for six months, and...

450
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,867
And you've done an exemplary job,
but it's over. Understood?

451
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,454
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,664
I happen to know

453
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,666
your parents are anxious
to spend some time with you.

454
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,836
Take a few days' leave.
Go and see them.

455
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,277
A Cardassian disruptor.

456
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,781
I've modified it
to emit a nadion pulse.

457
00:26:55,864 --> 00:27:00,035
Impressive, but that's not
what I've come for.

458
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,288
No.

459
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,668
You've come for something
far more dangerous.

460
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,712
Where is it?

461
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,548
Somewhere safe.

462
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,593
I went to a great deal of trouble

463
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,679
to get you your seat
on the High Council.

464
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,014
Now give me what you promised.

465
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,108
[beeping]

466
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,573
I've scanned your shuttle.
It appears you've made some...

467
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,285
interesting modifications.

468
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,874
Your shields generator
is of particular interest.

469
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,584
It's not for sale.

470
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,215
Then what you want
isn't available, either.

471
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,470
We had an agreement.

472
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,764
Show the Admiral out.

473
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,772
[door opens, closes]

474
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:20,115
Maybe Chell should add
"Nebula Soup" to his menu.

475
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,408
[rumbling]

476
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,493
-Shields.
-[Tuvok] Holding.

477
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,454
-Bridge to Astrometrics.
-[Seven] <i>Go ahead.</i>

478
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,789
Any more data on those
neutrino emissions?

479
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,667
Negative, Captain.
I still can't get a clear scan.

480
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,628
<i>Distance to the center?</i>

481
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,171
Six million kilometers.

482
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,339
[rumbling]

483
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,882
What is it?

484
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:41,887
I'm detecting a tritanium signature,
bearing 342, mark 55.

485
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,847
Whatever it is, it's too close.

486
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,641
Evasive maneuvers.

487
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,645
Was it a ship?

488
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,188
Possibly.

489
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,523
[rumbling]

490
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:58,070
Another tritanium signature
right on top of us.

491
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,450
Tom!

492
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,918
Get us out of here now.

493
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,925
[Borg]
<i>Vessel identified: </i>USS Voyager.

494
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,511
<i>We will pursue and assimilate.</i>

495
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:26,598
No, they haven't compromised
our security.

496
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:30,310
Let the vessel continue...for now.

497
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,439
I'll keep an eye on them.

498
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,449
There's no evidence
that the Cube detected us.

499
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,784
[Chakotay]
Where is it now?

500
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,494
Approximately
three light-years away.

501
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,954
How could they not have seen us?

502
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,998
We came within ten meters
of their hull.

503
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,125
The Borg wouldn't
knowingly risk a collision.

504
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,585
The radiation must have interfered
with their sensors as well.

505
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,838
If they can't detect us,
we should go back.

506
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,131
I wouldn't recommend it.

507
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,091
My analysis
of the tritanium signature

508
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,303
suggests there were at least
47 Borg vessels inside the nebula.

509
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,430
We can't just give up
on those wormholes.

510
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,806
Oh, yes, we can.

511
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,100
-What if we try to modify...
-I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

512
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,270
You may be the Captain someday,
but not today.

513
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,450
Tom.

514
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,201
What are you doing
when your shift ends?

515
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,703
No plans. Why?

516
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,165
I've been thinking.
You and I should have some fun.

517
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,959
One last adventure before you get
too busy being a father.

518
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,711
Did you reserve
some holodeck time?

519
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,338
I've got a better idea.

520
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,425
This is your idea of fun?

521
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,678
It'll work. We just need to make
a few modifications to the<i> Flyer.</i>

522
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,222
We might as well just
hand it over to the Borg.

523
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,515
How could that happen

524
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,893
with the best pilot in the quadrant
at the helm?

525
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,645
Nice try.

526
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,564
If we go to the Captain together,

527
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,691
she'll be much more likely
to approve my plan.

528
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,276
I don't<i> want</i> her to approve it.

529
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,611
Where's your sense
of adventure?

530
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,906
I left it in that nebula,
and I'm not going back for it.

531
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,368
-Don't you want to find a way home?
-I<i> am</i> home, Harry.

532
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,043
Captain Proton would never
walk away from a mission like this.

533
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:22,464
Captain Proton doesn't have a wife
and a baby on the way.

534
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,097
If you're here for my daily report,
it's not complete.

535
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,644
Actually, I'm here
in an unofficial capacity.

536
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,563
I was wondering if you'd like
to get together again.

537
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,943
To do what?

538
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,489
Well, that all depends
on your research.

539
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,909
Would a quiet dinner
be an appropriate fourth date?

540
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,997
Hmm, I believe it would be
a more suitable fifth date.

541
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,085
I'm willing to skip ahead if you are.

542
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,507
You're fine...

543
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,884
aside from some
minor inflammation

544
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,511
around your biradial clamp.

545
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,680
Let me know if it starts
to bother you.

546
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,060
Is there something else?

547
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,812
Do you remember
three months ago

548
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,522
when my cortical node
shut down?

549
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,107
How could I forget?

550
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,818
You said it might be possible

551
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,571
to remove the fail-safe device
that was causing the problem.

552
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,698
Has it been giving you
trouble again?

553
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,118
No, but I've reconsidered
your offer to extract it.

554
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,537
I've been hoping you would.

555
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,914
You said it would require
several surgeries.

556
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:41,751
Actually, in anticipation
of your change of heart,

557
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,129
I've been studying the problem
in more detail.

558
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,923
I now believe I can reconfigure
the microcircuitry

559
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,341
with a single procedure.

560
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,386
You'll be free to experience
the full ranges of emotions--

561
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,182
everything from a hearty belly laugh
to a good cry.

562
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,766
How soon can you do it?

563
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,685
Today, if you'd like.

564
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,770
My shift ends at 1800 hours.

565
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,063
It's a date.

566
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,610
Speaking of dates...

567
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,820
once the fail-safe is gone,

568
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,908
you'll be free to pursue
more intimate relationships.

569
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,242
I'm aware of that.

570
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,705
If you decide you need help
with that aspect of your humanity,

571
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,749
I'm always at your disposal.

572
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,044
I appreciate that.

573
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,504
Really?

574
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,172
Yes.

575
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,383
But I already have all the help I need.

576
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,261
Ah.

577
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,804
Of course.

578
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,558
You'll undoubtedly be running
more simulations

579
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,352
with the Chakotay hologram.

580
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,646
No, actually.

581
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,065
I'll see you at 1800 hours.

582
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,952
<i>Mak-tah hoon...</i>
Janeway, <i>ghuy'cha.</i>

583
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,420
I've reconsidered your offer.

584
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,964
I thought you might.

585
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,258
I'll give you the shield emitter,

586
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,928
but not until I've inspected
the device you're offering,

587
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,888
to make sure it's genuine.

588
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,015
You question my honor?

589
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,809
If you were honorable,

590
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,853
you wouldn't have changed
the terms of our agreement.

591
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,068
Show it to me, or I'm leaving.

592
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,178
This will do just fine.

593
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,600
Stop her!

594
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,690
Computer, deploy armor.

595
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,113
Lay in a course
for these coordinates.

596
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,456
[communications beep]

597
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,124
[sighs]

598
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,626
What do you want?

599
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,295
<i>You'll pay for your deceit, </i>ghuy'cha!

600
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:35,258
<i>And the house of Korath won't rest</i>
<i>until you've drowned in your own blood!</i>

601
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,845
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I'm on a tight schedule.

602
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,889
Computer, warp six.

603
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,522
[computer]
<i>Approaching designated coordinates.</i>

604
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,732
All stop.

605
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,986
<i>Warning: vessel approaching,</i>
<i>vector 1-2-1, mark six.</i>

606
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,909
[communications beep]

607
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,915
Harry! And people are always
saying that space is so big.

608
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,293
<i>Lower your shields, Admiral.</i>
<i>Prepare for transport.</i>

609
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,878
<i>I'm taking you into custody.</i>

610
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:16,383
You have no grounds
to take me into custody, Captain.

611
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,678
<i>Reg told the Doctor everything,</i>
<i>and the Doctor told me.</i>

612
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:24,140
<i>Now please, Admiral, stand down.</i>

613
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:29,020
On one condition: you let me
explain why I'm doing this.

614
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,564
You have no idea
what the consequences would be.

615
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,401
I know what the consequences
are if we do nothing.

616
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,985
So do you.

617
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,155
I have a chance to change all that.

618
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,451
If Starfleet Command knew
what you were trying to do...

619
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,412
You haven't told them.

620
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,581
The Doctor and I decided
to keep things in the family.

621
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,874
What about your crew?

622
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,794
I told them I needed to take you
back to Starfleet Medical

623
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,879
because you'd contracted
a rare disease.

624
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,965
I hope it isn't terminal.

625
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,093
No, but it has been known
to affect judgment.

626
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,886
I know what I'm doing, Harry.

627
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,012
Do you?

628
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,890
Can you say with absolute
certainty that it'll work?

629
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,600
Because if you can't...

630
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,937
Even if it weren't a violation
of every rule in the book,

631
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,772
it would still be far too risky.

632
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,817
What?

633
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,361
I'm remembering a young Ensign

634
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:22,574
who wanted to fly
into a Borg-infested nebula,

635
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,077
just to explore the remote possibility
that we might find a way home.

636
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,581
If I remember correctly,
you stopped me.

637
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,250
We didn't know then
what we know now.

638
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,962
Our technology
may have advanced, but...

639
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,424
I'm not talking about technology.
I'm talking about people--

640
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,343
people who aren't as lucky
as you and me.

641
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:47,015
You said you and the Doctor wanted
to keep things in the family.

642
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,605
But our family's
not complete anymore, is it?

643
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,109
I'm asking you
to trust my judgment, Harry...

644
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,195
one last time.

645
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,876
Am I early?

646
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,086
No, you're right on time.

647
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,963
Something wrong with the door?

648
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,507
I didn't think it would be discreet

649
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,551
to be seen carrying flowers
to the First Officer's quarters.

650
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,557
Your research?

651
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,356
I should put these in water.

652
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:59,128
I've been told that anticipation of
the first kiss is often uncomfortable.

653
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,297
I wanted to alleviate the tension.

654
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,051
That was very considerate of you.

655
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,638
What about the second kiss?

656
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,935
I'd have to check the database.
It may indicate...

657
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,777
[Janeway]
<i>Senior officers report to the Bridge.</i>

658
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,660
Next time we deactivate
the com system.

659
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,834
[door opens]

660
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,253
What is it?

661
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,882
Judging from the tachyon emissions,
some sort of temporal rift.

662
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,508
How's it being generated?

663
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,969
That's what we're trying to figure out.

664
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,936
If Starfleet Command finds out
I had anything to do with this,

665
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,230
they'll demote me back to Ensign.

666
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,816
You worry too much, Harry.
It's turning you gray.

667
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:07,363
Propulsion's online,
plasma flow stable.

668
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,456
This device of Korath's,

669
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,500
it produces too much
tachyo-kinetic energy.

670
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,837
It could burn itself out by the time
you get where you're going.

671
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,301
You wouldn't be able to get back.

672
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,013
I always assumed
it was a one-way trip.

673
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,355
You're sure I can't talk you
out of this?

674
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,741
Right. Stupid question.

675
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,340
Kim to the<i> Rhode Island.</i>

676
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,051
One to beam back.

677
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,896
Computer,
activate the chronodeflector.

678
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,824
-Deploy armor.
-<i>Unable to comply.</i>

679
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,410
<i>Ablative generator is offline.</i>

680
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,578
Evasive pattern, beta six.

681
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,873
Open a channel to the<i> Rhode Island.</i>

682
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,043
Harry, I'm under attack.
How fast can you get back here?

683
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,714
I'm detecting nadion discharges
on the other side of the rift.

684
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,340
Weapons fire?

685
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,385
It's possible. The signature
appears to be Klingon.

686
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,053
Red alert.

687
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,812
[Kim]
<i>Stand by for transport, Admiral.</i>

688
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:06,441
You know where I'm going, Harry,
and it's not to your ship.

689
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,568
<i>Your structural integrity is failing.</i>

690
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,945
Just get these Klingons off my tail!

691
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,494
Computer, activate the tachyon pulse

692
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:22,415
and direct it to these spatial
and temporal coordinates.

693
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,841
There's a vessel
coming through the rift.

694
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,634
Klingon?

695
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,011
No.

696
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,388
Federation.

697
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,272
We're being hailed.

698
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,692
On screen.

699
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,614
<i>Recalibrate your deflector</i>
<i>to emit an anti-tachyon pulse.</i>

700
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,033
<i>You have to seal that rift.</i>

701
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,078
It's usually considered polite
to introduce yourself

702
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,038
before you start giving orders.

703
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,041
Captain, a Klingon vessel
is coming through.

704
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,918
<i>Close the rift!</i>

705
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:11,422
<i>In case you didn't notice,</i>
<i>I outrank you, Captain.</i>

706
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,840
Now do it.

707
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,810
I did what you asked.

708
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,646
Now tell me what the hell
is going on.

709
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,899
<i>I've come to bring </i>Voyager <i>home.</i>

710
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,930
Welcome aboard.

711
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:04,058
It's good to be back.

712
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,065
-Fresh coffee.
-Would you like a cup?

713
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,986
No, I gave it up years ago.
I only drink tea now.

714
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,238
I told the curator at the museum

715
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,157
that if he wanted to make
the ready room more authentic,

716
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,827
he should always keep a steaming
pot of coffee on the desk.

717
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,996
<i>Voyager's</i> in a museum?

718
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,625
<i>Voyager</i> is a museum,
on the grounds of the Presidio.

719
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,962
On a clear morning,
you can see Alcatraz from here.

720
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,173
You made it back to Earth.

721
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:41,846
Unfortunately, our favorite cup took
a bit of a beating along the way.

722
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:46,142
It was damaged during a battle
with the Fen Domar.

723
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:49,520
-Who?
-You'll run into them in a few years.

724
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,356
You know what? I shouldn't be
listening to details about the future.

725
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,443
Oh, the almighty
Temporal Prime Directive.

726
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,905
Take my advice. It's less of
a headache if you just ignore it.

727
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:02,366
You've obviously decided to,
or you wouldn't be here.

728
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,203
A lot's happened to me
since I was you.

729
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,998
Well, I'm still me,
and this is still my ship,

730
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,292
so no more talk about
what's going to happen

731
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,420
until I decide otherwise.
Understood?

732
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,380
All right.

733
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,343
Let's talk about the past.

734
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,056
Three days ago, you detected
elevated neutrino emissions

735
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,767
in a nebula in Grid 986.

736
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,353
You thought it might
be a way home.

737
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,104
You were right.

738
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,525
I've come to tell you to take
<i>Voyager </i>back to that nebula.

739
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,611
It was crawling with Borg.

740
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,030
I've brought technology
that'll get us past them.

741
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,367
Oh, I don't blame you
for being skeptical,

742
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,078
but if you can't trust yourself,
who<i> can</i> you trust?

743
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,038
For the sake of argument,

744
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,374
let's say I believe
everything you're telling me.

745
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,960
The future you come from
sounds pretty good.

746
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:57,046
<i>Voyager's </i>home. I'm an admiral.

747
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,715
There are ways
to defend against the Borg.

748
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,759
My ready room even gets
preserved for posterity.

749
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:06,973
So why would you want to tamper
with such a rosy timeline?

750
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,392
To answer that,

751
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,061
I'd have to tell you more
than you want to know.

752
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,898
But suffice it to say...

753
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,776
if you don't do what I'm suggesting,

754
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,363
it's going to take you
another 16 years

755
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,156
to get this ship home.

756
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,034
And there are going to be
casualties along the way.

757
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,081
I know exactly what you're thinking.

758
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,125
You've also become a telepath?

759
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,420
I used to be you, remember?

760
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,883
You're asking yourself,
"Is she really who she says she is,

761
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,886
or is this some sort of deception?"

762
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:50,641
For all you know, I could be a member
of species 8472 in disguise.

763
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,855
Have your people examine my shuttle.

764
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,481
Tell them to take a close look

765
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:01,527
at the weapons systems
and the armor technology.

766
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,740
In the meantime, the Doctor
can confirm my identity.

767
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,908
My scans of the Admiral's
cerebral cortex

768
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,618
turned up something interesting.

769
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,787
-What is it?
-I'm not sure.

770
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,497
I've never seen this kind
of implant before.

771
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,875
Alien technology?

772
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,003
The microcircuitry
has a Starfleet signature.

773
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,213
Of course it does.

774
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,215
[clears throat]
Admiral?

775
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,762
<i>You</i> invented it--12 years ago,
from my perspective.

776
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,599
I'm sorry, Admiral, I didn't realize...

777
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,726
What? That I was eavesdropping?

778
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,437
I may be old,
but my hearing's still excellent,

779
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,065
thanks to your exemplary care
over the years.

780
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:44,278
So, this...
implant I'm going to invent--

781
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,322
what does it do?

782
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,283
It's a synaptic transceiver.

783
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:54,997
It allows me to pilot a vessel
equipped with a neural interface.

784
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,624
Fascinating.

785
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,960
Tell me, what other extraordinary
breakthroughs am I going to make?

786
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,504
Doctor.

787
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,215
Sorry, Captain, but you can't
blame a hologram for being curious.

788
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,384
Just finish your report.

789
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,843
Yes, ma'am.

790
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:15,851
My scans indicate the two of you
are genetically identical.

791
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:20,189
The Admiral <i>is</i> you,
approximately 26 years from now.

792
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,315
[door opens]

793
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,778
Hello, Seven.

794
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,828
The technology aboard
the Admiral's ship<i> is</i> impressive.

795
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,788
Much of it appears
to have been designed

796
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,540
to defend against the Borg.

797
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,667
Could we install these systems
on<i> Voyager?</i>

798
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,877
The stealth technology
is incompatible,

799
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,880
but I believe we<i> can</i> adapt
the armor and weapons.

800
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,842
Well, Captain?

801
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,141
Do it.

802
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:06,402
[Janeway] <i>Captain's Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54973.4.</i>

803
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:10,364
<i>We've begun outfitting </i>Voyager
<i>with Admiral Janeway's upgrades.</i>

804
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:13,325
<i>As soon as the major modifications</i>
<i>are complete,</i>

805
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,120
<i>we'll reverse course</i>
<i>and head back to the nebula.</i>

00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,790
<i>Though I've certainly had some</i>
<i>strange experiences in my career,</i>

807
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:23,085
<i>nothing quite compares</i>
<i>to the sight of my future self</i>

Computer, begin regeneration cycle.

810
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,896
[Borg Queen]
Seven of Nine,

811
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:46,066
tertiary adjunct
of Unimatrix Zero One.

812
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,486
It's been too long.

813
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:50,613
What do you want?

814
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,115
Do I need a reason to visit a friend?

815
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,326
We're not friends.

816
00:49:55,409 --> 00:50:00,164
No. We're more than that.

817
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,959
We're family.

818
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,380
While we're on the subject
of old friends,

819
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,926
I see that<i> Voyager</i>
has just got a visitor

820
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:14,887
and she's come from the future.

821
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,764
Tell me why.

822
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,434
You may be able to communicate
with me while I'm regenerating,

823
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:25,021
but I'm no longer a drone.
I don't answer to you.

824
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:34,281
I've extrapolated <i>Voyager's</i> trajectory.

825
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,660
I know that you're
returning to the nebula.

826
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,788
I suggest you alter course.

827
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,540
Why should we comply?

828
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:49,421
You've always been
my favorite, Seven.

829
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:54,009
In spite of their obvious
imperfections,

830
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:57,263
I know how much you care
for the<i> Voyager</i> crew...

831
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,057
so I've left them alone.

832
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:08,274
Imagine how you'd feel
if I were forced to assimilate them.

833
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,403
<i>Voyager </i>is no threat to the collective.

834
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,780
We simply want to return
to the Alpha Quadrant.

835
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,740
I've no objection to that.

836
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:21,453
But if you try to enter
my nebula again...

837
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,248
I'll destroy you.

838
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,173
[computer] <i>Warning.</i>
<i>Regeneration cycle incomplete.</i>

839
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,932
Her cortical node was exposed
to a low-energy EM surge.

840
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,976
It could have been much worse.

841
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,769
It was the Borg Queen.

842
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,148
She wanted to make sure
I'd be able to deliver a message.

843
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:53,068
She said she'd assimilate<i> Voyager</i>
if we attempted to reenter the nebula.

844
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,154
Why is it so important to her?

845
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,447
That doesn't matter.

846
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,241
She's not going to be able
to make good on her threat.

847
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,993
I wish I shared your confidence.

848
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,371
You would if you'd had as much
experience with the Queen as I've had.

849
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,417
It was one thing to attempt this
when we thought it was a secret,

850
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,419
but if the Borg are monitoring us...

851
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,921
There's no guarantee
they won't try to assimilate<i> Voyager,</i>

852
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,174
even if we don't go
back into the nebula.

853
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,301
Is that supposed to be reassuring?

854
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,887
I'm not saying
the Borg aren't dangerous,

855
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,016
but from my perspective,
they're 30 years behind the times.

856
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,726
We shouldn't push our luck.

857
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,978
Luck's not going to have
anything to do with it.

858
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:31,273
I know, you don't want to hear
too much about the future,

859
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:34,860
but let's just say I ran into the Borg
a few more times

860
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,987
before I made it home.

861
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,364
If I hadn't developed

862
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:41,116
technology and tactics
that could defeat them,

863
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,661
I wouldn't be standing here today.

864
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,418
We'll maintain course
for the nebula,

865
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,045
but we'll stay at red alert.

866
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,048
And I want continuous scans
for Borg activity.

867
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,226
I heard what happened.

868
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,520
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

869
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,689
Because if you need time to rest...

870
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,483
I am in charge of the duty roster.

871
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,984
It would be inappropriate

872
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:19,530
to allow our personal relationship
to affect your command decisions.

873
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:21,990
You're right.

874
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,284
This is a time
to keep things professional.

875
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,619
Report.

876
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,123
There's no sign of Borg activity
within a ten-light-year radius.

877
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,709
That's good news, crewman.

878
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,377
Yes, sir.

879
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,755
But we shouldn't
underestimate the collective.

880
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,175
The Admiral seems confident
we can make it past them.

881
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,678
Captain Janeway is more cautious.

882
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,055
Our chances would be good

883
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,890
with one Kathryn Janeway
on the bridge,

884
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,477
but with two?
I'd bet on this ship any day.

885
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,736
If we do make it back to Earth...

886
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,530
what are your plans?

887
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:07,202
I assume Starfleet
will want to debrief me.

888
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,875
And then, I suppose, I'll attempt
to find a useful position somewhere.

889
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,629
You?

890
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,840
I don't know yet, either.

891
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,470
But wherever I end up,

892
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:27,514
I'm going to make sure
it's in transporter range of you.

893
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,562
[Torres] I don't want
this whole system crashing

894
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,147
because of one faulty relay.

895
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,982
-Install new ones.
-Yes, ma'am.

896
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,275
And I need an update
on the inductor capacitance.

897
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,861
-B'Elanna.
-Yes, Lieutenant.

898
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,654
Shouldn't you be on the Bridge?

899
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,198
Is there something wrong with a pilot

900
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,325
requesting a systems report
from the Chief Engineer?

901
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,161
The last report I got said the com
system was working perfectly.

902
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,246
[chuckles]
Okay, you caught me.

903
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,499
-I'm checking up on you.
-I'm fine.

904
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,001
-Your back?
-I'm ignoring it.

905
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,420
Well, I would offer
to give you a massage,

906
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,048
but then everybody would want one.

907
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,551
You know, for a Starfleet flyboy,
you're pretty sweet.

908
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,762
[chuckles] So how's it going?

909
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,681
This armor technology
that the Admiral brought--

910
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,225
it's incredible.

911
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:14,394
I hate to sound like Harry, but we
might actually make it this time.

912
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,480
Well, you don't seem
too happy about that.

913
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,106
Oh, I'm happy.

914
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,651
It's just that I'd actually gotten
used to the idea

915
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,861
of raising our daughter on<i> Voyager,</i>

916
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,613
and now I might end up
delivering her

917
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,783
at Starfleet Medical
instead of Sick Bay.

918
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,202
Well, that wouldn't be
so bad, would it?

919
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,246
Not as long as you're with me.

920
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,289
And I want the Doctor.

921
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,833
I don't want some stranger.

922
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,794
You would have to take him offline
to keep him away.

923
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,547
If we do make it home,

924
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,674
where do you think we'll live?

925
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,927
Well, we could always
stay with my parents for a while.

926
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,887
You're right. Bad idea.

927
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,014
Of course, it probably doesn't
matter to you anyway.

928
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,933
You flyboys are all the same.

929
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,019
You'll probably take the first piloting
assignment that comes along

930
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,771
and leave me home
to change the diapers.

931
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,315
Not a chance.

932
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,202
Bridge to Engineering.

933
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,620
[Torres]
<i>Go ahead, Captain.</i>

934
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,540
-Deploy armor.
-<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

935
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,522
Armor integrity at 97 percent.

936
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,159
Tuvok?

937
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,244
Integrity holding at 90 percent.

938
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:56,914
Maintain course.

939
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,547
They're looking for ways to adapt.

940
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,472
[alarm sounds]

941
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,308
Port armor integrity
down to 50 percent.

942
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,060
40 percent.

943
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,480
Mr. Paris, attack pattern Alpha One.

944
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:25,567
Target the lead cube
and fire transphasic torpedoes.

945
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,953
Target the second cube.

946
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,801
Distance to the center?

947
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,261
Less than 100,000 kilometers.

948
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,861
What the hell is it?

949
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,531
Mr. Paris, alter course
to enter the aperture

950
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,700
at coordinates 346 by 42.

951
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:19,246
Belay that. I asked you a question.
What is it?

952
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,039
The road home.

953
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,291
[Seven]
It's more than that.

954
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,544
It's a transwarp hub.

955
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,922
You once told me there were
only six of them in the galaxy.

956
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,966
That's correct.

957
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,972
You knew this was here,
but you didn't tell me about it.

958
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,307
-Why?
-I'll answer all your questions

959
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,560
once we're back
in the Alpha Quadrant.

960
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,688
Take us out of the nebula.

961
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,566
-Captain?
-You heard me.

962
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:51,403
I gave you an order, Lieutenant.
Proceed to the aperture.

963
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,738
This is my Bridge, Admiral,

964
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,991
and I'll have you removed
if necessary. Take us out.

965
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,829
Aye, Captain.

966
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,633
[Seven] This Hub connects with
thousands of transwarp conduits

967
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,470
with end points
in all four quadrants.

968
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,138
It allows The Collective
to deploy vessels

969
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,640
almost anywhere in the galaxy
within minutes.

970
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,770
Of all the Borg's tactical advantages,
this could be the most significant.

971
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,355
It's no wonder the Queen
didn't want us in that nebula.

972
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:29,274
So how do we destroy it?

973
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:34,196
The structure is supported
by a series of interspatial manifolds.

974
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:38,200
If we could disable enough of them,
theoretically, the Hub would collapse.

975
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,951
This is a waste of time.

976
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,995
The shielding for those manifolds

977
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,415
is regulated from the central plexus
by the Queen herself.

978
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,834
You might be able
to damage one of them, maybe two,

979
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,545
but by the time you moved
on to the third, she'd adapt.

980
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,340
There may be a way to bring them
down simultaneously.

981
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,258
From where, inside the Hub?

982
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,344
<i>Voyager</i> would be crushed like a bug.

983
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,138
What about taking the conduit
back to the Alpha Quadrant

984
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,349
and then destroying the structure
from the other side?

985
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,184
This Hub is here.

986
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:08,188
There's nothing in the Alpha
Quadrant but exit apertures.

987
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,943
While you're all standing around
dreaming up fantasy tactical scenarios,

988
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:16,571
the Queen is studying her scans
of our armor and weapons.

989
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,032
And she's probably got
the entire collective

990
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,034
working on a way to counter them.

991
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:26,665
So take the ship back into that nebula
and go home before it's too late.

992
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,626
Find a way to destroy that Hub.
Let's take a walk.

993
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,007
I want to know why you didn't
tell me about this.

994
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,636
Because I remember how stubborn
and self-righteous I used to be.

995
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,930
I figured you might try
to do something stupid.

996
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,975
We have an opportunity
to deal a crippling blow to the Borg.

997
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,102
It could save millions of lives.

998
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,645
I didn't spend the last ten years

999
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,689
looking for a way to get
this crew home earlier

1000
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:54,401
so you could throw it all away on some
intergalactic goodwill mission.

1001
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,027
Maybe we should go
back to Sick Bay.

1002
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,779
Why, so you can have me sedated?

1003
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,448
So I can have the Doctor
reconfirm your identity.

1004
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,535
I refuse to believe
I'll ever become as cynical as you.

1005
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:06,413
Am I the only one
experiencing déjà vu here?

1006
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,874
-What are you talking about?
-Seven years ago,

1007
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,959
you had the chance
to use the Caretaker's array

1008
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,252
to get<i> Voyager</i> home.

1009
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,712
Instead, you destroyed it.

1010
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,672
I did what I knew was right.

1011
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,717
You chose to put the lives of strangers
ahead of the lives of your crew.

1012
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,719
You can't make
the same mistake again.

1013
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,347
You got<i> Voyager</i> home,
which means I will, too.

1014
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,141
If it takes a few more years,
then that's...

1015
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,268
Seven of Nine is going to die.

1016
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,937
What?

1017
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,647
Three years from now.

1018
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,608
She'll be injured on an away mission.

1019
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,401
She'll make it back to<i> Voyager</i>

1020
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,695
and die in the arms of her husband.

1021
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:42,365
-Husband?
-Chakotay.

1022
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,619
He'll never be the same
after Seven's death,

1023
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,329
and neither will you.

1024
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,585
If I know what's going to happen...

1025
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:55,921
I can avoid it.

1026
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,756
Seven isn't the only one.

1027
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,550
Between this day and the day
I got<i> Voyager</i> home,

1028
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,844
I lost 22 crew members.

1029
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,723
And then, of course, there's Tuvok.

1030
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,559
What about him?

1031
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,312
You're forgetting the Temporal
Prime Directive, Captain.

1032
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,521
The hell with it.

1033
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,315
Fine.

1034
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,193
Tuvok has a degenerative
neurological condition

1035
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,778
that he hasn't told you about.

1036
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:24,366
There's a cure in the Alpha Quadrant,
but if he doesn't get it in time...

1037
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,119
Even if you alter <i>Voyager's</i> route,

1038
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,747
limit your contact with alien species,

1039
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,832
you're going to lose people,

1040
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,459
but I'm offering you a chance

1041
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:38,255
to get all of them home
safe and sound today.

1042
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:41,174
Are you really going
to walk away from that?

1043
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:47,722
Your concern is appreciated,
Captain, but premature.

1044
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:51,017
It will be several years before
the symptoms become serious.

1045
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:55,689
Until then, the Doctor can manage
my condition with medication.

1046
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,149
Is it true what the Admiral said--

1047
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,902
that there's a cure
in the Alpha Quadrant?

1048
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,488
It is called a <i>fal-tor-voh,</i>

1049
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,491
and it requires a mind meld
with another Vulcan.

1050
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,160
What about the other Vulcans
on<i> Voyager?</i>

1051
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,038
None of them are compatible.

1052
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,708
But members of your family are.

1053
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:20,297
If you knew that returning
to the Alpha Quadrant

1054
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,549
was your only chance for recovery...

1055
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,885
why didn't you object
when I asked you

1056
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,929
to help find a way
to destroy the Hub?

1057
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:31,516
My sense of logic isn't impaired yet.

1058
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,602
If we succeed,
millions of lives will be saved.

1059
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,398
What about your life?

1060
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,693
To quote Ambassador Spock,

1061
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:45,572
the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

1062
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,909
I appreciate your candor, Admiral.

1063
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,747
But Captain Janeway
is my commanding officer.

1064
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,916
-I won't disobey her.
-I'm not asking you to.

1065
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,045
I simply want you to tell her
that, in your opinion,

1066
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:03,381
destroying the Hub is too risky,
the cost too high.

1067
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:04,632
I can't do that.

1068
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:08,053
Even if it means avoiding
the consequences I mentioned?

1069
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:10,180
Now that I know
about those consequences,

1070
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,223
they're no longer a certainty.

1071
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:15,435
But even if they were, my death
would be a small price to pay

1072
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,771
for the destruction
of the transwarp network.

1073
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,649
I have known you
for a long time, Seven,

1074
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:23,985
longer than you've known yourself.

1075
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,280
You're thinking
that collapsing the network

1076
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,574
is an opportunity
to atone for atrocities

1077
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,951
you participated in
while you were a drone.

1078
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:36,414
It's time to let go of the past
and start thinking about your future.

1079
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,291
My future is insignificant

1080
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,502
compared to the lives
of the people we'd be saving.

1081
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,753
You're being selfish.

1082
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,338
Selfish?

1083
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,423
I'm talking about helping others.

1084
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:48,093
Strangers
in a hypothetical scenario.

1085
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,844
I'm talking about real life--

1086
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,639
your colleagues, your friends...

1087
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,641
people who love you.

1088
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,062
Imagine the impact
your death would have on them.

1089
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,108
Excuse me, Admiral.

1090
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,819
I have work to complete.

1091
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,029
[sighs]

1092
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:11,491
[Tuvok] Once inside, we'd fire
a spread of transphasic torpedoes.

1093
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,785
They'd be programmed
to detonate simultaneously.

1094
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,870
If the torpedoes
penetrate the shielding,

1095
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,831
the conduits should
begin to collapse

1096
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,874
in a cascade reaction.

1097
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,751
In order to avoid the shock wave,

1098
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,212
we'd have less than ten seconds
to exit the hub.

1099
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,886
A long time ago, I made a decision

1100
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,848
that stranded this crew
in the Delta Quadrant.

1101
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,225
I don't regret that decision.

1102
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:42,230
But I didn't know all of you then,

1103
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,858
and<i> Voyager</i> was just a starship.

1104
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,862
It's much more than that now.

1105
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,947
It's become our home.

1106
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,660
I know I could order you
to carry out this plan,

1107
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,787
and none of you would hesitate
for a second,

1108
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,456
but I'm not going to do that.

1109
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,334
You know the crewmen
who work under you,

1110
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,795
and you know what your own
hearts are telling you.

1111
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,550
So we're not going to attempt this
unless everyone in this room agrees.

1112
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,387
No one will think less
of you if you don't.

1113
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,099
Captain.

1114
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,018
Go ahead, Harry.

1115
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,228
I think it's safe to say

1116
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:26,149
that no one on this crew
has been more...

1117
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:29,569
obsessed with getting home
than I have.

1118
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,698
But...

1119
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:38,411
when I think about everything
we've been through together...

1120
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:44,250
...maybe it's not
the destination that matters.

1121
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,503
Maybe it's the journey.

1122
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,964
If that journey takes a little longer

1123
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:53,092
so we can do something
we all believe in,

1124
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,346
I can't think of anyplace
I'd rather be

1125
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,807
or any people I'd rather be with.

1126
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,101
To the journey.

1127
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,269
Hear, hear.

1128
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,896
[all]
To the journey.

1129
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,491
[Admiral]
Coffee. Black.

1130
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,285
I thought you'd gave it up.

1131
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,747
I've decided to revive
a few of my old habits.

1132
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,165
Oh?

1133
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:27,085
What else besides the coffee?

1134
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,295
Oh, well...

1135
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,632
I used to be much more idealistic.

1136
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,343
I took a lot of risks.

1137
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,265
I'd been so determined
to get this crew home

1138
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,976
for so many years...

1139
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,479
that I think I forgot how much
they loved being together...

1140
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,733
and how loyal they were to you.

1141
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,446
It's taken me a few days
to realize it.

1142
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,950
This is your ship...

1143
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:02,996
your crew, not mine.

1144
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,748
I was wrong to lie to you,

1145
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:09,419
to think I could talk you out of
something you'd set your mind to.

1146
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,880
You were only trying to do what you
thought was right for all of us.

1147
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:15,717
Well, you've changed
my mind about that.

1148
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:23,933
And I'd like to help you
carry out your mission.

1149
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:27,186
Maybe together
we can increase our odds.

1150
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,856
Maybe we can do more than that.

1151
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,985
There's got to be a way
to have our cake and eat it, too.

1152
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:37,989
We can't destroy the hub
and get<i> Voyager</i> home.

1153
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:45,246
Are you absolutely sure
about that?

1154
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,459
There might be a way.

1155
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,588
I considered it once,
but it seemed too risky.

1156
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:57,133
That was before you decided
to revive your old habits.

1157
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,640
I don't know why I ever gave this up.

1158
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,606
It's about time. I'm not getting
any younger, you know.

1159
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,448
You're sure you want to do this?

1160
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,076
No.

1161
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,703
But<i> Voyager</i> isn't big enough
for both of us.

1162
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,675
Good luck, Admiral.

1163
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,094
You, too.

1164
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,139
Captain.

1165
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,977
I'm glad I got to know you again.

1166
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,756
Any word from the Admiral?

1167
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,218
We lost contact as soon
as she entered the hub.

1168
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,137
Did the Borg give her any trouble?

1169
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,097
Her vessel was scanned
by several Cubes,

1170
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,141
but none approached her, sir.

1171
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,187
Are we keeping things
professional again today?

1172
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,731
Yes, Commander.

1173
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,236
You're not joking, are you?

1174
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:42,530
No.

1175
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:53,541
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I'm just...busy.

1176
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,421
I think I've gotten to know you
a little better than that.

1177
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:03,384
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me
as though we're on intimate terms.

1178
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,971
We are on intimate terms.

1179
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,264
Not anymore.

1180
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,018
What the hell is going on?

1181
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:15,396
I've decided to alter the parameters
of our relationship.

1182
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,899
You mind telling me why?

1183
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:21,235
We both have dangerous
occupations.

1184
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:25,364
It's possible one of us could be
seriously injured or worse.

1185
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:30,953
I believe it's best to avoid
emotional attachments.

1186
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,956
Maybe you can just
flip some Borg switch

1187
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,125
and shut down your emotions,
but I can't.

1188
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,752
I suggest you try.

1189
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:41,047
It will make things
less difficult for you

1190
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,216
if any harm should come to me.

1191
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,385
Why are you suddenly
so concerned about that?

1192
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,054
Is there something I should know?

1193
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,645
The Admiral suggested...

1194
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:03,319
that your feelings for me will
cause you pain in the future.

1195
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,865
I can't allow that to happen.

1196
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,534
Seven.

1197
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:15,623
Any relationship involves risk,

1198
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:19,794
and nobody can guarantee
what's going to happen tomorrow,

1199
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:22,088
not even an Admiral from the future.

1200
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:29,971
The only certainty is how we feel
about each other here and now.

1201
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,849
If you think I'm going
to let you end this

1202
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,684
because of what <i>might</i> happen...

1203
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,064
then you need to get
to know me a little better.

1204
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,454
-[groans loudly]
-Try to relax, Lieutenant.

1205
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,373
Oh, if you tell me
to relax one more time,

1206
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,250
I'm going to rip your
holographic head off!

1207
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,835
I hope you don't intend
to kiss your baby with that mouth.

1208
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,087
-[yells]
-Tell me this isn't another false alarm.

1209
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,506
This isn't another false alarm.

1210
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:08,301
-I can't believe it.
-Oh, believe it!

1211
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,927
I might actually win.

1212
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,971
-What?
-The baby pool.

1213
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,514
I picked today, 1500 hours.

1214
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:16,142
I'm so glad I could
accommodate you.

1215
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,393
Don't celebrate yet.

1216
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,437
Klingon labor sometimes
lasts several days.

1217
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,355
[yells loudly]

1218
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,649
Of course I'm sure
that won't be the case here.

1219
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,318
[Janeway]
<i>Bridge to Lieutenant Paris.</i>

1220
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,819
<i>We're ready to get underway.</i>

1221
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,906
-Captain, I'm afraid...
-Go.

1222
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:32,325
-But...
-No buts, flyboy.

1223
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:36,203
If this mission is going to succeed,
we need our best pilot at the helm.

1224
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:39,540
Don't worry.
The Doctor will be here with me.

1225
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:42,043
[Janeway]
<i>Is there a problem, Mr. Paris?</i>

1226
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,298
On my way, Captain.

1227
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,941
Let's get this show on the road.

1228
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,034
Voyager <i>has altered course.</i>

1229
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:19,080
<i>Current position: spatial grid 362.</i>

1230
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:22,792
<i>Trajectory, 112 mark five.</i>

1231
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,169
[Admiral]
I don't know how you do it.

1232
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:28,255
All those voices talking at once.

1233
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:31,092
You must get terrible headaches.

1234
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:34,720
If you're calling drones
to assimilate me, don't bother.

1235
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:38,808
I don't need drones
to assimilate you.

1236
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:47,233
I'm not actually here, Your Majesty.

1237
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,402
I'm in your mind.

1238
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,738
I'm using a synaptic interface.

1239
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:56,200
If I were you, I wouldn't waste
my time trying to trace the signal.

1240
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,870
For the moment,
it's beyond your abilities.

1241
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,835
What do you want?

1242
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,587
To make a deal.

1243
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,923
Captain Janeway thinks I'm here

1244
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,634
to help her destroy
your transwarp network.

1245
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:16,262
-That's beyond your abilities.
-Oh, I know that,

1246
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:20,266
and I tried to explain it
to my naive younger self,

1247
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,934
but she wouldn't listen.

1248
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:26,272
She's determined
to bring down that hub.

1249
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,024
She'll fail.

1250
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,067
Yes.

1251
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:33,654
But she has weapons
that I brought from the future.

1252
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:36,615
I believe you're familiar with them.

1253
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:39,660
Transphasic torpedoes.

1254
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,120
We will adapt.

1255
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,830
Eventually,

1256
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,834
but not before<i> Voyager</i>
does a great deal of damage.

1257
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,797
I'm willing to tell you how
to adapt to those weapons now.

1258
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:55,509
In exchange...for what?

1259
01:15:55,593 --> 01:16:00,014
To send a Cube to tractor<i> Voyager...</i>

1260
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:04,977
and drag them back
to the Alpha Quadrant.

1261
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:11,275
You're asking me to believe

1262
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,277
that the incorruptible
Kathryn Janeway

1263
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,945
would betray her own crew?

1264
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:18,157
Not betray them.
Save them from themselves.

1265
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,203
I brought technology
to help <i>Voyager</i> get home.

1266
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,790
But the Captain's arrogant,
self-righteous.

1267
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,626
And her officers
are so blinded by loyalty

1268
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,170
that they're prepared
to sacrifice their lives

1269
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,256
just to deal a crippling blow
to the Borg.

1270
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,050
But<i> you'd</i> never try to harm us.

1271
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:40,096
I've become a pragmatist
in my old age.

1272
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:43,516
All I want is to get that crew
back to their families.

1273
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,436
You wish to ensure
the well-being of your collective.

1274
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,605
I can appreciate that.

1275
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:52,191
I'll help you.

1276
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:57,738
But it'll cost more
than you're offering.

1277
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,406
What do you want?

1278
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,826
Your vessel and its database.

1279
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:05,579
I told you, I'll show you
how to adapt to their torpedoes.

1280
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,373
Insufficient.

1281
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,626
If I let you assimilate technology
from the future,

1282
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:13,087
there's no telling
how events would be altered.

1283
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:16,090
You're willing to alter the future
by getting<i> Voyager</i> home now.

1284
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,134
Oh, yes, but there's a difference.

1285
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:22,930
Do what all good pragmatists
do, Admiral--

1286
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,765
compromise.

1287
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,105
All right.

1288
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,232
I'll give you the shuttle...

1289
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:38,404
after<i> Voyager</i> arrives safely
in the Alpha Quadrant.

1290
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,489
You've already lied
to your younger self.

1291
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:41,991
How do I know
you're not lying to me?

1292
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,118
I guess you'll just have to trust me.

1293
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,371
That won't be necessary.

1294
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,040
You underestimate me, Admiral.

1295
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:53,377
While we've been talking, my drones
have triangulated your signal.

1296
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,338
Computer, deactivate the interface.

1297
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,966
Deploy armor.

1298
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,856
[Borg Queen]
Very clever.

1299
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,942
Hiding right at my doorstep.

1300
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,362
Were you planning to attack us
from inside the Unicomplex?

1301
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:24,200
Not feeling talkative?

1302
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:25,910
[moans]

1303
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:33,709
You and I don't need words
to understand each other.

1304
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:42,509
Take us in.

1305
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,386
Aye, Captain.

1306
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:53,437
Voyager <i>has entered aperture 823.</i>

1307
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,192
<i>Access transwarp corridor</i>
<i>zero-nine.</i>

1308
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:02,321
<i>Redirect vessels to intercept at...</i>

1309
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:05,157
[garbled] <i>corridor nine.</i>

1310
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:08,118
[garbled communications]

1311
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:12,122
<i>...zero...nine...</i>
<i>transwarp facility...</i>

1312
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,667
[groans]

1313
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,257
Must be something you assimilated.

1314
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,175
What have you done?

1315
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:27,846
I thought we didn't need words
to understand each other.

1316
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,851
You've infected us...

1317
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,728
with a neurolytic pathogen.

1318
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,605
Just enough...

1319
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,400
to bring chaos to order.

1320
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,615
The Admiral succeeded, Captain.

1321
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,159
The conduit's shielding
is destabilizing.

1322
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,494
Now, Mr. Tuvok.

1323
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,464
<i>Voyager </i>will be destroyed.

1324
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,342
[Admiral]
They're ahead of the shock wave.

1325
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:08,095
They'll survive.

1326
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:12,141
Captain Janeway and I
made sure of that.

1327
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:18,647
It's<i> you </i>who underestimated<i> us.</i>

1328
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,233
[groans]

1329
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,126
Sphere six-three-four.

1330
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:42,338
They can still hear my thoughts.

1331
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,685
I may have assimilated
your pathogen...

1332
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,774
but I also assimilated
your armor technology.

1333
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,650
[groans]

1334
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:25,464
Captain Janeway is about to die.

1335
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:31,345
If she has no future,
you will never exist,

1336
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:36,266
and nothing that you've done here
today will happen.

1337
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,251
[Admiral Paris]
What the hell is it?

1338
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:05,421
A transwarp aperture.

1339
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,881
It's less than a light-year from Earth.

1340
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,508
How many Borg vessels?

1341
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,051
We can't get a clear reading,

1342
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,512
but the graviton emissions
are off the scale.

1343
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,974
I want every ship in range to converge
on those coordinates now.

1344
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,475
Yes, Admiral.

1345
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,069
Aft armor is down to six percent.

1346
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,989
Hull breaches
on Decks Six through 12.

1347
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:41,248
I can't stay ahead of them,
Captain.

1348
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,167
The armor is failing.

1349
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,085
Where's the nearest aperture?

1350
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:47,629
Approximately 30 seconds ahead,

1351
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,632
but it leads back
to the Delta Quadrant.

1352
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,137
Mr. Paris,
prepare to adjust your heading.

1353
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,889
Yes, ma'am.

1354
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:05,522
We've got 18 ships in position,
nine more on the way.

1355
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,065
Open a channel.

1356
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,317
Open, sir.

1357
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,737
This is Admiral Paris.
Use all necessary force.

1358
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,281
I repeat, all necessary force.

1359
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:16,700
Sir, there's a vessel
coming through.

1360
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:31,965
Mr. Paris, what's our position?

1361
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:34,468
Right where we expect it to be.

1362
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:37,596
The transwarp network
has been obliterated, Captain.

1363
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,641
We'll celebrate later. Mr. Tuvok.

1364
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:56,782
Cease fire!

1365
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:09,586
We did it.

1366
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,384
[beep]

1367
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,010
We're being hailed.

1368
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,137
On screen.

1369
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,849
Sorry to surprise you.

1370
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:24,810
Next time, we'll call ahead.

1371
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:27,563
<i>Welcome back.</i>

1372
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,565
-It's good to be here.
-<i>How did you...</i>

1373
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,650
It'll all be in my report, sir.

1374
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:35,112
