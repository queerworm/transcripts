1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,465
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48734.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>Sometimes it's a good idea</i>

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,845
<i>to get away from being</i>
<i>a captain for awhile.</i>

4
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,972
<i>To that end,</i>
<i>I've started participating in</i>

5
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:16,767
<i>a new holonovel.</i>
<i>The setting is ancient England.</i>

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,853
( thunder crashing )

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,441
WOMAN:
The drawing room
is in here.

8
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,195
Bridget, take
Mrs. Davenport's cape

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,905
and tell Lord Burleigh
that she's here.

10
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:30,865
Yes, ma'am.

11
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,491
There's tea.

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,786
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

13
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,291
Tea is usually served at 5:30,
and dinner's at 8:30.

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,419
His Lordship doesn't appreciate
being kept waiting.

15
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,714
I'll be sure to be prompt.

16
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,173
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,889
Let's make something clear,
Mrs. Davenport.

18
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,224
My job is to make sure

19
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,434
that this household
runs smoothly.

20
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,479
I have been with Lord Burleigh
for nearly 20 years

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,733
because this household
runs smoothly.

22
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,443
He has come to trust me,

23
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,654
and I will not brook
any behavior

24
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,114
that might jeopardize
that trust.

25
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,701
So you will be expected
to follow the rules

26
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,369
that I have set down.

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,329
Mrs. Templeton...

28
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,708
I have no wish to do anything

29
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,710
that might disrupt
this household,

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,714
but let me make something
perfectly clear.

31
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,299
I have been hired
by Lord Burleigh,

32
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,179
and it's his orders
I will follow, not yours.

33
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,727
You would be wise
not to make an enemy of me.

34
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,938
I can make sure
we have another governess

35
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,856
by next week.

36
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,234
I suggest we try to get along,
Mrs. Templeton.

37
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,404
Surely there's room here
for both of us?

38
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,578
One lump or two?

39
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,249
Two, please.

40
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,717
Lord Burleigh will
be here directly.

41
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,179
( sighs )

42
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,610
( clattering )

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,517
( gasping )

44
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,103
Forgive me.
I've startled you.

45
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,479
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,064
I didn't hear you come in.

47
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,359
Mrs. Davenport,
I'll come to the point.

48
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,904
I am not an easy man
to live with.

49
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,949
Since my wife died,
I'm told I'm even worse.

50
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,995
She was a buffer
for me.

51
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,163
I understand.

52
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,413
The children
are the ones

53
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,206
who've suffered.

54
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,542
I've not been much
of a father to them,

55
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,626
and God knows,

56
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,045
I can't be a mother.

57
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,632
I'm not asking
that you replace their mother,

58
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,385
but I think they'll respond
to a woman's sensibilities.

59
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,803
You might fill a void
in their lives.

60
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,306
I'll certainly try, Your Grace.

61
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,851
Young Henry
is sometimes a bit stubborn,

62
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,064
and little Beatrice...
misses her mother terribly.

63
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,983
I hope they won't make
things difficult for you.

64
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,822
One thing above all
I must demand.

65
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,825
You are never, under
any circumstances,

66
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,079
to go onto the fourth
floor, is that clear?

67
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,372
KIM:
<i>Bridge to Captain Janeway.</i>

68
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,333
Go ahead, Mr. Kim.
<i>I've got Commander Chakotay</i>

69
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,087
and Mr. Tuvok's shuttlecraft
on long-range sensors,

70
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,630
but they're not responding
to our hails.

71
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,298
The shuttle's
been badly damaged.

72
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,134
I'm reading
multiple hull fractures.

73
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,260
<i>Life signs?</i>

74
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,345
Two, but they're very faint.

75
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,181
<i>Beam them to Sick Bay</i>
<i>as soon as they're in range.</i>

76
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,432
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

77
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,683
Aye, Captain.

78
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,357
Doctor.

79
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,776
They've each taken
a blast to the head

80
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,569
by some kind
of energy discharge.

81
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,695
Cardiostimulator.

82
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,905
Mr. Tuvok has

83
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,198
a serious concussion,

84
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,532
but it's nothing
I can't handle.

85
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,159
As for Commander
Chakotay...

86
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,577
all of the
bio-neural energy

87
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,204
has been extracted
from his brain.

88
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,455
Extracted?

89
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,581
Yes, from the
looks of it,

90
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,208
someone drained the energy

91
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,001
from every single
axon and dendrite

92
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,294
right down to
the synapses.

93
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,462
I can keep his
heart beating,

94
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,588
and I can keep
him breathing,

95
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,672
but other than that,

96
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,967
there's nothing
I can do.

97
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,635
He's brain dead.

98
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,792
TUVOK: The attack lasted
no more than a few seconds,

99
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,460
but it was highly effective.

100
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,463
I feel Commander Chakotay and I
are fortunate to be alive.

101
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,341
What happened,
Lieutenant?

102
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,551
We had completed our trade
mission with the Ilidarians

103
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,762
and were on course
to the rendezvous point

104
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,472
when we encountered
a dark-matter nebula.

105
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,600
As we began
a routine analysis,

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,895
an unidentified ship emerged
and attacked our shuttle.

107
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,313
Any idea why?

108
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,482
No. They would not
respond to our hails.

109
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,194
We were hit
by an energy discharge

110
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,406
which penetrated our shields
and filled the cabin.

111
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,491
Commander Chakotay
lost consciousness immediately,

112
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,078
and I was barely able
to activate the autopilot

113
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,329
before I was overcome as well.

114
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,039
And the alien ship?

115
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,249
( sighs )

116
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,583
The last image I saw,

117
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,044
was a ship
flying back into the nebula,

118
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,381
but the details
are difficult to remember.

119
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,175
Can you tell me anything
about the energy discharge--

120
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,510
its modulation
or phase distribution?

121
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,014
No. There was no time
for a detailed analysis.

122
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,810
However, the shuttle's sensors
may have recorded information

123
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,270
that could be helpful.

124
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,687
I will download the sensor logs.

125
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,773
Why would someone
want to extract

126
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,733
his bio-neural energy?

127
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,778
I don't know,
but if I'm to have

128
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,696
any hope of reviving him,
I must know precisely

129
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,824
<i>how</i> his neurons
were depleted.

130
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,034
It would be a great help
if I could examine the weapon.

131
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,996
We're going back
to that nebula

132
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,248
to try to find the ship
that attacked you.

133
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,666
Janeway to Bridge.

134
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,335
Prepare to lay
in a new course.

135
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,003
Mr. Tuvok will provide
you with the coordinates.

136
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,379
PARIS:
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

137
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,006
We'll keep you
posted, Doctor.

138
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,520
TUVOK:
The energy discharge

139
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,605
overloaded the shuttlecraft's
central computer core.

140
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,483
All sensor data
have been erased.

141
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,860
Lieutenant Torres
is in Sick Bay now.

142
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,320
When she reports,
tell her to go over

143
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,780
those damaged sensor logs
with a fine-tooth comb

144
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,573
to see if she can reconstruct
any of the data.

145
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,825
Aye, Captain.

146
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,909
Well, this is going
to make things

147
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,244
a little more difficult.

148
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,121
I've been using the
long-range sensors

149
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,374
to analyze the nebula
you discovered.

150
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,043
It's sending out strong
electromagnetic radiation.

151
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,046
We won't be able
to scan inside it.

152
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,676
You know, it sounds to me
like a perfect hiding place.

153
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,303
I agree.

154
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,181
I don't like the idea
of going in there blind.

155
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,891
Let me see if I can
reconfigure the sensors

156
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,767
to a multiphasic bandwidth.

157
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,188
Is there a problem?

158
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,398
I've lost

159
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,649
all sensor contact
with the nebula.

160
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,027
I don't understand.

161
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,320
( beeping )

162
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,197
Wait a minute.
We've altered course.

163
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,365
Mr. Paris?

164
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,993
Our new heading is 121 mark 6.

165
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,620
We've completely
come about, Captain,

166
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,081
but it wasn't me.

167
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,166
Mr. Kim, check
the navigational computer.

168
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,252
Who ordered
the course change?

169
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,170
According to my readings,

170
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,631
the command was issued
from the conn.

171
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,926
I'm telling you, it wasn't me.

172
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,345
And the helm controls
are working perfectly--

173
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,804
no sign of a malfunction.

174
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,474
Ensign,
transfer helm control

175
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,684
to your station,
and reset our original course.

176
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,020
Course laid in.

177
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,314
Mr. Paris, I
want you to run

178
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,358
a full diagnostic
on the conn station.

179
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,776
See if you can isolate
the problem.

180
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,152
Aye, Captain.

181
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,219
You might have asked
before adorning my Sick Bay

182
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,263
with animal remains.

183
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,348
It's a medicine wheel--

184
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,059
a talisman
used by Chakotay's tribe.

185
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,354
He once...
showed me how it works.

186
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,649
He said if anything
ever happened to him

187
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,943
that I should perform
a special healing ritual.

188
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,154
The wheel
represents

189
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,489
both the universe outside

190
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,865
and the universe
inside our minds as well.

191
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,701
They believe each
is a reflection of the other.

192
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:06,082
When a person is sleeping
or on a vision quest,

193
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,337
it's said that his soul is
walking the wheel, but if he's

194
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,381
in a coma,
or near death,

195
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,967
it means that he's gotten lost.

196
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,137
These stones are

197
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,431
signposts...

198
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,808
to help point the way back.

199
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,480
( sighing )

200
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,526
Not exactly standard
medical procedure I know, but...

201
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,612
You've placed
the coyote stone

202
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,156
at the crossroads
of the Fifth and Sixth Realms,

203
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,284
which would divert
Commander Chakotay's soul--

204
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,577
that is,
his consciousness--

205
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,663
into the Mountains
of the Antelope Women,

206
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,666
according to his tradition
an extremely attractive locale.

207
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,417
He might not
want to leave.

208
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,379
How do you know about
the medicine wheel?

209
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,839
It's my business to know about
a variety of medical treatments,

210
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,426
including those based on
psycho-spiritual beliefs.

211
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,595
Unfortunately, in this case,

212
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,014
the medicine wheel
won't be much help.

213
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,434
There's just not enough
of his mind left to work with.

214
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,454
Find your way home, Commander.

215
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,847
Hello?

216
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,235
Is someone here?

217
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,965
KES:
It's like...

218
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,676
sensing some
kind of presence--

219
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,637
as if someone
else were here.

220
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,100
Your telepathic
senses again.

221
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,063
Is this like last week,
when you went into Sick Bay,

222
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,441
and you knew Lieutenant Hargrove
had been there,

223
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,443
only he'd left
hours before?

224
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,361
It's not the same.

225
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,447
That was like...

226
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:47,201
like hearing faint music
from a faraway place.

227
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,913
When I was in my
quarters just now...

228
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,415
Mm-hm.

229
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,917
it was almost tangible.

230
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,211
I felt like there was someone
in the room with me.

231
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,171
Who was it?

232
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,589
I don't know.

233
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,924
A presence.

234
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,718
That's all I can say.

235
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:08,055
Warp engines still within
normal parameters, Captain.

236
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,601
We just changed course again.

237
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,687
Mr. Kim?

238
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,938
Our new heading is 121 mark 6.

239
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,357
Get us back on course.

240
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,110
The helm's not responding.

241
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,779
I'm locked out.

242
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,124
( console beeping )

243
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,168
This command station
has been blocked.

244
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,378
From where?

245
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,672
The lockout originated
on Deck 12,

246
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,173
Section B-7--

247
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,675
navigational
control.

248
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,386
See if you can
reestablish control.

249
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,846
I've checked every
ODN junction

250
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,096
in the helm control network

251
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,473
and I still can't find
the problem.

252
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,433
Seems we've developed
a new problem

253
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,393
while you were gone.

254
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,977
Helm control reestablished.

255
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,438
Get us back on course
for the nebula.

256
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,940
Janeway to Torres.
<i>Torres here.</i>

257
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,359
Who's in the
navigational control?

258
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,943
<i>No one right now.</i>

259
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,196
<i>I was there this morning,</i>
<i>and Lieutenant Paris</i>

260
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,365
<i>was in there</i>
<i>just a few minutes ago.</i>

261
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,991
That's not true.

262
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,202
Are you certain about
that, B'Elanna?

263
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,788
Positive. I just saw him leave
about five minutes ago.

264
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,332
Janeway out.

265
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,794
Explanation, Mr. Paris.

266
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,796
I passed by
the navigational control

267
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,340
on my way back from the
Jefferies tube, but that's all.

268
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,136
Am I being accused
of something here?

269
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,471
We are merely
following

270
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,766
a line of deductive
reasoning, Lieutenant.

271
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,267
Both deviations from our course

272
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,352
were apparently issued
from locations

273
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,687
where you were working.

274
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,481
I'm telling you,
I didn't do it.

275
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,860
Well, I'm willing to rule out
mutiny for the time being.

276
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,153
I believe you, Mr. Paris,

277
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,072
but we have to consider
the possibility

278
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,283
that you might be having
a problem with your memory.

279
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,743
I want you to go
down to Sick Bay.

280
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,703
Have the doctor
check you out.

281
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,496
All right.

282
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,997
Lieutenant Durst.

283
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,682
Neurotransmitters at normal.

284
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,143
Synaptic functions stable.

285
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,311
Hold still.

286
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,521
This is an extremely
sensitive scan.

287
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,401
What I wouldn't give to see
good old Doc Brown right now.

288
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,402
What?

289
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,946
Doc Brown.

290
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,364
Lollipops in the waiting room,

291
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,117
no holocomic books
more than six months old,

292
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,828
house calls.

293
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,122
I caught a bad cold one time
when I was nine years old.

294
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,500
The doctor whipped up
a pot of garlic soup

295
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,084
and brought it over himself.

296
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,378
Your report, Doctor.

297
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,464
I still have
a series of tests to perform,

298
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,759
but other than his irritating
lapses into nostalgia,

299
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,678
I see nothing
wrong with him.

300
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,430
I guess you're going to have to
round up another suspect, Tuvok.

301
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,307
On the contrary,
Lieutenant.

302
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,644
I ran a forensics sweep of
the navigational control.

303
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,522
I found traces of
your DNA on the console.

304
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,231
That's impossible.

305
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,192
The cellular residue
you left behind

306
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,027
is less than
12 hours old.

307
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,237
Do you still wish to
maintain your innocence?

308
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,659
To be honest,
I don't know what to think.

309
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,455
Perhaps my biomolecular scan
will reveal something.

310
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,249
Keep me informed,
Doctor.

311
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,223
TUVOK:
I believe I have found
the ion trail

312
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,892
of the ship
that attacked us.

313
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,227
It leads directly
into the dark-matter nebula.

314
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,021
This is the nebula...

315
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,481
and this is
the ion trail.

316
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,858
As you can see,

317
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,359
their flight path
is highly erratic.

318
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,069
JANEWAY:
These planetoids
inside the nebula,

319
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,320
they may be generating

320
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,698
a dangerous
gravitational effect--

321
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,157
like storm currents.

322
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,201
Chances are they've
mapped those currents

323
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,370
and they're taking the
only safe way through.

324
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,163
A reasonable assumption.

325
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,249
I recommend we follow
their exact flight path.

326
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,418
Agreed. Lay in
a course to the...

327
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,795
KIM:
Captain, we're dropping
to impulse power.

328
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,506
I'm reading a massive
energy drain all over the ship,

329
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,259
and the warp core
is shutting down.

330
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,719
Bridge to Engineering.
Report.

331
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,513
Lieutenant Torres,
please respond.

332
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,058
Mr. Kim, take the Bridge.

333
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,183
Tuvok, you're with me.

334
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,105
Torres, what's going on?

335
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,732
Captain?

336
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,609
You've initiated
an emergency warp core shutdown.

337
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,651
What?!

338
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,697
Too late.
The warp core is off-line.

339
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,949
It'll take at least two hours

340
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,575
to regenerate
the dilithium matrix.

341
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,078
Ensign, get the rest
of the systems back on line.

342
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:44,082
Apparently, you've just crashed
the main computer,

343
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,251
locked out the Bridge
and stopped this ship cold.

344
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,253
Do you want
to tell me why?

345
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,006
Captain, I don't know
what you're talking about.

346
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,804
What the hell
is going on here?

347
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,600
( door opens )

348
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,268
I've found something

349
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,645
and you're not going
to like it.

350
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,400
This is Mr. Paris' memory engram
for the last 24 hours.

351
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,569
As you can see,
it has a very consistent

352
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,779
and distinctive modulation,

353
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,782
except at 1350 hours.

354
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,033
For one minute, 47 seconds,

355
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,828
a different memory pattern
appeared.

356
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,162
1350 hours is also

357
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,538
the exact moment
when Mr. Paris

358
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,666
presumably tampered
with navigational control.

359
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,751
It gets worse.

360
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,377
In addition
to that,

361
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,964
there is another disruption
at 1202 hours,

362
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,299
the moment when
he allegedly entered

363
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,884
the new course
at the helm.

364
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,428
I also found there's
an identical disruption

365
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,806
in Lieutenant Torres' pattern,
at the moment

366
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,390
she shut down
warp power.

367
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,059
I should point
out that this

368
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,394
is a neural
electrical signature--

369
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,355
what I believe to be
another brain wave

370
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,315
that was superimposed
on their own.

371
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,817
Another brain wave?

372
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,860
PARIS:
Whose?

373
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,986
I don't know.

374
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,697
It has an unusual
energy signature,

375
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,573
one I've never
seen before.

376
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,661
Doctor...
what are you saying?

377
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,954
( sighs )

378
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,914
One possible explanation--

379
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,458
and the only one
I can think of at the moment--

380
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,919
is that an unknown
alien entity

381
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,630
momentarily took control
of their minds.

382
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,798
Intruder alert.

383
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,383
All security
personnel

384
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,843
go to Condition 4.

385
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,386
Captain,
it is possible

386
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,221
the intruder
returned with us

387
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,389
in the shuttlecraft.

388
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,559
If we're right...

389
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,312
and there is an alien here,

390
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,984
it seems intent on preventing us
from going back to the nebula.

391
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,320
What's more,
it seems to have the ability

392
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,948
to jump from person to person.

393
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:45,452
If that's true,
it could be in any one of us,

394
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,954
controlling our actions

395
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,373
without us
realizing it.

396
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,918
Well, except for me.

397
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,504
That's true.

398
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,674
So far it's only affected
organic beings.

399
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,342
If it could control
the computer

400
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,886
and navigational
systems directly,

401
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,470
it probably would've
done it already.

402
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,140
Which means...

403
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,726
the doctor is the only
person on board

404
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,187
we can trust at this moment.

405
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,316
Doctor...

406
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,779
until we have eliminated
this alien presence,

407
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,239
I can't take the risk

408
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,323
that it could take over
any of the senior officers.

409
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,037
I'd like to transfer
all command codes to you

410
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,538
until further notice.

411
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:34,460
W-What would that mean?
That<i> I</i> am in command?

412
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,839
No. But you will act
as a fail-safe.

413
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,591
If you feel at any time

414
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,553
that any of us are under
the influence of the alien...

415
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,766
you can countermand our orders
and take control of the ship.

416
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,726
Do you feel up to it?

417
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,770
Well, of course.

418
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,481
I make life-and-death
decisions every day.

419
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,816
I feel better already.

420
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,442
JANEWAY:
Computer,

421
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,279
transfer all command codes
to the holographic doctor.

422
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,949
Authorization:
Janeway-eight-four-one
-alpha-six-five.

423
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,409
COMPUTER:
<i>Command code transfer complete.</i>

424
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,953
Let's see if we can get
the warp core

425
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,621
back on line ahead of schedule.

426
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,290
TORRES:
Aye, Captain.

427
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,959
Captain, I heard
what's happened.

428
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,585
I think you're right.

429
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,587
There is an alien presence here.

430
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,965
I've been sensing
something unusual all day.

431
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,258
I don't know
how to describe it,

432
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,634
but I know there's
something here.

433
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,802
Do you know where?

434
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,345
No. Just that
it's on the ship.

435
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,515
Captain, Kes's
telepathic abilities

436
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,933
are undisciplined.

437
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,477
If I could initiate
a Vulcan mind-meld with her,

438
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,980
I may be able to help her focus
those abilities

439
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,898
to detect the alien
more accurately.

440
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,733
I'm willing to do that.

441
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,986
Very well.

442
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,529
Proceed, Mr. Tuvok.

443
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,291
KIM:
The captain wants to seal off

444
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,667
all critical areas of the ship.

445
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,169
Make sure the
access hatch

446
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,046
of Jefferies Tube
A-17 is secured.

447
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,798
So what exactly
are we securing against?

448
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,591
We're not sure yet,
but we think

449
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,426
it's some kind of
noncorporeal alien.

450
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,511
Noncorporeal?

451
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,055
That means it can
probably move

452
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,472
right through a bul...

453
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,433
Medical emergency, Deck 7
Section 13-Alpha.

454
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,236
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

455
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,487
<i>It appears that Mr. Tuvok</i>
<i>and Kes were both hit</i>

456
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,032
<i>by an unidentified</i>
<i>energy discharge.</i>

457
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:32,452
<i>Tuvok was not badly hurt,</i>
<i>but Kes is in a coma.</i>

458
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,830
It was similar to the attack
on the shuttlecraft--

459
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,291
an energy discharge
came through the bulkhead,

460
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,334
filled the turbolift

461
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,877
and hit
both of us.

462
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,837
We didn't pick up a
discharge of any kind

463
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,172
on the internal sensors.

464
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,590
Perhaps this type
of energy

465
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,050
is beyond our
sensor bandwidth.

466
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,593
JANEWAY:
Perhaps.

467
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,096
But that discharge
had to come from somewhere.

468
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,848
The most thorough
scanning device we have on board

469
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,600
is a magneton scanner.

470
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,936
We could search the ship
centimeter by centimeter,

471
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,812
but that wouldn't do much good.

472
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,399
This alien could be
anywhere at any time.

473
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,568
But what if we could perform
a magneton scan

474
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,695
on the entire ship all at once?

475
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,239
What do you suggest?

476
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,324
A magneton flash-scan.

477
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,077
We could reconfigure
every sensor array

478
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,746
on the ship to emit
a single burst.

479
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,290
It might be enough
to illuminate

480
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,374
any anomalous energy.

481
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,625
Harry, what do you think?

482
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,509
Whoa!

483
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,262
What did I do?

484
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,805
Stay where you
are, Mr. Kim.

485
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,141
I don't see
anything unusual,

486
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,310
but that doesn't
mean anything.

487
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,644
JANEWAY:
Mr. Kim?

488
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,854
What were you doing just now?

489
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,565
I was just thinking.

490
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,943
I was remembering
an old study I saw

491
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,612
about magneton scanners.

492
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,700
I guess my mind
started to wander a bit.

493
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,829
I'm very disturbed
by what just happened here.

494
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,208
We don't have
any idea what occurs

495
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,794
when someone is occupied
by this alien presence.

496
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,797
If we start pointing
a finger every time

497
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,132
someone gets distracted,

498
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,050
it won't be long
before outright paranoia

499
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,718
starts sweeping the ship.

500
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,264
Tuvok, B'Elanna, I want you
to get started on

501
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,434
that magneton flash-scan.
It's worth a try.

502
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,769
Dismissed.

503
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,317
NEELIX:
And that's not all.

504
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,527
Ensign Parsons
ordered his<i> pejuta</i> cold.

505
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,696
So?

506
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,240
He always drinks it
hot,<i> hot!</i>

507
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,658
With lemon...
but not today.

508
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,953
Today, it's cold<i> pejuta,</i>
hold the lemon.

509
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,580
Mr. Neelix, just because
a man changes his drink order

510
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,916
doesn't mean
he's possessed by an alien.

511
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,212
Nevertheless, don't you think
you should... scan him

512
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:50,216
or dissect him or something
just to make sure?

513
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,925
I could examine
every crew member

514
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,219
you've mentioned so far,

515
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,095
every person on board
for that matter,

516
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,638
and it wouldn't
do any good.

517
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,807
From what we can tell,
the alien can jump

518
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,684
from person to person
at will.

519
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,897
Sounds<i> to me</i> like you're
defending Ensign Parsons.

520
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,857
I'm not defending him.

521
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,027
I'm just pointing out that
you're acting a little paranoid.

522
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,695
In fact...

523
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,781
one could say you're acting
a little<i> too</i> paranoid.

524
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,242
Are you suggesting that I...?

525
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,035
That I could
possibly...?

526
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,828
Doctor, I can
assure you,

527
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,539
not even an alien intruder

528
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,665
could make me do
anything to hurt Kes.

529
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,504
All I'm suggesting,
Mr. Neelix,

530
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,548
is that paranoia is only
going to aggravate

531
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:33,050
your already precarious
emotional condition.

532
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,177
Try to relax.

533
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,304
I don't think
Kes has suffered

534
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,597
any permanent
neurological damage.

535
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,058
I'll let you know the moment

536
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,684
I've had any success
in reviving her.

537
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,896
I'll be back as soon
as you wake,

538
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,189
dearest,
and don't worry.

539
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,566
You're in good hands.

540
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,069
Thank you, Doctor.

541
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,785
What are you doing?

542
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,079
I am reconfiguring the
sensor relays on the ship.

543
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,414
This will only
take a minute.

544
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,582
Must you do it now?

545
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,584
I'm in the middle
of a treatment.

546
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,919
I am sorry, Doctor.
Captain's orders.

547
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,004
How is she?

548
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,048
No irreparable damage.

549
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,927
In fact, her injuries
are quite different

550
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,471
from Commander Chakotay's.

551
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,014
Her bio-neural energy
is completely intact,

552
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,975
and I'm curious
about these contusions

553
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,477
on her neck and shoulder.

554
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,979
They're not consistent
with an energy discharge.

555
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,355
They look more like wounds

556
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,190
sustained during
a physical struggle.

557
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,778
Odd. There was no physical
struggle that I can recall.

558
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,780
I just don't understand it.

559
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,366
The only thing these injuries
come close to resembling

560
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,495
is an extreme trauma
to the trapezius nerve bundle.

561
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,789
It's as though her nerve fibers
have been ruptured.

562
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,792
( door chimes )

563
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,169
Come in.

564
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,090
Lieutenant Torres and I
will be ready to initiate

565
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,260
the magneton scan
in approximately two hours.

566
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,637
You should be aware
that it will be

567
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,971
a high-intensity burst.

568
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,098
It will cause dizziness
and disorientation

569
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,891
in all crew members,
including myself,

570
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,560
for several seconds.

571
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,438
Make a shipwide announcement
before you initiate the scan.

572
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,023
Aye, Captain.

573
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,900
There is another matter
of some concern.

574
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,944
It appears that Kes's injuries

575
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,238
were not caused
by an energy discharge.

576
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,073
The doctor
has found evidence

577
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,617
that she was
physically assaulted.

578
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,330
Assaulted...

579
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,044
But you weren't
physically assaulted.

580
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,838
That is correct.

581
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,799
Is it possible that you
inflicted her wounds?

582
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,260
Me?

583
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,222
Maybe you were inhabited
by the alien at that moment.

584
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,392
It is possible.

585
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,185
Perhaps we should
have the doctor

586
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,271
run a neurological scan to see
if I show a memory disruption.

587
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,231
Agreed.

588
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,732
Janeway to Sick Bay.

589
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,404
Computer, activate emergency
medical holographic system.

590
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,822
Unable to comply.

591
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,409
The EMH program
has been disabled.

592
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,993
Disabled? By whom?

593
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,704
Unknown.

594
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:14,044
The doctor's initialization
routine has been locked out.

595
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,046
It's encrypted.

596
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,465
I can't reactivate the program.

597
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,966
It appears the lockout

598
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,135
originated
somewhere above Deck 4.

599
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,597
Why would someone
deactivate the doctor?

600
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:28,350
The doctor does hold
the command codes to<i> Voyager.</i>

601
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,186
Yes, but once
he was deactivated,

602
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,355
the codes automatically
reverted back to me.

603
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,900
If we assume the alien

604
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,445
could not take over
the holographic doctor,

605
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,615
then logically, it would try
to force the command codes

606
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,783
back into a humanoid host.

607
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,039
Me.

608
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,670
It's too dangerous
for one person

609
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,381
to retain the command codes
at this point.

610
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,217
I suggest we divide
my command protocols

611
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,303
into two
code groupings.

612
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,929
A sensible precaution.

613
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,431
You would be
the reasonable choice

614
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,391
to hold the second grouping,

615
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,852
if there's any such thing as
a reasonable choice right now.

616
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:19,318
The alien could occupy
either one of us at any time.

617
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:23,029
But, presumably, not both
of us at the same time.

618
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,906
I'll tell
the Bridge crew the plan.

619
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,826
We'll all have to act as checks
and balances for each other.

620
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,870
I want you all to be aware
of something that has happened--

621
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,708
something I must assume
was due to the alien.

622
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,126
The doctor has
been deactivated,

623
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,003
and we can't get
him back on line.

624
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,047
I have decided to divide
my command protocols.

625
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,010
Captain...

626
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,474
Stun her.

627
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,558
She's the alien.

628
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,549
( sighs )

629
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,258
That should
do it, Captain.

630
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,259
Thank you, Mr. Paris.

631
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,136
I feel better already.

632
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,056
Any luck getting
the doctor back on line?

633
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,432
Not yet.
Whoever did this

634
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,309
put up one hell
of a roadblock.

635
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,477
I'm going to have
to break through

636
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,103
at least six levels
of encryption

637
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,355
to access
the holo-emitters.

638
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,732
How long is it
going to take?

639
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,692
Two, maybe three hours.

640
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,694
<i>Torres to Janeway.</i>
Go ahead.

641
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,738
<i>Captain, can you come down</i>
<i>to Engineering?</i>

642
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,155
<i>There's something here</i>
<i>I think you should see.</i>

643
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,907
I'm on my way.
Mr. Paris?

644
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,326
You're our temporary medic
until the doctor returns.

645
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,578
Right.

646
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,912
Ensign, I need you
on the Bridge.

647
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,667
TORRES:
I've been trying
to reconstruct

648
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,001
the damaged sensor logs

649
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,212
from Tuvok and
Chakotay's shuttlecraft.

650
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,965
I didn't have any luck
until I ran a parity trace scan.

651
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,677
Captain, the sensor logs
weren't destroyed

652
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,345
by an energy discharge.

653
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,847
Someone erased them,

654
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,766
and then overloaded
the sensor matrix

655
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,726
to make it<i> look</i> like
they'd been damaged.

656
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,728
It gets worse.

657
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,938
There was enough
information left

658
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,648
in the backup logs
for me to reconstruct

659
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,191
what happened during the attack.

660
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,068
They<i> were</i> near
a dark-matter nebula,

661
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,279
and an energy discharge
<i>did</i> breach the hull,

662
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,907
<i>but</i> there was no other ship.

663
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,950
No ship?

664
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,951
I'm certain of it.

665
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,369
From what I can tell,

666
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,329
the energy discharge
came from the nebula itself.

667
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,421
Why would Tuvok lie
about an attack?

668
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,632
He must have been under
the alien's influence.

669
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,425
KIM:
Bridge to Janeway.

670
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,218
We're approaching
the dark-matter nebula.

671
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,845
Acknowledged.

672
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,764
How long until the magneton
flash-scan is ready to go?

673
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,182
The sensor arrays
are charging now.

674
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,184
15, maybe 20 minutes.

675
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,103
When it's ready,
transfer control of the scan

676
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,271
to the Bridge.

677
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,022
In the meantime,
I think we should

678
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,858
take a look
at exactly what it is

679
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,693
we're not supposed
to see.

680
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,995
Mr. Tuvok, can you locate
the ion trail

681
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,832
of the alien ship
that attacked you?

682
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,124
I believe so.

683
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,337
Mr. Kim,

684
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,339
lay in that course.

685
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,634
Shields are at maximum, Captain.

686
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,219
All preparations for entering
the nebula are complete.

687
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,598
Captain, I finished
the bio-analysis

688
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,850
the doctor was
running on Kes

689
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,017
before he was deactivated.

690
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,894
I think he was
onto something.

691
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,689
If I'm interpreting
his data correctly,

692
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,440
the bruises on Kes's
neck and shoulders

693
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,275
were the result
of a Vulcan neck pinch.

694
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,574
Lieutenant?

695
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,452
I have no memory
of injuring Kes.

696
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,372
Perhaps I was occupied
by the alien at that time.

697
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,957
Perhaps so.

698
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:07,963
But then... why does it
keep attacking<i> you?</i>

699
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:13,301
In three separate instances now,
it's assaulted you.

700
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,804
I am the Chief of Security.

701
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,181
It may see me
as a particular threat.

702
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,643
So far, you've posed no greater
threat than anyone else.

703
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:25,898
And yet, it keeps
going after you.

704
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,859
Captain, I believe
you are having

705
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,903
a typically human response
to circumstances

706
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,279
which are frightening
and inexplicable

707
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,490
commonly known as paranoia.

708
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,325
Maybe...

709
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,119
but I don't think it's paranoia
that's keeping me

710
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,997
from picking up
this ion trail of yours.

711
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,623
What bandwidth are you on?

712
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,043
I am using
a multiphasic scan.

713
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,628
If you examine the Alpha-K band,
you will see it.

714
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:55,468
Yes, here it is.
A very interesting ion trail.

715
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,681
There's no sign of any subspace
distortions in its wake.

716
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:05,604
According to these readings...
it's a ship without engines.

717
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,274
You're lying, Tuvok.

718
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:13,737
There is no alien ship
and there never was.

719
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,697
We're not going inside
that nebula

720
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,783
until we get some answers.

721
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,158
Mr. Kim, reverse course.

722
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,702
Belay that order.

723
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,996
That is exactly what the alien
has been trying to do--

724
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,957
keep us from entering
the nebula.

725
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,751
I suspect the captain
has been occupied.

726
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,711
I am relieving her
of command.

727
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,171
Ensign, proceed into the nebula,
one-half impulse.

728
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,757
Don't do it, Harry.

729
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,802
<i>Now,</i> Ensign.

730
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,515
No, sir.

731
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,392
I won't do it.

732
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,727
I must inform you.

733
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,270
This phaser is on
wide-beam dispersal

734
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,521
and set to kill.

735
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,983
I am taking command
of this Bridge.

736
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,484
I must ask you all
to stand together

737
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,777
where I can see you.

738
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,821
Step away
from the console, Ensign.

739
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,956
Captain, we're entering
the nebula.

740
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,553
Captain, I'm picking up
some kind of energy pulses

741
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,639
in the nebula--
highly coherent

742
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,390
with a bio-matrix.

743
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,976
Life-forms...

744
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,936
And they're
heading this way.

745
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,900
Those beings out there--
are they your people?

746
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,694
We are the Komar.

747
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,696
This is our domain.

748
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,014
What's happening?

749
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,849
The warp core
has been ejected.

750
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,517
No.

751
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,602
No. We must continue.

752
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,522
TORRES:<i> Torres to Bridge.</i>
<i>Captain,</i>

753
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,525
I think I was just
taken over by the alien.

754
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,443
One second, I was working
the plasma relays,

755
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,820
and the next thing I knew,
I was ejecting

756
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,155
<i>the warp core.</i>

757
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,990
Acknowledged, Lieutenant.
Stand by.

758
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,616
I don't get it.

759
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,036
If the alien's in Tuvok,
how could it be

760
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,163
down in Engineering
at the same time?

761
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,664
I don't know.

762
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,834
Unless there are
two aliens.

763
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,087
Two?

764
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,716
Wait a minute.

765
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,509
Lieutenant Torres
isn't authorized

766
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,012
to eject the warp core
on her own.

767
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:47,473
That requires a command
code authorization.

768
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,727
Computer, who authorized the
ejection of the warp core?

769
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,272
<i>The authorization was entered</i>
<i>by Commander Chakotay.</i>

770
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,528
Chakotay...

771
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,321
How is that possible?

772
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:06,284
The alien in Tuvok
wants us in that nebula,

773
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,744
but there's another presence

774
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,454
that's been trying
to keep us out.

775
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,665
It doesn't make sense
unless it's Chakotay.

776
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,710
And he knows we'll be in
danger if we go in there.

777
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,795
But he's in Sick Bay.

778
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,337
He's brain dead.

779
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,756
Maybe not.

780
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,801
Maybe his neural energy
was displaced somehow,

781
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,470
and he's able to move
from person to person.

782
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,642
Tuvok's engaged
emergency thrusters.

783
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,727
We're moving
again, Captain.

784
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,198
You brought us
here-- for what?

785
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,325
To extract
our neural energy?

786
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,286
Very perceptive, Captain.

787
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,830
The collective neural energy
of your crew

788
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,457
will sustain my people
for years to come.

789
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,960
You don't have to do this.

790
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,921
Maybe we can help you
find another source of energy.

791
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,506
Captain, we're
under attack.

792
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,258
We're being bombarded
by the energy beings.

793
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,763
( groaning )

794
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,652
( tricorder beeping )

795
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,413
The magneton scan identified

796
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,707
the entity
before it left the ship.

797
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,210
It was a trianic-based
energy being.

798
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,254
Looks like he's joined
his friends outside.

799
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,588
Shields are holding,

800
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,841
but they won't last long
at this rate,

801
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,301
and
the electromagnetic radiation

802
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,719
is blinding our sensors.

803
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,388
I can't find a way out.
Come about.

804
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,140
Maybe if we reverse course,
we can just backtrack.

805
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,599
Yes, ma'am.

806
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,434
I don't know if
that'll work, Captain.

807
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,520
Tuvok was navigating
a complicated course.

808
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,605
We could be going deeper
into the nebula.

809
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,858
Mr. Kim, maybe you can
reconstruct Tuvok's

810
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:02,775
navigational logs.

811
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,443
I'm on it, Captain.

812
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,778
( alarm beeping )

813
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,613
Shields down to 65 percent,
Captain.

814
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,909
The energy beings are starting
to penetrate our defenses.

815
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,514
KIM:
I'm not having any luck.

816
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,017
Tuvok deleted the navigational
logs as he went along.

817
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,936
He wanted to make sure
we didn't get out of here.

818
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,272
<i>Neelix to Bridge.</i>
Go ahead.

819
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:43,441
<i>Captain, I can't be sure,</i>

820
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,402
but I think I was just
taken over by the alien.

821
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,320
<i>And I've done something</i>
<i>very strange.</i>

822
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,407
<i>I've rearranged the stones</i>
<i>on the medicine wheel.</i>

823
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,826
If it's Chakotay,

824
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,494
maybe he's trying
to tell us something.

825
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:59,749
Mr. Kim, activate
Sick Bay Visual Relay 16

826
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,209
and put it on the viewscreen.

827
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,710
KIM:
Aye, Captain.

828
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,509
What is it?
What does it mean?

829
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,388
Is it a code?
A message?

830
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,973
Or a map...

831
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,642
Computer, overlay a star map
of the nebula

832
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,394
on the current viewscreen image.

833
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,315
PARIS:
The stones

834
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,733
are in the same position
as those three planetoids.

835
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,528
Chakotay must be using them
to point a way out.

836
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:34,200
Mr. Kim, lay in a course
that takes us along a line

837
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,203
connecting
those three planetoids.

838
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,497
Engage.

839
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,087
Shields failing!

840
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,006
The aliens
are penetrating the hull.

841
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,342
Mr. Kim, report.

842
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,677
We're passing the
third planetoid now, Captain.

843
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,053
The dark matter density
is thinning.

844
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,180
Reading normal space ahead.

845
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,639
Bridge to Torres.

846
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,433
Transfer all remaining power
to the thrusters--

847
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,476
including life support.

848
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,817
We've cleared
the nebula, Captain.

849
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,944
Main power coming back on line.

850
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,404
Shields at full strength.

851
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,864
Hull integrity normal.

852
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,908
The alien beings
are not pursuing.

853
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,960
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48735.9.</i>

854
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,462
<i>We have returned</i>
<i>to the coordinates</i>

855
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,005
<i>where we ejected</i>
<i>the warp core</i>

856
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,007
<i>and have successfully</i>
<i>retrieved it.</i>

857
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,426
<i>Now we're hoping the doctor</i>
<i>will be able to successfully</i>

858
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,137
<i>reintegrate Commander</i>
<i>Chakotay's consciousness.</i>

859
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,144
Did it work?

860
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,021
It appears so.

861
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,233
Commander...

862
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,861
Can you hear me?

863
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,409
Yes.

864
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,578
I'm a little dizzy,
but I think

865
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,787
I'm all here...

866
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,043
How did you manage

867
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,212
to reintegrate
his consciousness?

868
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,964
It involved
three neural transceivers,

869
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,426
two cortical stimulators,

870
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:15,885
and 50 gigaquads
of computer memory.

871
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,011
I would be happy

872
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,346
to take you
through the process,

873
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:19,597
but it would take
at least ten hours

874
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,307
to explain it all to you.

875
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,478
Needless to say, it was
a remarkable procedure.

876
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,188
I would consider
writing a paper about it

877
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,357
if there were a convenient forum
in which to publish it.

878
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,365
What happened,
Commander?

879
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,121
After the attack on the shuttle,

880
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:48,418
I had the sensation of...
floating above my own body.

881
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,504
I thought I was dead.

882
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,381
And when the shuttle
returned to<i> Voyager,</i>

883
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,800
you were still
disembodied?

884
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,802
Yes.

885
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:02,807
I couldn't speak.
I couldn't touch anything.

886
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,185
But then I found that
if I concentrated on someone

887
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,646
who was in the room with me...

888
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,775
I could share
their consciousness.

889
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,444
At first, I could only
do little things

890
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:19,698
with the host's body--
push buttons, work a console.

891
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,327
As time went on...

892
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,121
it became easier to do more.

893
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,706
Sorry I had to
knock you around, Tuvok.

894
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,418
No apologies necessary.

895
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:39,636
Good job, Commander,
and welcome back.

896
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:44,890
To be honest,
I feel like I never left.

00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,980
