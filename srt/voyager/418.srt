You should have killed me
when my back was turned.

00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,252
I want to see the
fear in your eyes.

12

Look closely and you'll
see your own destruction.

13

You are resilient prey.

00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,156
There were times

27
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:20,283
when she seemed...
aware of who she is.

28
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,827
Impossible.

29
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,245
I was monitoring the crew
during the entire simulation.

She believes she's whoever
we program her to be.

Shall I return her
to the Klingon simulation?

32

No. Bring her to Holodeck 1.

33

I've found another program
I want to try.

Obey me,

93
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,008
or I will hunt you down

94
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,677
and your bones will adorn
the bulkhead of my ship.

95
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,930
Sit down and
play the game.

96
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,682
In this setting,
we have no ships.

97
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,768
We are an ancient
race of soldiers

98
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,478
intent upon
conquering this world.

99
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,731
Play the game.

100
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,400
Now, now. What's this?

101
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,567

110
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,586

You leave the war outside.

113
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,011
I wish to
speak with her...

114
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,471
alone.

00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,405
He is disoriented.

118
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,074
Your world is
unfamiliar to him.

119
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,575
He'll be comfortable
soon enough.

120
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,953
The arms of France
are open to all.

121
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,955
I've heard otherwise.

122
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,081
What do you mean?

123
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,000
I understand
there is opposition

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,003
to our presence here
among your citizens.

125
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,421
The Resistance? Ha.

126
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,798
In Paris, perhaps,

127
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,051
but this is a small city,
defenseless.

128
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,554
We've learned to be
a little more diplomatic.

129
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,265
When this war is over,

130
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,310
we want to remain
on good terms with the victor.

131
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,561
Whoever that may be.

132
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,230
Whoever that may be.

133
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,400
Your city may
be defenseless,

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,277
but it's crucial
to the war.

135
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,612
Any ground assault
into Germany

136
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,032
must pass through
this province.

137
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,035
The Resistance
will come here.

138
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,954
If they do, I'll tell them
what I tell everyone.

139
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,582
Leave the war outside.

140
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,004
Excellent.

141
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,422
Commandant, I've
been informed

142
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,133
there's a problem in
the Engineering section.

143
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,969
The warp plasma network
has become unstable.

144
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,762
What's he talking about?

145
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,723
It need not concern you.

146
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,977
To the hunt.

147
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,270
"The hunt"?

148
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,938
For the Resistance.

149
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,067
I shall take great pleasure
in tracking them down.

150
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,653
And making the kill.

151
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,832
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

152
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,543
<i>Au revoir.</i>

153
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,675
How'd we do?

154
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,554
Insufficient
for a Saturday night.

155
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,265
1,247 francs
and 81 Reichsmarks.

156
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,516
Well, it should be enough

157
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,351
to buy an oscillator
to extend the range

158
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,643
of our radio.

159
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,645
First thing tomorrow
morning, I want you

160
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,940
to take a little trip
to the countryside.

161
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,484
There's a Monsieur Groleau
who has a cottage

162
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,278
just past the third bridge.

163
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,114
He's got a wine cellar
full of vacuum tubes.

164
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,533
Tell him we need a high
frequency oscillator.

165
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,784
Offer him 300 francs,

166
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,827
but don't go any
higher than 500.

167
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,746
We have more pressing needs.

168
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,039
Such as?

169
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,041
Explosives. We need
a launcher that can fire

170
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,667
armor-piercing grenades.

171
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,628
Ha. Planning on blowing
up a German tank?

172
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,046
If necessary.

173
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,215
We're not trying
to build an army here.

174
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,509
Well, maybe it's time we did.

175
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,844
Three more German battalions
have occupied the city

176
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,763
and a panzer division
is holding position

177
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,432
11 kilometers away.

178
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,683
When the Americans arrive
and the fighting begins,

179
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,769
I don't intend to be standing
next to a piano

180
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,480
singing "Moonlight Becomes You."

181
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,939
The Americans won't
even be able

182
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,066
to approach this city
without our help.

183
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,651
And if they can't
liberate Sainte Claire,

184
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,945
the assault into
Germany could fail.

185
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,905
We need to be
gathering information

186
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,198
about German
troop movements

187
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,159
and relaying it
to Allied Command.

188
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,369
I'm tired of lighting
the Nazis' cigarettes

189
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,954
and laughing at their jokes.

190
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,247
We should be helping
the Allies

191
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,999
by assassinating these pigs.

192
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,459
The moment we
start shooting,

193
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,085
we expose ourselves.

194
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,338
Right now, no
one suspects us,

195
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,632
and I am not about to
risk our entire operation

196
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,133
because you've
suddenly developed

197
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,426
a nervous trigger finger.

198
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,303
That is your opinion, Madame.

199
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,971
I'm the leader
of the movement here,

200
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,056
and right now, my opinion
is the only one that counts,

201
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,391
so get the oscillator.

202
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,146
I think we're all
feeling the strain.

203
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,439
It's been a hard four years,

204
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,065
but believe me,

205
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,609
the Third Reich
is feeling it, too.

206
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,777
We just have to hang on
a little while longer.

207
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,238
Word from the Americans
is going to come any day.

208
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,867
Perhaps.

213
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,834
Why is she so adamant?

214
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,253
What she's proposing
would put us all at risk.

215
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,589
Maybe that's
her intention.

216
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,091
If you have suspicions,
my old friend,

217
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,426
let's hear them.

218
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,803
From the beginning,
she's been argumentative

219
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,556
and on more than
a few occasions,

220
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,391
she's disobeyed
your direct orders.

221
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,685
She's headstrong--
typical of the underground.

222
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,562
Nevertheless,
her behavior

223
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,397
has threatened
our identities.

224
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,773
She's the only
munitions expert we have

225
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,651
and she can carry a tune.

226
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,902
We need her.

227
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,736
Let's keep our eye on her.

228
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,490
Have her followed
for the next few days.

229
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,326
If she is
a Nazi infiltrator,

230
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,828
we'll have to eliminate her.

244
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,564

certainly will.

in your own words.

364
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:45,666
Tell me. Why are
we the "Master Race"?

365
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,544
Our blood is pure.

366
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,172
Our people lived and hunted on
this land for a thousand years

367
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,842
before the degenerate races
brought their corruption.

368
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,053
Europe must be purified.

369
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,471
You, yourself...

370
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,099
are you stronger than
these "degenerate" races?

371
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,308
More cunning?

372
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,977
Yes, of course.
And if you were alone

373
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,645
without an army
supporting you,

374
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,980
would you continue
the hunt?

375
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,023
If your prey were armed

376
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,067
instead of defenseless,
what then?

377
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,944
I-- Colonel, I don't know
what you're trying--

378
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,738
<i>You</i> are superior
to no one!

379
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,993
Never underestimate your prey
or disrespect its abilities.

380
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,871
If you do,
<i>you</i> will become the hunted.

381
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,499
When the opposing army
invades this city,

382
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,043
remember my words.

383
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,377
( knocking )

384
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,671
Enter!

385
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:35,967
Brigitte!

386
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,426
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,262
I know I'm not
supposed to come here.

388
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,639
Don't blame him.

389
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,516
I told him I was ill,
that I had to see you.

390
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,520
I will leave
you two alone.

391
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,440
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

392
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,114
It's all right.

393
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,867
The colonel is in
a strange mood today.

394
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,952
( gasping )

395
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,707
What's wrong?
Is it our child?

396
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,375
I don't know.

397
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,044
I was dizzy.
I'll call the doctor.

398
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,545
No!

399
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,505
I feel better now.

400
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,590
Maybe I just needed
to see you.

401
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,054
Why haven't you shown
me this place before?

402
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,098
I didn't want your neighbors
to see you coming here.

403
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,017
They make it
difficult enough for you,

404
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,185
knowing we're together.

405
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,645
I don't care
what they think.

406
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,690
It's beautiful.

407
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,986
Praxiteles, master sculptor
of ancient Greece.

408
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,781
There are only three
like this in all of Europe.

409
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:45,161
So many...
wonderful things.

410
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,329
( telegraph beeping )

411
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,083
( people chattering )

412
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,168
The commandant would
have us continue

413
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,587
this simulation
until we rot.

414
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,796
It's pointless.

415
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,631
We should
begin the hunt.

416
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,177
He believes we must learn
more about our prey,

417
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,137
but I have
learned enough.

418
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,391
Ready your weapon.

419
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,726
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

420
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,145
Avoid the cranium.

421
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,775
( grunting )

422
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,991
This way!
But-- The message!

423
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,118
There's no time.

424
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,703
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

425
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,007
( whistle blowing )

426
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,927
( soldiers yelling in German)

427
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,651
Ah!

428
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,654
( both groan )

429
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,864
Computer,

430
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,491
exit holodeck.

431
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,409
We'll take them
to the medical bay.

432
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,251
( devices humming )

433
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,753
This neural interface
has been damaged.

434
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,463
That's because it
took a direct hit

435
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,590
when one of your bullets
grazed the base of her skull.

436
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,717
I'll provide you with
another-- install it.

437
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,343
Not until I've repaired
her injuries.

438
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,470
How long?

439
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,972
She has two
fractured vertebrae

440
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,141
and a punctured lung--
another hour at least.

441
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,309
Him?

442
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,768
I've stabilized
his vital systems,

443
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,352
but he still has
bullet fragments

444
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,562
lodged in his shoulder.

445
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,814
I will treat him.

446
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,691
This time, you might
do a better job

447
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,567
repairing
the muscle lacerations.

448
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,986
The last crew member
you treated

449
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,696
was brought back in
with internal bleeding.

450
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,281
Your crew is fragile.

451
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,365
They fall too easily.

452
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,659
What do you expect?

453
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,703
They've been stabbed,
shot, beaten, phasered

454
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,412
and<i> bat'lethed</i> over
the past three weeks.

455
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,707
Their bodies weren't designed
for this kind of punishment.

456
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:55,958
What happened?

457
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,543
These prey were
hunted by Turanj.

458
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,337
Their injuries
are severe.

459
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,629
You assured me
that your people

460
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,380
would avoid causing
serious head injuries.

461
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,757
Another centimeter

462
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,634
and the bullet would have
penetrated her brain.

463
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,345
If you can't keep
your people under control,

464
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,138
then you should put an end
to this blood sport.

465
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,973
The simulations will continue.

466
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,975
At least activate the holodeck
safety protocols.

467
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,185
No.

468
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,062
It'll prevent
life-threatening injuries,

469
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,271
for your people as well.

470
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,439
It will also eliminate
the challenge.

471
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,484
I have had 28 wounded
and one fatality

472
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,153
in the past 12 hours.

473
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,488
Even I can't keep up
with that level of triage.

474
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,949
You will keep up
or they will die.

475
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,618
Their lives are in
your hands, doctor.

476
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,411
Don't fail them.

477
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:39,710
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

478
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,339
When that one is ready,
place him in Holodeck 2.

479
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,758
Let's see how he fares
with the Klingons.

480
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,134
What about her?

481
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:51,055
Send her back to Holodeck 1.
I like her voice.

482
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,811
( consoles beeping )

483
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,815
Progress?

484
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,027
By cutting through the bulkheads
on Decks 4, 5 and 6,

485
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,530
we've been able to expand
both holodeck grids

486
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,283
by 5,000 square meters.

487
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,784
More.

488
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,578
( sighs )

489
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,330
I can't give you any more.

490
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,250
Not without compromising
<i>Voyager's</i> primary systems.

491
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,834
Then compromise them.

492
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,670
Look, holodecks require
a tremendous amount of energy.

493
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,673
I've already rerouted power
from all nonessential systems.

494
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:30,136
Anything more, and we'll start
losing propulsion, deflectors

495
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,804
even life support.

496
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,890
I'll transfer a supply
of power nodules from my vessel.

497
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,976
Integrate them
into your systems.

498
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,811
I want to expand
the holo-projectors

499
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,313
into all surrounding sections.

500
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,190
Replicate enough emitters
for the task.

501
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,902
Yes, sir.

502
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,074
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

503
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,079
( grunts )

504
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,831
( sighs )

505
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,458
( devices beeping )

506
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,584
The holo-emitters
in this corridor are stable.

507
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,628
Let's start working
on Section 19.

508
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,800
( quietly ):
But first, tell the guard
to escort you to Engineering.

509
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,261
That we need more equipment.

510
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,847
Specifically, a type-3
isolinear emitter.

511
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,265
If he gives you any trouble,

512
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,517
say "I can't complete
the assignment without it."

513
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,482
We need an isolinear
emitter from Engineering.

514
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,241
( beeping )

515
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,375
Ensign, how did
I get here?

516
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,583
I transferred you here

517
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,252
using the new emitters
in this section.

518
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,544
I assume you've
got a plan?

519
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,381
Half a plan.
Let's hear it.

520
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,631
Before we can
retake the ship,

521
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,008
we've got to get
the crew back.

522
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,177
And that means disabling
the neural interfaces.

523
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,552
Easier said than done.

524
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,680
The great hunters are
everywhere you turn.

525
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,931
Don't worry.

526
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,850
I think I've found
a way to tap

527
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,519
into the Sickbay
diagnostic console.

528
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,686
The only catch is--

529
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,688
( whoosh )

530
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,816
Stand by with the emitter.

531
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,151
I'm almost done here.

532
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,115
The catch, Ensign?

533
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,076
Somebody's got to be
inside the holodeck

534
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,785
to engage the
Bridge control relays.

535
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,121
We're shorthanded.
I know.

536
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,749
Well, we've got a Borg
on board, don't we?

537
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,543
Maybe we can put<i> her</i> 
to good use.

538
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:31,048
(<i> suspenseful theme calming</i> )

539
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,591
I have been studying
<i>Voyager's</i> database

540
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,761
looking for our
next simulation.

541
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,679
There are many
to choose from.

542
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,598
These people have
a violent history.

543
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:44,144
I believe I've found
a worthy prey:

544
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,480
the Borg.

545
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,982
When World War II is over,

546
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,151
we will recreate
a notorious battle

547
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,153
known as "Wolf 359."

548
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,821
I look forward to it.

549
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,242
I thought you might, but if you
continue to disobey me,

550
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,327
this is one hunt
you will never see.

551
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,747
You nearly destroyed
two of my favored prey.

552
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,998
You were careless.

553
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,875
I've become impatient.

554
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,835
We penetrated this vessel,

555
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,297
overcame their defenses

556
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:15,008
and in the moment of the kill,
you forced us to stop.

557
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:19,637
Now we play
these incessant games.

558
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:23,601
It's time we took our trophies
and moved on.

559
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,479
Your lust for the kill
has blinded you

560
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,646
like many young hunters.

561
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,609
If you took the time
to study your prey,

562
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,570
to understand its behavior,
you might learn something.

563
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,822
There is nothing to be learned.

564
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,407
You're wrong.

565
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,076
Each prey exposes us
to another way of life

566
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,328
and makes us reevaluate

567
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,787
our own.

568
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,414
Have you considered
our future?

569
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,832
What will become of us

570
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,084
when we have hunted this
territory to exhaustion?

571
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,920
We will travel
to another part of space,

572
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,881
search for new prey
as we have always done.

573
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,552
A way of life that hasn't
changed for a thousand years.

574
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,179
Why should it?

575
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,681
Species that don't change...

576
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,225
die.

577
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,606
We've lost our way.

578
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,858
We've allowed our
predatory instincts

579
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,652
to dominate us.

580
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,862
We disperse ourselves
throughout the Quadrant,

581
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,781
sending ships
in all directions.

582
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:23,536
We've become
a solitary race, isolated.

583
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,455
We've spread ourselves
too thin.

584
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,790
We're no longer a culture.

585
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,708
We have no identity.

586
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,546
In another thousand years,

587
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,048
no one will remember
the name "Hirogen."

588
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,343
Our people must
come back together,

589
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:43,305
combine forces,
rebuild our civilization.

590
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,973
What of the hunt?

591
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,184
The hunt will
always continue

592
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,478
but in a new way.

593
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,480
I intend to transform
this ship

594
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,106
into a vast simulation

595
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,069
populated with a varied
and endless supply of prey.

596
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:00,197
In time, this technology
can be duplicated

597
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,032
for other Hirogen.

598
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:07,120
These holodecks will allow us
to hold onto our past

599
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,872
while we face the future.

600
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,918
Even if I were persuaded,
others wouldn't be.

601
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,836
Then you are with me.

602
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,259
I must continue
my research.

603
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,761
I'll see you tomorrow
on Holodeck 1.

604
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,390
The Americans are due
to invade.

605
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,768
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

606
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,696
Remain calm
and stay quiet.

607
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,573
There's a Hirogen
working in the bio-lab.

608
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,823
He might hear us.

609
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,909
What's the last
thing you remember?

610
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,244
An attack.

611
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,704
The Hirogen vessels.

612
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,830
They breached our hull
and boarded the ship.

613
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,542
I was in a phaser fight
on Deck 3.

614
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,295
I was struck several times.
That's all I remember.

615
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,504
Then you have no memory

616
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,423
of the simulations
in the holodeck?

617
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,882
None.
The neural interface

618
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,718
must be circumventing
your memory centers.

619
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,885
Neural interface?

620
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,345
It's a subdermal
transmitter

621
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,514
that links your neocortex
to the holodeck.

622
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,224
In essence, it
makes you<i> believe</i>

623
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,810
you're a character
within the program.

624
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,104
Why am I in Sickbay?

625
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,898
You were wounded
in the simulation.

626
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:21,320
It's my job to patch you
all up and send you back in.

627
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,988
Half the crew is
under lock and key.

628
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,699
The rest are fighting for
their lives on the holodeck.

629
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,618
This has been going
on for 19 days--

630
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:28,786
dozens of battle scenarios,

631
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,870
one more brutal
than the next.

632
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,832
You should see what a mess
you were after the Crusades.

633
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,875
Will I be sent
into another simulation?

634
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,212
Yes, but this time...
with an advantage.

635
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,884
I have found a way
to disable the interface

636
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,553
by remodulating
one of your Borg implants

637
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,806
to emit a jamming signal.

638
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,433
Once the Hirogen have brought
you back to the holodeck,

639
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,727
the jamming signal
will activate within seconds.

640
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,228
My objective?

641
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,147
You must find a control panel
inside the holodeck

642
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,149
and engage
the Bridge access relays.

643
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,734
That will enable
Ensign Kim and me

644
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,986
to deactivate
all the neural interfaces.

645
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,155
After Captain Janeway
and the crew regain awareness,

646
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,865
you can work with them
to mount a resistance

647
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,074
against the Hirogen.

648
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,035
What simulation
will I be entering?

649
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,579
World War II--
a 20th century Earth conflict.

650
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,080
Do you know anything
about it?

651
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,290
Nothing.

652
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,958
That could
be a problem.

653
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,336
Once the interface is disabled,
you won't remember anything

654
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,754
about your role
in the simulation.

655
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,131
Think of it
as a new social setting.

656
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,883
Do your best to fit in.

657
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,803
This is the last
neural interface.

658
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,095
When you've
finished with her,

659
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,472
you'll help me
replicate more.

660
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,560
I have to sedate you now.

00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,401
I must discontinue

there, Commandant.

I'm sure she's fine.

676
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,289
Let me talk to her.

00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,669
I require
a glass of water.

679
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,921
Make it a quick one.

680
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,130
I promised the commandant

681
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,673
you'd be singing
till midnight.

682
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,842
I want to get a lot of
information out of him tonight.

683
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,093
I am ill.

684
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,053
Look, I don't care
if you're dying.

685
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,430
Get back out there.

686
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,808
I won't.

687
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,315
Maybe you're right about her.

688
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,567
The evidence is increasing.

689
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,944
She was present today

690
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,070
when our courier was
shot down in the street,

691
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,281
yet somehow,
she was unharmed.

692
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,326
And now, on the eve
of our liberation,

693
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,411
she becomes
uncooperative.

694
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,913
Leave this to me.

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,335

696

00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,721
At ease.
What's the word?

698
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,140
There is no word, at least
not from the Resistance

699
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,684
in Sainte Claire.

700
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,978
Then we won't get any support
from inside the city.

701
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,187
You may be underestimating

702
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,605
the good citizens
of Sainte Claire.

703
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,106
I spent a summer there
when I was 18.

704
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,650
Let me guess.

705
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,402
You ate a few snails, fell
in love with a local girl

706
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,196
and became an expert
on the city.

707
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,449
Uh, well, ah.

708
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,326
Yeah, pretty much like that.

709
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,870
I see.

710
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,121
But believe me, Captain,
those people love their town.

711
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,915
They'll fight for it
<i>and</i> die for it.

712
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,876
Don't count them out yet.

713
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,545
All right,

714
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,006
but I won't count
them in, either.

715
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,423
We continue as planned--

716
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,425

at first light.

00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,390
So, who was the mademoiselle?

( laughs )

720
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,687
Her name was Brigitte.

721
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,438
Great gams.

722
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,690
One hell of a temper.

723
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,316
Sounds like your kind of girl.

724
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,946
August 29, 1936...

725
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,908
12:17 P.M.

726
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,535
That's when my train
pulled out of Sainte Claire.

727
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,371
That's the last time I saw her.

728
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,583
We wrote to each other
every week for three years.

729
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,334
Then the war broke out,

730
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,336
and I never heard
from her again.

731
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,047
Sainte Claire's not a big place.

732
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,257
She shouldn't be
too hard to find.

733
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,926
Heh. I'm counting on it.

734
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,097
JANEWAY:
You'll maintain position here,

735
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,348
20 meters from the front doors.

736
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,100
Arm yourself with
a submachine gun,

737
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,852
and watch for any
sign of trouble.

738
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,062
Understood.

739
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,479
Now, we've observed
a 20-second break

740
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,231
in the guard rotation
at 4:15 A.M.

741
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,816
That should give you
and me enough time

742
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,192
to enter the building

743
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,070
through the storm window
on the eastern wall.

744
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,362
When I was there yesterday,

745
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,197
I saw guards posted
at all three stairways.

746
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,741
So you'll have to reach
the second floor

747
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,992
through the
elevator shaft.

748
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,535
The command post is
in the main gallery

749
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,703
at the end of the hall.

750
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,329
Once inside, we
plant the charges,

751
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,623
load the transmitter.

752
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,165
You'll remain here.

753
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,751
If something goes wrong
and we're caught,

754
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,544
destroy all evidence
of the underground--

755
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,464
our contact lists,
decryption codes-- everything.

756
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,673
Right.

757
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,258
We leave in one hour.

758
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,055
( door opens and closes)

759
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,229
This won't make
much of a bang.

760
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,857
You forgot to connect
the detonator.

761
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,609
I will correct the error.

762
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,069
It's lucky I found
your little error.

763
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,612
It might have
undermined our mission.

764
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,572
Are you having second
thoughts about tonight?

765
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,991
No.

766
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,909
Good, because I don't
want any more mistakes.

767
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,285
There won't be any.

768
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,162
Let's hope not.

769
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,791
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

770
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,676
( beeping )

771
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,052
( sighs )

772
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,553
We've got to stop
meeting like this.

773
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,263
I managed to grab
a quick scan of Holodeck 1,

774
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,141
and it looks like
Seven of Nine is on the move.

775
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,558
Are you ready in Sickbay?

776
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,978
My Hirogen taskmaster is
working in the bio-lab.

777
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,521
I'll have access to
the medical console

778
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,189
for another 20
minutes at least.

779
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,232
That'll give me enough time
to get to the Bridge and--

780
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,193
( door opens )

781
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,736
( beeps )

782
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,072
Good afternoon.

783
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,449
What are you
doing in here?

784
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,618
Trying to get the replicator
system back on line...

785
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,245
unless you prefer
the emergency rations.

786
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,582
Personally, I'm getting
tired of synthetic protein.

787
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,669
You're supposed to be the
finest hunters in the Quadrant.

788
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,672
Why don't you find us
something a little more tasty?

789
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,257
Something wrong?

790
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,469
An unauthorized transmission
was sent from this room.

791
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,346
What kind of transmission?

792
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,597
I don't know.

793
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,558
Maybe<i> you</i> can tell<i> me.</i>

794
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,602
Well...I was trying
to reroute power

795
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,938
from the main computer
to the replicators.

796
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,149
Oh, of course.

797
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,652
I must have tripped
a communications subroutine.

798
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,154
Sorry about that.

799
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,655
Didn't mean to worry you.

800
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,490
Your people have damaged

801
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,576
just about every system
on this vessel.

802
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,994
Accidents are bound to happen.

803
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,872
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm due on the Bridge.

804
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,123
Show it to me.

805
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,332
What?

806
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,292
I want to see
this subroutine.

807
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,796
Show me what you were doing
when the "accident" occurred.

808
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,173
Forget it.

809
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,092
I don't have time.

810
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,635
( groaning )

811
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,055
Do as I say.

812
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,264
All right!

813
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,517
( panting )

814
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,394
But you'd better
call the Bridge.

815
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:55,148
Tell your superior
I'm going to be late--

816
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,235
that I'm working
under your orders now, not his.

817
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,570
Go ahead.

818
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,405
Make the call.

819
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,117
I don't want to take the blame
for this.

820
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,327
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

821
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,747
Report to the Bridge.

822
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,083
Thanks.

823
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,841

830
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:10,056
Set the charges here,
here and there.

831
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,434
This looks like a message

832
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,478
from one of their
reconnaissance teams.

833
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:29,117
These must be instructions
for troop deployments.

834
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,954
The Germans must be taking up
new positions outside the city.

835
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,334
It looks like
they're mobilizing

836
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:40,545
more troops than our sources
originally expected.

( beeping )

840
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,385
They're moving armored units
into the valley.

841
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,680
They must know
the Americans are coming.

842
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,848
We've got to warn them somehow.

843
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,225
( clicking )

844
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,852
What are you doing?

845
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,940
You haven't set the charges.

846
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,816
What is that?

847
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,902
I believe it is a transmitter.

848
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,154
I'm attempting to disable it.

849
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,240
You're sending a message
to the Nazis.

850
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,408
No.

851
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:54,077
Step away
or I'll kill you.

Uh, nothing. Just
running a diagnostic...

You've accessed
the neural interface controls.

855
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,792
Stop it immediately.

856
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,002
I told you. No more mistakes.

00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:15,510
Distance: 800 yards. Correct
for crosswinds. Fire at will.

903
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,969
Take cover, boys!

904
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,305
Charlie One isn't
known for accuracy!

905
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,682
I can't access
the ship's systems.

906
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,937
Didn't you say this
was Nazi headquarters?

907
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,605
I did.

908
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,066
Then it would stand to reason
this building is being targeted.

909
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,317
Let's get out of here.

910
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,656
( incoming mortar flying )

911
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,826
( both grunt )

912
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,371
What happened?

913
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,915
There was a simulated explosion
in Holodeck 1.

914
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,293
Somehow it blew out the
holo-grid across three decks.

915
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,169
Is the program
still running?

916
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,754
Yes.

917
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,258
( men shouting in distance )

918
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:02,599
(<i> suspenseful theme</i>
<i>continues playing</i> )

919
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,230
( gasping )

920
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,817
What is it?

921
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,693
It looks like a bunker.

922
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,739
All units, listen up.

923
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,949
We've just blown the lid

924
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,951
off of some kind
of secret Nazi compound.

925
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,786
Converge on my position.

926
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,079
We're going in.

927
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,875
The breach opened the simulation
into the surrounding sections.

928
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,337
I'm picking up holographic
soldiers moving onto Deck 5.

929
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:36,299
Shut down the holo-emitters
until we can regain control.

930
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:39,511
I can't. The program
controls are off-line.

931
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,680
You wanted a war?

932
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,890
Looks like you've got one.

933
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,603
(<i> martial theme playing</i> )

934
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,647
( gunfire continues )

935
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,568
MAN:
Take your positions
on the double.

936
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,028
All right, sir.

937
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,031
Circle to the left.

938
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,660
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

939
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,084
