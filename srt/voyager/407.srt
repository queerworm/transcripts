00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:03,044
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,475
Sorry.

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,726
I didn't realize

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,227
that you'd been
assigned here today.

5
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,896
I wasn't.

6
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,564
This space was unoccupied,

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,816
so I came here to work.

8
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,400
On what?

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,569
I'm reconfiguring
the power couplings

10
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,237
in this section.

11
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,906
Why?

12
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,909
The Astrometrics Lab
requires additional energy.

13
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,369
I see.

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,579
So you're rerouting power
from other locations

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,331
like... Engineering.

16
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,292
They are minor adjustments.

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,252
Primary systems
will not be affected.

18
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,963
Unless, of course,
someone is trying

19
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,715
to do a warp core
diagnostic,

20
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,551
which my crew has been
trying to do all morning.

21
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,137
We have lost hours of work
because of this.

22
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,640
There is no need
for anger.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,809
I had no intention
of causing a problem.

24
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,354
What, "sorry" isn't in
the Borg vocabulary?

25
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,524
You need to
check with me

26
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,568
before you touch
the power systems.

27
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,319
Understood?

28
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,822
Understood.

29
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,791
I am unaccustomed
to working in a hierarchy.

30
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,001
In the collective,

31
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,253
there was no need
to ask permission.

32
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,880
If you're going to be
a member of this crew,

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,172
get used to it.
( beeping )

34
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,632
Procedures exist
for a reason.

35
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,217
We've got
to work together.

36
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,011
We follow
the same set of rules--

37
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,391
Lieutenant?

38
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,185
I was given
that lecture once,

39
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,478
by Captain Janeway

40
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,439
when I first joined
this crew.

41
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,861
If<i> I</i> could adjust
to Starfleet life...

42
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,739
...so can you.

43
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,157
Of course.

44
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,451
I am...

45
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,079
sorry for the inconvenience.

46
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,753
Doc, I've got to go
run a few errands.

47
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,464
I'll be back soon.
Not so fast, Mr. Paris.

48
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,673
Can't these errands wait

49
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,133
until the end
of your duty shift?

50
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,178
Uh... Well, it's my
Conn report, actually.

51
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,723
I just realized
I forgot to turn it in,

52
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,725
and Chakotay gives me
a hard time when it's late.

53
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,227
You've been here
all afternoon.

54
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,438
Didn't this occur
to you before?

55
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,024
Well, we've been
so...busy

56
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,902
that I guess it just
slipped my mind.

57
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,905
I see.

58
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,365
Well, since
it's an emergency,

59
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,284
don't let me
stand in your way.

60
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,619
Thanks.

61
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,919
Hmm.
Sir.

62
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,226
( console beeping )

63
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,024
Computer, lock on
to these coordinates.

64
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,275
I need
a site-to-site transport.

65
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,611
No, wait.

66
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,072
Access the central
replicator files first.

67
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,493
Ah...

68
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,202
perfect.

69
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,539
( sighs )
( beeping )

70
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,999
( whoosh )

71
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,135
Are those supposed
to make up

72
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,054
for canceling on me
last night?

73
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,931
I got stuck with an extra shift
on the Bridge.

74
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,725
What could I say--

75
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,477
"Sorry, Captain, I've got
a date with B'Elanna"?

76
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,521
And what about
right now?

77
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,940
Aren't you supposed
to be working in Sickbay?

78
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,568
I said I had to go
deliver a Conn report.

79
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,195
Not bad.

80
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,697
But he'll be
expecting you back.

81
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,908
He can wait.

82
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,077

84
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,713
What is it?

85
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,008
I just had the feeling that
somebody was watching us.

86
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,719
I must be completely
paranoid

87
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,722
about getting caught in a
compromising position, heh.

88
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,266
Kind of exciting,
isn't it?

89
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,150
(<i> triumphant theme playing</i> )

90
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,172
Your trapezius
is hard as a rock.

91
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,589
You haven't been following

92
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,508
the relaxation regimen
I prescribed for you.

93
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,759
I've been too busy.

94
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,969
The usual story.

95
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,386
Have you been getting
enough sleep?

96
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,223
More or less.
Mostly less.

97
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,598
Mm-hmm. And have
your headaches

98
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,975
been getting any worse?

99
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,895
No, but they're not getting
any better either.

100
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,981
They're like hot needles
driving into my skull.

101
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,942
These symptoms are
hardly surprising, Captain.

102
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,652
You work absurdly
long hours

103
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,113
under constant stress,
eating on the run,

104
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,657
without sufficient
exercise or rest.

105
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,952
Your body is crying out
for mercy.

106
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,205
It certainly is right now.
( spine pops, Janeway gasping )

107
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,249
There must be some easier
way to do this, doctor.

108
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,833
A hypospray, maybe?

109
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,210
Always looking for
the simple fix.

110
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,711
Sometimes there's
no substitute for

111
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,672
intensive osteopathic
pressure therapy.

112
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,132
You're fortunate
to have a masseur

113

who can work all day
without tiring.

CHAKOTAY:<i> Bridge to the Captain.</i>

115

Commander, unless
this is an emergency,

117
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,017
I'm here, Chakotay.
What is it?

118
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,603
CHAKOTAY:
<i>We've reached the source of</i>
<i>those energy readings,</i>

119
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,605
<i>and I thought you'd like to see</i>
<i>what we've found.</i>

120
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,023
On my way.

121
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,483
Captain!
I know what
you're going to say, doctor,

122
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,152
but I can't neglect
my responsibilities.

123
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,905
Actually, I was going to
suggest a change of outfit.

124
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,743
CHAKOTAY:
Binary pulsars.

125
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,037
The gravitational forces
between them are so intense

126
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,872
that everything within
50 million kilometers

127
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,374
is getting pulled in.

128
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,709
Don't worry.
We're well out of range.

129
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,253
Gamma radiation
levels are high,

130
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,754
but as long
as we're careful,

131
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,215
I think we can collect
some invaluable data.

132
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,969
Captain,
am I boring you?

133
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,720
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,098
I guess I'm a little
too tired to concentrate

135
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,516
on stellar phenomena
right now.

136
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,770
I'll leave this project
in your capable hands, hmm?

137
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,820
( people chatting indistinctly )

138
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,198
You wanted to see me,
Lieutenant?

139
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,118
Yes. I'm trying
to increase

140
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,828
the efficiency of
the impulse drive,

141
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,163
but I wanted to make sure

142
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,914
that I wasn't compromising
helm control.

143
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,166
Sensible precaution.

144
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,375
I'd be glad to help.

145
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,542
Good. All of the specs

146
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,211
are at my upper
workstation.

147
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,549
Then let's get started.

00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,892

150
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,481
Did you hear something?

151
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,232
You always think
you hear something.

152
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,067
( turbolift arriving )

153
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,904

00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,406
Lieutenant.

155
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,326
Here is the power usage data
you requested.

156
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,786
Right. Of course.

157
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,997
I didn't expect it
quite so...promptly.

158
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,874
Which I guess I should have,
uh, coming from you.

159
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,376
I mean, I'm grateful

160
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,171
that you got the data
to me so quickly. Thanks.

161
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,550

162
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,635
( both sigh )

165
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,853
( nervous chuckle )

166
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,939
Tuvok, I guess that was
kind of embarrassing.

167
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,733
I don't experience
embarrassment.

168
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,276
Right.

169
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,445
Well, then I guess
there's no harm done.

170
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,696
It's not like there was

171
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,198
a security violation
or anything.

172
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,158
None that
I am aware of.

173
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,327
So I guess
there's nothing

174
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,205
that would have to go on
any kind of report.

175
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,457
You want me to conceal
what I've observed

176

of your relationship
with Lieutenant Torres.

177
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,254
Well, I'd certainly
never ask you

179
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,258
Certainly not.

anything to the Captain?

I don't know.
Well, how did he sound?

182
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,438
Annoyed? Amused?

183
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,731
He sounded Vulcan.
What more can I tell you?

184
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,316
Deck 1.
( beeps )

185
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,528
We have got to be more
careful with appearances.

186
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,613
We shouldn't go into
the briefing at the same time.

187
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,073
Good idea.

188
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,991
Okay, you go in first.
I'll come in a minute later.

189
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,035
No. That'll look
even more suspicious.

190
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,204
Listen to us.
We're acting like criminals

191
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,705
when we haven't done
anything wrong.

192
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,249
Well, I'm not saying
that we have.

193
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,542
I just thought we wanted

194
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,586
to keep this relationship
to ourselves.

195
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,129
We do, right?

196
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,172
Do you?

197
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,591
If you do.

198
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,095
Computer, halt turbolift.
Let's figure out how

199
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,597
we're going to handle this.
( sighs )

200
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,098
Well...

201
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,183
I don't think that it's
anybody else's business

202
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,851
how we feel about each other.

203
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,270
Neither do I.

204
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,230
Right, then we're agreed.

205
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,566
We're just a little
more careful in public,

206
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,568
and we don't say
anything to anybody.

207
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,986
At least for now.

208
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,279
Now?

209
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,615
Sounds like you see
a future in this.

210
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:57,865
( chuckles )

211
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,618
I would never
be so presumptuous.

212
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,702
Smooth recovery,
Lieutenant.

213
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,954
I thought so.

214
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,872
Computer, resume.

215
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,668
So I'll go first,
and you follow.

216
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,212
Right.
( door opens )

217
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,385
Here's the plan.
We'll circle the two pulsars

218
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,596
at a minimum distance
of 80 million kilometers.

219
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,640
That might not be
far enough.

220
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,682
We've been detecting
some random proton bursts.

221
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,310
A strong one could
knock out our shields.

222
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,811
Tom, go to 90.

223
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,021
Keep it a safe distance.

224
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,897
Yes, sir.
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok,

225
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,274
keep our shields
at maximum strength.

226
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,985
Divert auxiliary power
if you need it.

227
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,862
I want to take every precaution
on this survey.

228
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,155
Report any problems immediately,

229
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,698
no matter how small.
JANEWAY: Dismissed.

230
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,910
Lieutenants
Paris and Torres,

231
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,996
I'd like to speak
with you for a moment.

232
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,789
Thanks.

233
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,338
JANEWAY:
I don't usually

234
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,007
pry into the personal lives
of my crew, but in this case,

235
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,842
I have to question
your recent conduct.

236
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,844
I guess Tuvok...
JANEWAY: Tuvok?

237
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,555
I haven't heard a word
from Tuvok.

238
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,307
But you two have been making
enough of a public display

239
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,184
that half the ship
is gossiping about it.

240
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,852
Believe me,
that wasn't our intention--

241
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,229
JANEWAY:
You are senior officers,

242
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,105
and I expect you
to maintain the standard

243
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,357
for the rest of the crew.

244
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,900
But this adolescent behavior

245
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,277
makes me question my faith
in you both.

246
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,573
If you choose to
pursue a relationship,

247
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,033
that's your business.

248
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,411
But you consider yourselves
under orders

249
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,828
to use better judgment
about it.

250
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,038
Is that understood?

251
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,249
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, Captain.

252
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,125
Dismissed.

253
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,294
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

254
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,758
( sighs )

255
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,345
( beeping )

256
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,645
( sighs )

257
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:56,443
Computer, hot coffee, black.
( beeping )

258
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,663
( gasping )

259
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:38,109
DOCTOR:
Commander Chakotay is suffering
bone decalcification,

260
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,070
tissue necrosis,
decreased visual acuity--

261
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,905
All classic signs of aging.

262
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,407
But they've developed
within hours.

263
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,824
Any theories?

264
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,161
There's a rare genetic
disorder called progeria,

265
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,580
which causes children
to age prematurely.

266
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,290
But there's never
been an adult case,

267
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,627
and it was supposedly
eradicated two centuries ago.

268
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,797
Even so, I took a close look
at your DNA.

269
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,341
These segments regulate
your body's metabolism.

270
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,843
My scans indicate that they've
been hyper-stimulated somehow.

271
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,471
What's the prognosis?

272
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,056
I can't speculate on that
until I've identified the cause.

273
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,767
There's no sign of
an infectious agent.

274
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,269
We spent several hours
near a binary pulsar

275
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,563
that was emitting
intense gamma radiation.

276
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,148
Our shields were operating.

277
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,941
I don't see how I could
have been exposed to it.

278
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,568
At this point,
we can't rule out anything.

279
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,821
I'm going to take a closer look
at the data we collected.

280
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,072
We should also run
scans of my quarters,

281
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,783
as well as my office
and the Bridge--

282
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,034
Everywhere I've been today.

283
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,327
I'm not prepared

284
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,162
to send you back
on duty yet, Commander.

285
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,372
I may look pretty strange,

286
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,998
but my mind
is perfectly clear.

287
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,083
I'd rather stay busy
than just sit here.

288
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,211
I have no idea how
your symptoms will progress.

289
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,254
You should remain
in Sickbay for observation.

290
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,798
He's right, Chakotay.

291
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,508
I'll keep you informed.

292
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,052
Whatever's affecting
the Commander's DNA

293
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,095
is working at
a submolecular level.

294
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,972
I'd like to set up
an electron resonance scanner

295
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,599
in the Science Lab
to get a closer look.

296
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,767
Use whatever you need.

297
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,101
And ask B'Elanna
to give you a hand.

298
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,895
Still having headaches,
Captain?

299
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,356
I don't need any more lectures
about working too hard, doctor.

300
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,358
Chakotay's the one who needs
your attention right now.

301
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,068
I'll get to work on
the scanner right away.

302
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,319
( door opens )

303
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,446
"Under orders
to use better judgment"?

304
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,614
Well, that's pretty harsh.

305
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,324
I hope
I can manage it.

306
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,368
Well, she does
have a point.

307
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,203
<i>You</i> could have been
more discreet.

308
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,621
Oh. I forgot
I was talking to

309
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,749
the most upstanding Ensign
in Starfleet.

310
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,667
Good morning.
Neelix.

311
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,793
I was just about to whip up

312
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,461
a fresh batch
of scrambled eggs.

313
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,921
Would you like some?
KIM: Actually,

314
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,464
I was hoping
you might have

315
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,216
some leftover
<i>pleekarind</i> casserole

316
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,467
from last night.

317
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,927
For breakfast?

318
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,262
I like it, heh.

319
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,639
I'm sure I can find
some for you.

320
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,267
So I guess
your relationship

321
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,018
isn't exactly
a secret anymore.

322
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,311
Do you think anybody
on this ship

323
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,521
can keep a secret?

324
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,273
( clattering crash )

325
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,608
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

326
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,150
PARIS:
Neelix!

327
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,403
( gasping )

328
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:49,407
Aah-- Aah-- What's--
What's happening?

329
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,742
Paris to the doctor.

330
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,118
I'm bringing Neelix
to Sickbay.

331
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,453
It's an emergency.

332
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,832
DOCTOR:
Now pay attention, Mr. Paris.

333
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,710
These scans should indicate
whether...

334
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,129
Hmm.
What is it?

335
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,423
It seems that your DNA
has been hyper-stimulated,

336
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,091
just like
Commander Chakotay's.

337
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,760
But Neelix doesn't
seem to be aging.

338
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,428
No. The effects
are quite different.

339
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,014
If anything, I look...
like a Mylean.

340
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,476
They occupy a region of space
near Talax.

341
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,853
Interesting.
Do Talaxians and Myleans

342
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,188
share a common ancestry?

343
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,065
Not that I know of.

344
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,567
Do the two races ever
intermarry?

345
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,237
Yes. As a matter of fact,

346
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,030
my great-grandfather
was Mylean.

347
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,699
Then one-eighth
of your genetic material

348
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,242
was inherited from him.

349
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,412
Those must be the genes
which have become stimulated.

350
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,081
Too bad my great-grandfather
wasn't a little better-looking.

351
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,169
Hmm. As far as I can tell,
his condition seems stable.

352
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,254
I'm going to leave you
in charge of Sickbay

353
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,756
so I can continue
the DNA analysis.

354
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,048
If anyone else
comes in,

355
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,300
I'll run
a cellular scan.

356
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,010
Is there anything else
I can do?

357
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,553
Do your best
to keep them comfortable.

358
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,888
Until we have
more information,

359
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,015
that's the best
either of us can do.

360
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,184
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

361
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,941
( grunting )

362
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,988
Thought you
might be thirsty.

363
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,781
Thanks.

364
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,495
Do you smell
something strange?

365
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,581
I... I'm...

366
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,167
I'm afraid that's me.

367
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,628
I seem to be developing
Mylean sweat glands.

368
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,171
Sorry.

369
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,882
It's not so bad.

370
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:33,011
Well, whatever happens,
I... I try to keep in mind

371
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,220
that things could be worse.

372
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,972
( grunting )

373
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,975
I still have my home
here on<i> Voyager,</i>

374
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,267
my friends...

375
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,686
Your hair.

376
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:45,523
True,
but I'd gladly lose it

377
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,775
if I could have
my taste buds back.

378
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,778
At least you're not
losing your eyesight.

379
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,489
See that display
over there?

380
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,577
It's nothing but a blur.
You think that's bad?

381
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,121
The doctor tells me my pupils
have dilated 60 percent.

382
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,207
I can't even<i> look</i> at that
display, it's so bright.

383
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,878
Yeah? Well, I've got
chronic arthritis in my fingers.

384
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,129
I can barely
keep this glass steady.

385
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,381
That's nothing.

386
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,092
My spinal column
is fusing together.

387
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,802
In a matter of days,
I won't be able to walk.

388
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,054
Got you beat.

389
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,471
I can barely walk now.

390
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,181
( door opens )

391
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,684
( groans )
NEELIX: Lieutenant, can we help?

392
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,061
I don't think so.

393
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,938
I'm releasing you both
back to your quarters.

394
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,940
I've just gotten reports
of more patients

395
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,148
on the way.

396
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,901
It's going
to get crowded in here.

397
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,444
How's the scanner?

398
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,320
B'ELANNA: Almost ready.
Good.

399
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,155
This disorder seems
to be spreading rapidly

400
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,365
among the crew.

401
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,867
Does that mean
we'll all be affected?

402
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,285
Right now, it only means
that we need

403
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,370
to find some answers
as quickly as possible.

404
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,872
All right.
Give the scanner a try.

405
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,958
I'll start with
Commander Chakotay.

406
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,460
( beeping )

407
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,962
How's the resolution?

408
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,337
Very nice.

409
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,673
Now, let's focus in on
the hyper-stimulated

410
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,216
segments of his DNA.

411
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,885
Can you give me
more magnification?

412
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,804
Coming up.

413
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,391
DOCTOR:
That's odd.

414
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,851
What is?

415
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,062
There seems to be
some kind of contaminant

416
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,480
on the base pair
sequence.

417
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,983
It didn't show up
on the first scan.

418
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,192
I need a closer look.

419
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,655
I'm going to maximum
magnification.

420
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,492
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

421
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,288
What do you see?

422
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,791
I'm not exactly sure.

423
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,417
Well, what does it look like?

424
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,879
See for yourself.

425
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,969
I'm no microbiologist, but...

426
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,013
that doesn't look
like it belongs there.

427
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,555
Believe me, it doesn't.

428
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,974
I've never seen
anything like it.

429
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,018
This level
of submolecular technology

430
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,061
is well beyond anything
Starfleet has developed.

431
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,522
What are those markings?

432
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:53,067
Some kind of alien writing?

433
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,610
I wish I knew.

434
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,445
They might help us determine
where it came from.

435
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,447
But who could have put this
into Chakotay's cells

436
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,740
without his knowledge?

437
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,663
Let me try
a compositional analysis.

438
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,958
( beeping )

439
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,585
(<i> dramatic theme</i>
<i>turns suspenseful</i> )

440
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,135
It's in Mr. Neelix's DNA
as well.

441
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,970
Is this what's causing
the mutations?

442
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,264
A good scientist never jumps
to conclusions, Lieutenant,

443
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:28,102
but I'd say
it's a distinct possibility.

444
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,730
I'm having trouble getting a
clear reading from this sample.

445
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,816
It looks almost like the, um...
whatever it is

446
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,319
could be slightly out of phase.

447
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,655
That must be why my initial
scans didn't reveal it.

448
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,534
I'm compensating
for the phase variance.

449
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,662
You're not gonna believe this,

450
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,581
but I'm picking up
an energy signature.

451
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,584
This thing is transmitting
some kind of a signal.

452
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,419
To where?
I don't know.

453
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,713
It's too weak
to travel very far.

454
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,216
Access the internal sensors

455
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,468
and set them
to a phase variance of .15.

456
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,762
Right.

457
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,891
Lieutenant.

458
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,563
Your program is being deleted.
DOCTOR: How?

459
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,814
I don't know.

460
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,524
I'm transferring you
back to Sickbay.

461
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,151
( gasping )

462
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,571
( groaning )

463
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,281
B'Elanna...

464
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,574
Science Lab
to the Bridge.

465
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,909
This is the doctor.

466
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,629
PARIS:
In the last hour,

467
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,005
three more patients
have come in

468
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,548
with genetic mutations.

469
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,717
The effects are starting
to become life-threatening.

470
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,885
What happened to
B'Elanna?

471
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,511
The alveoli
in her lungs

472
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,055
suddenly stopped
processing oxygen.

473
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,640
I've got her on
respiratory support.

474
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,809
She almost died.

475
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,019
What about
the doctor?

476
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,980
The computer logs
in the Science Lab

477
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,149
show that he was trying to
transfer himself to Sickbay.

478
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,357
Something must
have gone wrong

479
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,651
while he was
in transit.

480
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,319
PARIS:
Could the doctor's
program...?

481
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,196
DOCTOR:
<i>Seven of Nine,</i>
<i>this is the doctor.</i>

482
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,739
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

483
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,491
<i>It's me, the doctor.</i>

484
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,785
<i>I've tapped</i>
<i>into your audio implants</i>

485
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,829
<i>so only you can hear me.</i>

486
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,998
<i>It's imperative</i>
<i>that you tell no one.</i>

487
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,292
<i>Make any excuse</i>
<i>to get out of there</i>

488
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,793
<i>and report to Holodeck 2.</i>

489
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,045
<i>I'm hiding</i>
<i>in the da Vinci simulation.</i>

490
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,006
<i>I'll explain everything</i>
<i>when you get here.</i>

491
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,257
KIM:
Seven was checking that.

492
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,675
JANEWAY:
Seven?

493
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,760
Seven?

494
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,848
About the doctor's
research.

495
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,601
Yes. I examined
their work area.

496
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,478
There was no record
of any findings.

497
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,273
The electron resonance scanner
appeared to be malfunctioning.

498
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,734
I...could return
to the Science Lab

499
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,195
and attempt
to repair it.

500
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,280
Keep me informed.

501
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,369
DOCTOR:
Hold your head
this way, Carlotta.

502
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,165
I can only conclude
that someone has implanted

503
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,500
these microscopic tags
in the DNA of the crew

504
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,419
to<i> cause</i> genetic mutations.
For what purpose?

505
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,088
I don't know,
and I get the feeling

506
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,589
they don't want us
to find out.

507
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,300
Explain.

508
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,552
When Lieutenant Torres
and I started making progress

509
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,803
in our investigation,

510
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,387
we were both incapacitated.

511
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,597
Call me paranoid,

512
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,266
but I don't think
that is a coincidence.

513
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,642
If you're correct,

514
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,435
perhaps our actions
are being monitored.

515
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,521
That's why I couldn't risk
contacting anyone

516
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,731
over the com system.

517
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,858
Our first
course of action

518
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,568
should be to collect
more information.

519
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,528
My thinking exactly.

520
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,866
B'Elanna wanted to adjust
the ship's internal sensors

521
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,451
to a phase variance of .15.

522
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,454
I'd like to do the same
to your Borg sensory nodes.

523
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,831
Proceed.

524
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,250
( beeping )

525
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,586
Computer, give me
a type-4 micro-inducer.

526
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,174
Hmm.

527
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,260
( whirring )

528
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:53,682
Now, take a look around,
and tell me what you see.

529
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,773
Do you see
anything...

530
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,858
unusual?

531
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,027
Energy signatures...

532
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,780
or perhaps something
that might be

533
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,698
transmitting a signal?

534
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,953
No.

535
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,246
That's one room down,

536
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,123
256 to go.

537
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,916
I suggest
a deck-by-deck survey.

538
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,752
If you need to contact me,
use com frequency Epsilon 2.

539
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,503
I've isolated it
from the rest of the system.

540
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,463
Understood.

541
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,592
And be careful.

542
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,928
Someone out there
could be watching.

543
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,018
( sighing softly )

544
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,146
(<i> suspenseful theme playing )</i>

545
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,843
( beeps )

546
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,594
( door opens )

547
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,974
Deck 5.
( beeping )

548
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,133
( indistinct chatter )

549
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,865
( com chirps )
Computer, frequency Epsilon 2.

550
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,826
Doctor, the aliens
are here on the ship.

551
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,786
I can see them everywhere.

552
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,414
DOCTOR:
<i>This is worse than I imagined.</i>

553
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,374
<i>You've got</i>
<i>to let the Captain know.</i>

554
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,925
( beeping )

555
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,934
( door chimes )

556
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,769
Yes? Yes!

557
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,564
Good morning,
Captain.

558
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,732
That's a matter of opinion.
What is it?

559
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,608
Internal scans
haven't revealed anything

560
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,319
about
the genetic mutations.

561
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,530
The doctor?
Still off-line.

562
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,115
We are investigating
the possibility--

563
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,410
Inform me of any progress.
Understood.

564
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,370
There's one more thing.

565
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,829
The incident
with Tom and B'Elanna

566
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,665
started me thinking about
ship's protocol...

567
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,419
or<i> lack</i> thereof.
Captain?

568
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,045
It seems to me that people
have been getting

569
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,381
a little too comfortable
around here lately.

570
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,174
They're late
for their duty shifts,

571
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,470
taking Mess Hall privileges
during non-designated hours,

572
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,721
and a lot of people are spending
more time on the holodeck

573
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,515
than they are at their posts.

574
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,641
You<i> are</i> Security Chief.

575
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,479
Don't 13 department heads
report to you every day?

576
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,189
Yes.
Well, straighten them out.

577
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,818
Shall I flog them as well?

578
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,404
( sighing )

579
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,326
Maybe the doctor was right.

580
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,161
I think I do need a vacation.

581
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,204
You do seem unsettled.

582
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,373
Crazed is more like it.

583
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,042
I haven't felt this anxious
since my first day of command.

584
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,544
( door chimes )

585
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,547
Remind me to lower the volume
on that door. Come in.

586
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,258
Captain, I wish to speak
with you--

587
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,472
What's wrong?

588
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,684
My attempts to repair the
resonance scanner have failed.

589
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,978
I require assistance.

590
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,357
Ask Ensign Kim
to lend you a hand.

591
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,234
Yes, Captain.

592
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,530
Is that all?

593
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,245
( door opens, closes )

594
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,872
When this mutation crisis

595
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,082
is over, I think
I'll spend a few days

596
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,251
in Renaissance Tuscany.

597
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,087
There's a little inn
outside Sienna

598
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,755
I've been wanting to try.

599
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:45,224
I will join you
for a glass of wine.

600
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,440
( gasps )

601
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,908
DOCTOR:
How many?

602
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,868
SEVEN:
I've observed
56 of the aliens.

603
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,495
There could be more.

604
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,955
DOCTOR:
Have you seen any pattern
to their behavior,

605
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,667
any hint as to what they're
trying to accomplish?

606
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,960
They seem to be conducting
experiments on the crew

607
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,962
and monitoring
the results.

608
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,842
As if<i> Voyager</i> were
one big petri dish.

609
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,886
I may be among them.

610
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,638
In the turbolift,
one of them

611
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,307
probed me with
a medical instrument.

612
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,352
We cannot allow them
to continue.

613
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,021
I've been analyzing
their energy signatures.

614
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,981
I believe there's a way

615
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,483
to make them visible
to everyone.

616
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,735
How?

617
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,195
Using a precisely modulated
phaser beam.

618
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,155
If we expose them,
the crew may be able

619
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,282
to fight back.

620
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,742
But what if the aliens
retaliate

621
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,785
by inflicting lethal mutations
on everyone?

622
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,078
It's too risky.

623
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,122
What do you suggest?

624
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,960
The key to the aliens' control
is the genetic tags.

625
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,713
I believe a neuroleptic shock
would disable them.

626
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,299
Unfortunately, it would be
rather... painful.

627
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,134
Will the crew recover?

628
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,177
Yes, they will.

629
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,388
The hard part will be
administering the shock

630
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,766
to everyone
simultaneously.

631
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,810
The power relays could be
reconfigured to do it.

632
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,229
Good. I assume
you know how to do that?

633
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,440
You assume correctly.

634
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,567
But I will have to bypass
several safeguards.

635
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,735
It will take time.

636
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,445
Then you'd better
get started.

637
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,614
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

638
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,200
( people speaking
indistinctly )

639
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,965

640
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,471

( com chirps )
Tuvok to Seven of Nine.

643
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,608
SEVEN:
<i>Yes?</i>

644
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,735
Why have you accessed
the EPS relay system?

645
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,445
There is a malfunction.

646
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,988
I'm attempting to repair it.

647
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,115
Perhaps you should leave that
to the Engineering crew.

648
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,659
<i>Normally, I would.</i>

649
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,829
However, they are all occupied
with other tasks.

650
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,373
You are compromising
the power safety protocols.

651
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,957
Stop what you're doing
at once.

652
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,544
<i>I assure you,</i>
<i>there is no cause for concern.</i>

653
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,550
( beeps )

654
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,724
Move away from
the console.

655
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,022
As I told you,
I am conducting repairs.

656
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,817
You are attempting
to deceive me. Why?

657
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:48,824
I can't explain what I'm doing,

658
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,409
but you must allow me
to continue.

659
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,036
Your actions could result
in an energy discharge,

660
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,747
which would be
harmful to the crew.

661
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,540
I realize that.

662
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,053
Don't move.

663
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,598
If your people attempt
to incapacitate me,

664
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,057
I will kill you.

665
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,893
I believe you.

666
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,979
What do you intend
to do now?

667
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,149
You will come with me
to speak to the Captain.

668
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,486
I am certain she will have
questions for you.

669
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,196
( door opens )

670
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,493
Keep on trying
to disable the tags.

671
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,579
Let me know when you're ready.
Understood.

672
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,664
I'll attempt to modify
the internal sensors

673
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,998
to detect the aliens.

674
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,250
Good.

675
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,710
Keep me informed.

676
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,839
(<i> dramatic theme continues</i> )

677
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,349
Who are you?

678
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,353
And what the hell
are you doing to my crew?

679
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,355
My team has been
observing you

680
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,649
and conducting tests.

681
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,858
Tests?

682
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,944
I'd call them mutilations.

683
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,571
I can understand
why you're angry.

684
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,157
I don't like causing
people to suffer,

685
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,034
but sometimes it's
a necessary part of my work.

686
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,662
What kind of work is that?

687
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,121
Medical research.

688
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,999
We're scientists, like you.

689
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,250
From where I stand,

690
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,878
you're
a hostile invasion force.

691
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,297
I want to know
how long you've been here

692
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,049
and exactly what
you've been doing to us.

693
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,969
I can't answer
those questions.

694
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,762
It's a breach of protocol

695
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,764
for me to be speaking
to you at all.

696
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,850
Oh, how convenient.

697
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,685
( scoffs )

698
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,896
That way you never
have to face your victims.

699
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,063
Captain, please.

700
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,399
You're exaggerating
the situation.

701
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,695
Our techniques are as benign
as we can make them.

702
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,864
What I have been through
for the last few days

703
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,907
certainly hasn't felt benign!

704
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:57,369
Please understand that there's
a purpose to our actions.

705
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,412
The data we gather from you

706
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,582
may help us cure physical
and psychological disorders

707
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,042
that afflict millions.

708
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,128
Isn't that worth
some discomfort?

709
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,047
I'm sure you'd see things
differently

710
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,382
if<i> your</i> people were the ones

711
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,801
being subjected
to these experiments.

712
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,761
Just as your perspective
would change

713
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,304
if your people were the ones

714
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,891
to live longer and healthier
lives as a result.

715
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,643
Don't forget, we've been
observing you, Captain.

716
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,729
I know the most important
thing to you

717
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,772
is the welfare of your crew.

718
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,358
You'd even kill
to protect them.

719
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,695
If necessary.
Of course you would.

720
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,865
You take care of your own,
just as we do.

721
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,746
We're really more similar
than you care to admit.

722
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,539
That's where you're wrong.

723
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,922
What you're doing
isn't self-defense.

724
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:53,383
It's the exploitation
of another species

725
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,927
for your own benefit.

726
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,763
My people decided
a long time ago

727
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,138
that that was unacceptable,

728
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,308
even in the name
of scientific progress.

729
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:06,646
You're a remarkably
strong-willed individual.

730
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,024
I've been very impressed
by your self-control

731
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,817
over the past several weeks.

732
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,320
We've been increasing
your dopamine levels,

733
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,156
stimulating
various aggressive impulses

734
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:21,244
to test
your behavioral restraints.

735
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,121
There's been a great
difference of opinion

736
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,957
about how much more strain

737
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,625
you can bear.

738
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,962
Not much.

739
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,379
( grunts )

740
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,924
(<i> exhales</i> )

741
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,595
I had hoped you might be
more cooperative

742
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,639
once you realized
the importance of our work.

743
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,683
Sorry. These lab rats
are fighting back.

744
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,144
I'm afraid
that will be pointless.

745
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,272
We're monitoring your attempts
to break our control over you.

746
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,816
You won't succeed.

747
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,151
Well, you may find that
you've underestimated us.

748
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:57,196
Consider what's in
the best interests of your crew.

749
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,574
We<i> will</i> be continuing
our research.

750
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,952
If you make
no further attempts

751
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,370
to interfere, I assure you

752
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,791
that the fatality rate
will be minimal,

753
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,876
though there may be
some deformities.

754
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,045
And I would be
willing to share

755
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,922
our final data
with you.

756
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,342
You can't possibly expect me
to accept that.

757
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,427
If you don't,

758
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,305
then the entire experiment,
and its subjects

759
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,765
will be terminated.

760
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,900
Are you telling me there is
no way to disable the tags?

761
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,777
My attempts to use
the EPS relays

762
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,904
to induce neuroleptic shock
have failed.

763
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,906
The aliens
may be responsible.

764
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,700
I've encountered
similar difficulties

765
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,494
in my efforts to modify
the internal sensors.

766
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,122
They appear to have gained
access to our key systems.

767
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,082
They can't be everywhere
all the time.

768
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,543
We have got to find
an advantage.

769
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,919
We'd better
find one soon.

770
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,587
Sickbay is being filled
with new patients

771
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,255
with increasingly
severe symptoms.

772
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,675
SEVEN:
We have the ability
to make them visible.

773
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,093
If we could modify
enough sensors,

774
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,054
we could resist them.
They are still capable

775
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,972
of manipulating
our DNA.

776
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,598
A direct conflict
would be inadvisable.

777
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,184
( com chirps )
MAN:<i> Bridge to doctor.</i>

778
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,936
<i>Medical emergency.</i> 
( sighs )

779
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,022
( gasping )

780
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,446
( tricorder beeping wildly )
She's in hypertensive shock.

781
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,074
20 milligrams
lectrazine.

782
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,827
Her blood pressure
is 360 over 125.

783
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,412
How is that possible?

784
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,997
DOCTOR:
Severe adrenal stress.

785
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,416
( instrument beeps )
No effect.

786
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,671
Her arterial pathways
are rupturing.

787
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,840
She's in cardiac arrest.
We're losing her.

788
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,386
Captain, I'm afraid
that won't help.

789
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,013
There's too much
internal bleeding.

790
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,472
Then try something else.

791
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,349
We'll transport her to Sickbay.

792
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,476
Her entire circulatory
system has collapsed.

793
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,270
There's no way to repair
that kind of damage.

794
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,231
( tricorder emits steady tone)

795
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:55,815
Brain death
has occurred.

796
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,192
I'm sorry.

797
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,902
There was nothing more
we could have done.

798
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,824
This ends right now.

799
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,785
You're relieved.

800
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,746
Captain, what
are you doing?

801
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,290
I'm running a little
experiment of my own.

802
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,708
Red Alert!

803
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,259
Captain, one of the aliens
has just entered the Bridge.

804
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,302
Understood.
TUVOK: We're less than

805
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,845
a million kilometers
from the pulsars.

806
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,472
We must change course
immediately

807
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,099
to avoid being caught
in their gravity.

808
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,809
No! Keep going.

809
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,145
This is a far
more reckless course of action

810
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,938
than I've come to expect
from you, Captain.

811
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,314
It certainly is.

812
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,984
Hull stress is at 30 teradynes
and rising.

813
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,359
KIM:
I'm transferring more power

814
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,778
to the structural integrity
field,

815
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,114
but I don't know
how long it can hold.

816
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,407
What do you hope
to accomplish by this?

817
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,534
Flying into a binary pulsar?

818
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,536
It seems like I'm trying
to crush this ship

819
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,746
like a tin can.

820
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,998
It's more likely

821
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,582
that you're trying
to intimidate us.

822
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,002
You're welcome
to stick around and find out.

823
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,087
Hull stress is at 45 teradynes.

824
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,967
Our course is locked in.

825
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,385
Only my authorization
can release it.

826
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,222
You're not behaving
very rationally.

827
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:12,558
That's what you were trying
to accomplish, wasn't it? Hmm?

828
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,312
Pumping up my dopamine levels
to push me to the edge?

829
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,105
Keeping me awake
for four days straight

830
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,773
with the constant pain
of your devices

831
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,441
drilling into my skull?

832
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,694
Well, this is the culmination
of your work, and guess what?

833
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,197
You're going to be right here
to collect the final data.

834
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,324
KIM:
Shields have failed.

835
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,575
Structural integrity
is down to 20 percent.

836
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,702
Enter the authorization code

837
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,495
and change course
immediately!

838
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,788
I don't think you realize

839
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,833
that you are<i> not</i> 
in control here anymore.

840
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,878
I can kill you and your crew
in an instant.

841
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,338
Go ahead.

842
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:44,090
Without us, you won't be
able to prevent this ship

843
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,051
from being torn apart
by the pulsars.

844
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,510
And even with my crew
working together,

845
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,512
I'd say the odds of us
getting through this

846
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,181
are what? One in ten?

847
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,266
One in 20,
at best, Captain.

848
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,560
I'm willing
to take that chance.

849
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,230
Are you?

850
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,149
Outer hull temperature
has reached 9,000 degrees.

851
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,734
The hull is
beginning to buckle!

852
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,527
( beeping )

853
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,822
Two alien vessels are attempting
to disengage from<i> Voyager.</i>

854
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,665
I can't break us free
of the gravitational forces!

855
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,501
Then let's divert all power
to the shields!

856
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,795
No. If we go in,
we go in full throttle.

857
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,964
Captain?
Assuming we survive,

858
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,632
we're gonna need
all the momentum we can get

859
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,801
to reach escape velocity
on the other side.

860
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,012
Everyone, hang on.

861
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,474
I hope you were exaggerating
about those odds, Tuvok.

862
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,143
I was not.

863
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:41,773
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

864
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,734
Hull stress has exceeded
maximum tolerance!

865
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:48,071
There are breaches
on Decks 4, 7, 8 and 12.

866
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,240
Emergency force fields
are holding.

867
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,325
I've lost helm control!

868
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,993
Main power is off-line!

869
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,204
Well, let's hope
we've got enough speed.

870
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,926
I don't believe it.

871
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,719
We're alive.

872
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,391
I never realized you thought
of me as reckless, Tuvok.

873
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,810
A poor choice of words.

874
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,562
It was clearly
an understatement.

875
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,735
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51244.3.</i>

876
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,488
<i>With the aliens gone,</i>
<i>the doctor has been able</i>

877
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,490
<i>to remove their devices</i>
<i>from the crew</i>

878
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,951
<i>and neutralize</i>
<i>the genetic tags.</i>

879
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,997
TORRES:
It was nice you could
get the night off.

880
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,833
"Nice" had nothing
to do with it.

881
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,002
I switched shifts
with Ensign Wildman,

882
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,628
which means tomorrow

883
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,340
I'll pull a double-duty
on the Bridge<i> and</i> with the doc.

884
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,301
Well, I appreciate
the sacrifice.

885
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,095
Tell me about the wine.

886
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,807
Ah, Ktarian merlot, 2282.

887
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,310
You might wanna
let it breathe first.

888
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,312
We've got all night
to let it breathe.

889
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,813
( com chirps )

890
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,648
MAN:
<i>Engineering to</i>
<i>Lieutenant Torres.</i>

891
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,608
Torres here.

892
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,777
<i>We are having a problem</i>
<i>with the plasma manifold.</i>

893
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,321
<i>I thought you'd want</i>
<i>to take a look.</i>

894
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:12,571
I don't.

895
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,781
Lock it down for now.

896
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,200
I'll deal with it
in the morning.

897
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,701
Torres out.

898
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,038
Sometimes it's nice to be
the<i> Chief</i> Engineer.

899
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,831
( chuckles )

900
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,582
Try the salad, Chief.

901
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,757
Hmm.

902
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,596
This is
really delicious.

903
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,765
Well, thanks.
I replicated it myself.

904
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,184
Mm, you're too good
for me.

905
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,312
( door chimes )

906
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,939
Ignore it.

907
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,441
Right.

908
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,693
( door chimes )

909
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,987
I'll get rid of them.

910
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,286
Oh, hi. Uh,
sorry to interrupt.

911
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,205
Hi, B'Elanna.

912
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,415
Harry, I'm not home.

913
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:04,957
I-I just wanted
to return this.

914
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,418
Thanks.

915
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,461
Smells good!

916
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,381
That's it.

917
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,798
No more interruptions.

918
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,311
You know, heh,

919
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,855
I've been thinking about
what the Captain said.

920
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,902
Thinking maybe she was right?

921
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,572
Me, too.

922
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,698
We have been...

923
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,991
a little out of control
lately.

924
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,244
( both chuckling )

925
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,874
Do you think we really were?
What?

926
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,001
Out of control?

927
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,130
Those aliens could have
just been messing around

928
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,257
with our hormones,
just to see what would happen.

929
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,052
You're right.
They could have.

930
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,472
And we don't know how long
they were on board.

931
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,515
They could have been
tampering with us for months.

932
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,849
Well, when you think about it,

933
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,684
you did have a pretty abrupt
change of heart

934
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,312
a couple of weeks ago.

935
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:11,357
What made you realize that
you loved me all of a sudden?

936
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,486
Just a feeling.

937
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:22,368
So, our whole relationship
might be based on some...

938
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,329
alien experiment.

939
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:27,165
You never know.

940
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,375
Well, I think
that explains it.

941
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:33,588
I guess we should just...
call it off, then.

942
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,923
I think so.

943
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,301
Thank God
we found out in time.

944
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,802
Thank God.

(<i> romantic theme playing</i> )

946
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,815
I don't know
about you, but...

947
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,985
I'm curious to see how
this experiment turns out.
