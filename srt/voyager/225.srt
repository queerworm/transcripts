1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,421
( birds chirping )

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,423
( equipment humming )

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,551
(<i> gentle theme playing</i> )

4
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,184
( beeping )

5
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>Sickbay to the Captain.</i>
<i>This is the doctor speaking.</i>

6
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,958
You've brought us
out of stasis.

7
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,209
I assume you have news.

8
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,794
Yes.

9
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,629
Our sensors show
your vital signs are normal.

10
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,964
How are you feeling?

11
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,591
We're fine.
How long were we in stasis?

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,343
A total of 17 days.

13
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,178
JANEWAY:
<i>That long?</i>

14
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,806
I wanted to exhaust every
possibility of finding a cure.

15
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,098
<i>And?</i>

16
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,642
I regret to inform you

17
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,895
that I have been
unsuccessful.

18
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:04,398
<i>I have not been able to develop</i>
<i>a counteragent for the virus,</i>

19
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,526
<i>and I have no other options</i>
<i>to explore.</i>

20
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,779
What about keeping us
in stasis aboard<i> Voyager?</i>

21
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,531
<i>Something</i>
<i>in the planet's environment</i>

22
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,825
<i>is shielding you</i>
<i>from the effects of the virus.</i>

23
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,243
If you leave,

24
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,786
you risk a recurrence
of the disease,

25
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,538
which would undoubtedly
prove fatal.

26
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,665
The only option I can
think of at the moment

27
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,083
is contacting the Vidiians.

28
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,961
They have sophisticated
medical technology.

29
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,213
It's possible they
might be able to help.

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,799
We'll take it under
advisement, doctor.

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,509
Thank you for your efforts.
Janeway out.

32
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,802
What do you think?

33
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,012
It's risky.

34
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,263
The Vidiians
have never shown

35
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,723
any willingness
to help us.

36
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,641
It's more likely
they'd attack<i> Voyager</i>

37
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,435
and try to harvest body parts
from the crew.

38
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,728
Agreed.

39
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,145
I just want to make sure

40
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,147
we're not overlooking
a possible alternative.

41
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,775
Could we live
with ourselves,

42
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,569
knowing we'd sent<i> Voyager</i> 
into that kind of danger?

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,866
Janeway to Tuvok.

44
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,409
<i>I'm here, Captain.</i>

45
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,662
You must be aware
of the doctor's report.

46
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,039
<i>Yes.</i>

47
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,918
I'm turning over command
of the ship to you

48
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,711
<i>on a permanent basis.</i>

49
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,130
<i>Your orders are to resume a</i>
<i>course for the Alpha Quadrant.</i>

50
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,758
And regardless of
the doctor's suggestion,

51
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,803
you are not to make contact
with the Vidiians.

52
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,888
I understand.

53
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,265
I'll prepare a message
for the crew.

54
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,734
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

55
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,505
So we're just going to
abandon them on this planet?

56
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,883
Those were Captain Janeway's
express orders.

57
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,300
But you're Captain now.

58
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,594
You can rescind them.

59
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,012
To what end?

60
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,014
I can't believe
we haven't been able

61
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,557
to find a cure
for an insect bite.

62
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,559
KES:
The doctor hasn't
deactivated himself

63
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,103
for a month.

64
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,478
He's tried everything.

65
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,730
He's searched every database,

66
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,732
attempted
the most drastic research.

67
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,525
You can't fault him.

68
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,653
I can tell you the morale
of the crew is going to suffer

69
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,864
if we leave them behind.

70
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,365
Not<i> if,</i> Mr. Neelix.

71
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,367
<i>When</i> we leave them behind.

72
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,660
The decision
has been made.

73
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,912
We will, of course,

74
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,164
provide them with
everything they'll need

75
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,707
for their survival and comfort.

76
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,375
I am arranging
for a modular shelter

77
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,253
to be transported
to the surface.

78
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,421
They'll have all the technology
they need--

79
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,092
weapons, tricorders,
a replicator.

80
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,261
You talk as though
it were a camping trip.

81
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,388
They have to spend the rest
of their lives down there.

82
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,015
That is not a certainty.

83
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,810
Captain Janeway intends to
continue researching the virus.

84
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,979
She is an able scientist,

85
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,439
and may eventually be able
to effect a cure.

86
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,025
They have a type-9 shuttlecraft
at their disposal,

87
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,486
if it becomes possible
for them to leave the planet.

88
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,531
A type-9 shuttlecraft has
a top speed of warp 4.

89
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,911
It won't take them more than...
oh, about 700 years to get home.

90
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,539
I am not certain what it is
you expect me to do, Lieutenant.

91
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,294
I guess, clearly,
something you can't do,

92
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,672
which is to feel as rotten
about this as we do.

93
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:43,010
You are correct that I am unable
to experience that emotion.

94
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,804
And frankly, I fail to see
what the benefit would be.

95
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,850
If there is nothing more,
you are all dismissed.

96
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,951
<i>Janeway to Tuvok.</i>

97
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,286
Yes, Captain?

98
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,121
<i>We've received the transport.</i>

99
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,540
<i>We'll check it over and let you</i>
<i>know if we're missing anything.</i>

100
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,084
I will remain in orbit
until I hear from you.

101
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,628
And, after that, we can still
remain in communication

102
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,505
for approximately 36 hours.

103
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,341
I'll contact you
before the day is over.

104
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,633
Janeway out.

105
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,926
It looks like
they transported

106
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,261
the contents of
the whole ship.

107
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,180
We may have to be here
for a while.

108
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,308
Petri dishes, protein analyzer,
DNA sequencers.

109
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,310
Everything I need for
my research is here.

110
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,187
Do you really think
you can find a cure?

111
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,731
It may take a while,
but, yes, I do.

112
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,150
If I can find a specimen of
the insect that infected us,

113
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,610
I can begin analyzing
protein cofactors.

114
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,363
That might give us
the information we need

115
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,031
to find out what it is
in this environment

116
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,116
that's keeping us
from being sick

117
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,408
and how to replicate it.

118
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,581
Does it matter
which way these things go?

119
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,957
I guess it depends
whether you're

120
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,751
in a beige mood
or a gray mood.

121
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,960
That's not much of a choice.

122
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,670
Couldn't Starfleet
have come up

123
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,297
with something
a little more cheerful?

124
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,174
Like polka dots?

125
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,884
I was thinking more
of a tasteful pinstripe,

126
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,386
something
in blues and greens.

127
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,555
Well, I suggest we put

128
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,307
the gray on the outside
and the beige inside.

129
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,474
I like that.

130
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,352
I've always looked
better in beige.

131
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,104
Actually, it might
be kind of interesting,

132
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,355
roughing it for a while.

133
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,606
"Roughing it"?

134
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,982
Let's see.

135
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,777
We have shelter, furniture,
research equipment,

136
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,946
tricorders, a replicator.

137
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,197
It's too rough for me.

138
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,656
We don't have a bathtub.

139
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,117
A bathtub?

140
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,035
I love a bath. It's
my favorite way of relaxing.

141
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,454
Captain, I'm sure you can learn
to love the sonic shower.

142
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,790
You know, Chakotay,
it occurs to me,

143
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,500
we aren't exactly in a
command structure anymore.

144
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,128
Maybe you should
call me Kathryn.

145
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,092
Give me a few days on that one,
okay?

146
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,763
This diagnostic report
looks like it was written

147
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,723
by a first-year Academy cadet.

148
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,310
There are mistakes.

149
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,980
It's incomplete.

150
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,856
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

151
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,608
I guess I've
been distracted.

152
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,068
We've all been distracted,
Ensign.

153
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,361
That's no excuse.

154
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,946
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,243
I can't get
anything done here.

156
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,744
Nobody can concentrate.

157
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,663
I know how they feel.

158
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,374
I'm not feeling
so terrific myself,

159
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,376
but I don't let that
get in the way of my work.

160
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,339
B'Elanna...

161
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,181
I've been talking with some
of the Starfleet crew.

162
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,476
They're not happy
about what happened.

163
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,519
I was wondering...

164
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,895
how are the Maquis taking it?

165
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,440
How do you think
they're taking it?

166
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,860
This isn't
a Starfleet issue, Harry.

167
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,111
It's affecting everyone.

168
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,571
Then why don't we do
something about it?

169
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,324
Do what?

170
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,034
I don't know.

171
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,247
It seems like we shouldn't
just accept this.

172
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,915
Well, that's
all well and good,

173
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,335
but, frankly, I can't think
of anything else we can do.

174
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,254
If you have any ideas,
I'll listen.

175
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,383
Otherwise, I think we should
take a deep breath and move on.

176
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:21,895
(<i> gentle theme playing</i> )

177
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,689
Catch anything?

178
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,316
Just the same ones
as yesterday,

179
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,484
and they don't seem to carry

180
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,444
the pathogen
that's infected us.

181
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,029
Where have you been?
Oh, in the woods.

182
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,531
For the past two days,

183
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,366
you've been spending
a lot of time in the woods.

184
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,076
Is something going on
I should know about?

185
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,036
Uh, not yet.
Not yet?

186
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,704
What's that
supposed to mean?

187
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,748
It means, when it's time
for you to know, I'll tell you.

188
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,083
Don't I even
get hints?

189
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,918
I'm building something.

190
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,170
Building?

191
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,755
What could you be building?

192
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,132
And why can't you tell me?

193
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,759
You can't stand it, can you?

194
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,344
You're like a little kid,
wheedling.

195
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,887
<i>Tuvok to Janeway.</i>

196
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,680
Janeway here.

198

199
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,440
We're doing quite well.

200
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,568
I'd like to speak
to the crew now.

201
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,280
<i>Your com link has been</i>
<i>put through to the entire ship.</i>

202
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,957
This is Kathryn Janeway.

203
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,666
I've never liked
saying good-bye,

204
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,295
so I'll make this brief.

205
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,880
But I want you all to know
that serving as your Captain

206
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,134
has been the most extraordinary
experience of my life.

207
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,471
<i>No Captain could ask more</i>
<i>than what this crew has given--</i>

208
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,182
<i>bravery, compassion</i>
<i>and strength of character.</i>

209
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,185
<i>But I think what I'll miss most</i>
<i>is the fun.</i>

210
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,564
<i>The times we joked together,</i>
<i>the games on the holodeck.</i>

211
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,400
<i>I'll remember the laughter</i>
<i>more than anything.</i>

212
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,486
<i>Although Commander Chakotay</i>
<i>and I won't be with you</i>

213
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,321
<i>for the rest of your journey,</i>

214
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,698
<i>we know that you'll be the same</i>
<i>steadfast crew for Mr. Tuvok</i>

215
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,493
<i>as you have been for us.</i>

216
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,787
<i>We wish you a safe</i>
<i>and a speedy journey home.</i>

217
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,123
<i>Our thoughts will be with you.</i>

218
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,083
Janeway out.

219
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,003
TUVOK:
<i>Thank you, Captain, Commander.</i>

220
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,089
<i>I am sure I speak</i>
<i>for the entire crew when I say</i>

221
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,759
<i>we will always remember</i>
<i>your grace and courage.</i>

222
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,345
<i>And I would like to add,</i>

223
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,763
<i>it has been an honor</i>
<i>serving with you.</i>

224
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,600

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,505
CHAKOTAY:
No, I left an hour ago.

234
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,923
I was thinking.

235
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,051
Maybe looking
for protein cofactors

236
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,636
is the wrong approach.

237
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,012
Even if I can't find

238
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,390
a specimen of the insect
that infected us...

239
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,433
I could try to learn something

240
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,311
about the biomolecular evolution
of this planet's ecosystem.

241
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,188
Can't hurt to give it a try.

( chittering )

249
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,835
It looks like
some kind of primate.

250
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,296
I've detected primate
life-signs here,

251
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,631
but I've never seen one.

252
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,757
Hello.

253
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,556
Are you hungry?

254
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,141
Is that why you came here?

255
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,812
I'm Kathryn.

256
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,607
He's Chakotay.

257
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,692
We've had to move
into your neighborhood,

258
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,736
but I hope we can be friends.

260
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,659
Oh. Maybe he'll come back.

261

Looking for a pet?

262
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,329
No. Looking for a clue

263
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,707
about primate physiology
on this planet.

264
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,418
They must have to contend
with insect bites, too.

265
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,841
Well...excuse me.

266
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,151
Maybe we should be
out looking

267
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,486
for other primates.

268
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,571
I might be missing
something important.

00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,750
Yes.

seven days a week
since we got here,

275
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,005
and we're still
no closer to a cure

276
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,341
than we were the day
we were infected.

277
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

"Even the eagle
must know when to sleep."

281
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,895
Maybe it's time
we both considered that.

282
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,148
You mean quit. Give up.

283
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,276
Why do you have
to see it as defeat?

284
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,861
Maybe it's simply...

285
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,281

from it right now.

Approximately 1.5 light-years.

They're within hailing range.

309
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,100

You're aware
that Captain Janeway

312

specifically told us not
to risk contacting the Vidiians?

Leave the Bridge at once,

Sure. Have a seat.

And we think
you're absolutely right.

We've got to contact
the Vidiians.

342
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,867
It's a risk,
but it's worth it.

343
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,785
That's what I think,

344
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,245
but Captain Tuvok's
made his decision.

345
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,790
Two Ensigns and a crewman
won't change his mind.

346

There are a lot more
who agree with us.

00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,545
Really?

can't believe

give this a try.

351
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,551
Come on.

352
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,974
Did you hear what happened
this morning?

353
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,225
Sure did.

354
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,895
Three weeks ago,
you said if I had an idea

355
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,855
about what to do,
you'd listen.

356
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,232
I'm listening.

357
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,275
Is there something going on

358
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,986
that I should know about?

359
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,779
Have a seat, Neelix.

360
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,989
We might have come up

361
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,407
with the biggest
morale booster

362
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,992
you could
possibly imagine.

363
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:59,579
(<i> soft theme playing</i> )

364
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,877
( door chimes )

365
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,169
Come in.

366
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,467
Could I have
a moment, sir?

367
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,640
It's 0100 hours, Ensign.

368
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,475
Don't you have
the early shift this morning?

369
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,686
Yes, sir, but this is important.

370
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,646
Very well.

371
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,320
First of all,
I want to apologize

372
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,989
for my behavior
yesterday.

373
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,033
Apology accepted.

374
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,078
I understand that this is
a difficult situation for you.

375
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,163
I'd like to suggest a plan.

376
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,374
It's something a lot of people
have helped to develop.

377
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,212
We have
two big bargaining points

378
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,590
when it comes to dealing
with the Vidiians.

379
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,010
First, there's the woman
doc treated-- Danara Pel.

380
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,344
They were very close,

381
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,597
so I'm sure she'd help us
if she could.

382
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,849
And then there's B'Elanna.

383
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,019
Her DNA might lead to a cure
for the phage.

384
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:09,107
We could offer them some--
in exchange for their help

385
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,776
with a cure
for the Captain and Chakotay.

386
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:16,363
Those are, as you say,
points in our favor,

387
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,491
but there is also the fact
that we

388
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,451
were recently responsible
for the destruction

389
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,163
of a Vidiian ship,
an act which killed over 300

390
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,706
of their people.

391
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,835
That alone makes it unwise
for us to contact them.

392
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,255
Sir...

393
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,757
I think you should know

394
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,301
how many people on this ship
disagree with you.

395
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,930
Everyone I talked to thinks
we should give this a try.

396
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,890
The people you talked to

397
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,476
do not have the responsibility
of commanding this vessel.

398
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,687
I do.

399
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,939
The safety of this crew
is paramount,

400
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,608
and I must do whatever I can
to ensure that safety.

401
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,402
But if we're willing
to take that risk in order

402
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,030
to<i> help</i>
the Captain...

403
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,907
Ensign, I'm going
to say this once

404
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,617
and once only.

405
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,995
If you ever question
my orders again,

406
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,372
you will be relieved
of duty permanently.

407
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,874
The next words

408
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,836
I expect to hear from you
are, "yes, sir."

409
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,009
Yes...

410
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,386
sir.

411
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:24,057
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

412
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,309
( door opens, closes )

413
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,946
I'm going to check the
insect traps in beta-4.

414
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,657
Oh, what are you
up to now?

415
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,577
Making headboards.

416
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,162
Headboards?

417
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,956
I've noticed you sometimes
sit up in your bed to read.

418
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,418
Figured you might as well
have a comfortable backrest.

419
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,628
That's very thoughtful
of you, Chakotay.

420
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,838
You've done so many things

421
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,548
to make our lives
easier here.

422
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,341
The cooking, for example.

423
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,718
I hate to cook.

424
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,767
But what I do makes you
uncomfortable, doesn't it?

425
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,144
Every time
I do something

426
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,311
that adds
a personal touch

427
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,731
to the shelter,
you resist it.

428
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,860
Sometimes it feels...

429
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,946
as though you've given up.

430
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,115
That you're focused
on making a home here

431
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,491
instead of finding a cure
that will let us leave.

432
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,660
I can't sacrifice
the present

433
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,913
waiting for a future
that may never happen.

434
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,915
The reality
of this situation

435
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,792
is that we may never
leave here.

436
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,336
So, yes, I'm trying
to make a home--

437
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:40,633
something that's more
than a plain gray box.

438
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,471
Someday I may have to let go.

439
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:49,058
But not today, okay?

440
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,978
I tried a new glucose
bait in the traps.

441
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,021
I have a feeling

442
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,856
this might be the day
I make a breakthrough.

Do you understand me?

455
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,141
There.

Know what that is?

just might be

of your backyard.

What's happened to the sky?

get out of here, I agree.

Are you hurt?

472
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,835
No. I couldn't
keep my balance

473
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,045
and carry the case.

474
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,338
Give it to me.

00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,215
What's happening?

00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,717
It seems to be some
kind of plasma storm.

Our tricorders
don't recognize it,

Of course.

Please sit down.

485
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,209
I'd like to talk to you...
about my father.

486
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,877
Your father?

487
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,130
He was a very wise man.

488
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,842
More than anyone,
he shaped the person I am.

489
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,260
If it hadn't been for him,

490
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,929
I would have never questioned
my people's beliefs.

491
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,681
I would have never
left our city.

492
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,974
I would never have met
all of you.

493
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,559
Then we owe him a debt.

494
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,729
It is difficult to imagine
this journey without you.

495
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,691
When he died,
I had just turned one year old.

496
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,943
I didn't know
how I'd get through

497
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,945
the rest of my life
without him,

498
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,905
but then I started
working with you

499
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,283
and I didn't miss him
so much anymore.

500
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,785
I am honored by the comparison.

501
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,245
As Captain,

502
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,998
the well-being of your crew
is important to you.

503
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,416
Of course.

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,253
Their emotional well-being

505
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,922
as well as
their physical safety?

506
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:53,427
I cannot allow myself to become
hostage to their feelings.

507
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,930
Tuvok, they are suffering
because of this.

508

Maybe you don't know
what it's like.

that I am not sensitive
to the situation,

from the truth.

I am not immune to the effects
of that loss.

who feel things deeply.

are on the Bridge,

what it means to be
in command of a ship

until that responsibility
rests squarely on your shoulders

523
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,107
as it does on mine.

524
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,526
It has been suggested
that I take an action,

525
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,112
which would require me
to disobey an order,

526
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,782
and knowingly put this crew into
a life-threatening situation.

527
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,077
In general, I believe it
demonstrates faulty leadership

528
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,414
to be guided by the emotions
of a distraught crew.

529
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:08,127
However, as Captain,
I must not ignore

530
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,213
the sensibilities
of those I command.

531
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,133
We will contact the Vidiians.

532
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,261
This is my decision
and mine alone.

533
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,346
You are all absolved

534
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,432
of responsibility in the matter.

535
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,477
I will accept any consequences
which may ensue.

536
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,687
Lieutenant, set a course
for the Vidiian convoy.

537
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,068
Mr. Kim, let me know when we're
within hailing range.

538
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,121
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

539
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,177
Oh! Oh, no!

540
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,979
CHAKOTAY:
Let's check outside.

541
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,607
Maybe some of the insect traps
are still intact.

542
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,546
( sighs )

543
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,799
None of this
is salvageable either.

544
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:46,559
There's no way I can
continue to do my research.

545
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,229
I'm sorry.

546
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,903
Well, that's one way
of letting go.

547
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:08,414

<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49694.2.</i>

548
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,916

<i>the Vidiian convoy</i>

549
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,460
<i>with encouraging results.</i>
<i>They have promised</i>

550
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,961
<i>to communicate</i>
<i>with Dr. Danara Pel</i>

551
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,839
<i>and ask if she will help us.</i>

552
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,426
Sir, the Vidiians

553
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,801
On screen.

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,472
PEL:
<i>Hello, Lieutenant.</i>

555
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,932
Doctor Pel,

556
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,017
I didn't expect
to see you this quickly.

557
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,520
<i>When I heard what happened, I</i>
<i>boarded the first ship I could.</i>

558
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,522
<i>Tell me about this illness.</i>

559
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,065
They were infected
by a virus

560
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,900
after being bitten by insects

561
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,445
on a planet approximately
70 light-years from here

562
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,821
in a system
with a yellow dwarf star.

<i>The third planet</i>
<i>in a system of seven?</i>

564
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,325
Yes.

565
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,535
<i>I know it well.</i>

566
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,120
<i>There's a particular kind</i>

567
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,038
<i>of burrowing insect</i>
<i>that carries the disease.</i>

568
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,666
<i>Years ago, we developed an</i>
<i>antiviral agent to combat it.</i>

569
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,460
Can we get some from you?

570
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,588
<i>Of course. Our Captain said</i>
<i>we could rendezvous with you.</i>

571
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,465
<i>He's transmitted</i>
<i>the coordinates.</i>

572
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,467
( console beeps )
I have them, sir.

573
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,219
Thank you, doctor.
We appreciate your help.

574
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,055
<i>I'm glad I can</i>
<i>be of assistance.</i>

575
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,224
Estimated time
to the coordinates?

576
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,560
Approximately 20 hours.

577
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,438
Until then, I want
a series of battle drills.

578
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,940
We must be ready
for whatever comes.

579
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,985
I've been thinking...

580
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,362
there's plenty of wood
available here.

581
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,782
I could probably add
rooms to the shelter.

582
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,575
Give us a little more
living space.

583
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,118
How would you mill it?

584
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,911
I could do a certain
amount with a phaser,

585
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,456
but I was actually
thinking of logs.

586
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,500
As in log cabin?

587
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,543
I built a few of them
when I was growing up.

588
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,753
My father thought

589
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,713
it was important
that I learn how.

590
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,466
When I was young, my parents
took us on backpacking trips.

591
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,801
They thought we should all

592
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,385
keep a connection
to our pioneer roots.

593
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,971
I hated it--
no bed, no replicator...

594
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,264
No bathtub.

595
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,808
No bathtub.

596
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:54,520
I guess I was always a child
of the 24th century.

597
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,648
Well...
maybe those camping trips

598
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,399
helped prepare you
for life here.

599
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,026
Oh, no.

600
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,028
Life here is much better
than that.

601
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,282
I think that's the first time

602
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,451
I've heard you say anything
positive about being here.

603
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,870
( chittering )

604
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,500
Well, hello there.

605
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,502
I haven't seen you
in a while.

606
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:19,795
Where have you been?

607
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,673
Do you expect him
to answer you?

608
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,342
( whispers ):
Not really. I just sense
intelligence in him,

609
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,219
and I could swear
he came to warn me

610
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,554
about the plasma storm.

611
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,805
Come here, fella.

612
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,097
Come on.

613
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,603
I doubt that he
can be domesticated--

614
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,813
at least not very easily.

615
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,357
( chittering )

616
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:44,444
Well, we have
plenty of time.

617
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,988
The rest of our lives.

618
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,033
( sighs )

619
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,493
That's a long time.

620
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,121
At least I hope so.

621
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,373
( laughs )

622
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,999
Well, I can't give you
orders anymore,

623
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,001
but I suggest we get
back to work.

624
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,378
Aye, aye, Captain.

625
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,049

627
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,392
I guess I'm not used
to that kind of work.

629
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,480
My knots are getting knots.

Here, let me help.

631
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,002
Oh, that feels good.

632
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,300
I've had a lot
of practice at this.

633
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,804
My mother used to get
sore necks all the time.

634
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,723
I was the only one she'd trust
not to make it worse.

635
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,165
That's much better.
Thank you.

636
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,879
Well...I'm going
to go to bed now.

637
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,297
I'll see you in the morning.

638
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,633
Sleep well, Kathryn.

639
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,051
Yes.

640
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,553
You, too.

Vidiian ship,

Hail them.

00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,744
They aren't responding.

00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,537
Trying
on alternating frequencies.

649
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,415
I'm reading a second ship,
177 mark 5.

00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,834
I've got it.
Now a third.

00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,335
They're surrounding us.

652
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,671
None of them are answering hails

653
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,923
and their weapons are powered.

654
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,966
Red Alert.

657

We have to talk
about this.

658
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,279
All right.

659
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:19,325
I think we need to define
some parameters...

660
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,494
about us.

661
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:25,498
I'm not sure I can...
define parameters.

662
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,087
But I can tell you a story--

663
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,881
an ancient legend
among my people.

664
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,428
It's about an angry warrior

665
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,679
who lived his life

666
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,347
in conflict with the
rest of his tribe--

667
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,600
a man who couldn't
find peace,

668
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,685
even with the help
of his spirit guide.

669
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:52,442
For years, he struggled
with his discontent.

670
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,570
But the only satisfaction
he ever got

671
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,197
came when he was in battle.

672
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,951
This made him a hero
among his tribe,

673
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,496
but the warrior still longed
for peace within himself.

674
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,082
One day, he and his war party

675
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,209
were captured
by a neighboring tribe

676
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,504
led by a woman warrior.

677
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,841
She called on him to join her

678
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,677
because her tribe was too small
and weak to defend itself

679
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,095
from all its enemies.

680
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,056
The woman warrior
was brave and beautiful

681
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,390
and very wise.

682
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,269
The angry warrior
swore to himself...

683
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,982
that he would stay by her side,

684
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,485
doing whatever he could
to make her burden lighter.

685
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,237
From that point on,
her needs would come first.

686
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,241
And in that way...

687
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,706
the warrior began to know...

688
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,124
the true meaning of peace.

689
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,673
Is that really...

690
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,051
an ancient legend?

691
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,724
No.

692
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,020
But that made it easier to say.

00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,587
( both grunt )

711
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,799
( moaning )

712
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,383
She has
a broken arm.

713
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,885
Set it with the osteogenic
stimulator.

714
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,428
I think there's someone
on the monitor.

715
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,846
This way.

716
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:31,143
Odd. Why wouldn't they
just use the com line?

717
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,769
I don't think this is coming
from our ship.

718
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,062
DANARA:
<i>Shmullus...</i>

719
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,231
<i>Shmullus, can you hear me?</i>

720
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,275
Danara.

721
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,819
<i>Shmullus,</i>
<i>I have to do this quickly.</i>

722
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,528
<i>I'm on one</i>
<i>of the Vidiian ships.</i>

723
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,738
( grunts )

724
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,198
Do they know
you're contacting me?

725
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,616
Are you in any danger?

726
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:51,204
<i>No. Everyone's too focused</i>
<i>on the battle.</i>

727
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:55,667
<i>Oh, Shmullus, I swear I didn't</i>
<i>know they planned to attack.</i>

728
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,878
<i>I thought we were on</i>
<i>an errand of mercy.</i>

729
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,421
I believe you.

730
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,215
<i>I have the antiviral serum</i>
<i>here. If you could use</i>

731
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,842
<i>your transporter</i>
<i>to get it to your...</i>

732
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,218
Our shields are up.

733
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,928
We can't transport anything
through them.

734
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,055
<i>I don't know what else</i>
<i>to suggest.</i>

735
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,766
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

736
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,685
Maybe we can
lower the shields

737
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,312
long enough
to transport the serum.

738
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,230
Sickbay to Bridge.

739
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,566
This is Tuvok.

740
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,985
We're rather busy
here, doctor.

741
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,903
Doctor Pel is on
one of the Vidiian ships.

742
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,613
<i>If we can drop</i>
<i>our shields briefly,</i>

743
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,115
<i>we can beam aboard the serum.</i>

744
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,367
Keep this com
line open, doctor.

745
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,536
When you hear me
order the shields down,

746
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,913
you must complete a site-to-site
transport yourself.

747
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,540
We will be busy
with the Vidiians.

748
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,875
<i>Understood.</i>

749
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,376
Bridge to Engineering.

750
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,836
<i>Report.</i>

751
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,838
We're ready to eject
the antimatter container.

752
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,048
Stand by for my command.

753
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,966
Here is the sequence of events.

754
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,677
We will drop shields
to transport the medicine.

755
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,262
At the same moment,

756
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,056
the antimatter container
will be ejected.

757
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,473
As soon as it's clear,

758
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,893
Mr. Kim will detonate it
with a photon torpedo.

759
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:58,521
Simultaneously, Mr. Paris
will jump to full impulse,

760
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,523
so that we will not take
the brunt of the explosion.

761
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,567
Is everyone clear on this?

762
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,944
Timing is
of the utmost importance.

763
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,863
We won't get a second chance.

764
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,114
Understood.

765
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,366
Aye, sir.

766
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,658
We're ready down here.

767
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,868
Doctor?

768
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,286
I've set up
to make the transport.

769
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,453
Stand ready, then.

770
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,707
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

771
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,459
Lower shields.

772
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,461
Initiating transport.

773
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,714
Ejecting
the antimatter container...

774
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,299
now.

775
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,262
We've got it.

776
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,305
Raise shields.

777
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,224
Mr. Kim, Mr. Paris?

778
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,808
Go.

779
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,435
Firing torpedo.

780
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,818
Report.

781
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,486
The Vidiian ships
are all disabled, sir.

782
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,821
They're not pursuing.

783
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,740
Ready to go
to warp, sir.

784
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,368
Set a course for the planet

785
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,494
where we left the Captain
and Commander Chakotay.

786
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,788
Warp 6.

787
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,456
Aye, aye, sir.

788
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,232
How are they coming?

789
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,236
Very nicely.

790
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,780
We should have vine-ripened
Talaxian tomatoes

791
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,573
in a couple of months...

792
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,160
unless this planet has
the equivalent of tomato bugs.

793
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,120
Oh, they're awful.

794
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,913
I would never
have thought

795
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,248
of you
as a gardener.

796
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,709
Hmm. I grew up around farmers.

797
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,629
My parents insisted we learn
some basic gardening skills.

798
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,173
Did you hate that
as much as camping?

799
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,424
Of course.

800
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,676
Who wanted to muck around
in the dirt

801
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,761
when you could be studying
quantum mechanics?

802
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,054
( chuckles )

803
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:59,351
But...I find it
very satisfying now,

804
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,312
watching the seeds sprout
and grow.

805
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,232
If your tomatoes
could spare you for a minute,

806
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,400
I'd like your opinion

807
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,068
on something
in the house.

808
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,487
You've come
to the right person.

809
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:11,737
I always have an opinion.

810
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,947
Really?

811
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,324
( laughs )

812
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,582
What do you think?

813
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,084
A boat.

814
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,878
You said you wanted
to explore the river?

815
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,254
I think I could
build this.

816
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,673
We could go on
a camping trip.

817
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,967
I'm not sure we could fit
the bathtub in the boat.

818
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,635
Well, that's all right.
I'll have the river.

819
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,970
( muffled com noise )

820
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,222
Do you hear that?

821
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,057
Yes.

822
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,145
TUVOK ( staticky ):

823
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,980

824

<i>This is Tuvok calling Captain</i>
<i>Janeway and Commander Chakotay.</i>

<i>Please respond.</i>

826
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,532
This is Janeway.

<i>Captain, it's good</i>
<i>to hear your voice.</i>

828
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,160
<i>We have news.</i>

829

What is it?

JANEWAY:
There you are.

At least I get to say good-bye.

Feel free to use

839
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,789
the house.

Welcome back,

846
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,363
Commander.

847
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,741
The doctor tells me

848
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,369
you contacted the Vidiians
after all.

849
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,371
I disobeyed your
order, Captain.

850
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,748
I am prepared to accept
the consequences.

851
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,585
If I didn't know
you better,

852
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:34,046
I'd say your decision
was almost...emotional.

853
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,714
Thank you all.

854
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,175
Well, we've lost time
with all this.

855
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,551
Let's see if we can make
some of it up.

856
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,219
Mr. Paris, warp 8.
Aye, Captain.

857
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,930
Commander, we'll need
to review the ship's systems.

858
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,266
I'll handle propulsion,
environmental and communication.

859
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,102
You'll handle sensors,
weapons and transporters.

860
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,687
Aye, Captain.

861
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,314
I'll have a report to you
by 1800 hours.

862
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,650
Check with phaser maintenance.

863
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:54,817
See if they solved that problem
