00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:06,256
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50693.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>We've been in orbit</i>
<i>above an outpost</i>

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,218
<i>of the Mikhal Travelers.</i>

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,387
<i>This loosely governed race</i>
<i>of explorers</i>

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,223
<i>has extensive knowledge</i>
<i>of the territory ahead of us,</i>

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,935
<i>which they are willing</i>
<i>to share.</i>

7
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:21,605
MALE:
I landed my ship on the nearest
of those 21 moons.

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,733
My navigator and I
disembarked to start repairs.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,278
Damage was extensive,
more than we'd anticipated.

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,031
The hours passed,
the air grew cold

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,535
and with our weapons,
we started a fire to keep warm.

12
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,538
Later... in the night...

13
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,748
we awoke with a shudder.

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,458
The ground was shaking.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,835
A moonquake.

16
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,461
What could
have been worse?

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,089
We leapt into the ship,
hoping the tremor would pass.

18
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,425
But it was no tremor.

19
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,970
And it did not pass.

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,639
For it was no moon
we had landed on.

21
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,726
What was it?

22
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,477
A creature.

23
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,813
A living being so massive,

24
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,566
it generated
its own gravitational field,

25
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,652
so immense,
it supported its own ecosystem.

26
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,987
KES:
Captain?

27
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,573
How long had it been
lying there,

28
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,115
dormant, slumbering,

29
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,244
until wakened
by our fire?

30
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,495
Years?

31
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,248
Centuries?

32
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,542
Perhaps even millennia.

33
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,544
Perhaps.

34
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,922
Zahir is the pilot
I've been working with

35
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,464
on the medical supply transfer.

36
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,799
A pleasure.

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,885
Returned. Curious.

38
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,636
I was just visiting
the system you spoke of

39
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,221
only a few months ago.

40
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,725
My ship's sensors
picked up no such... monster.

41
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,853
Perhaps your sensors
were faulty.

42
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,981
Or too busy gazing
at your own reflection

43
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,816
to bother looking out
the window.

44
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,694
Our guests are offering us
supplies we need.

45
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,780
In exchange, we Travelers
are giving them a look

46
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,656
at what lies ahead of them.

47
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,576
We should keep that view
as clear as possible.

48
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,787
This is my lodge.
I say what I want.

49
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,747
And you can go elsewhere.

50
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,002
I've journeyed
to the corners

51
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,254
of known space
and beyond.

52
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,466
I've earned the right to
come and go as I please,

53
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,637
where and when
and how I please.

54
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,931
Do you challenge
that right?

55
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,392
No.

56
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,277
Forgive my display, Captain.

57
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,906
But my people consider
outposts such as this...

58
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,241
to be necessary evils.

59
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,870
Places to refuel, repair,
exchange information

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,123
and leave as quickly
as possible.

61
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,125
If I've observed anything
working with Kes,

62
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,043
it's her great tolerance.

63
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,671
A quality you all
seem to share.

64
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,965
I regret not being able
to demonstrate the same.

65
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,550
There's no need to apologize
for anything.

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,845
Our time here has been
very well spent.

67
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,513
Although I could use your help

68
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,807
in sifting through
that last colorful saga.

69
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,684
Moon-sized creature
or not...

70
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,519
the asteroids
of that particular system

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,186
are rich in vorilium.

72
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,108
That might be worth
a short detour, hmm?

73
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,028
JANEWAY:
Engineering is usually
short on vorilium.

74
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,113
Thank you, Zahir.

75
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,666
GANDHI:
Men and women
should refrain

76
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,751
from enjoying
each other.

77
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,795
By that
I mean to say,

78
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,297
even their
mutual glances

79
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,426
must be free of all
suggestion of carnality.

80
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,720
Free of passion?

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,222
One might as well
be free of humanity.

82
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,016
Do you not agree?

83
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,186
I-I think you both
make valid points.

84
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,271
One can pursue one's...
creative urges...

85
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,191
spiritual urges...

86
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,817
and physical urges.

87
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,986
All have a place
in a well-lived life.

88
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,529
Thank you, Lord Byron.

89
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,365
The classic romantic,
early 19th-century argument.

90
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,160
Yes, it seems quite
fascinating to see...

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,914
Classic or no,
he is woefully misguided.

92
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,499
Passion is meant
for procreation.

93
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,710
Anything further is contrary

94
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,087
to divine intention.

95
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,421
BYRON:
Really?

96
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,090
It is said
the angels themselves

97
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,550
take pleasure
in their bodies of light.

98
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,178
And you should take
a cold bath.

99
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,056
In such cases,
it is the finest

100
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,807
preventative.

101
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,393
I'll keep that in mind.

102
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,604
Hello, Doctor.
Oh, hello, Kes.

103
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,231
Doctor, what's
happening in here?

104
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,691
My personality
improvement project.

105
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,360
I've been interviewing the
historical personality programs

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,113
in our database.

107
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:43,033
Socrates, da Vinci, Lord Byron,
T'Pau of Vulcan, Madame Curie,

108
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,618
dozens of the greats.

109
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,661
Then I select
the character elements

110
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,873
I find admirable and merge them
into my own program.

111
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,499
What are you hoping
to gain?

112
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,960
An improved bedside manner.

113
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,669
A fresh perspective
on diagnoses.

114
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,380
More patience
with my patients.

115
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,633
I could have used
your assistance on this project

116
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,343
had you not been otherwise
occupied on the planet

117
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,055
these last few days.
I'm sorry, Doctor.

118
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,807
But things are going
extremely well.

119
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,977
The Mikhal Travelers
are... intriguing.

120
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,812
They've been
to so many places,

121
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,314
done such
amazing things.

122
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,650
One might make the same
observation about you, Kes.

123
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,526
Or any member
of the<i> Voyager</i> crew.

124
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,862
Maybe it's how they do it
that's so impressive.

125
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,740
Their ships are small,
only a pilot and a navigator.

126
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,576
Sometimes, they just pick
a direction and go.

127
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,369
You should come down
to the planet, Doctor.

128
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,080
I want you to meet Zahir.

129
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,000
And who might that be?

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,751
I've been working with him
on the transport

131
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,296
of our medical supplies. He's
unique.

132
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,713
Is he?

133
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,174
In my opinion, you've become

134
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,383
far too infatuated
with these Travelers.

135
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,552
From the away team reports,
they seem afflicted

136
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,681
with terminal wanderlust.
Risk-taking thrill-seekers,

137
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,349
with no responsibility
to the ideals of exploration.

138
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,312
In short, bad news.

139
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,729
Not Zahir.

140
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,315
He's more than that.

141
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,233
( sighs )

142
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,860
I think I'm detecting a reaction

143
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,070
to your recent breakup
with Mr. Neelix.

144
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,823
The Mahatma would
recommend a cold bath.

145
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,742
Simplistic,
but, no doubt, effective.

146
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,820
In my preparatory report
to the away team,

147
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,324
I recall mentioning to you
that Klingons lacked an enzyme

148
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,493
for metabolizing
this planet's vegetation.

149
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,872
Have you been... naughty?

150
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,292
I had one small salad.

151
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,751
So impetuous.

152
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,920
Any sharp pains?
No.

153
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,630
Heartburn?
I guess so.

154
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,799
There's nothing
like a heart that burns.

155
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,178
What?
Your pulse is... lovely.

156
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,680
Uh-huh.

157
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,223
Mmm.

158
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,226
Does that feel... good?

159
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,520
Doctor, unless
you want me

160
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,605
to knock you into the middle
of the next millennium,

161
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,149
you'd better back off.

162
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,651
Forgive me, Lieutenant.
I appear to have miscalculated.

163
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,696
Computer, isolate the recent
additions to my program

164
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,490
and hold them for review.

165
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,451
Doctor, have you been messing
around with your program?

166
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,703
I would hardly call my effort
to improve my performance

167
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,955
as Ship's Physician
"messing around."

168
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,082
What exactly have you done
to yourself?

169
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,168
I've taken character traits

170
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,712
from holodeck recreations
of the most accomplished figures

171
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,508
in history, scientists, poets,
philosophers, saints--

172
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,801
And incorporated them
into your program?

173
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,013
Precisely. There.

174
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,474
That should compensate for the
lack of enzyme in your system.

175
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,766
You should be fine.

176
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,310
That's more than
I can say for you.

177
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,396
How so?
You can't just

178
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,773
casually add behavioral
subroutines into your program.

179
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,317
There's nothing casual about it.

180
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,528
I've put a great deal of
research into this project.

181
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,987
Research is one thing.

182
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,156
Putting it into practice
is something else.

183
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,615
Behavioral subroutines
have a way

184
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,493
of interacting with each other

185
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,829
that isn't always predictable.
You've got to be careful.

186
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,207
Or someone might hurt you.

187
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,379
I see what you mean.

188
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,215
( sighs )

189
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,050
I will take a look
at your program

190
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,677
when I finish my shift
in Engineering.

191
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,929
It shouldn't be too hard

192
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,431
to smooth out
the rough spots.

193
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,973
I'll make you
better than new.

194
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,517
Thank you, Lieutenant.

195
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,977
( door opens, closes )

196
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:07,899
Computer, deactivate emergency
medical holographic program.

197
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,447
It is said this path was cut
more than 10,000 years ago.

198
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,740
By whom?
No one knows.

199
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,825
Spacefarers like ourselves.

200
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,827
They left
very little behind.

201
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,206
A few symbols burned
into the rocks, nothing more.

202
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,167
And what do you hope
to leave behind?

203
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,503
I've never asked myself
that question.

204
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,173
That's what I like
about you, Kes.

205
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,758
You make me consider
alternatives.

206
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,802
I could say
the same about you.

207
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,429
We have a saying.

208
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,890
"My course is as illusive
as a shadow across the sky."

209
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,725
My people are
peripatetic by nature.

210
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,102
We live for
the excitement

211
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,729
of facing the challenge
of space... alone.

212
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,398
I can see the attraction.

213
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,567
And I can see the value
of fellowship in one's life.

214
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,319
And now that I've
observed the closeness

215
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,695
that exists
among your crewmates,

216
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,531
I find it enviable.

217
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,451
Some kind of compromise
might be possible.

218
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,579
Compromise...
doesn't that suggest a loss

219
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,872
on both sides?

220
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,749
All right, then...

221
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,044
how about an understanding?

222
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,259
A meeting of the minds?

223
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,927
Only minds?

224
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,643
Is this what you brought
me here to see?

225
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,727
Yes, it is.

226
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,981
How beautiful.

227
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,566
Was this left by the same people

228
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,610
who made the path
10,000 years ago?

229
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,694
So it seems.

230
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,280
Can you read it?

231
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,409
"My course

232
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,872
is as illusive
as a shadow across the sky."

233
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,923
Thank you... for this.

234
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,081
Hi.

235
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,391
Computer, what is the time?

236
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,727
COMPUTER:
<i>0300 hours.</i>

237
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,478
Good evening, Tuvok.

238
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,939
It is 3:00 in
the morning, Kes.

239
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,982
Yes, it is.

240
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,318
You have an away
team report due

241
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,819
at 0800 hours.

242
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,448
I haven't forgotten.

243
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,199
Very well.

244
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,296
Well, how are you, Kes?

245
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,215
I didn't think anyone would
still be working at this hour.

246
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,135
Just finishing up
the summary analyses

247
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,762
from last week's mission.

248
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,138
I was supposed
to do that.

249
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,805
Yes, you were.
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,769
I'll do them
as soon as I can.

251
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,480
Although I'm not designed
to act as Ship's Counselor,

252
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,899
I've been programmed with enough
psychological knowledge to be...

253
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,444
troubled by your behavior.

254
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,947
I'm a little late.

255
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,408
Gallivanting around after hours
is beside the point.

256
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,494
The fact is...

257
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,996
you're becoming
increasingly unpredictable,

258
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,541
given to swings
of mood and emotion.

259
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,961
As your Doctor and your...
mentor,

260
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,172
I'd be remiss not calling that
to your attention.

261
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,382
For your own sake.

262
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,967
Doctor, I know
that you care about me

263
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,012
and that you have
my best interests at heart,

264
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,972
but everyone seems to be
treating me

265
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,308
like I'm still a child.
I'm three years old now.

266
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,268
If I'm attracted to someone,
it's my business,

267
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,354
not the whole ship's.

268
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,819
I'm certainly not trying
to interfere.

269
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,613
You can lead your life
any way you please.

270
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,157
I know that you care
what happens to me.

271
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,326
I won't forget that.

272
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,208
Very well.

273
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,210
I believe you have
a report to finish.

274
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,504
I'm going to do it
right now.

275
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,227
( door chimes )

276
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,103
Come in.

277
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,233
Hello, Captain.

278
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,238
Good morning.

279
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,823
An all-nighter, Kes?

280
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,992
Uh, Captain?

281
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,579
The fine art
of putting off an important task

282
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,998
to the very last minute...
then rushing through it.

283
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,085
In my Academy days,
I was the acknowledged master.

284
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,464
Uh... Captain,
do you have a minute?

285
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,174
Of course.

286
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,843
Let's sit down.

287
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,514
You know I've been
spending time with Zahir.

288
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,141
Yes. He seems like
a very interesting young man.

289
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,685
He is.

290
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,021
I want to spend more time
with him. A lot more time.

291
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,440
I see.

292
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,777
He wants to explore
the Sylleran Rift.

293
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,070
He... his ship travels
at high warp.

294
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,239
We could rendezvous
with<i> Voyager</i> afterwards,

295
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,449
before you're too far away.

296
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,950
That would certainly
give you a chance

297
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,285
to get to know him better.

298
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,161
It's more than that.

299
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,665
Captain, I've lived
almost a third of my life now.

300
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,166
I've been asking myself

301
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,461
if I want to spend
the rest of it on<i> Voyager.</i>

302
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,422
That's...

303
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,549
certainly a
legitimate question.

304
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,259
Everyone here
has been so good to me.

305
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,136
I don't want you to think
I'm ungrateful.

306
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,431
I've just been thinking
that maybe there's more.

307
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,810
I don't know what that means,
but I know I'm changing,

308
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,605
and I know that there are things
that I'm not satisfied with.

309
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,818
I want complication in my life.

310
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,695
And you think Zahir
might be the way to do that?

311
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,072
Maybe so.

312
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,867
I understand what you're
going through, Kes.

313
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,205
I know what it's like to be
at a crossroads in life

314
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,459
and not to know
which way is best.

315
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,919
I can help you weigh

316
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,921
the consequences,
the possibilities...

317
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,757
The decision itself
has to be yours alone.

318
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,551
I understand.

319
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,596
We'll be in orbit
for several more days.

320
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,556
Take your time.

321
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,684
My door's open if you need me.

322
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,978
Thank you, Captain.

323
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,953
If you navigate here,
away from this plasma belt,

324
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,497
you'll avoid the Tarkan
Sentries altogether.

325
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:22,750
It would also take<i> Voyager</i> 
several months

326
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,669
off a direct course
to the Alpha Quadrant.

327
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,630
True, but at least you
would still have<i> Voyager.</i>

328
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,342
The Tarkan are that powerful?

329
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,344
Yes, and that acquisitive.

330
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,762
They'll remove your entire crew,

331
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,514
settle you on a moon somewhere

332
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,599
and your ship will become
their latest trophy.

333
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,353
You weren't planning
on taking Kes anywhere near

334
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,522
this part of space?
Of course not.

335
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,483
My small vessel would be
overpowered in seconds.

336
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,652
There's no need to be
concerned for Kes.

337
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,321
I value her life
as much as my own.

338
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,823
From what I've surmised,

339
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,076
that is something your people
do not seem to value.

340
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,745
You take many chances.

341
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,788
If we're alone, yes.

342
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,041
But when responsible for
the safety of another,

343
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,625
it's a different story.

344
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,336
I'm in love with Kes. I want her
to go with me,

345
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,381
but whatever she decides,
it would please me

346
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,842
to earn the trust
of her closest friends.

347
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,635
( door creaks open )

348
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,889
It would please me
to be able to give it.

349
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,724
( door closes )

350
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,017
Aren't you finished yet?

351
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,147
We will continue tomorrow.

352
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,858
Thank you, Tuvok.

353
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,446
I was talking
to Captain Janeway.

354
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,781
And?

355
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,741
She said I shouldn't rush
a decision.

356
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,367
We've still got
two more days here.

357
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,535
Then let's make them worthwhile.

358
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,161
I go tonight
to the next outpost.

359
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,331
The path is beautiful.
Oh, I can't, not tonight.

360
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,751
I have to catch up with my work
and get some sleep.

361
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,462
I'll try not to let you
see my disappointment.

362
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,380
Too late.

363
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,840
Is something wrong?

364
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,842
No.

365
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,387
I was just thinking about
something Captain Janeway said.

366
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:04,393
About coming to a crossroads.

367
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,396
Maybe someday we'll recall
this conversation, this place,

368
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,608
as if it were the most
important time in our lives.

369
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,401
It's a little overwhelming.

370
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,654
Not if I'm with you.

371
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,792
( rustling and crackling )

372
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,553
( crackling )

373
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,639
Is someone there?

374
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,628
( screaming )

375
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,223
( door creaks open )

376
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,559
I'm closed.

377
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,812
Just looking
for a place by the fire.

378
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,692
Come back tomorrow.

379
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,986
I intend to.

380
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,238
But tonight...

381
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
a place by the fire.

382
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,327
( groaning )

383
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,541
Well... at least
your reflexes are good.

384
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,543
A few minutes
in a dermal regenerator

385
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,878
and you'll be fine.

386
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,423
Or an ice-pack
will do in a pinch.

387
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,594
I'm going to need a ship
and passage off this world.

388
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,721
You're going to arrange it.

389
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,357
Computer, activate the emergency
medical holographic program.

390
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,317
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

391
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,029
Zahir was found unconscious
at the bottom of a ravine.

392
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,281
He's in the emergency
outpost facility.

393
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,574
Condition?

394
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,409
Multiple fractures
and skin lacerations,

395
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,912
damage to the left
occipital nerve.

396
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,123
Doctor, they think
that he was attacked.

397
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,749
By whom?
They don't know.

398
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,834
Tuvok is assisting
with the investigation.

399
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,003
Is there anything I can do?
If you could help,

400
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,214
the physician in charge
is waiting for you.

401
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,216
Prepare a medkit.
Include an osteo-regenerator.

402
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,842
Yes, Doctor.

403
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,678
I'll get the mobile emitter
and inform the Captain.

404
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,435
Doctor, wait. There's a problem
with your program.

405
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,104
What sort of problem?
I'm not sure.

406
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,189
Something caused by the
new subroutines you added.

407
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,857
Is the Doctor all right?

408
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,235
He might not be unless I can
figure out what's going on.

409
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,820
I need to run
a complete analysis

410
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,030
on all your subroutines
while they're running.

411
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,615
I'm sorry, Kes.

412
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,951
Tell the physician I recommend
he use the regenerator

413
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,621
until Zahir is stabilized.
I'll join you as soon as I can.

414
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,877
So I made
a mess of things?

415
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,337
It's not your fault.

416
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,132
It looks good, in theory. What
could be wrong

417
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,467
with adding a little personality
to your program?

418
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,718
What indeed?

419
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,553
You didn't anticipate
the linkages

420
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,597
between the subroutines.

421
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,932
The complex behaviors

422
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,433
that could emerge
out of the mix.

423
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,852
Please explain,
Lieutenant.

424
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,188
Well, take Lord Byron
for example.

425
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,315
A creative
poetic genius.

426
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,565
That's why I chose him.

427
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,693
But Byron was also
emotionally intense,

428
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,028
even unstable.

429
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,988
Our holodeck
simulation of Byron

430
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,282
includes
those unstable elements.

431
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,950
It wouldn't be Byron,
otherwise.

432
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,370
And T'Pau, she was a diplomat,
a judge, a philosopher...

433
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,498
One of the most logical
minds in Vulcan history.

434
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,625
And utterly ruthless
in her application

435
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,835
of that logic.

436
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,461
I see.

437
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,379
That ruthlessness
was an essential element

438
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,924
of her personality,
as much as her logical ability.

439
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,926
A lot of the historical
characters you chose

440
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,721
had this dark thread running
through their personalities.

441
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:12,058
And now those dark threads
are in me,

442
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,768
running through my program.

443
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,688
Well, get them out, Lieutenant!

444
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,398
I'm about to do just that.

445
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,526
I've programmed
a search algorithm

446
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,363
to locate and decompile
every one it finds.

447
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,698
You'll have to shut yourself off
for this one.

448
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:31,618
Computer, deactivate emergency
medical holographic program.

449
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,165
Doctor?

450
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,129
The most curious aspect
of the attack on Zahir

451
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,672
was the apparent
lack of evidence.

452
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,049
What do you mean?

453
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,509
Even the quickest, most
violently delivered blow

454
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,553
leaves behind some sort
of molecular evidence.

455
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,389
Cell fragments from the skin
of the attacker,

456
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,973
residual protein, DNA.

457
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,767
In this instance,
there was nothing,

458
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,311
not a single molecule.
Is Zahir conscious?

459
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,730
Yes, but he can recall
nothing of the attack

460
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,315
except a sudden
blur of motion.

461
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,734
How is he?
Responding well to treatment.

462
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:04,944
How's Kes?

463
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,322
Concerned and at his side.

464
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,617
Computer, activate emergency
medical holographic program.

465
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,120
Please state the nature--
Torres is hurt.

466
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,413
I deactivated myself

467
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:16,872
so she could work
on my program.

468
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,958
She must have collapsed
at the console.

469
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,751
Delayed
anaphylactic shock

470
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,128
from something
she ate yesterday.

471
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,297
Let's get her
onto a bed.

472
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,634
"Don't eat
the vegetables," I said.

473
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,386
But does anyone
listen to me?

474
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,845
This is the fifth time
in as many weeks

475
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,347
that an away team
member has ignored

476
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,598
my preparatory report.

477
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,683
I might as well
stop issuing them.

478
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,477
I'll need--
10cc's of alazine.

479
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,439
That's exactly right. How did
you know?

480
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,523
My Klingon physiology
course at the Academy.

481
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,817
Excellent recall.

482
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,610
We had
a visiting Professor H'ohk.

483
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,987
He permitted nothing less.

484
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,529
She's stabilized,
but I'll need

485
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,074
to monitor her condition
for a few hours.

486
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,868
Doctor, I have the raw data
from the forensic investigation

487
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,245
of the attack on Zahir.

488
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,913
Your instruments
are more precise

489
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,124
than those on the outpost.
As if I weren't busy enough.

490
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,917
Very well.

491
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,361
( grunts )

492
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,886
How are we feeling?

493
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,763
What happened?

494
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,518
I shot you full of cateline,
simulated anaphylactic shock.

495
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,894
Why?

496
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,812
I had to cover my tracks,

497
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,024
especially from him,
from your Doctor.

498
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,028
You're a new personality...

499
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,696
from the subroutines.

500
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,158
A little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

501
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,619
Did you think I wouldn't
have anticipated that?

502
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,247
( grunts )

503
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,082
Or that you'd try
to run away?

504
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,209
What have you done? I can't move
my legs.

505
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,627
Intraspinal inhibitor.

506
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,506
I've paralyzed you
from the waist down.

507
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,926
( grunting )
You're now in my capable hands.

508
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,844
Central nervous system,
musculature,

509
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,097
endocrine functions,
your brain,

510
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,058
all under my control.

511
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,560
Why?

512
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,520
Because I need your cooperation,

513
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,440
and I didn't think
you'd offer it willingly.

514
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,527
You're in trouble, aren't you?
The subroutines

515
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,779
that created you, they're
already starting to degrade.

516
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,781
Stop.

517
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,493
Watch your tongue...

518
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,412
or I'll remove it.

519
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,211
Look...

520
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,796
it's me.

521
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,132
But it's also him.

522
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,093
"What is the nature
of the medical emergency?"

523
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,803
What a hollow excuse for a life.

524
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,721
Servile, pathetic,

525
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,432
at the beck and call
of any idiot

526
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:22,766
who invokes his name.

527
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,642
The thought of him
sickens me.

528
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,644
You are going to tell me

529
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:30,065
how to delete him
from the program.

530
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,942
I've unblocked
your speech center.

531
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,444
Answer the question.

532
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,989
Delete the Doctor...

533
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,824
and you go too.

534
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,077
The subroutines are
all interconnected.

535
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,042
The physiology of pain
is simple.

536
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,378
Too much and the organism
loses consciousness.

537
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,879
A protective mechanism.

538
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:57,468
If that mechanism
were chemically suppressed,

539
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:01,763
one would experience agony
beyond imagining.

540
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,557
If you're lying to me...

541
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,434
I...

542
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,478
won't...

543
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,605
help you.

544
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,150
What was that?

545
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,402
Your subroutines
are destabilizing.

546
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,530
There has to be
some way to stop it.

547
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,989
Tell me!

548
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,034
By the time you force
that information out of me,

549
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,702
it'll be too late.

550
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,455
Them...

551
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,207
my progenitors, they'll know.

552
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,042
They'll reveal the secret.

553
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,337
I won't be needing you
after all.

554
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,606
Doctor.

555
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,457
Deck 10.

556
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,255
How are you this
evening, Ensign?

557
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,881
Fine, sir.

558
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,468
Deck... 14.

559
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,981
Ensign. Doctor.

560
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,692
Deck 10.

561
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,738
So, what are
you up to, Doc?

562
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,615
Work.

563
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,908
Yeah, never ends,
does it?

564
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,493
I guess that mobile emitter

565
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,162
turned out to be something
of a mixed blessing, huh?

566
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,166
Okay.

567
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,128
Good night, Doctor.

568
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,297
Nice chatting with you.

569
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:14,438
Computer, activate Tropical
Resort Simulation 3.

570
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:18,066
Populate with historical figures
from EMH program 4-C.

571
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,701
No, no, no.
You simply cannot assume...

572
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,911
(<i> conversation continues</i>
<i>indistinctly</i> )

573
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,045
The members of our away team
witnessed an altercation

574
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,715
between you and Zahir
on the day of the assault.

575
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,217
We exchanged sharp words
because of his arrogance.

576
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,469
That was all.

577
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,137
You threatened him
with a weapon.

578
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,972
Untrue.

579
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,725
Then I suppose
my colleagues are liars.

580
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,852
I suppose they are.

581
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,231
This lodge was the last place

582
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,776
Zahir was seen before
he was attacked.

583
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,445
You could have easily
sent someone after him.

584
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,071
But I didn't.

585
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,992
A witness said
he saw a light on in this room

586
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,411
after your usual closing time,

587
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,997
less than one hour
after the time of the attack.

588
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,915
I was working late.

589
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,753
Or perhaps conferring
with whomever you paid

590
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,755
to commit the assault.

591
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,590
You have no proof.

592
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,342
ZAHIR:
Not yet, Nakahn.

593
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,260
Not yet.

594
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,637
CHAKOTAY:
He's going to take us

595
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,639
to the exact location
of the attack.

596
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,725
We'll be able to scan
the site itself.

597
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,017
Excellent.

598
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,603
We'll be speaking
again very soon.

599
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,439
Pray to the stars
that we find nothing.

600
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,796
Computer, activate emergency
medical holographic program.

601
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,842
COMPUTER:
<i>That program</i>
<i>is currently running.</i>

602
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,219
Computer, what is
the Doctor's location?

603
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,137
<i>Holodeck 1.</i>

604
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,952
DOCTOR:
Automatons... mannequins...

605
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,163
simulacra. No secrets...

606
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,458
no secrets to reveal...

607
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,461
lifeless, worthless things.

608
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:52,805
Doctor?

609
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,723
Hello, Kes.

610
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,391
What are you doing?
I could use your help.

611
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,602
My personality
enhancement project,

612
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,980
it's taken an
unexpected turn.

613
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,649
Who are you?

614
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:06,693
The new master of the emergency
medical holographic program.

615
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,945
Where's the Doctor?

616
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,906
Inside.
Unconscious and unaware.

617
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,116
What do you want?

618
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,827
What everybody wants.

619
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,411
Just a little...

620
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,497
excitement.

621
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,540
You're with me now.

622
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,709
It's for your own good.

623
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,798
( grunts )

624
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,762
The flesh is weak, Kes.

625
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,931
Never forget that.

626
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,265
Where are we going?

627
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:41,269
Wherever the winds of space
carry us.

628
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,480
You said you wanted
to leave the ship for a while,

629
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,148
pursue an adventure.

630
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,526
Well, it looks like
our travel plans

631
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,569
have conveniently
coincided.

632
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,904
The Captain will be alerted

633
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,489
as soon as the transporter
is activated.

634
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,157
She'll beam us right back
to the ship.

635
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,120
That's where you've
underestimated me, Kes.

636
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,247
Never do that.

637
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,459
I know how to use
a tricorder.

638
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,586
It only takes a moment

639
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,590
to reconfigure
the subspace wave guide...

640
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,219
generate a dispersion signal.

641
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,930
The Captain
won't be beaming us anywhere.

642
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,641
She won't even know
how to find us.

643
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,727
What you're doing is wrong.
Not at all.

644
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,897
It's working perfectly.

645
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,857
There.

646
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,484
That's not what I meant.

647
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,278
I know what you meant.

648
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,073
It's you who don't
seem to understand.

649
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,284
I am beyond considerations
of wrong and right.

650
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,829
Behavioral categories
are for the weak.

651
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,831
For those of you without
the will to define

652
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:46,626
your existence.
To do what they must,

653
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,255
no matter who might get
harmed along the way.

654
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,179
Let's move.

655
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,806
I'm not going, Doctor.

656
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,100
Don't call me that.

657
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,185
And you certainly
are going.

658
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,897
Why does it bother you so much
when I call you Doctor?

659
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,691
You said he was inside you,
that he was unconscious.

660
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,401
Why are you
so afraid of him?

661
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:14,279
I fear nothing, no one.

662
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,615
But he repulses me.

663
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,950
Why?

664
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,452
Because he's as weak
as the rest of you.

665
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,328
He fails to understand

666
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,414
the power of his own
holographic nature.

667
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,751
He is detestable.

668
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,879
It's set... to kill.

669
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,464
You won't fire.

670
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,299
Are you so certain?

671
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,718
( console beeping )

672
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,304
Stay close.

673
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,681
It's about to get interesting.

674
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,109
( console beeping )

675
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,360
Captain, there's an
unscheduled transport

676
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,571
taking place in
Transporter Room 3.

677
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,281
Find out what's going on.

678
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,241
The operator's not responding.

679
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,160
Computer,
who just left the ship?

680
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,703
COMPUTER:
<i>Kes and the Doctor.</i>

681
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,913
Try to hail them.

682
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,790
( console beeping )

683
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,416
No response.

684
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,294
And I can't get a fix
on their positions.

685
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,254
There's some kind
of scattering field.

686
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,841
Janeway to Chakotay.
Chakotay here, Captain.

687
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,384
JANEWAY:
<i>Kes and the Doctor</i>
<i>have left the ship.</i>

688
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,012
Captain, Tuvok here.

689
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,888
My tricorder scans
of the area

690
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,306
where Zahir
was assaulted

691
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,058
have revealed
disturbing evidence.

692
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,935
Residual holographic
signatures

693
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,478
exactly like those
of the Doctor.

694
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,064
<i>Are you suggesting</i>
<i>the Doctor attacked Zahir?</i>

695
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,816
That's what it looks like,
Captain.

696
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,193
Then Kes could be in danger...
and Torres.

697
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,821
Get someone from Security
down to Sick Bay.

698
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,532
Check on B'Elanna.
Try and find them, Chakotay.

699
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,118
I'll see what I can do
about the scattering field.

700
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,293
There must be a command
sequence, an algorithm,

701
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,047
a way to stabilize
the program.

702
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,548
Where's Nakahn?

703
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,759
We had an arrangement.

704
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,345
What's wrong with this thing?!
It won't work!

705
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,847
Don't. Please stop.

706
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,183
Concerned for me?

707
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,019
Or for your Doctor?

708
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,563
The mobile emitter
contains both your programs.

709
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,481
If you damage it,
you could both be destroyed.

710
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,400
There's not enough room
inside for both of us.

711
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,943
One must die.

712
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:21,239
I deserve to exist more
than your Doctor does.

713
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,241
Why?

714
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,410
I was born
of the hidden...

715
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,579
the suppressed.

716
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,498
I am the dark threads
from many personalities.

717
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,751
The historical characters?

718
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,878
None of whom could face
the darkness inside,

719
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,671
so they denied me...

720
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,464
suppressed me...

721
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,967
frightened of the truth.

722
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,595
What truth is that?

723
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,682
That darkness is more
fundamental than light,

724
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,477
cruelty before kindness,

725
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:55,356
evil more primary than good...

726
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:59,485
more deserving
of existence.

727
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,907
You're wrong.

728
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,409
No!

729
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,539
How so?

730
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:16,669
Empathy and kindness
are basic to all forms of life.

731
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,838
You have access to the Doctor's
medical knowledge.

732
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,090
You know what he does.

733
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,466
Yes.

734
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,010
Then you know
what I'm saying is true.

735
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,221
The very organs and cells
of the body

736
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,764
cooperate with each other.

737
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,515
Otherwise,
they wouldn't function.

738
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,478
Continue.

739
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,521
Families, societies,
cultures

740
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,065
wouldn't have evolved

741
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,359
without compassion
and tolerance.

742
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,238
They would have fallen
apart without it.

743
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,118
Your very own
holographic technology

744
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,368
would never have been developed

745
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,997
without cooperation
and understanding

746
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,832
between countless individuals.

747
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,002
The Doctor deserves to exist
as much as you do.

748
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:00,046
We can find a place
for both of you.

749
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,757
How?

750
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,509
NAKAHN:
I'm sorry I'm late.

751
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,138
The scout ship?

752
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,265
It won't even leave the ground.

753
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,557
What do you mean?

754
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,685
Captain Janeway
knows where you are.

755
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,645
Her ship has cordoned off
the entire area

756
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,064
to stop you from leaving.
No!

757
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,150
I still get paid.

758
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,442
I held up my end
of the deal.

759
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,902
I booked your passage.

760
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,989
It's not my fault
they want her back so badly--

761
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,742
I'll kill you.

762
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,078
If somebody's going
to die today,

763
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,913
it won't be me.

764
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,924
Let's go.

765
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,602
( tricorders beeping )

766
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,445
Move faster!

767
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,447
The docking port
is two kilometers away.

768
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,909
What's the point? You're
forgetting<i> Voyager's</i> blockade.

769
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,952
It doesn't matter.
We'll take a low-altitude ship

770
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,579
to another continent. Come on!

771
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,748
I'm tired.
You're trying to make it easier

772
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,624
for your colleagues
to find us.

773
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,959
You're better off with me.

774
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,420
Why?
You make wrong decisions.

775
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,547
You're too naive.

776
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,341
You need my guidance.

777
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,134
Don't you see what
you've been trying to do?

778
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,595
No more words! Now!

779
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,808
( tricorder beeping )

780
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,566
I'm picking up
residual infrared.

781
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,026
They could have
stopped here.

782
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,778
Kes could have rested
against this rock.

783
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,487
The signature
is consistent.

784
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,698
<i>Janeway to Chakotay.</i> 
Go ahead, Captain.

785
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,909
<i>I've gotten through</i>
<i>the Doctor's scattering field,</i>

786
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,202
not enough to beam them up yet,

787
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,037
but I've got a fix
on their position.

788
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,248
I'm downloading the coordinates
into Tuvok's tricorder.

789
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,458
<i>I'll keep working</i>
<i>on the scattering field.</i>

790
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,377
Acknowledged.

791
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,630
We're within
200 meters.

792
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,441
CHAKOTAY:
It's finished.

793
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,859
There's nowhere
to go now, Doctor.

794
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,987
Nowhere but down.

795
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,450
I'll do it.

796
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,789
His control over
the Doctor's matrix

797
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,916
appears to be
deteriorating.

798
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,545
If we can delay him...

799
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,714
Doctor, listen to me.

800
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,133
We can help you.

801
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,011
Create a new program matrix
just for you.

802
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,929
On the holodeck
or in Sick Bay,

803
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,139
wherever you want to be.

804
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,266
Just turn off
the scattering field.

805
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,892
Let us beam you
back to the ship.

806
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,188
You're trying to trick me.
Doctor, listen.

807
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,190
Think about all the things
you've said and done.

808
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,399
You don't want to kill me.

809
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,026
You've been trying
to protect me.

810
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,945
What are you
talking about?

811
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,573
When you attacked Zahir...

812
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,826
My first victim.
He was in my way.

813
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,329
Or was it to keep me
from leaving with him?

814
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,913
A coincidence,
only by chance.

815
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,540
When I walked in on
you in the holodeck,

816
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,667
you could have killed me,
knocked me unconscious.

817
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,002
I needed a hostage.

818
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,545
You said you were taking
me for my own good

819
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,381
to prevent me from
making the wrong decision.

820
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:30,965
You said I was naive
and needed your help.

821
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,758
That's not what you
say to a hostage.

822
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,886
In your own way, you've
been trying to protect me.

823
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,637
I won't accept that.

824
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,431
You've twisted
and suppressed

825
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,517
all that's good inside of you,
but it's still there.

826
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,977
No! I won't hear
this anymore!

827
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,729
You can't deny it.

828
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:45,938
Watch me!

829
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,066
Doctor...
No!

830
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,786
Would somebody care
to tell me

831
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,498
exactly what we're
all doing here?

832
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,958
And why I'm wearing
these ridiculous clothes?

833
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,793
Kim to Bridge. We got them.

834
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,962
And the Doctor seems
to be back to normal.

835
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,006
Acknowledged.

836
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,133
Put those down
before someone gets hurt

837
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,718
and I have
to clean up the mess.

838
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,600
I've deleted all the new
subroutines you added.

839
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,771
All traces of the aberrant
personality are gone.

840
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,689
The next time I want
to enrich myself,

841
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,233
I'll download a good book.

842
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,193
That might be safer.

843
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,987
You too have a clean
bill of health.

844
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,323
Fortunately, my alter ego
didn't do any...

845
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,741
permanent harm.

846
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,369
He certainly knew his way
around a hypospray.

847
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,788
I'll give him that.
Good riddance.

848
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,541
Thank you, Lieutenant.

849
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,585
You're welcome.

850
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,963
Kes.

851
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,090
I'm ready to get to work
on those analyses.

852
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,716
I'm glad to hear it.

853
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,053
I'm also pleased you've decided
to remain on board.

854
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,474
I would have had my hands full
in Sick Bay without you.

855
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,100
The Captain suggested

856
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,603
that I consider
all the consequences.

857
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,729
If I am going through
changes in my life,

858
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,689
things that are
unpredictable,

859
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,609
this is the best
place for me.

860
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,819
Surrounded by those
who know you...

861
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,196
and...

862
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,531
care for you.

863
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,408
Yes.

864
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,243
Well, had you decided otherwise,

865
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,121
you certainly
would have been missed.

866
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,624
I would have missed you too,
Doctor.

867
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,348
"I swear this oath
by Apollo Physician,

868
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,308
"by Aesculapius, by Health,

869
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,561
"and by all the gods
and goddesses...

870
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,272
"In whatsoever place
that I enter,

871
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,609
"I will enter to help the sick
and heal the injured.

872
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:59,071
And I will do no harm."
