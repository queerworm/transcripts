00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,796
[Doctor]<i> In the beginning,</i>
<i>there is darkness,</i>

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,633
<i>the emptiness of a matrix</i>
<i>waiting for the light.</i>

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,178
<i>Then, a single photon</i>
<i>flares into existence.</i>

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>Then another.</i>

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,350
<i>Soon, thousands more.</i>
<i>Optronic pathways connect,</i>

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,186
<i>subroutines emerge</i>
<i>from the chaos,</i>

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:23,065
<i>and a holographic consciousness</i>
<i>is born.</i>

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,528
<i>I awaken into this world</i>
<i>fully programmed,</i>

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,196
<i>yet completely innocent,</i>

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>unaware of the hardships</i>
<i>I'll endure,</i>

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,452
<i>or the great potential</i>
<i>I will one day fulfill.</i>

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,416
Computer, save revisions
and open Chapter One.

13
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,988
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54732.3.</i>

14
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,908
<i>It's been three weeks since we received</i>
<i>Starfleet's instructions</i>

15
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,409
<i>in the last datastream,</i>

16
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,745
<i>and we're finally ready</i>
<i>to begin "Operation Watson."</i>

17
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,705
<i>We're all holding our breath.</i>

18
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,166
-The deflector's in position.
-Anything?

19
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,585
I'm picking up
a phased tachyon beam.

20
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,587
[Seven] There's a triaxilating signal
encoded in it.

21
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,130
On screen.

22
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,174
<i>Voyager, this is Lieutenant Barclay</i>
<i>at Starfleet Command.</i>

23
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,968
<i>-Are you receiving this?</i>
-Can you clear it up?

24
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,553
I'm on it.

25
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,642
<i>Captain Janeway, it's a pleasure</i>
<i>to finally talk to you in person.</i>

26
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,103
The pleasure's mine, Admiral.

27
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,896
How's the weather
in San Francisco?

28
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>Cold and rainy, as usual.</i>

29
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,276
It sounds delightful.
Lieutenant Barclay,

30
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,781
my congratulations on establishing
the first transgalactic com-link.

31
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,783
You've earned a place
in the history books.

32
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,743
<i>I can't take all</i>
<i>of the credit, Captain.</i>

33
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,746
<i>It was Harry and Seven who suggested</i>
<i>bouncing a tachyon beam</i>

34
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,164
<i>off of the quantum singularity.</i>

35
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,667
Just be sure to thank us
when you accept the Daystrom Prize.

36
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,961
<i>I wish we had more time</i>
<i>for small talk,</i>

37
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,255
<i>but the singularity</i>
<i>only stays in alignment</i>

38
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,840
<i>for 11 minutes a day.</i>

39
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,009
Eleven minutes are better
than none, Admiral.

40
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,011
We appreciate all your work, Reg.

41
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,722
<i>We're going to leave it up to you</i>

42
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,765
<i>to determine how to allocate</i>
<i>the com time.</i>

43
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,018
<i>Admiral, um...</i>
<i>there was something else.</i>

44
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,689
<i>Oh, yes, uh, Mr. Barclay</i>
<i>has arranged a small gift</i>

45
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,066
<i>for you and your crew.</i>

46
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,612
<i>This is a live image</i>
<i>from McKinley Station.</i>

47
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,908
<i>Uh, not too much cloud cover</i>
<i>over North America today.</i>

48
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,829
Quite a view.

49
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,831
Thank you, Reg.

50
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:14,755
In my hat, I hold 146 sequentially
numbered isolinear chips--

51
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,257
one for every member
of the crew.

52
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,760
Each chip entitles the bearer

53
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,554
to three minutes
of uninterrupted com time

54
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,766
with his loved ones
back in the Alpha Quadrant.

55
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,059
Good luck.

56
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,853
My mom's birthday
is next week.

57
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,897
This could be the best present
I ever gave her.

58
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,273
Who's everyone else calling?

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,608
I'll be calling my sister.

60
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,902
-What about you, Captain?
-My mother, I hope.

61
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,612
Doesn't anyone want to know
who I'm calling?

62
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,863
Wait, wait.
Let me guess.

63
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,200
Um... Reg Barclay
or Dr. Zimmerman.

64
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,118
What makes you so certain
it's either of them?

65
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,453
Ah, number six.

66
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,788
The lowest one yet.

67
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,248
You'll be talking to your family
the day after tomorrow.

68
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,584
One hundred and thirty.

69
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,795
That's about a month
and a half from now.

70
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,129
So much for Mom's birthday.

71
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,924
Apparently, the line forms here.

72
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,302
-[Tuvok] Congratulations.
-Doc, how about a trade?

73
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,805
I'm willing to throw
in some Holodeck time.

74
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,641
Come on. It would mean
a lot to my mother.

75
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,144
I wish I could help, but I have
a very important call to make.

76
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,647
Here. Give your mom my best.

77
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,981
Are you sure?

78
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,109
I've waited this long.
What's another six weeks?

79
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,574
<i>I can hear the critics already</i>
<i>"A new voice has arrived."</i>

80
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:29,246
<i>You could be the next K'Ratak,</i>
<i>or a modern-day Tolstoy.</i>

81
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,290
<i>I'd like to start distribution</i>
<i>by the end of the month.</i>

82
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,044
Uh, the material I sent
was only a working draft.

83
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,754
I need time to make revisions.

84
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,632
<i>Well, if you insist,</i>
<i>but please do it quickly.</i>

85
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,467
I will.

86
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,761
So tell me...

87
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,304
what did you think
of the characters?

88
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,348
<i>Oh, they're very real--</i>
<i>compelling.</i>

89
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,434
<i>I almost forgot</i>
<i>they were holograms.</i>

90
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,270
Who was your favorite?

91
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,772
<i>Without a doubt,</i>
<i>that would have to be Lieutenant...</i>

92
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,440
What happened?

93
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,776
Your time has expired.

94
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,445
You could've let the man
finish his sentence.

95
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,949
I believe your ego has received
enough stroking for one day.

96
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,828
[whistling upbeat melody]

97
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,830
So, how's Reg?

98
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,791
I'll have you know I was speaking
with Ardon Broht

99
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,168
of Broht &amp; Forrester.

100
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,879
The publishers
of the<i> Dixon Hill</i> series?

101
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,716
Mm-hmm. Who are now
about to publish my work.

102
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,301
It seems you're not
the only one aboard

103
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,469
with a flair
for holographic narratives.

104
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,305
[chuckles]
Well, congratulations.

105
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,472
Thank you.

106
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,143
So, what's it about?

107
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,688
The adventures
of an intrepid doctor.

108
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,481
Oh, sounds like fun.

109
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,027
You know, I've never thought
about trying to get my work published.

110
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,863
Maybe I could talk to your people
about<i> Captain Proton.</i>

111
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,949
Broht &amp; Forrester deals in...
sophisticated literature.

112
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,076
What are you saying,
that I'm lowbrow?

113
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,830
Not at all. I'd be delighted
to talk to them.

114
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,999
Ah. Thanks.

115
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,628
So, when do I get to see this opus?

116
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,963
Well, it's not ready yet.

117
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,633
It was ready enough
for Broht &amp; Forrester.

118
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,011
Maybe it could use
a fresh pair of eyes.

119
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,305
After all,
you are a fellow author.

120
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,182
I'll cover the rest
of your shift.

121
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,978
Oh, I almost forgot.

122
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,647
What's it called?

123
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,483
<i>Photons Be Free.</i>

124
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,069
Catchy.

125
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,364
[Doctor]<i> I awaken into this world</i>

126
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,575
<i>fully programmed,</i>
<i>yet completely innocent,</i>

127

128
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:37,499
<i>or the great potential</i>

129
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,461
Ah... welcome.

130
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,713
You've made an excellent choice.

131
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,300
You're about to take part in a thrilling
first-person narrative.

132
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,720
You will take on the role
of an Emergency Medical Hologram,

133
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,640
the Chief Medical Officer
aboard the Starship<i> Vortex.</i>

134
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,183
<i>Vortex?!</i>

135
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,187
As our story begins,
an anomaly has hurled your ship

136
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,772
thousands of light-years
across the galaxy.

137
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:01,982
Your mission?

138
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,067
To uphold your medical
and ethical standards

139
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:08,571
as you struggle against the crew's
bigotry and intolerance.

140
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,407
Persons with vascular disorders
should consult

141
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,158
a physician before running this program.

142
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,744
And now, a few acknowledgments.

143
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,496
First, Dr. Lewis Zimmerman,

144
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,249
the creator of my holo-matrix,
whose foresight

145
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,042
and dedication have made it
possible for me...

146
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,504
Computer, freeze program.
How much longer is this introduction?

147
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,257
-[computer] Nine minutes, four seconds.
-[sighs]

148
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,759
Skip to the first chapter.

149
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,012
[Doctor] Chapter One
<i>"A Healer is Born,"</i>

150
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,306
<i>in which our protagonist</i>
<i>must make a difficult choice.</i>

151
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,853
[woman] Increase the resonance level,
20 percent.

152
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,021
Are you the EMH?

153
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,772
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

154
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,733
Our doctor's dead.
We've got wounded.

155
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,193
They're both badly hurt.
Who should we treat first?

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,403
Uh...

157
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,365
Second degree plasma burns.

158
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,077
He's got an aortic rupture.

159
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,413
Get him to the Surgical Bay now.

160
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,751
You! Over here.

161
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,671
Whew.

162
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,846
-Nice mustache.
-What?

163
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,973
Uh, nothing.

164
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,311
He's got a mild concussion.

165
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,022
I'm going to have to treat
the others first.

166
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,024
I need Lieutenant Marseilles
on the Bridge.

167
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,817
-You'll treat him now.
-As I understand it,

168
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,653
my job is to treat
the critical patients first.

169
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,155
So, if you'll excuse me...

170
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,076
I don't know who you think
you are, Hologram,

171
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,328
but to me, you're just
another piece of technology.

172
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,664
Well, apparently, I'm a piece
of technology that's in demand,

173
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,874
so why don't you
go back to the Bridge

174
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,376
and let me do my job?

175
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,253
What's going on here?

176
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,923
Our medical hologram
is refusing to treat Mr. Marseilles.

177
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,844
-Are you malfunctioning?
-I don't think so.

178
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,013
I need my helmsman
back at his station.

179
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,182
Lieutenant Marseilles
isn't seriously hurt.

180
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,018
This man will be dead
in five minutes if I don't operate.

181
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,562
Drop the force field.

182
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,993
That patient is dead.

183
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,454
Now you're free to treat
Lieutenant Marseilles.

184
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,798
Then the Captain
pulls out a phaser

185
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,217
and shoots him,
right there on the bio-bed.

186
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,302
Captain Janeway
murders a crewman?

187
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,929
[Paris] No, Captain Jenkins.

188
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,305
Everybody has a different name.

189
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:44,269
You're Kymble, you're Torrey,
and I am Lieutenant Marseilles.

190
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,937
Oh, now, that's creative.

191
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,313
What did you say to the Doctor?

192
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,232
Well, he thinks
he's written a masterpiece.

193
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,608
I didn't know what to tell him.

194
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,694
If this gets distributed,

195
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,779
people are going to assume
this is about us.

196
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,322
What are our families
going to think?

197
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,616
This is a Starfleet ship.
No one will believe

198
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,411
we actually go around
shooting injured crewmen.

199
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,581
People may not take
the program literally,

200
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,584
but they might wonder
if there's some truth to it.

201
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,628
[sighs] I think we should
talk to the Captain.

202
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,090
Are you sure you're not taking this
a little personally?

203
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,633
What do you mean?

204
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,845
Well, the Holodeck
always has been your domain.

205
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,432
[disbelieving laugh]
You--you think I'm jealous?

206
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,558
[chuckling]

207
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,977
Okay, maybe I am overreacting.

208
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,645
Why don't the rest of you
try the program

209
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,230
and decide for yourselves?

210
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,194
[Doctor]<i> Chapter Five</i>

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,571
<i>"Out of the Frying Pan,"</i>
<i>in which our protagonist</i>

212
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,032
<i>must confront abusive colleagues.</i>

213
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,034
I'm here for my physical.

214
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,912
Why don't you have a seat
over here?

215
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,167
Doctor, you better
get down to Engineering.

216
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,335
What's wrong?

217
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,879
A plasma conduit just exploded.

218
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,797
At least ten people are hurt.

219
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,346
Hey, genius.

220
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,223
Forgetting something?

221
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,558
Your mobile emitter?

222
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,769
Oh, right.

223
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,481
I don't see it.

224
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,611
That's my mobile emitter?

225
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,119
[grunts]
This thing must weigh 50 kilos.

226
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,163
You should be glad we let you
out of your cage at all.

227
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,540
Now, get going.

228
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,125
[sighing]

229
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,091
I'm impressed.

230
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,009
-Really?
-Absolutely.

231
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,513
I haven't seen a dilithium matrix
this far out of alignment

232
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,474
since I served aboard
a Ferengi garbage scow.

233
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,018
I'll fix it myself.

234
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,645
Excuse me.

235
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,814
How many times have I told you?

236
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,900
Engineering is off-limits
to holograms.

237
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,736
Maybe you should waive
that restriction during emergencies.

238
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,949
A plasma conduit exploded?

239
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,244
Does it look like anyone here
is covered with plasma burns?

240
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,914
Lieutenant Par... uh, Marseilles
told me there was an accident.

241
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,959
Looks like your auditory subroutines
are malfunctioning... again.

242
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,421
I'm surprised a matrix as primitive
as yours can function at all.

243
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,841
Maybe you should be a little
nicer to your shipmates.

244
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,010
You never know
when you might need their help.

245
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,345
Get one thing straight.
You're not one of my shipmates.

246
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,764
You're a tool--
like this hyperspanner--

247
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,932
and tools can be replaced.

248
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,517
So, why don't you go back
to Sick Bay

249
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,353
before I start doing
a little reprogramming?

250
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,652
[soft, passionate moaning]

251
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,404
Computer, lights.

252
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,864
[startled grunts]

253
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,451
Didn't I tell you
to go to Engineering?

254
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,037
Oh, I get it.

255
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,248
Interesting plot twist.
You get me out of Sick Bay,

256
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,500
so you're free to give
my patient a tonsillectomy.

257
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,462
If you even think about
mentioning this to my wife,

258
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,798
I will purge your memory buffer.
Do we understand each other?

259
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,469
I'm here for my physical?

260
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,683
[Doctor]<i> Chapter Six</i>
<i>"Duel in the Ready Room,"</i>

261
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,436
<i>in which our protagonist</i>

262
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,314
This time, you've gone too far.

263
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,859
Captain, I'm not sure
what you mean.

264
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,989
An inventory
of your holo-matrix.

265
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:29,202
50 gigaquads of memory
devoted to music,

266
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,287
42 for "daydreams,"

267
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,166
another ten
to expand your sexuality.

268
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,170
I had no idea
holograms could do that.

269
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,131
These extracurricular subroutines
don't belong

270
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,468
as part of
an Emergency Medical Hologram.

271
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,721
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

272
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,141
Uh, well, uh, of course I do.

273
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,561
I don't think these subroutines
are trivial, Captain.

274
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,022
They help make me
a better doctor

275
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,733
-and a better person.
-But you're not a person.

276
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,152
You may be programmed
to look and act human,

277
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,862
but that doesn't make you one.

278
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,907
These subroutines are going
to be deleted immediately.

279
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,617
Mr. Tulak.

280
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,166
Take the EMH to the Holo-Lab

283
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,847
I'm not sure we should

284
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,557
Listen to him,
he knows what he's talking about.

285
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,184
Quiet!
I'm not talking to you.

286
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,228
If we start tinkering
with his matrix,

287
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,230
how do we know we won't
accidentally delete

288
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,857

[chuckling]

290
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,194
You afraid you'll catch something
on your next away mission, Ensign?

291
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,864
There must be millions of viruses
in this Quadrant

292
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,866
that no one's ever encountered before.

293
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,910
With my luck, I'll probably end up
catching half of them.

294
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,496
Great, my character's
a hypochondriac.

295
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,874
I'll escort the prisoner from here.

296
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,710
Our orders are to take him
to the Holo-Lab.

297
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,421
I've been ordered
to perform the procedure.

298
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:08,217
Your sympathies for the EMH
are no secret, Three of Eight.

299
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,639
Step aside.

300
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,530

305
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,755
[Jenkins] I've tried to do this
the easy way,

306
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,965
but it's clear you're not going
to be reasonable.

307
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,676
Your matrix will be decompiled
and reinitialized.

308
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,804
You'll remain off-line
except for emergencies.

309
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,264
Ready.

310
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,766
Do it.

311
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,309
[Three] Wait.

312
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,522
He has the right
to expand his program.

313
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,441
He's a piece of technology.

314
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,776
He has no rights.

315
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,277
But he should.

316
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,780
One day, the EMH
and others like him

317
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,115
will be recognized
for what they are--

318
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,077
intelligent individuals
with a passion for life.

319
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,579
Make no mistake, Captain--

320
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,332
we may be thousands
of light-years from home,

321
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,919
but one day, people will learn of
the crime you're committing here today.

322
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,297
Nice speech.

323
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,216
Now decompile the program.

324
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,686
What you've experienced,
dear protagonist,

325
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,437
is a work of fiction.

326
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,275
But like all fiction,
it has elements of truth.

327
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,443
I hope you now have
a better understanding

328
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,446
of the struggles
holograms must endure

329
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,782
in a world controlled...

330
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,867
by organics.

331
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,037
[computer] End of program.

332
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,874
Janeway to the Doctor.

333
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,669
Report to my ready room now.

334
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,009
How many times
do you want me to say it?

335
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,177
My work is not
about the<i> Voyager</i> crew.

336
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,014
Come on. Ensign Kymble,
Lieutenant Marseilles...

337
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,100
The characters look
almost exactly like us.

338
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,686
I used your physical parameters
as a starting point,

339
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,732
but I assure you any further similarities
are purely coincidental.

340
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,193
You set your story on a starship
lost in the Delta Quadrant.

341
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,070
What would you have me
write about?

342
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,781
Palace intrigue
on the Klingon Homeworld?

343
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,868
I do what all good novelists do.
I write what I know.

344
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,037
So, it is about<i> Voyager?</i>

345
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,246
No.

346
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,123
The<i> Vortex</i> characters
are larger than life.

347
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,460
They're nothing like our crew.
As far as I know, Captain,

348
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,087
you haven't executed
any of my patients.

349
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,091
Doctor, you've written
a very imaginative story,

350
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,303
but it's conceivable that people
will think it's based on fact.

351
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,138
I don't see how.

352
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,098
How many holograms
carry mobile emitters?

353
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,352
The emitter in my story
is nothing like the real one.

354
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,978
Yeah, what was the point of that?

355
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,314
It was like carrying around
a small shuttlecraft.

356
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,109
It's a metaphor, a symbol of the burdens
that I live with every day.

357
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,237
Imagine having to take this
everywhere you go.

358
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,616
It would be a constant reminder
that you're different from everyone else.

359
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,995
I wanted the player to feel
the weight of it... literally.

360
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,624
Your emitter isn't a ball and chain.
It liberates you.

361
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,002
It doesn't always feel that way.

362
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,004
If I didn't know better,
I'd think this story

363
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,340
was written by someone
who feels oppressed.

364
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,676
Is that how
you see yourself, Doctor?

365
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,594
Of course not.

366
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,014
The real victims are my brothers
in the Alpha Quadrant.

367
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,182
Brothers?

368
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,351
Hundreds of EMH Mark-1's,

369
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,646
identical to me
in every respect, except...

370
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,649
they've been condemned
to a menial existence--

371
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,734
scrubbing conduits,

372
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,986
mining dilithium.

373
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,905
There's a long history

374
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,409
of writers drawing attention
to the plight of the oppressed.

375
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,453
<i>The Vedek's Song,</i> for example tells
the story of the occupation of Bajor.

376
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,331
I understand you have your reasons
for writing this,

377
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,751
but you should consider how it's going
to make your friends feel.

378
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,260
I'm sorry my work offends you,

379
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,846
but if the price
of expressing myself

380
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,765
is having to suffer the scorn
of a few colleagues...

381
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,933
so be it.

No.

You know very well

463
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,791
You accessed my holonovel
without permission

464
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,210

your own hackneyed narrative.

Hey, I'm just writing
what I know.

466
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,048

Relax, Doc.

468
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,302
I saved your program
in a backup file,

469
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,721
but I was just trying
to make a point.

470
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,224
Well, you made it with a typical
lack of subtlety.

471

Oh, you're one to talk!

472
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,437
Your program's about as subtle
as a Ferengi mating dance.

473
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,731
My program is a serious attempt
at social commentary.

474
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,234
Yours is an insulting farce!
You...

475
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,862

ran that program

479
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,333
and thought that it was based on you?
That would bother you, wouldn't it?

480
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,253
-I don't care what people think.
-That's all you care about!

481
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,840
You want everyone back home to think
of you as a brilliant author.

482
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,759
I'm not doing this for my ego,
and if you could look past yours,

483
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,428
maybe you'd see that!

if the whole Alpha Quadrant

for Lieutenant Marseilles.

487
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,984
What bothers me is that you think
that's what I'm like.

488
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,569
Obviously, you're nothing like Marseilles.

489
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:33,073
-He's self-indulgent, immature.
-And how would you describe me?

00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,454
Well, you're a married man
with a child on the way.

491
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,913
A lot of responsibilities.

492
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,416

You know, I thought
I'd begun to earn your respect.

494
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,714

It was a rousing adventure,

512
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,768
with an important message, too.

513
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,269
Exactly.

514
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,313
This is my first chance
to be appreciated,

515
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,440
not just as a physician,
but as an artist.

516
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,275
I thought the crew
would be happy for me.

517
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,985
You're going to reach
a wide audience.

518
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,239
What do you care about the opinions
of a few disgruntled shipmates?

519
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,615
They're my friends.

520
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,409
I don't want to hurt them.

521
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,413
There's an old Talaxian expression:

522
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,750
"When the road before you
splits in two,

523
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,669
take the third path."

524
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,464
Meaning?

525
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,134
You could make some adjustments
to the program,

526
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,137
so it won't be so obvious
it's based on<i> Voyager.</i>

527
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,391
I suppose I could change the setting,

528
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,642
alter the characters' physical parameters.

529
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,354
You wouldn't have
to change your theme.

530
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,481
No.

531
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,441
But a rewrite could take weeks.

532
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,695
My publisher is expecting
a final draft tomorrow.

533
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,072
Maybe you should give him a call.

534
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,661
<i>Revisions?</i>

535
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,372
I need to rework the characters.

536
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,833
<i>Why?</i>
<i>They're so believable.</i>

537
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,834
[anxious laugh]

538
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,503
A little too believable,
apparently.

539
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,089
<i>Doctor, I-I really don't think</i>
<i>this is necessary.</i>

540
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,884
I'm afraid I have to insist.

541
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,011
My friends' reputations
are at stake.

542
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,888
<i>[sighs]</i>

543
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,849
My publisher assures me
he won't distribute the program

544
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,435
until he receives
the revised version.

545
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,395
That must be the one
where we assimilate the Borg

546
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,272
and take over the Quadrant.

547
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,860
We're all grateful that you're taking
our feelings into account.

548
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,154
So, how long do you expect
the revisions will take?

549
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,615
Art can't be rushed.

550
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,409
Take your time, Doctor.

551
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,039
-Lieutenant.
-Hmm?

552
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,332
I'm sorry.

553
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,958
Oh. Forget about it.

554
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,044
I could use your help
with the rewrites.

555
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,337
Really?

556
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,007
Well, you realize, as a writer,
I'm a little unsophisticated.

557
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,594
No, I believe the phrase
you're looking for is lowbrow.

558
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,934
Hey.

559
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,936
What's that?

560
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,356
It's from my father.

561
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,733
He wants to talk.

562
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,236
What are you gonna do?

563
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,738
Well, I've already arranged
to talk with my cousin.

564
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,533
Well, I'm sure she wouldn't mind
waiting a few weeks.

565
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,827
I wouldn't know
what to say to him.

566
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,746
Then let him do the talking.

567
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,459
<i>Look at you.</i>

568
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,878
<i>You must be, what, 20 weeks along?</i>

569
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,964
23, actually.

570
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,633
<i>Have you decided on a name?</i>

571
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,052
Not yet.

572
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,805
We were thinking about Miral.

573
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,516
<i>Your mother would've liked that.</i>

574
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,312
<i>You know, I had some business</i>
<i>on Kessik IV a few months ago.</i>

575
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,315
<i>You wouldn't believe</i>
<i>what our old house looks like.</i>

576
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,734
Lieutenant... 30 seconds.

577
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,988
We have less than a minute.

578
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,407
Is there a reason
you wanted to talk?

579
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,662
<i>I know I can't make up for 20 years</i>
<i>in one conversation.</i>

580
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,748
<i>The truth is...</i>

581
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,335
<i>when your ship disappeared,</i>

582
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,546
<i>I thought I'd lost you.</i>

583
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,673
<i>I don't expect you to forgive me,</i>

584
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,760
<i>but maybe we could try</i>
<i>to get to know each other again.</i>

585
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,762
[alarm chiming]

586
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,557
I'll write you.

587
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,697
[doors open, close]

588
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,874
I'm sorry to disturb you, Admiral.

589
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,792
Uh, yes, Mr. Barclay.
What can I do for you?

590
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,211
I thought you'd want
to see this, sir.

591
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,130
Well, what is it?

592
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,341
It's, um, a holonovel

593
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,967
that's becoming quite popular.

594
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,886
Well, I appreciate
the gesture, Lieutenant,

595
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:49,514
but I don't share your affinity
for holographic diversions.

596
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,640
You don't understand, sir.

597
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,893
This program...
it's about<i> Voyager,</i>

598
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,980
and it doesn't portray the crew
in a very flattering light.

599
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,816
Hmm.

600
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,151
[Janeway] On screen.

601
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,319
[Admiral]<i> Captain.</i>

602
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,988
Seven told me
your message was urgent.

603
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:08,033
<i>I had the dubious privilege</i>
<i>of playing a new holonovel,</i>

604
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,285
<i>apparently written by your EMH.</i>

605
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,996
<i>I'm surprised that you</i>
<i>would allow the Doctor</i>

606
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,748
<i>to discredit your crew like this.</i>

607
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,958
He's still making revisions.

608
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,669
The program shouldn't
have been distributed yet.

609
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,962
<i>Well, it has been.</i>

610
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,923
<i>Mr. Barclay tells me</i>
<i>it's already being played</i>

611
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,175
<i>in thousands of holosuites.</i>

612
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,101
You assured me you
were going to wait for my revisions.

613
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:38,021
I demand that you recall every copy
and issue a public apology

614
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,398
to Captain Janeway and her crew.

615
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,025
<i>I won't do anything of the sort.</i>

616
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,528
I don't see that you
have a choice, Mr. Broht.

617
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,279
Authors have rights.

618
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,073
<i>Not in this case.</i>

619
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,574
What do you mean?

620
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,285
<i>The Doctor is a hologram.</i>

621
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,787
So?

622
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:59,000
<i>According to Federation law,</i>
<i>holograms have no rights.</i>

623
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,428
Under a strict interpretation
of Federation law,

624
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,223
Mr. Broht is correct.
The Doctor has no legal rights.

625
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,724
Because I'm a hologram.

626
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,309
Yes.

627
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,645
There is another option.

628
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,397
We may be able to claim
that the holonovel

629
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,399
reveals classified information.

630
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:26,111
Starfleet could then request that
it be recalled for security purposes.

631
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,238
Oh, great idea, a cover-up,

632
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,615
and then everyone will be convinced
that it's a true story.

633
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,492
Could we claim defamation?

634
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,412
Well, we'd have to prove
that the story's about us

635
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,746
and that we've been harmed by it.

636
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,709
We might win on those grounds,
but what about the Doctor?

637
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,294
What about me, Captain?

638
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,838
It's the crew's reputations
that are at risk.

639
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,965
I'm not so sure.

640
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,427
I think it's your reputation
that's on the line here.

641
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:54,222
You have the same rights as
every other member of this crew,

642
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,933
and I'm not going to let
this publisher say otherwise.

643
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:05,025
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54748.6.</i>

644
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,944
<i>A Federation Arbitrator</i>
<i>has been assigned to determine</i>

645
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,740
<i>whether the Doctor has the right</i>
<i>to control his artistic creation.</i>

646
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,867
<i>Because of our limited com time</i>
<i>with Earth,</i>

647
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,953
<i>the argument should take</i>
<i>about three days.</i>

648
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,289
<i>You claim the Doctor</i>
<i>doesn't have the legal right</i>

649
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,041
<i>to control this holoprogram.</i>

650
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,211
<i>Yet you're promoting the fact</i>
<i>that</i> Voyager's<i> EMH wrote it.</i>

651
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,463
Our most successful children's title

652
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,966
is a program "written by"
Toby the Targ.

653
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,302
Fortunately, Toby
hasn't tried to stop me

654
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,138
from distributing any of his work.

655
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,974
But you don't deny that the Doctor
is the creator of this holonovel?

656
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:43,063
No, but, uh, a replicator
created this cup of coffee.

657
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,482
Should that replicator
be able to determine

658
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,234
whether or not I can drink it?

659
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,194
-I object!
-Doctor...

660
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,696
An intriguing analogy, Mr. Broht,

661
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,907
but I have never
encountered a replicator

662
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,827
that could compose music,
or paint landscapes,

663
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,831
or perform microsurgery.
Have you?

664
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,542
Would you say
that you have a reputation

665
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,836
for publishing respected,
original works of literature?

666
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,547
I'd like to think so.

667
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,383
<i>And is the Doctor's holonovel</i>
<i>such a work?</i>

668
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,886
Actually, some aspects of it
are quite derivative.

669
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,347
[Tuvok] Has there even been
another work written

670
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,432
about a hologram's struggle for equality?

671
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,143
Uh, not that I know of,
but, uh...

672
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,563
Then, in that respect,
it is original?

673
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,525
I suppose so.

674
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:32,445
Your Honor, Section Seven Gamma
of the Twelfth Guarantee

675
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,491
defines an artist as a "person who creates
an original artistic work."

676
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,953
Mr. Broht admits that the Doctor
created this program

677
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,081
and that it is original.
I therefore submit

678
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,834
that the Doctor should be entitled
to all rights and privileges

679
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,461
accorded an artist
under the law.

680
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,009
<i>[sighs] You've made a persuasive</i>
<i>argument, Commander,</i>

681
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,761
<i>but there's a flaw in your logic.</i>

682
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,014
<i>As you point out, the law says</i>

683
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,601
<i>that the creator of an artistic work</i>
<i>must be a "person."</i>

684
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,270
<i>Your EMH doesn't meet</i>
<i>that criteria.</i>

685
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,688
[static grows louder]

686
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,524
[Barclay]<i> Sir, we're losing the link.</i>

687
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,985
<i>This hearing is in recess</i>
<i>until tomorrow.</i>

688
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,116
We're not doing well.

689
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,535
Is that your considered
legal opinion?

690
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,871
I'm sorry.

691
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,165
It's just frustrating
to be told I have

692
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,250
no more legal standing
than a replicator.

693
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,129
[Tuvok] If the Doctor doesn't have
the right to control his own work,

694
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,173
then it stands to reason
he never had the right

695
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,383
to enter into an agreement
with Mr. Broht.

696
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,803
We could argue that
the original contract is invalid.

697
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,181
In other words,
you want to concede

698
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,516
that the Doctor isn't a person.

699
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,226
What we need to do...

700
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,856
is prove that he is just as much
a person as any of us.

701
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,858
How do we do that?

702
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,027
By telling your real life story.

703
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,533
<i>Because I was having difficulty</i>
<i>interacting with the crew,</i>

704
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,410
<i>the Doctor gave me social lessons.</i>

705
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,205
<i>First, he taught me</i>
<i>how to make conversation.</i>

706
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,165
Later, how to dance.

707
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,209
Eventually, he showed me

708
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:12,003
how to express romantic interest.

709
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,715
<i>Without his guidance, I wouldn't be</i>
<i>the person I am today.</i>

710
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,927
He decided it wasn't enough
to be just a doctor.

711
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,888
So he added command subroutines
to his matrix,

712
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,390
and now, in an emergency,

713
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,767
he's as capable
as any Bridge officer.

714
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,270
That only proves the Doctor's program
can be modified.

715
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,481
<i>Your Honor, I think it shows</i>
<i>he has a desire</i>

716
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:35,026
<i>to become more than he is,</i>
<i>just like any other person.</i>

717
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,112
He traveled halfway
across the galaxy

718
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,990
to care for Lewis Zimmerman,
the man who created his program.

719
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,158
It was like a son

720
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,412
who wanted to show his father
what he'd become,

721
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,497
so the old man
would be proud of him,

722
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:51,167
and if you ask me... he was.

723
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,253
<i>I'd made myself clear,</i>

724
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,548
<i>but the Doctor disobeyed</i>
<i>my direct orders.</i>

725
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,051
<i>In the process,</i>
<i>he endangered the ship and crew.</i>

726
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,721
That's hardly commendable behavior.

727
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,516
No, it wasn't,
but it was human.

728
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,270
<i>Starfleet had programmed him</i>
<i>to follow orders.</i>

729
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,939
The fact that he was capable
of doing otherwise

730
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,859
proves that he can think
for himself.

731
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,778
[Janeway]<i> Your Honor,</i>

732
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,823
centuries ago,
in most places on Earth,

733
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,326
only landowners
of a particular gender and race

734
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,287
had any rights at all.

735
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:31,082
Over time, those rights
were extended to all humans,

736
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,793
and later,
as we explored the galaxy,

737
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,546
to thousands
of other sentient species.

738
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,884
Our definition of what
constitutes a person

739
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,052
has continued to evolve.

740
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,390
Now, we're asking that you expand
that definition once more...

741
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,601
to include our Doctor.

742
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,979
When I met him seven years ago,
I would never have believed

743
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:56,733
that an EMH could become
a valued member of my crew...

744
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,277
and my friend.

745
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,697
The Doctor is a person

746
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,618
as real as any flesh and blood
I have ever known.

747
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,579
<i>If you believe the testimony</i>
<i>you've heard here,</i>

748
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:14,375
it's only fair to conclude that he has
the same rights as any of us.

749
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,966
You'll have my decision
in two days.

750
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,385
<i>This hearing is in recess.</i>

751
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,817
When you sing<i> Happy Birthday</i>
to your mother,

752
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,486
-try to stay in tune.
-What's this?

753
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,571
An isolinear chip
entitling the bearer

754
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,782
to three minutes
of com time tomorrow.

755
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,993
You made it clear how important it was
to finish your conversation.

756
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,496
I overreacted.

757
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,041
I understand why you did.

758
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,293
I've been observing the crew
interacting with their families

759
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,128
over the past few days.

760
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,841
It's become clear to me how meaningful
that communication can be.

761
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,472
Thanks, but I can't accept this.

762
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,015
Why not?

763
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,142
You should contact
your own family.

764
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,645
My parents were assimilated.

765
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,313
Well, there must be someone.

766
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,232
A distant relative?

767
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,987
My father has a sister
on Earth... Irene Hansen.

768
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,907
I'm sure she'd be thrilled
to hear from you.

769
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,163
<i>You can imagine my reaction</i>

770
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,083
<i>when Starfleet told me</i>
<i>to expect your call.</i>

771
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,628
I experienced some apprehension myself.

772
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,047
<i>You seem like</i>
<i>a lovely young woman.</i>

773
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,887
<i>But you were the most stubborn</i>
<i>six-year-old I've ever met.</i>

774
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,806
<i>Your parents left you with me</i>
<i>for a weekend,</i>

775
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,101
<i>and you were so angry,</i>
<i>you locked yourself in my guest room</i>

776
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,604
<i>and refused to come out.</i>

777
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,065
That must have been...
inconvenient for you.

778
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,860
<i>Oh, I coaxed you out eventually...</i>

779
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,404
<i>with a strawberry tart.</i>

780
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,364
I'm very fond of strawberries.

781
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,408
I didn't realize
I'd eaten them as a child.

782
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,036
<i>You couldn't get enough of them.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>

783
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,079
<i>Of course, you didn't hesitate</i>
<i>to point out</i>

784
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,665
<i>if they weren't perfectly ripe.</i>

785
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,794
I'm sorry if I insulted you.

786
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,963
Perhaps I shouldn't have called.

787
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,342
<i>No, I'm very glad you did.</i>

788
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:31,471
<i>It's wonderful</i>
<i>to see you again, Annika.</i>

789
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,188
We're exploring new territory today,

790
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:44,359
so it is fitting that this hearing
is being held at Pathfinder.

791
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,904
The Doctor exhibits many of the traits
we associate with a person--

792
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:52,659
intelligence, creativity,
ambition, even fallibility.

793
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,661
But are these traits real,

794
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,915
or is the Doctor merely
programmed to simulate them?

795
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,834
To be honest, I don't know.

796
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,337
Eventually,
we will have to decide,

797
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:09,342
because the issue of holographic rights
isn't going to go away.

798
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,177
But at this time,
I am not prepared to rule

799
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,013
that the Doctor
is a person under the law.

800
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,559
However, it is obvious he is
no ordinary hologram,

801
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,312
and while I can't say with certainty
that he is a person,

802
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,315
I am willing to extend
the legal definition of artist

803
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,776
to include the Doctor.
I therefore rule

804
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,695
that he has the right
to control his work,

805
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,031
and I'm ordering all copies of his
holonovel to be recalled immediately.

806
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,492
-Your Honor...
-This hearing is adjourned.

807
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,120
-Congratulations, Doctor.
-Thank you, Reg.

808
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,871
<i>We'll be in touch, Captain.</i>

809
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,542
You don't look like someone

810
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,712
who's just struck the first blow
for the rights of holograms.

811
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,964
I don't mean to sound ungrateful,

812
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:51,426
but it feels like a hollow victory--
pardon the pun.

813
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,303
The program's already been played
by thousands of people.

814
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,389
-The damage is done.
-We'll survive.

815
00:41:56,556 --> 00:42:00,351
If I'm not mistaken, don't you have
a holonovel to revise?

816
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,146
Do you think I'll be able
to find another publisher?

817
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,857
If there's one thing
I've learned about you, Doctor,

818
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,818
it's that you can do just about anything
you set your mind to.

819
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,914
Time for your diagnostic.
Report to the Holo-Lab.

820
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,583
I know the routine.

821
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:29,422
And... while you're there,
do yourself a favor.

822
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:33,259
Ask the operator
to run program 47-Beta.

823
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,178
Why? What is it?

824
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:40,183
It's called<i> Photons Be Free.</i>
It's quite provocative.

825
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,695
[Hammer clinking]
