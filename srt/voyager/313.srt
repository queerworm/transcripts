1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,380
Mr. Tuvok,
Mr. Tuvok!

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,715
I was supposed
to accompany you

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,425
on security rounds
this morning.

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,927
Did you forget?

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,095
I was not aware that we
had a definite appointment.

6
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,764
I'm sure
it was definite.

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,016
Well, maybe not
completely definite.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,185
That is,
I'd expressed my desire

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,728
to "learn the ropes,"
as it were,

10
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,605
and I have
completed my study

11
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,440
of starship
security protocols.

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,484
I think you'll find
that I'm fully qualified

13
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,652
to serve in the capacity

14
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,320
of a Starfleet
security officer.

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,113
Junior grade,
of course.

16
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,448
If you will recall,
Mr. Neelix,

17
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,408
I did not guarantee you
a position.

18
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,452
But Captain Janeway
is always saying

19
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,454
that<i> Voyager</i> is
a ship of opportunity.

20
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,165
That is true, but
opportunities for promotion

21
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,792
on a starship
must be earned.

22
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,461
I've been working
hard at this.

23
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,087
I really do feel

24
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,590
I have a great deal
to contribute to<i> Voyager</i>

25
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,925
beyond my current role.

26
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,678
Your dedication is duly noted,
Mr. Neelix.

27
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,389
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am due on the Bridge.

28
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,558
I'll see you first thing
tomorrow morning

29
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,393
for security rounds.

30
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,067
Ensign Vorik.

31
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,777
Get me a duotronic probe.

32
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,030
I'm having trouble
regulating the plasma flow.

33
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,407
May I suggest a gravitic
caliper instead?

34
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,951
You might find it a more
precise instrument.

35
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,245
Good idea,
but bring me both.

36
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,121
Good morning,
B'Elanna.

37
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,291
You missed my special
Klingon breakfast buffet.

38
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,711
I'm sorry, Neelix,
but a bowl of cold<i> gagh</i>

39
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,671
is not my idea of how
to start a morning.

40
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,715
Well, you're not alone.
None of the crew

41
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,217
seemed especially
enthusiastic about it.

42
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:36,095
Um, what's
the problem with...

43
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,974
the plasma injectors?

44
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,976
I've been getting
myself up to speed

45
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,062
on Federation
warp propulsion.

46
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,188
The plasma flow
in the manifold

47
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,523
seems to be constricted.

48
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,526
Ah! Have you thought
of phase-locking them

49
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,861
to the dilithium matrix?

50
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,738
That was the first
thing I did.

51
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,364
Oh.

52
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,952
I really am interested

53
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,161
in learning more about
engineering systems,

54
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,123
maybe even volunteering
for a few duty shifts.

55
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,125
In fact, I have
a couple of questions

56
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,419
about the impulse
response filters...

57
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,796
Neelix, Neelix,

58
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,798
this really isn't
a good time.

59
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,216
I understand,
Lieutenant.

60
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,511
Sorry.

61
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,348
I'll just, uh, watch for a while
if you don't mind.

62
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,225
Here are the tools, sir.

63
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,564
I also had a question
about the transporter buffers...

64
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,692
JANEWAY:
<i>Mr. Neelix, please</i>
<i>report to the Bridge.</i>

65
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,278
On my way, Captain.

66
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,204
Neelix, we seem
to be approaching

67
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,833
some kind of interstellar
dust clouds.

68
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,335
Can you tell us
anything about them?

69
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,922
They look rather
ominous to me.

70
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,382
I believe this is
a region of space

71
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:58,095
known as
the Nekrit Expanse.

72
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,541
JANEWAY:
What can you tell us

73
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,002
about this Expanse,
Mr. Neelix?

74
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,004
It's a vast territory.

75
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,006
No one knows much
about it.

76
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,299
Those plasma storms

77
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,842
might be a problem
for navigation.

78
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,386
Full sensor scan, Tuvok.
Aye, Captain.

79
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,097
Can we plot a course around it?

80
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,015
That might be advisable.

81
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,349
I don't believe so.

82
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,310
It's thousands
of light-years wide.

83
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,520
Then we'll have
to go through it.

84
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,939
Looks like we'll
be counting

85
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,607
on your knowledge
of the Delta Quadrant

86
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,692
even more than
usual, Neelix.

87
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,279
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,405
I'm at your command,
as always.

89
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,199
Will there be any
planets where we can

90
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,492
take on supplies?

91
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,869
There is a station
near the border...

92
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,081
a kind of supply depot
for mining and trading ships.

93
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,041
I suggest we stop there
for provisions

94
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,960
before we go
into the Nekrit Expanse.

95
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,212
What are the
coordinates?

96
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,298
Uh, let's see.

97
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,882
It's actually been a while...

98
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,260
CHAKOTAY:
I have the station
on sensors, Captain.

99
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,220
3.4 light-years away,

100
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,346
heading 071 mark 17.

101
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,598
You heard him, Tom.

102
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,142
On our way.

103
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,565
We're being hailed, Captain.

104
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,318
On screen.

105
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,737
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway

106
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,990
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

107
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>Bahrat,</i>
<i>manager of this station.</i>

108
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,952
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

109
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,955
Your station is
a trading outpost, isn't it?

110
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,790
I'd like permission
to come aboard

111
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,416
to negotiate for supplies.

112
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,460
<i>Granted,</i>

113
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,629
<i>but understand</i>
<i>that any transaction</i>

114
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,966
<i>you negotiate on this station</i>
<i>is subject to my approval.</i>

115
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,802
<i>I receive a 20 percent</i>
<i>commission on all trade.</i>

116
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,930
<i>Your whereabouts</i>
<i>will be closely monitored.</i>

117
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,307
<i>Communications with your ship</i>

118
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,601
<i>may also be monitored</i>
<i>at my discretion.</i>

119
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,603
<i>Do you agree</i>
<i>to these conditions?</i>

120
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,772
Evidently, I have no choice.

121
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,024
<i>Excellent.</i>

122
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,692
<i>Meet me in my office</i>
<i>in one hour</i>

123
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,278
<i>and we'll discuss your needs.</i>

124
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,739
Pleasant fellow.

125
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,533
Neelix, Chakotay, Tom,
you're with me.

126
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,793
( monitor beeping )

127
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,007
( door opens )

128
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,347
Mr. Bahrat.

129
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,681
What is it?

130
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,976
I'm Kathryn Janeway.

131
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,689
I've brought a list
of the supplies we'll need.

132
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,983
Forgive me,
but it's demanding work

133
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,818
watching over this station.

134
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,947
We get all kinds
of troublemakers here.

135
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,324
I understand.

136
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,785
All right. Let's see it.

137
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,664
Hmm.

138
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,084
Mm-hmm.

139
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,711
Hmm... pergium?

140
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,921
To regenerate the filters

141
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,006
in our environmental
control system.

142
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,841
That might be
a little difficult.

143
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,760
It's a rare commodity.

144
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,387
Give me a few moments

145
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,140
and I'll put together a list
of potential suppliers,

146
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,811
but I'll warn you,
they won't strike easy bargains.

147
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,188
I'm prepared to deal fairly.

148
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,402
(<i> buzz of conversation,</i>
<i>whir of machinery</i> )

149
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,345
Good day, gentlemen.
Good day.

150
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,347
Anything in particular
you're looking for?

151
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,931
Anything I can
help you with?

152
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,267
We were hoping to find
some magnetic spindle bearings

153
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,144
for our reaction
control assembly.

154
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,896
Spindle bearings,
spindle bearings...

155
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,858
No. Can't help you
with that. No.

156
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,485
Long voyage ahead?

157
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,821
Uh, you could say that.

158
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,199
I have something
that might ease your journey,

159
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,908
ease it considerably.

160
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,994
Rhuludian crystals.

161
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,206
Ingesting just one of these
will make days of tedious travel

162
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,124
seem like moments
of exquisite rapture.

163
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,418
No, thank you.

164
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,961
The price is surprisingly...

165
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,963
No.

166
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,924
Nice place.

167
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,934
I see you're
a map dealer.

168
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,228
I have coordinate charts

169
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,397
for all of the local
mining colonies.

170
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,190
Actually,
I'm interested

171
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,359
in maps of the Nekrit Expanse.

172
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,194
You must be a stranger
here or you'd know.

173
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,279
There aren't any maps
of that region.

174
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,199
Surely, there's an astrometric
chart or a database

175
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,034
that would help me plot
a safe course.

176
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,037
The Nekrit Expanse is
too unstable to chart.

177
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,580
MALE:
No matter.

178
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,458
He never could plot
a straight course anyway.

179
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,545
Wixiban?

180
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,047
Wix, is that you?

181
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,007
( laughs )

182
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,134
I can't believe it.

183
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,346
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,223
I've never seen
another Talaxian

185
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,975
this far from home.
It's a long story.

186
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,395
I'm one of the crew
of a highly-advanced starship.

187
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:07,274
Ah... I want to
hear all about it.

188
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,608
Come on.

189
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,610
The tavern here serves
the best<i> Toffa</i> ale

190
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,612
I've had in years.

191
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,406
NEELIX:
I do a little
of everything.

192
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,366
Cook, guide,

193
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,784
advisor to the Captain.

194
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,246
Possibly even
an unofficial ambassador.

195
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,707
( chuckling ):
Life's been good to you.

196
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:29,129
Yes, I'm very... I'm very lucky.

197
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,468
Mmm... but what about you?

198
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,428
What are you doing
on this station?

199
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:40,265
A little of this,
a little of that.

200
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,225
To tell you the truth,

201
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:46,729
things haven't gone
quite so well for me.

202
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,148
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,901
Ever since that nasty business
with the Ubeans,

204
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,945
things have
been difficult.

205
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,780
But you know me.

206
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,450
Can't keep Wix down long.

207
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,577
I'm working on a trade deal now

208
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,039
that should put me right back
in the thick of things again.

209
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,707
I hope it works out.

210
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,502
Yeah.

211
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,587
Uh, Wix...

212
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,507
about the Ubeans.

213
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:18,261
I don't think I ever told you
how much I valued what you did.

214
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,763
You'd have done the same for me.

215
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,933
Yes, I would have, but you
were the one who got caught.

216
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,978
I owe you a great deal.

217
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,105
If there's anything
I can do to help...

218
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,690
I'm fine. Honestly.

219
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,820
Maybe not on the crew
of a magnificent starship,

220
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,364
but I'll get by.

221
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,782
To tell you the truth, um...

222
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,409
it's not quite
what I told you.

223
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,829
In fact, I may not be
on<i> Voyager</i> much longer.

224
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,747
Why?

225
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:51,211
The main reason Captain Janeway
needed me was as a guide

226
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,172
to give her information
about this Quadrant,

227
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,383
but I've never been
beyond the Nekrit Expanse.

228
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,885
I can't tell her anything
about what's ahead.

229
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,095
But your other jobs,

230
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,931
cook, ambassador...?

231
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,519
They don't really need a cook

232
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,107
and I don't think our Captain
really requires an ambassador.

233
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,151
I've tried to find
some other area

234
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,238
where I might be useful, but...

235
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,408
the truth is...

236
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,618
I'm not needed.

237
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,414
I'm hoping you can help me.

238
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,416
I can't let<i> Voyager</i> go

239
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,875
into that dangerous part
of space

240
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,294
without some idea
of what's there.

241
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,338
I have to find a map.

242
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,675
Hmm.

243
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,893
( clattering )

244
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,187
Can I be of help,
Mr. Neelix?

245
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,273
Dinner isn't for another
hour, Ensign Vorik,

246
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,275
and I don't have time
to prepare a snack.

247
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,402
I don't require food
at the moment.

248
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,986
Lieutenant Torres
sent me to adjust

249
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,155
the control interface
in your food replicators.

250
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,617
You said you were experiencing
difficulties with them.

251
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,660
Oh, of course.

252
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,954
Go ahead.

253
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,416
Neelix...

254
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,086
I thought you'd like
to say hello to your old friend.

255
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,963
Well, uh...

256
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,798
yes, yes, of course.

257
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:24,596
So, this is where you prepare
your legendary feasts.

258
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,556
Well...
You know, Commander,

259
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,058
Neelix has
more varied talents

260
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,851
than anyone I've ever known.

261
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,020
You're lucky to have him
on board.

262
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,522
Mr. Wix was able to find

263
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,857
those magnetic spindle bearings
we were looking for.

264
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,360
I don't know what we'd have done
if he hadn't come up with them.

265
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,238
Well, yes, Wix has
always had a knack

266
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,325
for finding
those hard-to-locate items.

267
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,825
( chuckles )

268
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,579
I'll let you two
reminisce for a while.

269
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,913
Thanks again, Wix.

270
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,039
You're more than welcome.

271
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,667
Yes, this is
the mess room.

272
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,293
On any given day,
I must be prepared

273
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,545
to feed over
a hundred people.

274
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,422
About done, Ensign?

275
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,508
Not quite.

276
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,010
Well, I really don't need
the replicators today,

277
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,679
so you can finish later.

278
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,221
As you wish.

279
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,807
Oh, and remind
Lieutenant Torres,

280
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,975
uh, when she has a moment,

281
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,269
I'd still like to go over
a few things with her.

282
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,562
I'll relay the message.

283
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,731
NEELIX:
Thank you.

284
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,567
Wix...

285
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,321
please tell me
those spindle bearings

286
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,031
weren't stolen property.

287
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,033
Of course not.

288
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,868
I wouldn't do that to you.

289
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,330
Neelix, I need the work.

290
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,708
I don't live
on a comfortable starship.

291
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,377
No one looks out for me
except me.

292
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,796
Maybe you've forgotten
what that feels like.

293
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,464
I haven't forgotten.

294
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,799
I've been stuck

295
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,551
on that trash-heap
of a space station

296
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,845
for three years.
My ship's been impounded.

297
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,764
I can't afford to give Bahrat
what he wants to get it back.

298
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,517
Do you begrudge me
an opportunity

299
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,519
to make a fair trade?

300
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,021
Of course not.

301
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,398
I have news for you.

302
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,483
I've located some pergium
for your ship.

303
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,109
That's great news.

304
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,904
Captain Janeway
hasn't had any luck.

305
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,947
And I've found someone
with a map.

306
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,908
Wonderful!

307
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,744
How do we get it?

308
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,120
It'll involve several
bartering sessions.

309
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,789
I have the opportunity

310
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,833
to sell medical supplies
to an outpost

311
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,502
whose people are dying
of a lung disease.

312
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,796
It's a good cause
and it will make me enough

313
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,506
to pay Bahrat
and get my ship back.

314
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,965
Where does the map come in?

315
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,427
When I deliver
the medical supplies,

316
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,013
one of the physicians will
give me an astrometric chart.

317
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:36,018
I can't thank you enough.

318
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,354
I'll have to ask
your help though.

319
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,773
We'll need a shuttle.

320
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,900
First, we have to get
to a nearby freighter

321
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,610
to pick up
the medical supplies.

322
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,612
Then, we return
to the space station

323
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,197
and meet with one of the
physicians from the outpost.

324
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,908
With your transporter
technology,

325
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,744
we could be in and out
of the station within minutes.

326
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,204
Then, I could finally
get away from here

327
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,331
and get back
to a Talaxian colony.

328
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,626
I don't think that
would be a problem.

329
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,378
Just one thing.

330
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,380
Don't tell anyone
that we're delivering

331
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,006
medical supplies
to the station.

332
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,634
Not even one person.

333
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,135
If Bahrat finds out,

334
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,053
he'll take 20 percent
and I can't afford that.

335
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,891
I-I suppose there's
no need to mention it.

336
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,726
Thanks, Neelix.

337
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,978
I knew I could
count on you.

338
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,450
Didn't I tell you
this would be easy?

339
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,034
( chortles )

340
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,203
I got the medical supplies

341
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,915
and you got the pergium
your ship needs so badly.

342
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,000
Only 20 kilograms. I told
Commander Chakotay

343
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,877
it would be 45.

344
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,045
You're lucky to get
what you did.

345
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,881
Come on, Neelix.

346
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,967
A few minutes more
and we'll be done.

347
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,678
And you'll have a map
to help you through

348
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,763
the Nekrit Expanse.

349
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,182
What is the matter with you?

350
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,935
I don't like keeping the whole
truth from Commander Chakotay.

351
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,186
It's not honest.

352
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,729
I don't remember you

353
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,024
ever being so squeamish
about twisting the truth.

354
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,401
Wix...

355
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,696
I'm not what I used to be.

356
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,574
Neither am I.

357
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,035
We've both tried
to change our lives.

358
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,745
You've done it.

359
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,414
Now, I have the same chance.

360
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,002
We're almost there.

361
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:27,213
We should have your transporter
take us to Corridor 14-L

362
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,965
near the outer docking ports.

363
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,383
It's hardly ever used.

364
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,092
Our contact
will meet us there.

365
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,595
We're within
transporter range.

366
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,056
I've entered
the coordinates.

367
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,398
What are you doing?!

368
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,234
This station
is a dangerous place

369
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,819
and these supplies
are valuable.

370
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,654
We have to be able
to defend ourselves.

371
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,073
You said this
would be easy.

372
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,784
It's just a precaution.

373
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,414
Let's go.

374
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,541
Computer, energize.

375
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,138
( whispering ):
Where's your contact?

376
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,267
He'll be here. Don't worry.

377
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,643
I don't like this,

378
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,771
meeting in dark passageways
late at night.

379
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,398
MALE:
Wix.

380
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,567
Sutok.

381
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,654
This is my associate.

382
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,282
You have the supplies?

383
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,743
As promised.

384
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,924
What's he doing?

385
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,843
Satisfied?

386
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,930
Completely.

387
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,557
What kind of medical
supplies are those?

388
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,686
If you give me my payment,
we'll be on our way.

389
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,065
Yes, I have it right here.

390
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,782
( groans )
Stop them! Get his weapon!

391
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:18,908
Wix!

392
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,660
( grunts )
Someone's coming!

393
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,121
( alarm blaring )

394
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,290
Neelix!

395
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,668
Get us out of here.

396
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,712
Computer,
two to beam up.

397
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,387
NEELIX:
You lied to me
from the beginning!

398
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,181
And I was foolish enough
to believe you.

399
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,517
It should have been
as easy as I said.

400
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,645
I didn't know Sutok
would try to steal the tubes.

401
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,981
Those aren't ordinary
medical supplies.

402
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,899
You failed to
mention that.

403
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,152
They do have
a medicinal application,

404
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,612
but no one would pay
what I was supposed to get

405
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,280
if they were just
simple medications.

406
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,409
They're narcotics,
aren't they?

407
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,621
Oh, you're up to
your same old tricks.

408
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,291
We have to talk
to Captain Janeway

409
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,044
as soon as we get back.

410
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,174
Do you really
want to do that?

411
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,300
How is it going to look
to your shipmates

412
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,512
when they find out you were
once a contraband smuggler

413
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,889
and that you
were involved

414
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,724
in this ugly
business tonight?

415
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:29,729
You think your position
on<i> Voyager</i> is precarious now?

416
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,438
Wait till they discover

417
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,066
the whole truth
about you.

418
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,609
I can't just
forget about this.

419
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:40,073
So you'd let Bahrat put me
in cryostatic suspension?

420
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,703
I guess you would.

421
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,956
You did let me spend a year
in that Ubean prison.

422
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,624
Wix...

423
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,668
I never told you what it
was like in there, did I?

424
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,171
About eating worms
to stay alive...

425
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,547
sleeping in a cell

426
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,550
where the vermin
chew on you all night...

427
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,011
being punished in ways
you couldn't imagine.

428
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,721
All right!

429
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,853
I won't say anything.

430
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,314
But I don't want to have
anything more to do with you.

431
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,525
The debt is paid.

432
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,573
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

433
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,658
<i>I have called a meeting</i>
<i>of the senior staff</i>

434
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,161
<i>to inform them</i>
<i>of some very disturbing news</i>

435
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,538
<i>I have just received.</i>

436
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,712
There's been a murder
aboard the station.

437
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,505
CHAKOTAY:
A murder?

438
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,925
I've been told that's not
an uncommon occurrence here.

439
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,511
The man who died has been
suspected of criminal activity.

440
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,556
Mr. Bahrat, however, discovered
something at the scene

441
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,226
of the killing that
greatly concerns me.

442
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,852
During my investigation,

443
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,438
I discovered some energy
readings I couldn't identify,

444
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,566
so I ran a spectral analysis.

445
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,028
He showed me the analysis
just a few minutes ago.

446
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,240
It's a Federation
phaser signature.

447
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,408
Tuvok will be
assisting Mr. Bahrat

448
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,994
in his investigation.

449
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,579
I want to know how a weapon
from<i> Voyager</i>

450
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,999
could have been involved
in this incident.

451
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,250
The shooting took place

452
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,960
in an abandoned section
of the station.

453
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,462
Security scanners
were disabled.

454
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,590
I'm reviewing other surveillance
records,

455
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,885
looking for anything
that might help me apprehend

456
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,013
whoever did this.

457
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,015
I've promised Mr. Bahrat
the full cooperation

458
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,559
of every member of this crew
during his investigation.

459
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,687
Dismissed.

460
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,669
You wanted
to see me, Mr. Tuvok?

461
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,172
Please, sit down.

462
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,174
I examined the scene
of the shooting

463
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,343
and confirmed the Federation
weapon signature.

464
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,886
A type-2 phaser blast.

465
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,180
Fourteen<i> Voyager</i> crew members
were off the ship

466
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,890
at the time
of the incident.

467
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,390
I see.

468
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,560
Several traders from the station

469
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,188
were aboard<i> Voyager</i> 
on the day of the incident.

470
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,939
We can't rule out
the possibility

471
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,317
that one of them managed
to steal a phaser.

472
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,110
I suppose not.

473
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,612
What can you tell me
about your friend Wixiban?

474
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,156
Wix?

475
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,825
Mr. Chakotay reported
that he was aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

476
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:36,790
Ah, yes. He delivered
some magnetic bearings.

477
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,295
We're more like acquaintances,
not friends really.

478
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,796
I haven't seen him in years.

479
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,091
Has he ever been involved
in criminal activity?

480
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,343
I-I wouldn't know.

481
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,346
I certainly don't think so.

482
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,430
I must question him

483
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,850
and I would appreciate
your accompanying me.

484
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,602
Me?

485
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,104
What could I do?

486
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,688
You may be able to help me
evaluate

487
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,399
the verisimilitude
of his answers.

488
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,609
I see.
Please meet me

489
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,280
in Transporter Room 2
at 1800 hours.

490
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:26,006
How much time did you spend
aboard<i> Voyager?</i>

491
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,176
Probably less than
an hour altogether.

492
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,429
Were you ever alone
on the ship?

493
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:35,015
No. I was met
by Mr. Chakotay

494
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,976
in your
transporter room.

495
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,936
Extraordinary
experience

496
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,772
that transporter
of yours.

497
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,317
We delivered the bearings
to Lieutenant Torres.

498
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,777
Then, Mr. Chakotay
and I paid a visit

499
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,863
to my old friend Neelix
in your Mess Hall.

500
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,074
Where were you
at the time of the shooting?

501
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,119
In bed, asleep.

502
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,829
Can anyone corroborate that?

503
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:01,708
Alas, Mr. Tuvok, I sleep alone.

504
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,753
That will be all
for now, Mr. Wix.

505
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,591
I'd like to stay
for a glass of<i> Toffa</i> ale.

506
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,427
As you wish,
but please see me

507
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,845
as soon as you return
to the ship.

508
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,680
Yeah.

509
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,689
I'd forgotten
how easy it is

510
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,399
for you to lie.

511
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,361
You're not suggesting
I tell him the truth.

512
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:32,114
Vulcans aren't as easily fooled
as you might think.

513
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,992
If you want to worry,
I'll give you something

514
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,869
to worry about.

515
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,496
What?

516
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:43,501
The people I was conducting
that transaction for

517
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,379
aren't happy that they
didn't get paid.

518
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,672
I thought this was your scheme.

519
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,718
Do you think I could have
afforded those tubes?

520
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:57,555
I was acting as an agent
for some Kolaati Traders.

521
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,557
Do you know anything
about the Kolaati?

522
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,019
They're mean
as fire snakes.

523
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,897
They will kill us,
and it won't be quick.

524
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:09,693
I... I can't believe
this is happening.

525
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,987
Why did I ever listen to you?!

526
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,656
Neelix, it's all right.

527
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,826
I've convinced them to take
something else in payment.

528
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,413
Something easily come by.

529
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,540
They know
about<i> Voyager.</i>

530
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,293
They want a sample
of your ship's warp plasma.

531
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,794
They'll be able
to use it

532
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,714
to increase the efficiency
of their engines.

533
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,467
No. It's wrong.
I won't do it.

534
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,927
This has to stop.

535
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,263
You should have thought
of that in the beginning.

536
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,805
You're in too deeply now.

537
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,268
The people on<i> Voyager</i> 
are my friends.

538
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,395
I can't steal from them.

539
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,313
Friends?

540
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,814
You've already told me

541
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,401
they're ready to put
you off the ship.

542
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,823
You're living
in a dream world.

543
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,326
It's time to wake up.

544
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,872
You're on your own,
just as I am

545
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,958
and you're going to die
a horrible death

546
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,460
at the hands
of the Kolaati

547
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,712
unless you bring them
three grams of warp plasma.

548
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,257
Do you understand that?

549
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,594
I've already told them
you'd do it.

550
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:22,391
Meet me here tomorrow morning
at 900 hours.

551
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,699
Hey, Neelix, what's up?

552
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,994
Oh, nothing.

553
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,663
Just thought I might
give you a hand with...

554
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,000
whatever it is
you're doing.

555
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,876
You may regret that.

556
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,420
Chakotay and I
have to pick up

557
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,298
a supply of biomimetic
gel tomorrow morning

558
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,758
and I am trying
to find the container

559
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,969
that is listed as the proper
transport device.

560
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:03,098
Starfleet standard
issue L647X7.

561
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,644
Well, sounds like another
set of eyes wouldn't hurt.

562
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,605
M-34...

563
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,482
No, not that one.

564
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,028
L647...

565
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,071
No, it's Y-6.

566
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,495
Tom...

567
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,458
if it's not too bold of me,

568
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,293
I wonder if I could
ask you something.

569
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,420
Sure. Anything.

570
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,632
I've heard you were
in some trouble in the past.

571
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,676
Spent time in prison.

572
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:41,387
That's right.

573
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,014
Do you...?

574
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,643
Would you... tell me
how you got in trouble?

575
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,856
I've thought a lot
about that

576
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,068
and it comes down
to one simple fact.

577
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,819
I didn't tell the truth.

578
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,490
I made a mistake,
which happens to people,

579
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,909
but if I'd admitted
that mistake,

580
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,870
it would have been
a lot better.

581
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,122
But I lied about it

582
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,710
and it nearly
ruined my life.

583
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,961
Why do you ask?

584
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,257
Oh... no reason.

585
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,429
Just wondered.

586
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,270
Here's your container.

587
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,479
Oh.

588
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,022
( laughing )

589
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,777
After I'm done here,
a bunch of us are going to go

590
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,738
down to the resort.
Why don't you come along?

591
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:43,198
Thanks, but I'm going
to turn in early.

592
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,700
Maybe another time.

593
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,910
Okay.

594
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,258
Good evening, Ensign.

595
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,676
Mr. Neelix.

596
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,052
I thought I'd log
a little time

597
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,845
in the Jefferies tubes
if that's all right.

598
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,389
I was unaware you
were officially

599
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,391
on an engineering
work detail.

600
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,560
Oh, it's not official,
not at all.

601
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,562
But Lieutenant Torres
has been good enough

602
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,355
to allow me to poke
around here and there,

603
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,649
as time permits, of course.

604
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,358
She has mentioned
your desire to become

605
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,527
familiar with Starfleet
engineering protocols.

606
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,321
I see no reason why
you can't proceed.

607
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,989
Thank you.

608
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,870
Ensign Vorik.

609
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,665
Yes, Mr. Neelix?

610
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,083
You're quite young.

611
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,794
Is it difficult for you

612
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,588
being so far away
from everything that's familiar?

613
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,965
Had I been given the choice,

614
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,593
I might not have chosen
to explore the Delta Quadrant.

615
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,095
However, since we are here,

616
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,307
I must say the challenges
are intriguing.

617
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,935
<i>Voyager</i> is
a wonderful place to be.

618
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,355
The people here
are very fortunate.

619
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,440
I would concur.

620
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,965
Did you get it?
Where is it?

621
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,134
I have to talk to you.
Give it to me.

622
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,429
I didn't get
the warp plasma.

623
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,971
What?!

624
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,766
I couldn't do it.

625
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,517
I just couldn't.

626
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,853
We have to tell the truth.

627
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,064
It's the only way
to make things right.

628
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,651
We're dead men, Neelix.

629
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,820
No. I have a plan.

630
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,907
BAHRAT:
You two,
stay where you are!

631
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,702
Don't panic. Stay calm.

632
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,248
I said stay
where you are!

633
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,250
What is this?

634
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,711
You two are
under arrest.

635
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,004
PARIS: Arrest?
What's the charge?

636
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,758
Conspiring with known
drug traffickers...

637
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,635
and murder.

638
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,637
Let's go!

639
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,018
This is the criminal
who was killed...

640
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,855
and these are the two men we
arrested.

641
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:05,484
You can't seriously regard this
as viable evidence.

642
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,571
I realize it's circumstantial,
but it is compelling.

643
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,197
It proves absolutely nothing.

644
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,366
It proves your two men
had a conversation

645
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,703
with a narcotics dealer
only hours before he was killed.

646
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,997
As the Captain said,
that proves nothing.

647
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,624
I'm holding them
for questioning.

648
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,084
They are
prime suspects.

649
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,589
I want my security officer
present

650
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,675
during all interrogations.

651
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,595
I'll take that
into consideration.

652
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,597
But make no mistake
about this.

653
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,432
Someone will serve 50 years

654
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,602
of cryostatic suspension
for that murder.

655
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,354
If I were to let
this go unpunished,

656
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,607
there would be anarchy
on this station within days.

657
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,484
You make no mistake
about this.

658
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,611
I won't allow members
of my crew to be condemned

659
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,280
for a crime
they did not commit.

660
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,119
( sighs )

661
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,180
This has gone too far.
We have to go to Bahrat.

662
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,350
We'll end up in his
cryostatic prison for decades.

663
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,519
Not if he agrees
to my plan.

664
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,731
Your plan is crazy.
It's worse than prison.

665
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,399
It's a death sentence.

666
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,442
That would be better
than living a lie.

667
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,945
I'm going whether
you do or not.

668
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,031
Neelix.

669
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,368
We've been through
too much together.

670
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,329
I can't let you
do this alone.

671
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,758
It was a type-2 Federation
phaser that was used.

672
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,217
It's on one of our shuttles.

673
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,344
You can get it
from our security officer

674
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,263
to verify the energy signature.

675
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,390
Which of you
fired the weapon?

676
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,101
We were both involved
in all aspects of the crime.

677
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,062
I was the one
with the weapon,

678
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,606
but I fired
in self-defense.

679
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,900
So you see,
Commander Chakotay

680
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,152
and Lieutenant Paris
are innocent.

681
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,154
The punishment
for trafficking

682
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,782
in illicit substances

683
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:20,744
is 50 years of
cryostatic imprisonment.

684
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,376
Your cryostatic prison

685
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,379
isn't a particularly
effective deterrent, is it?

686
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,381
It certainly is.

687
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,301
There's very little narcotics
trafficking that goes on here.

688
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,553
That's what you think.

689
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,975
The Kolaati have made a fortune
trading drugs here.

690
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:46,311
I know everything
that happens on this station.

691
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,687
Apparently not.

692
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,065
Since we were able
to deliver narcotics

693
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,859
to known criminals
right under your nose.

694
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,653
WIXIBAN:
They have ways of disabling

695
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,530
your surveillance systems.
Masking your sensors.

696
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,950
Creating false
visual signals.

697
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,368
It happens almost
every night.

698
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,788
I'll put a stop to that.

699
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,748
Since you don't know
how they do it,

700
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,541
that might
prove difficult.

701
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:13,630
But... we have a plan.

702
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,467
The Kolaati want a sample
of warp plasma from<i> Voyager.</i>

703
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,136
I'll arrange a
meeting with them

704
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,720
to deliver the plasma.

705
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,140
When they arrive, we'll
take them into custody.

706
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,809
How do you plan to do that?

707
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,520
You won't be able
to carry weapons

708
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,230
and if they thought
my men and I were near,

709
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,358
they'd be gone in a second.

710
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,234
We have some ideas.

711
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,738
If we are able
to turn them over to you,

712
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,992
will you agree
not to charge us with a crime?

713
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,708
It's no risk to me.

714
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,965
You'll undoubtedly perish
in this ridiculous scheme.

715
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,299
You'll have to provide us

716
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,551
with a sample
of warp plasma.

717
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,219
I won't take any from<i> Voyager.</i>

718
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,680
What I can give you
won't be of the same quality.

719
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,931
Doesn't matter.

720
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,184
We'll make do.

721
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:10,145
All right.
We'll try it.

722
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:14,607
But I don't hold any hopes
that you will survive.

723
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,908
It's been over 20 minutes.
Where are they?

724
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,534
I confirmed the
time and place.

725
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,161
They should be here.

726
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,996
Maybe they've
realized it's a trap.

727
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,873
Maybe they're not
going to show up.

728
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,918
Let's hope they do or we will
end up in Bahrat's prison.

729
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,429
It looks like somebody's
begun transmitting

730
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,306
a false visual signal.

731
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:51,061
My guess is they're
about to come aboard.

732
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,356
We'll give them five minutes

733
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,068
and then move in.

734
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,657
It's Tosin.
Who?

735
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,452
He's one of the most
powerful Kolaati.

736
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,671
Good evening, gentlemen.
My name is Neelix, and I am--

737
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,966
The warp plasma. Where is it?

738
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,675
It's right in here,
Tosin,

739
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,385
but first, you must
guarantee us--

740
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,054
You'll live for today.

741
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,099
No guarantees
about tomorrow.

742
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,850
Give me the plasma.

743
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,019
Slowly.

744
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,289
( instrument beeping )

745
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:56,251
Twenty parts per million
isonucleic residue.

746
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,628
This is contaminated.

747
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,964
You promised me a pure sample.

748
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,381
It really doesn't matter,

749
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,510
because you're under arrest.
What?

750
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,680
I said
you're being taken into custody

751
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,309
for smuggling contraband
and narcotic substances.

752
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,936
Very serious offenses
aboard this station,

753
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,856
Mr. Tosin. It's time
you faced up to them.

754
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,233
( laughing )

755
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:25,030
( laughter continues )

756
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,157
Little man...

757
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,617
your days have ended.

758
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,369
I wouldn't fire that weapon
if I were you.

759
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,496
That plasma canister
you're holding...

760
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,042
I disengaged the safety nodes
just as you came in.

761
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,586
Even as we speak,
warp plasma is leaking from it.

762
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,715
This section
of the station is filling

763
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,591
with plasma particles.

764
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,177
Fire your weapon

765
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,095
and you'll set off an explosion

766
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,264
that would undoubtedly
kill us all.

767
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,142
He's telling the truth, Tosin.
Don't do it.

768
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,312
And I wouldn't activate
your transporter system,

769
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,813
if I were you.

770
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,649
The beam would also
destabilize the plasma.

771
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,361
Same effect. Boom.

772
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,033
Then you will die with me,
little man.

773
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,785
No problem at all
if it means getting rid

774
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,080
of an Orillian lung maggot
like you.

775
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,622
( growls )

776
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,791
Go ahead.

777
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,835
You'd be doing me a favor.

778
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,130
I have nothing to lose.
Fire away.

779
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,631
Neelix.

780
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,218
Shoot.
What are you waiting for?

781
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,053
( breathing heavily )

782
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,180
Fire.

783
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,779
Re-engage the safety nodes.

784
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,074
Don't bother.
Put down your weapons.

785
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:55,536
You're under arrest
for violating Station Code 4279,

786
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,998
Subsection
Beta-325.

787
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,917
No, don't!

788
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,543
( screaming )

789
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,639
( groans )

790
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,558
I'm in Sick Bay?

791
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,060
Yes, Mr. Neelix.

792
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,937
You sustained
third-degree plasma burns

793
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,272
and a moderate concussion,

794
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,898
but my skills
have prevented you

795
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,650
from suffering permanent damage.

796
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,485
Thank you, Doctor.

797
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,071
One of the criminals was killed
in the plasma explosion.

798
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,740
The others have been taken
into custody by Mr. Bahrat.

799
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,659
Chakotay and Tom
were released.

800
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,578
Oh, good.

801
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,746
And Wix?

802
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,832
Mr. Wixiban
was given his shuttle.

803
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,000
He sent you his thanks

804
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,210
before making
a hasty departure.

805
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,046
Would all of you
excuse us please?

806
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,174
I'd like to talk
to Neelix alone.

807
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,645
Well, do you have anything
to say for yourself?

808
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,815
Only that I'm terribly sorry.

809
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,776
Oh. You're sorry.

810
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,029
Is that supposed
to make everything better?

811
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,322
I don't really care

812
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:13,948
whether you're sorry
or not, Neelix.

813
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,950
At this point it
doesn't matter.

814
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,452
I can't imagine
what could have

815
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,162
made you behave
the way you did.

816
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,955
Lying to us.

817
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,082
Sneaking around
behind our backs.

818
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,460
Covering up
criminal activity.

819
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,086
Did you have
some misguided reason

820
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,588
to think that this was
acceptable behavior?

821
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,424
No, ma'am.

822
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,803
You've been one
of my most trusted advisors

823
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,182
since we began this journey.

824
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,351
How can I ever trust you again?

825
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,228
How can I ever
listen to you

826
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,231
without wondering whether you're
telling the truth or not?

827
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,651
I've never been
dishonest to you before.

828
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,071
I swear, Captain.

829
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:57,075
I-I just took one step,

830
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,453
a step that seemed
perfectly reasonable,

831
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,540
and that step led to another and
another and before I knew it,

832
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,042
I was involved in something
I didn't know how to handle.

833
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,668
What was it?

834
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,379
What was so important

835
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:12,090
that you were willing
to throw away your principles?

836
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,427
I needed a map.

837
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,470
A map?

838
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,725
Captain, my usefulness
to you was at an end.

839
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:26,438
I don't know anything about
space beyond this point.

840
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,940
I couldn't let you go
into the Nekrit Expanse

841
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,735
without knowing
what you faced.

842
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,238
You've been on this ship
for two years.

843
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,781
I'd think by now
you'd have learned

844
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,824
that the first duty
of any Starfleet officer

845
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,743
is the truth.

846
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,955
You violated that duty, Neelix,

847
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,541
and there will be consequences.

848
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,925
I'm prepared to leave
the ship, Captain.

849
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,761
Oh, no.
It's not that easy.

850
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,347
You can't just walk away
from your responsibilities

851
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,391
because you made a mistake.

852
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:07,145
You're part of a family now,
and you have obligations.

853
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:11,274
But... I can't guide you.

854
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,568
I can't advise you.
I don't know what's coming.

855
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,278
That's not the point.

856
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,737
Is it?

857
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,823
None of us knows what's coming.

858
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,409
That's what Starfleet
is all about.

859
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,286
We are all in this
together, Neelix,

860
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,704
and we have to be able
to count on each other

861
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,457
no matter how hard it gets.

862
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:30,042
Do you understand?

863
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,669
Yes.

864
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,338
Yes, I do.

865
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,922
Well, that's good.

866
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,799
Report to deuterium
maintenance

867
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,843
at 0400 tomorrow morning.

868
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,803
You're going to spend
the next two weeks

869
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,014
scrubbing the exhaust manifolds.

870
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,267
That should give you time
to think about what I've said.

871
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,353
Dismissed.
