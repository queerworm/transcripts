<i>How was the sunrise</i>
<i>from down there?</i>

3
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:15,683
WOMAN: <i> Beautiful.</i>
<i>There was a little green</i>
<i>mixed in today.</i>

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,185
<i>It was really quite spectacular.</i>

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,687
Sorry I missed it.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,480
<i>Next time, Lieutenant.</i>

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,357
Any luck drilling
through that lava plain?

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>Roger that.</i>
<i>We broke through</i>
<i>the iron oxide barrier</i>

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,069
<i>and we're down to eight meters.</i>

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,905
MAN:
<i>We should have some samples</i>

11
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,949
<i>by the end of the day</i>
<i>if all goes well.</i>

12
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,868
On to more important matters.

13
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,703
Received an uplink from Houston.

14
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,746
The Yankees won game five
of the World Series.

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,456
WOMAN:
<i>You owe me 20 bucks.</i>

16
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,750
It's not over yet.
There's still game six.

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,878
We're not the only ones
making history today.

18
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,671
Bokai just broke
DiMaggio's record.

19
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,589
MAN:
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

20
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,884
If you ask me, Houston's
been manipulating the stats.

21
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,554
WOMAN:
<i>They do have a few too many</i>
<i>Kings fans at Mission Control.</i>

22
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,557
Well, how else do you
explain Bokai beating out
the Yankee Clipper?

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,021
WOMAN:
<i>Commander, we lost you</i>
<i>for a second there.</i>

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,314
The ride got a little bumpy.
Stand by.

25
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,441
I'm picking up
some turbulence.

26
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,318
MAN:
<i>At your altitude?</i>

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,862
Checking Lidar.

28
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,531
What the hell...?

29
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,449
WOMAN:
<i>John, what's going on?</i>

30
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,284
There's an object
closing on my position--

31
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,329
azimuth 121.6.

32
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,998
Whatever it is, it's huge.

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,083
It's over
1,000 meters across.

34
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,045
MAN:
<i>How could something that big</i>
<i>appear out of nowhere?</i>

35
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,505
I don't know, but I'm
getting out of its way.

36
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,757
Firing thrusters.

37
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,677
WOMAN:
<i>It's probably</i>
<i>just a solar flare.</i>

38
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,303
Let's hope so.

39
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,481
It's no solar flare.

40
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,305
<i>( light jazz playing )</i>

43
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,436

46
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,955
Chakotay to the bridge.

47
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,083
MAN:<i> This is</i>
<i>Transporter Room Two.</i>

48
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,876
I'm trying to reach the bridge.

49
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,378
<i>Your com signal</i>
<i>was routed here, sir.</i>

50
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,214
Can you patch me through?

51
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,008
(<i> warbled</i> ):
<i>Pardon me? Who is this?</i>

52
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,718
<i>Patch you through? Where?</i>

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,345
Neelix?
<i>Commander?</i>

54
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,347
MAN:<i> Double check on</i>
<i>the field generators.</i>

55
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,186
(<i> overlapping voices</i> )

56
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,470
I see you're making some
changes to the computer core.

57
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,139
I've enhanced the
command sequencers

58
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,723
with Borg algorithms.

59
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,475
Well, your enhancements
are wreaking havoc

60
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,227
with our secondary systems.

61
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,562
Insignificant
malfunctions.
I will correct them.

62
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,898
I don't recall authorizing
any modifications.

63
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,318
The computer core
is inefficient.
It needed to be improved.

64
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,446
I appreciate your initiative,
but that's not up to you.

65
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,616
I've explained the value
of these enhancements
on several occasions,

66
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,994
but Lieutenant Torres
chose to ignore me.

67
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,830
I thought a demonstration
would be more persuasive.

68
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,457
Well, I doubt this one's
going to change her mind.

69
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,419
Clearly<i> Voyager</i>
is not yet ready
for assimilation.

70
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,257
A joke.
The doctor suggested

71
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,676
that I diffuse tense
situations with humor.

72
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,429
Good idea.
Now how about getting
these systems back up again

73
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,473
so I can get back
to my book?

74
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,981
We're experiencing
a ship-wide power drain.

75
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,775
This is unrelated
to my modifications.

76
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,280
KIM:
<i>Senior officers to the bridge.</i>

77
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,579
It's 2:00
in the morning, Ensign.

78
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,915
This better be more
than a little turbulence.

79
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,168
You won't be disappointed.
We've got level-nine
gravimetric distortions

80
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,919
closing on our position.

81
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,462
TUVOK:
They are emanating
from subspace.

82
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,922
On screen.

83
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,385
Shields.

84
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,267
It's heading
right toward us.

85
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,935
Evasive maneuvers.

86
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,612
Captain.
Say good morning

87
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,324
to 30 million terrajoules
of subspace energy.

88
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,408
This thing is following us.

89
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,869
I can't outrun it at impulse.

90
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,079
Go to warp.

91
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,707
It's disrupting our warp field.

92
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,584
If it any gets closer,
the gravimetric stresses

93
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,211
are going to rip
the plating off our hull.

94
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,171
Captain, I recognize
this phenomenon.

95
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,674
Its Borg designation
is Spatial Anomaly 521.

96
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,635
It's attracted to objects that
emit electromagnetic energy.

97
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,847
We have to cut power
and reverse our shield polarity.

98
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,724
Do it.

99
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,858
That was close.

100
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,571
I recognize
this anomaly, too.

101
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,823
It's called
a graviton ellipse.

102
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,450
According to
the Federation database,

103
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,952
it travels
through subspace

104
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,038
emerging occasionally
without warning.

105
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,501
Ellipses have only been
observed a handful of times.

106
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,670
<i>Ares Four.</i>

107
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,965
Commander?

108
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,467
One of the early
Mars missions.

109
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,719
The command module and
its pilot were engulfed

110
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,513
by a similar phenomenon
back in 2032.

111
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,433
I remember reading about that.

112
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,726
Two astronauts were stranded
on the surface for weeks

113
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,478
before a rescue ship arrived.

114
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,563
No one's gotten
this close to
a graviton ellipse

115
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,065
and lived to
tell about it.

116
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,234
This could be
a remarkable
opportunity.

117
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,153
Go to yellow alert.

118
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,405
Keep our power output
at minimum levels.

119
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,074
Match its course and speed,
but maintain a safe distance.

120
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,409
Aye, Captain.

121
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,286
I suggest we
launch a probe,

122
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,204
see if we can find
out what makes
this thing tick.

123
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,290
Make it fast.
There's no telling
when our visitor

124
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,792
is going to burrow back
into subspace.

125
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,263
I'm receiving telemetry
from the probe.

126
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,812
It appears to have
entered a stable core
within the anomaly

127
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,231
where gravimetric forces
are negligible.

128
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,192
The eye of the storm.

129
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,943
An apt metaphor.

130
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,237
Computer, run a
multispectral analysis

131
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,072
of the anomaly's core.

132
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,700
<i>Analysis in progress.</i>

133
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,243
The Borg developed shields

134
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,204
to get through
the gravimetric currents.

135
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,498
They intended to dissipate
the anomaly from within.

136
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,042
Perhaps we should
continue their efforts.

137
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,336
It would be shortsighted
to destroy it.

138
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,671
We should study
the phenomenon.

139
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:13,512
I didn't realize
you shared this crew's
penchant for exploration.

140
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,056
I am a Starfleet officer.

141
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,433
When the risks outweigh
the potential gain,

142
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,228
exploration
is illogical.

143
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,147
We can't predict what
we might find here, Seven.

144
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,442
One must allow
for the unexpected discovery.

145
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,903
<i>Core analysis complete.</i>

146
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,034
There are more than
2.8 billion compounds
in the core.

147
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,161
Fascinating.

148
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,121
The computer
has isolated

149
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,375
several synthetic
alloys native
to sector 0-0-1.

150
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,919
Titanium
and polymer composites.

151
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,047
These materials date back
to the 21st century.

152
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,549
They were used
in the construction

153
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,300
of Earth's
early spacecraft.

154
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,635
Commander Chakotay
mentioned a space
capsule

155
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,305
that was consumed
by a graviton ellipse.

156
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,226
These alloys are consistent
with the hull of that capsule.

157
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,857
An unexpected
discovery, indeed.

158
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,414
She was 46 meters,
92 metric tons,

159
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,832
powered by a third-generation
ion drive

160
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,834
and equipped
with a transpectral imager.

161
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,213
<i>Ares Four</i> was piloted
by Lieutenant John Kelly.

162
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,757
His ground team,
astronauts Rose Kumagawa

163
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,675
and Andrei Novakovich,

164
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,178
were close to completing
their survey mission

165
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,681
when Kelly reported an object
closing on his position.

166
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,350
Then he and the command module

167
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,269
disappeared off NASA's
Lidar scopes--

168
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,187
And into the
history books.

169
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,273
That incident
almost derailed
the Mars program.

170
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,942
TUVOK:
Mankind's first encounter
with a spatial anomaly.

171
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,194
Seven, you said
the Borg were working

172
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,738
on a way to get inside
a graviton ellipse.

173
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,325
Shield enhancements.

174
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,453
Well, maybe we could apply
the same enhancements
to the<i> Flyer.</i>

175
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,498
Captain, do you intend to try
to find the command module?

176
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,873
Or what's left of it.

177
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,208
By my calculations,

178
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,002
we have less than
16 hours

179
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,212
before the anomaly goes
back into subspace.

180
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,756
Then we have to work quickly.
Harry, B'Elanna,

181
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,468
help Seven modify
the<i> Flyer's</i> shields.

182
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,429
Tom, review the database
from the<i> Ares Four</i> mission.

183
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,516
It might tell us something
about this anomaly we've missed.

184
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,393
We're going to need
a mission leader.

185
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,103
I volunteer.

186
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,229
I thought you might.

187
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,981
Let's do it.

188
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,404
Something on your mind,
Seven?

189
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,448
The anomaly is as dangerous

190
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,117
and unpredictable now
as it was 300 years ago.

191
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,204
The<i> Delta Flyer</i> is
a little more advanced
than the<i> Ares Four</i> was.

192
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,913
We'll be taking
every precaution.

193
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,208
That may not be enough.

194
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,379
I appreciate your concern,
but this is my call.

195
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,214
Searching for
the command module seems

196
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,799
more sentimental
than scientific.

197
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,760
I can't argue with that.

198
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,804
If scientific knowledge
was all we were after,

199
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,306
then the Federation
would have built

200
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,684
a fleet of probes,
not starships.

201
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,520
Exploration is about seeing
things with your own eyes.

202
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,064
In this case,
we're exploring the past.

203
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,233
How will retrieving
this artifact

204
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,360
enhance your appreciation
of history?

205
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,446
By making us part of it,
in the same way

206
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,241
that excavating the obelisks
of ancient Vulcan

207
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,284
or finding
the Shroud of Kahless

208
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,580
made those explorers
part of their history.

209
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,417
<i>( sighs ):</i>
Here's the crux of it.

210
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,047
As a Borg, you didn't study
the past; you ingested it.

211
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,385
You never really developed
an appreciation for
humanity's history.

212
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,053
Maybe this is an opportunity

213
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,514
for you to do some
exploring of your own.

214
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,225
Are you ordering me
to join this mission?

215
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,853
Let's just say I'm encouraging
you to volunteer.

216
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,275
<i>( sighs )</i>

217
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,527
<i>It's no solar flare.</i>

218
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,863
<i>Wow.</i>

219
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,949
KUMAGAWA:
<i>John, can you describe it?</i>

220
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,036
<i>It's... It's at least</i>
<i>1,000 meters wide. Bright.</i>

221
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,414
NOVAKOVICH:
<i>Your transmission</i>
<i>is breaking up.</i>

222
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,583
<i>It's generating</i>
<i>an electromagnetic radiation</i>

223
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,710
<i>interfering</i>
<i>with primary systems.</i>

224
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,754
<i>I can't get away from it.</i>

225
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,507
<i>Activating</i>
<i>the transpectral imager.</i>

226
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,926
<i>I'll record</i>
<i>as much data as I can.</i>

227
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,181
<i>It's right on top of me!</i>
<i>I'll transmit as much as I...</i>

228
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,477
That's all she wrote.

229
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,398
NASA received Kelly's
last telemetry

230
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,694
at 0922 hours,
October 19, 2032.

231
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,946
I thought I was
the Mars buff.

232
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,907
You seem to know more about
the<i> Ares Four</i> than I do.

233
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,411
The Mars missions paved the way
for the exploration of space.

234
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,538
Kelly was one of
my childhood heroes.

235
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,914
Yeah, mine, too.

236
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,793
That's dedication.

237
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,252
The man's life's
about to end,

238
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,171
but he won't stop
taking readings.

239
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,673
Makes you wonder
if those old-timers

240
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,840
were made of sterner
stuff than we are.

241
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,552
You think we have it easy?
Are you kidding?

242
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,347
Warp drive, shields,
transporters--

243
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,432
We're traveling
in the lap of luxury.

244
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,686
Kelly and Kumagawa,
Armstrong and Glenn,

245
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,228
they were the real pioneers.

246
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,397
Am I interrupting?

247
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,193
We're just admiring someone,
a fellow explorer.

248
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,944
Hero worship--
the glorification

249
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,030
of an individual's
accomplishments.

250
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,533
I guess you didn't have
many role models growing up.

251
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,285
In the collective,
personal accomplishments
are irrelevant.

252
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,163
The shield modifications
to the<i> Delta Flyer</i> are
complete.

253
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,332
We're ready
for launch.
We?

254
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,125
You'll need
someone familiar

255
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,045
with Borg technology
to monitor the shields.

256
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,880
I'm volunteering.

257
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,257
Well, you don't sound
too happy about it.

258
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,718
I'm not,
but this mission

259
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,761
can benefit
from my expertise.

260
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,680
In that case...

261
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,098
welcome aboard.

262
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,186
I'm preparing an inoculant
to counter the effects
of gravimetric radiation.

263
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,146
Of course,
if you were a hologram,

264
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,273
you'd simply adjust
your mobile emitter.

265
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,108
That's what I did
on Arakis Prime,

266
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,652
one of my first
away missions.

267
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,986
I don't recall that.

268
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,446
This was before
you came aboard.

269
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,866
Such an
enchanting planet--

270
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,325
crystalline glaciers...

271
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,536
magnesium vapor
atmosphere.

272
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,621
I had to stop my
metallurgical scans

273
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,749
just to admire the
sheer beauty of it--

274
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,586
to... "smell the roses,"
to coin a phrase.

275
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,629
An inefficient use
of your time.

276
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,548
Perhaps.

277
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,635
We're all finished here,
except for one thing.

278
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,971
Would you mind
recording some images

279
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,849
when you're
inside the ellipse

280
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,810
for those of us not lucky
enough to make the trip?

281
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,063
You envy my participation
on this mission.

282
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,315
There isn't a crewman
aboard who doesn't.

283
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,818
Why?
I can only tell you

284
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,781
how I felt that morning
when I materialized
on Arakis Prime.

285
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,700
I left my footprints
in the magnesite dust

286
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:54,788
and thought, "one small
step for a hologram,

287
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,290
one giant leap
for mankind."

288
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,250
To coin a phrase.

289
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,588
Well, I know the sentiment
isn't exactly original,

290
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,882
but the fact is
I was exhilarated.

291
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,093
<i>Chakotay to Seven of Nine.</i>
<i>Report to Shuttle Bay Two.</i>

292
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,387
Good luck.

293
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,571
We're approaching
the perimeter in five, four...

294
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:33,033
three, two, one.

295
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,288
We're within
2,000 kilometers.

296
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,415
Gravimetric interference
is increasing.

297
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,876
It's nothing compared
to what they're going through.

298
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,753
They're really getting
knocked around in there.

299
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,922
The shields have weakened,
but they're still holding.

300
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,340
Harry, keep your finger
on that tractor beam

301
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,883
in case we have
to pull them out.

302
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,469
They're approaching
the anomaly's core.

303
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,388
We've lost
sensor contact.
Harry.

304
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,390
The com link is still active.

305
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,938
The gravimetric shear
is increasing.

306
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,357
I'm reading diminished
turbulence directly ahead.

307
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,485
Full thrusters, Tom.
Punch us through.

308
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,661
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

309
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,873
We're in.

310
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,504
CHAKOTAY:
<i>I wish you could</i>
<i>see this, Captain.</i>

311
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,089
<i>It's incredible.</i>
We're all ears.

312
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,926
<i>It's very calm,</i>
<i>no gravimetric distortions.</i>

313
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,471
<i>The E.M. activity is creating</i>
<i>a natural luminescence.</i>

314
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,640
<i>Tom called it "mood lighting."</i>

315
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,184
PARIS:
<i>Hey, B'Elanna, it's</i>
<i>the perfect romantic getaway.</i>

316
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,395
I'll take your word
for it.

317
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,856
CHAKOTAY:
<i>We've detected asteroid</i>
<i>fragments, pieces of vessels,</i>

318
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,941
<i>matter from every quadrant</i>
<i>of the galaxy.</i>

319
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,610
<i>Next time I lose something,</i>
<i>I'll know where to look.</i>

320
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,364
<i>Instead of a graviton ellipse</i>
<i>we should call it the</i>
<i>"kitchen sink anomaly."</i>

321
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,701
<i>The chemical interactions</i>
<i>have even created</i>
<i>a primitive atmosphere.</i>

322
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,370
PARIS:
<i>Nothing you'd want</i>
<i>to breathe, of course.</i>

323
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,915
What do you
make of it, Seven?

324
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,251
SEVEN:
<i>Well, I suppose</i>
<i>it's intriguing.</i>

325
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:09,296
<i>Some of the matter appears to be</i>
<i>extra-dimensional in origin.</i>

326
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,883
Sounds like
this anomaly's
gotten around.

327
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,052
Any sign of the<i> Ares</i>
command module?

328
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,262
PARIS:
<i>We're picking up traces</i>
<i>of the hull,</i>

329
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,347
<i>but our sensor readings</i>
<i>are being refracted</i>

330
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,224
<i>by all the debris in here.</i>

331
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,604
That was a gravimetric surge
caused by the anomaly

332
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,941
altering its course
by .006 degrees.

333
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,776
We just had a big jolt
out here.

334
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,070
CHAKOTAY:
<i>We didn't feel a thing.</i>

335
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,739
By our estimate, you have
five hours, 36 minutes

336
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,617
before the anomaly
returns to subspace.
You better get a move on.

337
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,786
CHAKOTAY:
Understood.

338
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,081
I'm having difficulty
isolating the debris
from the command module.

339
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,458
I'll lay in a search pattern.

340
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,335
It may take a couple of hours
to cover an area this large.

341
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,964
Seven and I can use the time
to take some samples.

342
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,382
We'll get a better idea
of where this anomaly's been.

343
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:57,344
We should focus on achieving
our objective and returning
to<i> Voyager.</i>

344
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,346
We're not here
just to find the module.

345
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,265
We've got
an opportunity to...
To explore.

346
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,810
I am familiar
with our mission.

347
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,105
In that case,
let's get started.

348
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,033
The fossilized
microbes in this ore

349
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,286
appear to have had
metallic membranes.

350
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,413
We've speculated
about the possibility

351
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:29,002
of metallic life-forms,
but we've never
discovered one.

352
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,171
You're excited
by this discovery.

353
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,592
This piece of rock
is billions of years
older than Earth,

354
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,887
from a time when the
galaxy was still forming.

355
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,097
Here.

356
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,473
Commander.

357
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,058
Take it.

358
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,147
You're holding
a piece of history.

359
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,774
Maybe even the beginnings
of life itself.

360
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,233
Unlikely.

361
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,653
It's more likely
than you think.

362
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,115
This anomaly is
as old as anything
we've ever encountered.

363
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,409
I could spend a lifetime
studying the things
it's collected.

364
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,204
And leave<i> Voyager</i>
without a first officer.

365
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,498
They'd manage.

366
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,459
Paleontology was
always my first love.

367
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,879
It's the reason
I joined Starfleet.

368
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,296
Why didn't you pursue it?

369
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,756
My sense of responsibility

370
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,591
got in the way--

371
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,511
First the Maquis,
then<i> Voyager.</i>

372
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,639
What I wanted
always seemed
to take a backseat.

373
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,018
Do you remember
what you wanted to be

374
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,602
before you were
assimilated?

375
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,065
I was assimilated
when I was a child.

376
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:36,819
I knew I wanted
to be a paleontologist
when I was six.

377
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,282
A ballerina.

378
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,079
Maybe it's not too late.

379
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,497
It was a juvenile fantasy.

380
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,124
Those are the ones
that stick with you.

381
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,625
PARIS:
<i>Heads up, folks.</i>

382
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,586
<i>I think we're getting close.</i>

383
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:01,552
I've isolated the module.
Bearing 39, mark 1-5.

384
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,137
There.

385
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,894
It appears to be intact.

386
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,979
I'm reading hull
breaches and corrosion

387
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,774
but, all things considered,
it's pretty well preserved.

388
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,526
We weren't expecting to find
a fragment this big.

389
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,780
We can't just stow it
in the aft section.

390
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,200
We'll use a tractor beam
to tow it back
to<i> Voyager.</i>

391
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,911
Captain, the
anomaly just made

392
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,580
another course change--
.003 degrees.

393
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,458
That's the third one in an hour.
Something has to be
attracting it.

394
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,376
There's nothing
on the sensors.

395
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,212
I think it enjoys
being unpredictable.

396
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,923
We know it has a taste
for electromagnetic energy.

397
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,634
So what could generate
an E.M. field large enough

398
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,595
to get its attention
but still not show up
on sensors?

399
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,224
An energy burst
from a pulsar,
a neutrino cloud.

400
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,850
Dark matter.

401
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,393
Realign the sensor array

402
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,687
to scan for E.M. fluctuations.

403
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,857
I've got
a spatial disturbance...

404
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,026
three million kilometers away.

405
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,653
It's a dark matter asteroid.

406
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,197
Bingo.
The anomaly's heading
right for it.

407
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,698
Time to impact?

408
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,659
Four minutes. Captain,

409
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,162
we can't predict how the impact
will affect the anomaly.

410
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,956
But it's a safe bet
it won't be a gentle nudge.

411
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,416
Janeway to<i> Delta Flyer.</i>
We've got a problem.

412
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,628
<i>The anomaly's</i>
<i>on a collision course</i>
<i>with a dark-matter asteroid.</i>

413
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,421
We've located
the Mars orbiter.

414
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,757
We're adapting
a tractor beam;
give us a minute.

415
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,092
You don't have it;
get out of there.

416
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,011
Captain...
Now.

417
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,430
Is the tractor beam ready?

418
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,890
Just about, sir.

419
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,018
Lock onto the module
and take us out.

420
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,519
We don't have time.

421
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,230
I gave you an order.
Commander.

422
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,983
We're not leaving
without that module.

423
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,069
Tom!

424
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,288
Captain, both the anomaly
and the asteroid
are accelerating.

425
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,332
They're attracting
each other like
a pair of magnets.

426
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,584
At this rate,
it'll impact in...
56 seconds.

427
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,546
Chakotay, you've got
less than a minute.
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

428
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,132
The module is slowing us down.

429
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,591
Maintain tractor lock.

430
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,426
How long until we clear
the anomaly?

431
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,804
At our current speed,
40 seconds.

432
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,014
We can do it.

433
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,312
30 seconds to impact.
They're still not clear.

434
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,771
Chakotay, status.

435
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,233
We're on our way.

436
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,569
20 seconds.

437
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,630
The gravimetric distortions
are increasing.

438
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,132
The<i> Flyer.</i>

439
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,800
I've lost the signal.

440
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,566
How badly is he damaged?

441
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,818
He's got a severe concussion
and internal injuries.

442
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,487
We need to get him
back to<i> Voyager.</i>
That may not be possible.

443
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,574
Communications,
shields and propulsion
are still off-line.

444
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,952
Well, he's
stable for now.
I'll give you a hand.

445
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,747
We can repair the shields,
but the engines
are unsalvageable.

446
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,708
It can't be that bad.
It's worse.

447
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,295
The anomaly is showing signs
of returning to subspace.

448
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,797
We have less than two hours.

449
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,601
<i>( groaning )</i>

450
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,400
He's regaining
consciousness.

451
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,112
Easy.
Easy. Lie still.

452
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,948
It feels like I went ten rounds
with an Andorian.

453
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,576
More like 20.
You were hit with
a plasma discharge.

454
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,288
The gravimetric surge
from the asteroid

455
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,459
caught us at the edge
of the anomaly,
tossed us back inside.

456
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,210
The command module?

457
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:07,006
It's adrift, 300 meters
off our port bow.

458
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,966
Then we can still
salvage it.
Not so fast.

459
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,884
We can't get engines
or shields back on-line,

460
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,719
not to mention
a tractor beam.

461
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,181
We'll be lucky to
get out of this
in one piece.

462
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,641
I can help.
You're in worse shape
than this ship.

463
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,644
You want to help?
Lie in the bed--
doctor's orders.

464
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,399
Another
gravimetric surge.

465
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,777
I'll see if I can reinforce
the structural integrity field.

466
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,451
You might try drawing power
from auxiliary life support.

467
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,703
The system was
damaged as well.

468
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,288
What about
the secondary relays?

469
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,040
They're off-line.

470
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,125
That doesn't give us
many choices.

471
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,002
Try rerouting
the phaser couplings.

472
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,754
We explored that option
while you were unconscious.

473
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,547
Then maybe you can
bring me up-to-date.

474
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,009
There's no time.
I suggest you recuperate.

475
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,178
We have the situation
under control.

476
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,554
It doesn't look that way
from here.

477
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,641
I'm still in command
of this mission. I want
to know what's going on.

478
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:05,398
Very well.
We were ordered by the Captain
to leave this anomaly,

479
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,816
but you chose
to disobey that command.

480
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,152
As a result of your obsession
with the module,

481
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,238
we are now trapped
along with it.

482
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,490
In all probability,
we won't survive without...

483
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,450
Point taken.

484
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,577
Now, why don't you continue...
without the attitude?

485
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,750
An inventory of
the damaged systems.

486
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,793
Read it for yourself.

487
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,718
I made a mistake.

488
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,345
I put the mission
at risk.

489
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,931
You put our lives at risk.

490
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,438
Well, if we don't make it out...

491
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,606
someone's bound
to come looking for us

492
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,276
in a few hundred years.

493
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:57,324
Diffusing a tense situation
with humor... remember?

494
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,077
JANEWAY:
Voyager<i> to</i> Delta Flyer.

495
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,664
They're using a probe
as a transmission relay.

496
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,293
Voyager<i> to Chakotay,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

497
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,962
<i>We can't detect you.</i>
Captain, we can hear you.

498
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,005
I'm matching their frequency.

499
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,550
<i>Voyager,</i> this is the<i> Delta</i>
<i>Flyer,</i> respond.

500
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,677
JANEWAY:
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>What's your status?</i>

501
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,390
We've sustained heavy damage,
Captain, but we're alive.

502
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,850
It's good to hear your voice.

503
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,063
We could install
the same shielding

504
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,274
on a class-two shuttle,
and take it in.

505
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,776
It took us hours to
make the modifications
to the<i> Flyer.</i>

506
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,570
We've only got 82 minutes

507
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,905
before this thing
disappears into subspace.

508
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,533
It may be possible
to modify a tractor beam

509
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,785
to cut through
the gravimetric interference.

510
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,371
You'll never be able to get it
all the way to the core.

511
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,624
Start working on it anyway.

512
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,792
You said all the energy
conduits are fused?

513
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,669
Correct. We can't get power
to any of the primary systems.

514
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,965
If the replicators were working,
we could whip up a new
plasma manifold

515
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,716
and be on our way.

516
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,969
What if I could get you
an old manifold?

517
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,638
Excuse me?

518
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,722
The command module
may be three centuries old,

519
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,475
but the power
distribution system

520
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,019
isn't that different
from the<i> Flyer's.</i>

521
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,356
Right here.

522
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,108
This control panel
in the main cockpit--

523
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,444
It was called
an ion distributor.

524
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:18,364
With a few tweaks,
it could be modified
to channel warp plasma.

525
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,407
SEVEN:
Even if it were possible,

526
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,700
we'd have to obtain
the object before we
can adapt it.

527
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,287
Do you have
enough power to beam
one of you to the module?

528
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,914
Yes, ma'am. I'll go.

529
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,291
<i>Not so fast, Tom.</i>

530
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,668
If another
gravimetric surge hits,

531
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,586
we'll need you at the helm.

532
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,837
Seven?

533
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,673
Are you encouraging me

534
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,924
to volunteer again, Captain?

535
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,843
You read my mind.

536
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,347
Come on.

537
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,516
Just a little closer.

538
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,441
That's it for thrusters,

539
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,527
but I got us within
transporter range.

540
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,611
<i>Ready?</i>

541
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,904
Stand by.

542
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,545
Ironic. You're doing
what I've always dreamt of.

543
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:17,005
Remember,

544
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,091
when you set foot
in that module,

545
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,343
you'll be stepping
into history.

546
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,387
History is irrelevant.

547
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,971
Irrelevant?

548
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,185
Do me a favor.

549
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,104
When you're over there,

550
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,357
download whatever you can
from their database,

551
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,194
and also, take a minute
to look around...

552
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,321
so you can tell us
what it was like.

553
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,156
There may not be time...

554
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,787
but I'll try.

555
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,581
Good luck.

556
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,263
PARIS:
<i>What's it like in there?</i>

557
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,806
Dark.

558
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,356
The ambient temperature
is minus 260 degrees.

559
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,654
There appear to be fractures
in the aft bulkhead.

560
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,447
<i>Is the cockpit intact?</i>

561
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,449
Yes.

562
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,389
I've brought the main
computer on-line.

563
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,476
KELLY:
<i>I've lost contact with</i>
<i>the team on the surface...</i>

564

PARIS:
<i>What was that?</i>

566
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,358
There's an active data file.

567
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,485
<i>It appears to contain</i>
<i>log entries.</i>

568
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,654
Can you play them for us?

569
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,615
I believe so.

570
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,283

571
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,162
Consider it my last request.

573
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:26,092

574
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,388

00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,934
Could you hear that, Chakotay?
It's amazing.

577
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,896
Everyone assumed
he was killed instantly.

578
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,940
<i>It's very calm--</i>

579
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,776

580
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,319

581
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,112
The way I figure it,

582
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,906
if there's a way in,
there's got to be a way out.

583
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,533
I'm going to fire up
the transpectral imager

584
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,993
before I initiate another
engine burn...

585
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,414
collect as much data as I can.

586
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,167
Jeannie, I may not be bringing
you back a Mars rock,

587
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,838
but I promise you, I'm going to
do everything I can to get home.

<i>Ares Four,</i> mission record,

589
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,555
I'm starting to feel like Jonah.

590
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,641
How long was he in the belly
of that whale? Three days?

591
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,185
I got him beat
by a day or two already.

592
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:26,194
The E.M. interference
is disrupting communications
and Lidar,

593
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,238
and I can't see the stars,

594
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,783
so there's no way
I can get a fix on my position.

595
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,326
If this thing's moving as fast
as it was when it pulled me in,

596
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,662
I could be a long way
from Mars by now.

597
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,332
The imager's
been working overtime,

598
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,501
cataloguing
all the matter in here,

599
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,003
but a lot of it defies analysis.

600
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,965
I think we're going to need to
make room on the periodic table.

601
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,888
Where the hell am I?

00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,173
I have the distributor.
I'm downloading Lieutenant
Kelly's database.

687
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,634
<i>Hurry. We're running</i>
<i>out of time.</i>

688
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,144
<i>( beeping )</i>

689
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,824
Lock onto my bio-signature
and my com badge.

690
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,493
PARIS:<i> Seven?</i>
Energize.

691
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,552
<i>Delta Flyer,</i> report.

692
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,429
PARIS: <i> We're trying</i>
<i>to integrate the distributor.</i>

693
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,598
<i>Stand by, Captain.</i>
How long do they have?

694
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,517
Four minutes.

695
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,855
Try bypassing
the power couplings.

696
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,190
No effect.

697
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,233
Resequence the ion modulators;

698
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,401
see if that does it.

699
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,948
SEVEN:
Power conversion in progress.

700
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,493
We have propulsion,
shields.

701
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,204
The plasma flow
is still fluctuating.

702
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,496
Stay on top of it.

703
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,126
Paris to<i> Voyager.</i>
JANEWAY:<i> Go ahead.</i>

704
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,503
Open the shuttle bay doors;
we're coming home.

705
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,505
Acknowledged.

706
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,674
Laying in an escape trajectory.

707
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,265
The ellipse
is returning to subspace.

708
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,766
The<i> Flyer.</i>

709
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,601
They're approaching
the perimeter...

710
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,563
2,000 meters... 1,800.

711
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,273
The anomaly's submerging.

712
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,652
Are we in tractor range?
TUVOK: Not yet.

713
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,363
Take us closer.
Captain?

714
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,281
Do it.
They are still
out of reach.

715
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,116
Another 300 meters.
Closer.

716
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,701
We'll be pulled
right in with them.

717
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,452
Just a few more meters.

718
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,542
We're too close!
I've got a lock.

719
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,212
Reverse thrusters,
full impulse.

720
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:49,072
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 53301.2:</i>

721
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:53,576
<i>the away team collected</i>
<i>over 60 terraquads of data</i>
<i>on the anomaly.</i>

722
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,828
<i>Before we begin</i>
<i>to analyze them,</i>

723
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,207
<i>we've decided</i>
<i>to pay our respects</i>
<i>to an old colleague.</i>

724
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,583
Space.

725
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,587
Literally,
it means "nothing..."

726
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,465
a vacuum
between stars and planets,

727
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,343
but by the same token,
it means everything.

728
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,221
It's what connects
all our worlds--

729
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,473
Vulcan, Kronos,

730
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,310
Talax, Earth.

731
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,687
Centuries ago,

732
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,858
mankind sent its first wave
of explorers into that void.

733
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,320
Astronauts like Mr. Kelly.

734
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,656
They paved the way
for the first colonies,

735
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,741
the first starships,

736
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,535
for those of us
who've made space our home.

737
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,040
We commend
the spirit and the bravery

738
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,835
of Lieutenant John Mark Kelly

739
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,629
as we commit his body...

740
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,673
to space.

741
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,134
He will not be forgotten.

742
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,594
Captain...

743
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,725
I did not know
this individual.

744
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,396
Had I encountered him
while I was a Borg,

745
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,315
I would have found
his technology

746
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,608
unworthy of assimilation.

747
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,364
But we are more alike
than one might think.

748
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,784
In a sense,
his desire to explore

749
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,912
was not unlike
a quest for perfection.

750
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:24,709
<i>His contribution</i>
<i>helped secure humanity's future</i>

751
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,711
<i>and in some ways, my own.</i>

752
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,718
<i>( softly ):</i>
The Yankees...

753
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,720
in six games.

754
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,397
All hands, attention.

755
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,902
Honor guard.

756
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,740
(<i> whistle blowing</i> )
