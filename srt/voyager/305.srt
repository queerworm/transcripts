JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 50074.3.</i>

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,091
<i>We have detected evidence</i>

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,802
<i>that a wormhole</i>
<i>recently appeared</i>

4
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,680
<i>and then disappeared</i>
<i>in a nearby solar system.</i>

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,307
<i>We're on our way there</i>
<i>to investigate.</i>

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,184
Based on the residual
neutrino levels,

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,811
I'd estimate it's been
at least six months

8
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,896
since the wormhole's
last appearance.

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,190
From the dispersal pattern
of the interstellar plasma,

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,108
it looks like
it isn't fixed.

11
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,777
It seems to be traveling
through space.

12
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,570
It may not be fixed
on this end,

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,406
but if it's shown up in the
same location more than once,

14
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,868
it's possible its exit point
is constant

15
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,619
and it's wagging
around the Delta Quadrant

16
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,537
like the tail on a dog.

17
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,163
PARIS:
Approaching

18
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,290
the last-known coordinates
of the wormhole, Captain.

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,669
All stop. Mr. Kim, initiate
continuous neutrino scans.

20
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,753
Aye, Captain.

21
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,171
Mr. Tuvok,
scan the planets

22
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,631
in this system
for life signs.

23
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,090
Maybe there's
someone around here

24
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,759
who can give us
some helpful information.

25
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,887
TUVOK:
I am picking up
an M-Class atmosphere

26
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,013
on the second planet.

27
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,848
Humanoid life signs.

28
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,265
However, metallurgic

29
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,643
analysis indicates
a preindustrial civilization.

30
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,229
A Bronze-Age level
of technology.

31
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,064
Curious, Captain.

32
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,941
What is?

33
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,651
I'm detecting evidence
that these people

34
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,111
have had contact
with the Alpha Quadrant.

35
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,989
What kind of evidence?

36
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,532
It is a modulated
energy discharge

37
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,952
that appears to be consistent
with the recent use...

38
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,787
of a replicator.

39
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,822
If they've got
a replicator,

40
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,824
it could mean
the wormhole leads

41
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,159
to the Alpha Quadrant

42
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,743
and that someone's
traveled through it.

43
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,745
I appreciate
your enthusiasm, Ensign,

44
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,539
but before we indulge
in too much speculation,

45
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,707
let's see if
we can back up

46
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,542
your assumptions
with some facts.

47
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,794
Commander Chakotay,
I want you and Lieutenant Paris

48
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,629
to go down to that planet
and have a look around.

49
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,589
Launch a high-resolution
reconnaissance probe

50
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,133
to gather information

51
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,301
about the local population's
dress and appearance.

52
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,511
Aye, Captain.

53
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,138
In the meantime, Ensign,
why don't you

54
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,223
and Lieutenant Torres
get started on a phase profile

55
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,309
of this elusive wormhole's
neutrino emissions.

56
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:52,149
Let's see if we can confirm that
it leads to the Alpha Quadrant.

57
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,737
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 50074.5.</i>

58
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,489
<i>Based on information provided</i>
<i>by the probe,</i>

59
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,533
<i>we have replicated local attire</i>

60
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,994
<i>for Commander Chakotay</i>
<i>and Lieutenant Paris.</i>

61
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,413
<i>They have gone to the surface</i>
<i>to investigate.</i>

62
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,310
This is where we picked up
a replicator signature?

63
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,854
Hard to believe,
isn't it?

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,858
"Oh, those many years ago,

65
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,653
"the people's hearts
were sad and low,

66
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,740
"then the Sages
to the city came.

67
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,660
"They came upon a burning flame.

68
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,329
"Just as the seer
said they would,

69
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,581
"they lifted

70
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,751
Takar's blinding hood."

71
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,921
Well...

72
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,051
what did you think?

73
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,510
It was...

74
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,263
uh, very nice.

75
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,889
Nice?

76
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,725
I'll wager you've never heard
"The Song of the Sages"

77
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,230
more beautifully
or faithfully recited.

78
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,441
He's got a point.

79
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,278
We have never heard
"The Song of the Sages"

80
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,113
more beautifully recited.

81
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,324
As you know,
the first verse is free,

82
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,952
but the next verse will
cost you three frangs.

83
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,453
I'm sorry. Not today.

84
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,664
But I need money...

85
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,624
for ointment for my eye.

86
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,084
Please, gentlemen...

87
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,294
Oh, go away, old man.

88
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,335
Can't you see?

89
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,172
These are men of commerce.

90
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,633
They have no business
with your silly poems.

91
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,971
And may I say, gentlemen,
you both have very fine shoes.

92
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,931
Excuse me?

93
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,391
Well, the Sages say
you can tell a great deal

94
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,102
about a man from his shoes,

95
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,522
and I can tell from your shoes
that you're men of refinement...

96
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,691
affluence.

97
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,526
We've really
got to be going.

98
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,320
MALE:
Well, you're obviously
new in Takar.

99
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,361
Perhaps I could

100
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,738
interest you in some property.

101
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,990
No, thank you.

102
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,992
We're not planning
on settling here.

103
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,409
What about some transportation?

104
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,204
The Sages say "time's an asset."

105
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,498
And you shouldn't
waste your assets

106
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,292
walking everywhere you go.

107
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,836
You'd be wearing out
those fine shoes of yours.

108
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,254
(<i> chuckles</i> )

109
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,257
I'm sorry, but we're
really not interested.

110
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,258
Tom?

111
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,010
Excuse me.

112
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,141
I'm picking up a narrow-band
EM dampening field

113
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,267
around that building.

114
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,768
It looks like
some sort of temple.

115
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,770
Then I'd say the temple's
where we ought to look.

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,523
Oh, thank the Sages
I found you.

117
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,360
You can't enter the temple
without wearing your ears.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,986
Look, friend, I
thought I told you...

119
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,364
What do you mean
"wearing your ears?"

120
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,074
(<i> chuckles</i> )

121
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,784
You're really not Takarian,
are you?

122
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,994
Nobody visits the temple

123
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,914
without displaying
at least one ear.

124
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,463
It must be some
sort of fetish.

125
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,632
If you're not wearing an ear,
you could be fined,

126
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,260
even arrested.

127
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,011
Wouldn't want that to happen.

128
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,304
And let me guess.

129
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,764
It just so happens

130
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,058
that you could sell us
a couple of these ears.

131
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,185
As a matter of fact...

132
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,686
I can.

133
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,702
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

134
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,038
<i>I've been asked</i>
<i>to join Lieutenant Torres</i>

135
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,915
<i>and Ensign Kim</i>
<i>in the Science Lab</i>

136
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,960
<i>to hear what they've termed</i>
<i>as "very exciting news."</i>

137
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,502
KIM:
We've been able to confirm

138
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,463
that the wormhole does lead
to the Alpha Quadrant.

139
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,007
The problem is
that on this end,

140
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,717
it's jumping from point
to point so quickly

141
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,261
that even at maximum warp,

142
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,554
by the time we got to
its next probable location,

143
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,639
it would be gone.

144
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,224
So we were thinking

145
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,101
if you can't bring
the ship to the wormhole,

146
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,353
bring the wormhole
to the ship.

147
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,856
We've detected a subspace
instability at our location

148
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,942
that's a result of the
wormhole's last appearance here.

149
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,487
If we could somehow amplify
and polarize that instability,

150
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,407
we might be able to get
the wormhole to reappear.

151
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,952
Sort of like using a magnet
to move a compass needle.

152
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,162
The question is:

153
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,747
how do we polarize
the instability?

154
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,459
Uh, we haven't figured
that part out yet.

155
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,924
Gentlemen, as the Sages say,
your goods are now my goods.

156
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,967
And my feet

157
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:29,968
are now cold.

158
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,386
Perhaps I could

159
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,514
interest you in some
discounted mining futures.

160
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,974
Don't push your luck.

161
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,558
You know, so far,

162
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,519
I can't say that I like
this town very much.

Now what other wisdom
have you learned from the Sages?

175

"A wise man can hear

00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,232
We found the replicator,
Captain.

180
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,569
ALL:
A wise man can hear profit
in the wind.

181
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,992
MALE:
And now, dear friends,
in our great beneficence,

182
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,287
we will allow you
to come forward

183
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,332
to honor our greatness
and glorify our generosity.

184
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,252
Approach the Holy Sages.

185
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,758
Approach your gods
and speak your heart.

186
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,222
Ehh!

187
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,770
I am a sandal maker

188
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,272
from the poorest
quarter of the city.

189
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,731
The laziest, you mean.

190
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,025
Speak, my friend.

191
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,069
What is your business
with the Sages?

192
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,029
I am in need of assistance.

193
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,990
My sandal shop is failing.

194
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,741
I can no longer feed my family.

195
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,285
Same old song.

196
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,953
My wife,
and her mother,

197
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,373
my five children, the baby.

198
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,918
That's seven employees--
eight, if you count the infant.

199
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,171
How can your shop be failing?

200
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,714
You're not paying them, are you?

201
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,509
My mother-in-law is ill.

202
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,636
My children are very young.

203
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,888
Oh. Don't tell me
none of them are working.

204
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,350
Ignorant, lobeless fools!

205
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,938
Exploitation begins at home.

206
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,233
ALL:
Exploitation begins at home.

207
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,822
Exploitation begins at home.

208
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,450
Exploitation begins at home.

209
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,707
I understand my mistake

210
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,751
and I promise
to begin exploiting my family

211
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,420
before the end of the day,

212
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,675
but could I have some food
and some medicine?

213
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,092
Ohh!

214
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,011
Until my business improves.

215
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,682
You shall have something
far more valuable--

216
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,725
one copy
of The Rules of Acquisition.

217
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,603
Cheapest binding possible.

218
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,285
That'll be ten frangs.

219
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,037
But I...

220
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,006
That's all for today.
You may return tomorrow.

221
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,303
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

222
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,722
<i>The away team has returned</i>

223
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,599
<i>with some</i>
<i>very disturbing observations</i>

224
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,975
<i>about the situation</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

225
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,768
CHAKOTAY:
It seems the people
have a myth--

226
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,731
an epic poem called
"The Song of the Sages,"

227
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,399
which predicts the arrival

228
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,901
of two demigods
from the sky, the Sages,

229
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,904
who would rule over the people
as benevolent protectors.

230
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,490
But these Ferengi are
anything but benevolent.

231
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,451
What they've done is co-opt
the local mythology

232
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,161
by using advanced technology
like the replicator

233
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,663
to convince the people

234
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,540
that they're the two Sages
spoken of in the poem.

235
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,250
Of course,
being Ferengi,

236
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,127
they haven't just
co-opted the mythology.

237
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,963
They've cornered
the market... on everything.

238
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,548
It's disgusting, Captain.

239
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,799
The two Ferengi live
in a palatial temple,

240
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,303
while the people are lucky to
have a roof over their heads.

241
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,262
Apparently, it wasn't

242
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,513
always like that.

243
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,181
According to the
people that we met,

244
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,807
before the
Ferengi came,

245
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,518
the society may have
been primitive,

246
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,810
but it was flourishing.

247
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,313
What I'd like to know

248
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,232
is how two Ferengi got
to the Delta Quadrant.

249
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,109
We've been looking
into that. Mr. Tuvok.

250
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,570
According to Starfleet
computer records,

251
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,113
approximately seven years ago,

252
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,074
the Federation Starship
<i>Enterprise</i> hosted negotiations

253
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,410
for ownership
of the Barzan wormhole.

254
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,079
Included among the bidding
parties were two Ferengi--

255
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,040
minor functionaries
known as Arridor and Kol.

256
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,251
And this Barzan wormhole--

257
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,671
it's the same one
we've discovered now?

258
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,380
Apparently,
but we've confirmed

259
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,174
what nobody knew
at the time.

260
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,135
The wormhole is fixed
in the Alpha Quadrant,

261
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,844
but in the Delta Quadrant,
it jumps around.

262
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,846
It turned out
to be worthless.

263
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,932
But the Ferengi
were not aware of that,

264
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,267
and during a nefarious attempt

265
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,311
to secure
the wormhole for themselves,

266
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,314
they were pulled into it and
deposited in the Delta Quadrant.

267
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,775
Now that we've found them, what
are we going to do with them?

268
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,694
Well, I certainly don't intend
to leave them here

269
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,029
to continue exploiting
an innocent society.

270
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,531
How are you two
coming with getting

271
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,658
the wormhole back here
and reopened?

272
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,410
We've been bombarding the area
of the subspace instability

273
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,787
with verteron particles.

274
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,080
So far, everything is going
according to plan,

275
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,541
but it's tricky.

276
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,042
There are a hundred factors

277
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,627
that could deflect
it from this sector--

278
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,128
a gravimetric shift,
a solar flare...

279
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,839
And even if we're lucky
enough to get it here,

280
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,382
it won't be around
for long.

281
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,258
We'll have a very short
window of opportunity

282
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,593
to get through.

283
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,679
Well, if we can get
the wormhole here,

284
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,682
we'll be taking two additional
passengers with us.

285
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,100
We'll turn them over to Ferengi
authorities when we get there.

286
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,186
TUVOK:
Captain,
I must remind you

287
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,355
that the Ferengi are not
members of the Federation.

288
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,899
They are not bound
by the Prime Directive,

289
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,776
nor would it seem
that the Prime Directive

290
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,110
would allow us to interfere

291
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,405
with the internal affairs
of this society,

292
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,324
as much as we may disapprove
of what the Ferengi are doing.

293
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,705
The Federation did host
the negotiations,

294
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,332
and if it weren't
for those negotiations,

295
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,043
the Ferengi wouldn't be here.

296
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,421
So one could say...

297
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,257
without being unreasonable,
I think,

298
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,261
that the Federation is partially
responsible for what's happened

299
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,223
and therefore, duty bound
to correct the situation.

300
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,772
That is a most logical
interpretation, Captain.

301
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,649
FERENGI:
143...

302
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,651
144...

303
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,237
145...

304
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,489
146...

305
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,034
147, 148...

306
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,000
Profits from the Ga'nah Province
are down.

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,502
Hmm?

308
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,504
Are you listening to me?

309
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,508
I said profits from the Ga'nah
Province are down.

310
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,551
Down?!

311
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,595
Profits are down?

312
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,513
Hey, both of you
leave me alone.

313
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,559
Can't you see I'm trying
to conduct business here?

314
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,269
I'm... sorry...

315
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,355
Arridor.
It's just that...

316
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,817
they can't get enough
of my lobes.

317
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,401
Where were we?

318
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,946
Oh, yeah.
Profits are down?

319
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,198
And what are we going to do
about it?

320
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,575
What are you looking at me for?

321
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,243
Ask that idiot Kafar.

322
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,705
He's in charge of collections
in the Ga'nah Province.

323
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,998
Kafar!

324
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,752
You called, Great Sage?

325
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,797
What is the 95th Rule
of Acquisition?

326
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,131
Huh!

327
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,717
"Expand or die"?

328
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,345
He knows the rules
better than you do.

329
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,638
He does not.

330
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,931
And where is it

331
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,851
we've been trying
to expand... this month?

332
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,311
Into the Ga'nah
Province, Great Sage.

333
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,439
And who is in charge
of collections

334
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,941
in the Ga'nah Province?

335
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,484
I am, Great Sage.

336
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,945
Then why are profits down,
you idiot?!

337
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,404
Where's our money?!

338
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,114
Please forgive me,
Lesser Sage.

339
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,409
Oh, I told you to stop
calling me...

340
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,690
Who are you?

341
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,066
Captain Kathryn Janeway

342
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,527
of the Federation
starship<i> Voyager.</i>

343
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,195
The Federation?

344
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,113
♪Shut up, Kol.
Let me handle this.

345
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,120
What, may I ask

346
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,249
is the Federation doing
in the Delta Quadrant?

347
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,251
It's a long story,
but suffice it to say,

348
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,962
we've been stranded here
for the past two years.

349
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,840
We're on our way back
to the Alpha Quadrant

350
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,759
and we're taking
you with us.

351
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,010
This is an outrage.

352
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,429
We won't allow you
to tr...

353
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,264
You're crazy.

354
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,516
It would take decades
to get back from here.

355
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,685
Show them,
Mr. Tuvok.

356
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,230
We have been bombarding

357
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,900
a local subspace instability
with verteron particles.

358
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,693
If all goes
according to plan,

359
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,152
the Barzan wormhole

360
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,238
should reopen
at our present location

361
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,656
in a matter
of hours.

362
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,867
And if all doesn't go
according to plan?

363
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,454
One way or another,
you're coming with us.

364
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,497
We've been kidnapped.

365
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,291
Snatched...

366
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,294
from the embrace of bliss.

367
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,046
It's all over.

368
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,173
No more limitless profits...

369
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,094
no more unquestioning adulation

370
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,511
of the masses...

371
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,138
no more

372
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,808
quadruple lobe rubs.

373
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,686
If I'm not mistaken, Captain,
the Federation has rules,

374
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,187
and those rules forbid you

375
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,690
to interfere
with indigenous cultures.

376
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,275
What about
your interference?

377
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,986
You've taken
these people's religion

378
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,780
and manipulated it
for your own selfish purposes,

379
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,365
pretended to be their Sages.

380
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,994
Who's to say we aren't
their Sages, Captain?

381
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,536
Don't be ridiculous.

382
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,582
The song is sung of Sages
who can perform miracles,

383
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,919
which, thanks to
our replicator, we do.

384
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,171
The song is sung of men

385
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,174
coming from the sky
on a burning flame--

386
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,301
when we crash-landed
our shuttle

387
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,512
in their quaint
little town square,

388
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,347
trailing behind us

389
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:46,268
a roaring ribbon
of burning plasma.

390
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,855
You mean we really
are the Sages?

391
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,985
The point is, Captain,

392
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,402
that these people

393
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,363
have believed
for centuries

394
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,740
that gods,
known as the Sages,

395
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,868
would deliver them
from their strife.

396
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,953
To them...

397
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,291
we are those Sages.

398
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,211
What happens to a people
when they lose their gods?

399
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,922
Despair...

400
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,923
Mm-hmm.

401
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,924
Fear...

402
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:17,925
Mmm...

403
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,219
Confusion.

404
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,804
And how can you...

405
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,141
as a moral people,

406
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,310
blithely tear down
the spiritual structure

407
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,312
that has supported a community

408
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,566
since before their gods
were flesh?

409
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,569
What would you
be leaving them with?

410
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,779
Tell us, Arridor,
tell us.

411
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,156
Darkness...

412
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,617
Doubt...

413
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,995
Hopelessness.

414
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,040
That was beautiful.

415
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,295
Mr. Tuvok...

416
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,508
transport them back
to the surface.

417
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,308
We did it, Arridor.

418
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,476
We won.

419
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,329
We can't just leave
the Ferengi there

420
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,207
to continue exploiting
those poor people.

421
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,416
But Arridor is right.

422
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,293
We can't kidnap
their gods either.

423
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,421
What other option is there?

424
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,340
What if the gods
didn't just disappear

425
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,843
suddenly and inexplicably?

426
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,721
What if they left
voluntarily? Gracefully?

427
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,474
The gods would be gone, but
people would be prepared for it,

428
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,102
and they might accept it as
a natural, ordained occurrence.

429
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,186
Exactly.

430
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,729
But how do we get
two Ferengi

431
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,065
to just walk away
from a monopoly

432
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,691
on an entire economy?

433
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,568
What motivates a Ferengi?

434
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,861
Profit.

435
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,155
Then we must find
a way to make it

436
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,990
more profitable
for them to leave.

437
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,325
Or less profitable to stay.

438
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,452
How do we do that?

439
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,746
We have to out-Ferengi...

440
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,332
the Ferengi.

441
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,171
Mmm.

442
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,672
There we are.

443
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,967
I've reconfigured
the matter/antimatter generator

444
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,052
to produce an ionic
disruption field

445
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,553
around the temple square.

446
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,681
No more
unexpected beam-outs.

447
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,683
Let's see how smart
those humans

448
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,101
think they are now.

449
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,270
(<i> loud knock at door</i> )

450
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,313
Kafar!

451
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,691
You called, Great Sage?

452
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,860
Find out who
has the audacity

453
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,736
to disturb us in
our Divine Vault.

454
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,322
Uh...

455
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,572
And make it quick.

456
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,162
Who has the audacity
to disturb the Holy Sages

457
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,247
in their Divine Vault?

458
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,377
Grand Nagus!
Grand Nagus!

459
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,633
Not the Grand Nagus.

460
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm his official messenger--

461
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,637
the Grand Proxy.

462
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,188
But, Grand Proxy,
how did you...?

463
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,939
Through the Barzan wormhole.

464
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,192
The humans stabilized it

465
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,902
temporarily,
and were kind enough

466
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,486
to send a probe through

467
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:29,700
informing us of your...
impressive operation.

468
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,538
Well, of course
the Grand Nagus,

469
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,456
or his official messenger

470
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,667
the Grand Proxy,
is always

471
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,586
welcome in our
little world--

472
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,714
our rather poverty-stricken
little world--

473
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,008
and we're thrilled he
has taken an interest

474
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,719
in our very modest operation.

475
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,721
If I were you,

476
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:54,350
I'd save the groveling
for the Nagus himself.

477
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,062
Y-You mean, the Grand Nagus
is coming here, too?

478
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,690
Of course not, you idiot.

479
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,567
You two are
going to him.

480
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,444
You've been recalled.

481
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,446
Recalled?
We're ruined.

482
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,408
GRAND PROXY:
You will be leaving immediately.

483
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,993
This is not a time
to lose one's lobes.

484
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,536
I'll think of something.

485
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,172
Perhaps the Grand Nagus
doesn't understand

486
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:29,051
that profits in this market
depend upon our presence.

487
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:34,390
You see, to these people,
we're, well... gods, actually.

488
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,517
Without us to make the fools
cower in submission,

489
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,686
there will be
no profits to be had.

490
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,357
The Grand Nagus knows
all about your little scheme--

491
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,567
"The Song of the Sages"
and all the rest of it.

492
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,819
Very clever.

493
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,029
But he wants you
and all your acquisitions

494
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,448
back on Ferenginar

495
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,325
before the wormhole
closes again.

496
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,661
I'm sure the Grand Nagus
wouldn't want to lose

497
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,998
such a lucrative
revenue stream.

498
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,251
The wormhole seems to open
and close on its own

499
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,752
every seven or eight years.

500
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,839
We would be willing
to forward a fair share

501
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,300
of the profits
every time it does.

502
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,344
Say, hmm... 20 percent?

503
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,972
That's coming out
of your half.

504
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,223
Shut up.

505
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,351
The Grand Nagus
has no intention

506
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,687
of losing profits
from this market.

507
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,689
That's why he's already
got a team of scientists

508
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,359
investigating
the human's technology--

509
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,487
to see if we can find a way
to open and close the wormhole

510
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,364
whenever we want.

511
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,073
Then perhaps
the Grand Nagus

512
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,950
could simply
recall one of us

513
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,369
and leave the other behind

514
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,037
to administer
the operation.

515
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,456
You could take Kol
back with you.

516
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,166
Hey, wait a minute!
I don't think that...

517
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,709
That's enough!

518
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,212
The Grand Nagus
has recalled you both.

519
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,047
It's nonnegotiable.

520
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,716
Of course, the Nagus

521
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,593
doesn't want to upset
the local population.

522
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,222
He may want to send others
in your place.

523
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,932
That's why he wants you
to make a little speech

524
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,394
telling the people that their
Holy Sages have been recalled

525
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,769
to the Divine Treasury,

526
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,147
or whatever it is the people
around here call it.

527
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,733
Then he wants you
to tell them not to worry--

528
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,818
that everything
will be all right without you.

529
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,947
Then he wants you to thank them
for their generosity.

530
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,491
Thank them?

531
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,994
The 299th Rule of Acquisition--

532
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,748
"Whenever you exploit someone,
it never hurts to thank them.

533
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,252
That way, it's easier
to exploit them the next time."

534
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,545
Wait a minute.

535
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,924
There's only 285
Rules of Acquisition.

536
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,634
You've been gone
a very long time.

537
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,723
Oh...

538
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,894
By the way, did I mention
that the Nagus is appropriating

539
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:44,937
all your holdings?

540
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,730
What?
All?

541
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,441
All.

542
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,568
The least you can
do is let us keep

543
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,528
the females.

544
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:57,116
I'll be back in 20 minutes
to approve your speech.

545
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,700
I suggest you start writing.

546
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,372
You!

547
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,498
Come with me!

548
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,334
Of course,
Greater Sage.

549
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,508
What are we going to do?

550
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,720
What a Ferengi always does
in a situation this grave.

551
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,974
Panic?
No, you idiot!

552
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,394
He goes to the Rules
of Acquisition.

553
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,395
Oh.

554
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,355
Unabridged
and fully annotated

555
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,608
with all 47 commentaries,

556
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,776
all 900 major
and minor judgments,

557
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,904
all 10,000
considered opinions.

558
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:40,576
There is a Rule
for every conceivable situation.

559
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:47,416
Looks like Neelix is pulling off
quite a performance.

560
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,667
There you are.
Don't push.

561
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,669
There's plenty to go around.

562
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,589
Oh, you're quite welcome.

563
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,594
Is he another Sage?

564
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,887
Have you ever seen
a Sage give away money?

565
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,185
"Grand proxy, avoidance of..."

566
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,145
Mm-mm.

567
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,357
"Grand proxy, censure by..."

568
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,612
"Grand proxy,
encounters with..."

569
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,574
"See 'hopeless situation.'"

570
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,618
I told you there was no rule.

571
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,701
Then it's time

572
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,455
to invoke the unwritten rule.

573
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,499
The unwritten rule?

574
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,917
When no appropriate
rule applies...

575
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,378
make one up.

576
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,504
(<i> chuckles</i> )

577
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,130
That's a very good rule.

578
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,840
Now, let's see...

579
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,551
What should it be?

580
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:44,390
The Grand Proxy is the Nagus's
official messenger, right?

581
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,268
I've got it.

582
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,397
When the messenger comes
to appropriate your profits...

583
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,734
kill the messenger.

584
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,903
(<i> chuckling</i> )

585
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,156
(<i> laughing gleefully</i> )

586
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,242
Thank you!
Thank you!

587
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:23,887
Arridor!

588
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,681
Kol!

589
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,391
Show yourselves!

590
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,519
We can't keep
the Grand Nagus waiting!

591
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,439
If you say so.

592
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,023
What is the meaning of this?

593
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,193
You're not very bright
for a Grand Proxy.

594
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,363
Ex-Grand Proxy.

595
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,823
But the Grand Nagus...

596
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,076
Is on the other side
of the galaxy.

597
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,494
(<i> yells</i> )

598
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,585
(<i> grunting</i> )

599
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:01,800
Wait!

600
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,968
I'm not...

601
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm not the Grand Proxy.

602
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,889
Oh, no?
Who are you then?

603
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,184
Stop! My name is Neelix.

604
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:17,816
Neelix? That's not
a Ferengi name.

605
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,900
Wait!

606
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,111
I'm not Ferengi.

607
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,279
What?

608
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,241
I've never even met
the Grand Nagus.

609
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,076
A likely story.

610
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,286
It's true.

611
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,663
I'm wearing a disguise.

612
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,666
I'm really a Talaxian,
a crewman on<i> Voyager.</i>

613
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,377
If you're not Ferengi,
prove it!

614
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,463
I'm not sure how.

615
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,679
Doesn't that hurt?

616
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,054
I can't feel a thing.

617
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,311
He really isn't a Ferengi.

618
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,773
On your feet.

619
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,443
All right,

620
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,902
Talaxian,

621
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,197
back to your ship.

622
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,865
And tell those humans

623
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,908
to keep their hands
out of our pockets...

624
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,619
or else.

625
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,580
And stay out!

626
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,051
We won.

627
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,427
We won!

628
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,137
No, my friend.

629
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,056
Not exactly.

630
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,683
To be precise...

631
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,434
we won again.

632
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,687
(<i> laughs</i> )

633
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,500
What happened?

634
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,835
Suffice it to say,

635
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,212
they know I'm not
the Grand Proxy.

636
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,505
Oh, great.

637
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,799
Let's get to the shuttle.

638
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,927
Who<i> are</i> you?

639
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,095
I'm... uh...

640
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,346
well...

641
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,766
You are another Holy One,
aren't you?

642
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,810
That's right.

643
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,478
Uh... another Holy One.

644
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,564
Then you'll appreciate this.

645
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,066
"The Sages in the sky did dwell

646
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,527
"upon white clouds
that held them well,

647
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,613
"until the sentry rang the bell,

648
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:31,784
the Holy Sages never fell."

649
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,035
That'll be three frangs, please.

650
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,413
But we didn't ask
you to recite it.

651
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,123
You heard it, didn't you?

652
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,459
CHAKOTAY:
Your poem's very nice,
but we're in a hurry.

653
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,919
No, please, sir.

654
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,462
My eye.

655
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,924
Look, friend, I'm sorry
about your eye, really, but...

656
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,550
Wait a minute.

657
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,846
Wasn't your patch...
on the other side?

658
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,640
Oh.

659
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,351
Sir?

660
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,519
We've got to go.

661
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,854
Wait, please.

662
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,398
I'll throw in
another verse gratis.

663
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,818
"But when the ringing
called them here,

664
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,612
from the sky
they did appear..."

665
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,489
Tell me something.

666
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,283
What happens to the Sages
at the end of the song?

667
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,993
Oh... let me see now.

668
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,370
The final verse.

669
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,875
It's been a very long time,
you know.

670
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,628
Um...

671
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,046
Those are very handsome shoes
you have, sir.

672
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,969
Ah, yes.

673
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,053
It's coming
back to me now.

674
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,933
"And there amid
the eastern lights,

675
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:41,603
"three new stars
appeared that night

Wait a minute.

00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,381
I know who you are.

684
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,661

Did you hear that?

00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,469
The Holy Pilgrim.

00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,782
I have come
to fulfill the destiny

693
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,659
that is prophesied
in "The Song of the Sages."

694
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,994
What in the name

695
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,289
of eternal destitution
is going on here?

696
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,624
Ah, there you are.

697
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,001
Do you not recognize me?

698
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,503
I am the Holy Pilgrim.

699
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,964
The Holy Pilgrim?

700
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,339
Who's the Holy Pilgrim?

701
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,050
Quiet, you idiot.

702
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,386
This man is no Holy Pilgrim.

703
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,221
He's a Talaxian!

704
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,682
ALL:
Talaxian?

705
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,560
Oh, no, Great Sage.
You are mistaken.

706
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,021
I am indeed
the Holy Pilgrim

707
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,899
and just as "The Song
of the Sages" promises,

708
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,610
"I have come
to lead you back,

709
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,195

of black."

(<i> startled murmuring</i> )

711
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,617
I have prayed
for this day to come.

712
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,911
Lead them back.

713
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,663
CROWD (<i> chanting</i> ):
Lead them back.

714
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,707
Lead them back. Lead them back.

715
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,752
Lead them back.
Lead them back.

716
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,253
What do they mean,
lead us back?

717
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,465
I don't know. It must be
part of the song.

718
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,425
I told you we should've
listened to the whole thing.

719
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,094
Well, it looks
as though you two

720
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,596
will be heading off to see
the Grand Nagus after all.

721
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,016
We'll see about that.

722
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,767
This man...

723
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,478
This man?

724
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,563
Is a false pilgrim.

725
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,525
(<i> crowd exclaiming</i> )

726
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,443
He's come to steal
your profits.

727
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,528
(<i> shocked exclamations</i> )

728
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,947
I'm not a false pilgrim

729
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,615
and I'll prove it.

730
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,992
That's our cue.

731
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,368
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

732
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,828
On my mark.

733
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,039
Stand by to initiate
the photon burst, Mr. Kim.

734
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,247
Aye, Captain.

735
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,333
Captain, I am still unable
to penetrate

736
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,127
the Ferengi dampening field.

737
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,962
If the away team
experiences difficulties,

738
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,672
we will be unable
to beam them out.

739
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,715
Keep working on it.

740
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,008
In the meantime,

741
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,634
we'll just have to rely
on their ingenuity

742
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,761
to get themselves out of there
if trouble arises.

743
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,641
The song says that

744
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,645
"Amid the eastern lights,
three new stars

745
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,147
appeared that night."

746
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,398
(<i> all agreeing</i> )

747
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,567
Look, my friends.

748
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,568
Look.

749
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,569
Right up there.

750
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,611
Now.

751
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,905
Initiating photon bursts.

752
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,034
(<i> all gasping</i> )

753
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,413
(<i> gasping</i> )

754
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,540
It's a trick.

755
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,084
He's a fraud, I tell you.

756
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,377
Kafar, arrest this man.

757
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,547
Well, arrest him!

758
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,385
(<i> yelling</i> )

759
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,430
Ow! Stop!

760
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,556
My ears!

761
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,349
What do you think
you're doing?!

762
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,644
Like the song says,
<i>Lesser Sage...</i>

763
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,939
"With the ringing of the bell,

764
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:57,316
the Sages knew
where they must dwell."

765
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,277
(<i> yelling</i> )

766
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,738
Ow!

767
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,951
Like the song says,

768
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,912
you Sages, it's time for you

769
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,747
to go back where
you came from.

770
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,373
MALE:
Yes! Yes!

771
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,792
To the sky!

772
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,793
And they must go

773
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,629
on wings of fire!

774
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,881
ALL:
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

775
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:23,051
Wings of fire!
Wings of fire!

776
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,427
Wings of fire!

777
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,013
(<i> crowd yelling</i> )

778
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,310
We are your gods!
This is outrageous!

779
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,397
Look, we are your gods.
I am your god.

780
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,941
We're the Sages.

781
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,734
Hands off of your god.

782
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,489
No. No.

783
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,907
Wait a minute, people.

784
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,451
There's no reason to interpret

785
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,579
"The Song of the Sages"
so literally.

786
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,705
Kafar!

787
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,373
Kafar! Stop them!

788
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,335
We are fulfilling
the destiny of the Sages.

789
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,046
I am the Holy Pilgrim
and I have come to tell you

790
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,300
that there's another verse
to the song.

791
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,509
It's uh, uh...

792
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,761
Please, don't burn
the Holy Ones.

793
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,805
I am sorry,
Holy Pilgrim,

794
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,182
but that's not
part of the song.

795
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,727
CROWD (<i> chanting</i> ):
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

796
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,813
Wings of fire!

797
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,899
Commander, I think now
would be a very good time

798
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,109
for that beam-out.

799
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,407
CROWD:
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

800
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,536
Wings of fire!
Wings of fire!

801
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,579
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

802
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,165
We've got to disable
the dampening field,

803
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,415
so they can beam us
out of here.

804
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,375
Where's the generator?

805
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,835
BOTH:
In the vault!

806
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,296
CROWD:
Wings of fire!
Wings of fire!

807
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:45,925
Wings of fire!
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

808
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:50,805
(<i> chanting continues</i> )

809
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,683
We still cannot establish
a transporter lock, Captain.

810
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,144
Boosting power to
the annular confinement beam.

811
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,992
Arridor?

812
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,369
What is it now?

813
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,955
We had seven years
of pure profit.

814
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,666
We did, didn't we?

815
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,503
I can't shut it down.

816
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,383
Stand back.

817
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,315
The Holy Ones have ascended!

818
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,192
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

819
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,403
JANEWAY:
<i>Is everyone okay down there,</i>
<i>Commander?</i>

820
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,820
We're all here
in one piece, Captain.

821
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,447
<i>Good work.</i>

822
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,033
Report to the Bridge as soon
as everything is in order.

823
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,786
We'll be entering the wormhole
in approximately seven minutes.

824
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,870
Acknowledged.

825
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,958
We're not going
through any wormhole

826
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,667
without our possessions.

827
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,586
Listen, friend, you're
lucky to be alive.

828
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,546
We beamed your shuttle
to the shuttle bay.

829
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,923
As for the rest
of your possessions,

830
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,549
they're back in the
hands of the people

831
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,759
you stole them from.

832
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,511
Ensign Murphy,
escort these men

833
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,471
to secured quarters.

834
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,473
This is outrageous.

835
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,767
I'll hold you
personally responsible

836
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,644
for any losses we suffer.

837
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,062
We'll sue!

838
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,193
Shield status, Mr. Tuvok.

839
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,445
Shields are optimal.

840
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,155
Mr. Paris,
engage maneuvering thrusters

841
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,197
and ease us into position.

842
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,449
Aye, Captain.

843
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,075
DOCTOR:
<i>Sick Bay to Lieutenant Tuvok.</i>

844
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,576
Go ahead, doctor.

845
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,330
Ensign Murphy was just found
unconscious on Deck 2.

846
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,831
It's a severe concussion.

847
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,915
We suspect foul play.

848
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,625
Murphy was escorting
the Ferengi

849
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,043
to their quarters.

850
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,503
TUVOK:
Captain, security

851
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,046
has been breached
in the shuttle bay.

852
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,465
Seal that airlock,
Mr. Tuvok.

853
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,178
The Ferengi have phasered
the shuttle bay door.

854
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,637
They are exiting the ship.

855
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,182
Activating emergency
containment field.

856
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,604
They're setting a course
for the planet, Captain.

857
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,564
Lock a tractor beam
on to that shuttle.

858
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,317
The gravitational effects
of the wormhole

859
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,401
are refracting the beam.

860
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,610
I can't get a lock.

861
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,363
The Ferengi are hailing us,
Captain.

862
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,572
On screen.

863
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:17,869
<i>Thank you for all your</i>
<i>assistance, humans.</i>

864
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:21,580
<i>It was lovely</i>
<i>doing business with you.</i>

865
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,958
<i>We'll be heading</i>
<i>back into orbit</i>

866
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,212
<i>to transport our</i>
<i>acquisitions aboard.</i>

867
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,215
(<i> both laughing</i> )

868
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,674
JANEWAY:
Beam those men back

869
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,302
now, Mr. Kim.

870
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,096
I'm trying, but the targeting
scanners are out of phase.

871
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,390
Try setting the scanners

872
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,683
to a narrow-band
subspace frequency.

873
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,769
(<i> alarm beeps</i> )
What is it?

874
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,523
They're trying to beam us
back to their ship again.

875
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:50,109
They're using some sort
of subspace carrier wave.

876
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,069
Do something!

877
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,695
Shields to maximum.

878
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,739
Shields are at maximum!

879
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,117
Send out a high-energy
graviton pulse.

880
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,413
Let's see their transporter
signal cut through that.

881
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,373
Captain, the Ferengi
are emitting

882
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,999
a graviton pulse.

883
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,502
It's throwing the targeting
scanners off again.

884
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,838
Not only that, it's
destabilizing the wormhole.

885
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,967
Captain, a gravitational eddy
from the wormhole

886
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,511
is attracting
the Ferengi shuttle.

887
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,221
They're being pulled in.

888
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,309
Reverse thrusters!

889
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,103
They're off-line!

890
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,646
(<i> both screaming</i> )

891
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,904
Follow them in before that
wormhole collapses, Mr. Paris.

892
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,072
PARIS:
Aye, Captain.

893
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,282
Resetting
the coordinates.

894
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:43,121
Captain, the entrance
to the wormhole is moving.

895
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,497
The Ferengi graviton pulse

896
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,665
must have increased
its rotational momentum.

897
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,085
Adjusting course to follow.

898
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,086
(<i> console buzzing</i> )

899
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,212
(<i> sighs</i> )

900
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,338
It's too fast for us, Captain.

901
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,257
I need more speed.

902
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,469
Mr. Tuvok, divert auxiliary
power to the thrusters.

903
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,844
It's not enough.

904
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,764
Initiate a high intensity
impulse burst.

905
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,355
Mr. Kim, reinitiate
the verteron field.

906
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,023
Maybe we can attract
the wormhole back.

907
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,984
The Ferengi graviton pulse
knocked the wormhole

908
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,528
completely off
its subspace axis.

909
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,114
It's jumping erratically
now on both ends.

910
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,741
Options?

911
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,249
There are none.

912
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:38,801
Mr. Paris, reset a course
for the Alpha Quadrant.

913
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,262
Warp 6.

914
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,721
Aye, Captain.

915
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,488
Look.

916
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,032
KAFAR:
The Holy Ones are going home!
