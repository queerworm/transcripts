1
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,971
Look.

2
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,100
And you said they were
incompatible.

3
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,146
TUVOK:
You have confirmed
the genetic structure?

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,483
An entirely new species.

5
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,819
I'm gonna name it after you.

6
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:30,364
The Tuvok orchid.

7
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,492
That is an honor you should
reserve for yourself, Mr. Suder.

8
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,870
You gave this species life.

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,663
And you gave<i> me</i> life.

10
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,748
All of this is because of you.

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,586
Because of the meld.

12
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,255
The meld may have
introduced you

13
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,008
to my interest
in floriculture,

14
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,177
but you have embraced it
entirely on your own.

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,639
And discovered a unique
talent within yourself

16
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,849
in the process.

17
00:00:56,849 --> 00:01:00,602
I used to think
the only talent I had

18
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,898
was a talent for killing.

19
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:07,985
Please... It's my way
of saying thank you.

20
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,446
Very well.

21
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,281
I accept.

22
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,832
Tuvok, I want to do
something for the ship.

23
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,083
I'm not asking you

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,501
to let me out of confinement.

25
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,127
I accept my punishment.

26
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,463
But if I could just...

27
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,341
Just contribute somehow.

28
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,969
What contribution do you
feel you could make

29
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,178
from your quarters?

30
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,808
I was... I was thinking
I might adapt

31
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,227
some of the genetic
engineering techniques

32
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,271
I've developed for the orchids

33
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,106
to make the airponic vegetable
garden more productive.

34
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,193
Your attitude is admirable.

35
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,697
I will discuss it with
the Captain.

36
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,991
Do you think she'll agree?

37
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,744
We'll see.

38
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,287
Now, shall we begin?

39
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,585
Notice your mind working.

40
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,337
How it plans for the future,

41
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,632
visits the past.

42
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,425
Notice those thoughts

43
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,844
and set them aside.

44
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,847
Turn your attention
to the white light

45
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,100
that is your breath.

46
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,103
Captain, we're being hailed
on a subspace frequency.

47
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,813
Are there ships
in the vicinity?

48
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,982
Negative.
Tracking the source.

49
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,693
Seems likes it's coming
from an unmanned buoy.

50
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,114
Coordinates 140 mark 317.

51
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,865
It looks like a Kazon signal,
Captain.

52
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:41,745
Take us out of warp.
Open a channel.

53

55
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,710
<i>I hear them coming.</i>

00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,004
<i>I don't have much time.</i>

<i>the baby wasn't his...</i>

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,425
<i>Please, Chakotay, help us--</i>
<i>Not for me, for your son.</i>

59
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,218
CULLUH:
<i>I told you to stay out of here.</i>

60
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,846
SESKA:
<i>No, please don't.</i>

61
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,514
<i>Don't take him!</i>

62
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,601
<i>I beg... No! Please, no!</i>
<i>No!</i>

This is not
my responsibility.

67
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,804
She has no right
to expect me--

68
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,555
She knows you, Chakotay.

69
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,976
She knew how you'd react
when you saw your son in danger.

70
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,145
I have a duty to this crew.

71
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,272
I can't just leave
and go looking for the child.

72
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,940
And I'd never consider
letting you go

73
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,317
into a Kazon-Nistrim
stronghold by yourself.

74
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,028
If we do this,
we do it together.

75
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,740
That's something else
Seska would know too.

76
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,033
Do you think it's a trap?

77
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,660
Do I think Seska
is capable

78
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,912
of manipulating
you and me with this?

79
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,124
Oh, yes.
On the other hand,

80
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,500
it was time
for her to deliver.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,751
And that baby we saw

82
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,878
did look part Cardassian
and part human.

83
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,256
And knowing Culluh,
I'm sure his pride was wounded

84
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,424
when he realized
the child wasn't his.

85
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,968
It makes sense, Chakotay.

86
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,262
It might all be true.

87
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,763
Still, the safest
thing would be

88
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,141
to ignore this message
and resume our course.

89
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,436
I'm not going to resume
our course just yet.

90
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,689
I want you to think
about it, Chakotay.

91
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,235
This has to be your decision.

92
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,113
If you choose to go after him,

93
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,781
I know I speak
for the entire crew--

94
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,117
Starfleet and Maquis alike--

95
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:11,330
When I say
we'll stand behind you.

<i>Ah-koo-chee-moya.</i>

00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:32,059
We are far from the sacred
places of our grandfathers.

100
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,520
We are far from the bones
of my people,

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,358
but I ask on this day
of sorrow and uncertainty

102
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:44,112
that the wisdom
of my father find me

103
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,406
and help me understand
my dilemma.

104
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:51,078
Speak to me, Father.

105
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,622
Speak to me in my dreams.

00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,792
KOLOPAK:
<i>I've never seen you</i>
<i>so troubled, Chakotay.</i>

107
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,743
I have a son, Father.

108
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,289
A son, Chakotay?

109
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,375
Oh.

110
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,669
This is the reason
for your despair.

111
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,924
Was he born with two arms
and two legs

112
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,343
and a heart that beats?

113
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,510
Yes, but--

114
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,055
Then it's a cause
for celebration.

115
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,810
You will make a fine father.

116
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,561
You needn't worry.

117
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,275
I'm not sure I'm willing
to be a father to him.

118
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,653
Hmm. Not willing?

119
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,156
He was born
without my consent.

120
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,449
I had no part in it.

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,577
No part in it?

122
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,831
Well, it's been a long time,
so forgive me,

123
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,668
but it seems that I
<i>had</i> to play a part

124
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,878
before your mother
could conceive.

125
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,798
My DNA was taken from me.

126
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,758
Used by a woman
to impregnate herself

127
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,093
without my permission.

128
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,306
I see.

129
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,350
You're trying to decide
whether you should

130
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,643
accept the child
in your heart.

131
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,645
It's more than that.

132
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,647
But it must begin with that!

133
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,565
How do you take
a child into your heart

134
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,568
who is forced upon you
by a mother's deception?

135
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,991
He knows nothing
of deception.

136
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,161
He is innocent.

137
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,457
Centuries ago, when
the women of our tribe

138
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,585
were raped by
white conquerors,

139
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,796
many gave birth
to their children.

140
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,716
And we did not reject them.

141
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,886
They were accepted
by the tribe.

142
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,640
One was a direct ancestor
of ours, Chakotay.

143
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,978
His name was Ce Acatl.

144
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,024
He became a great leader
of our people.

145
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,985
Here is a man
who was given life

146
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,946
without
his mother's consent.

147
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,491
Are you so different
from her?

148
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,995
And is your child
so different from Ce Acatl?

149
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,544
No.

150
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,216
He is your son, Chakotay.

151
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,803
And he is a child
of our people.

00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,288

with the Talaxian
mining colony on Prema II.

155
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,167
They're willing to come
to our assistance

156
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,710
if we run into trouble.

157
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,214
That's good for about 40 hours
if we average warp 2.

158
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,799
After that, we're out
of their com range.

159
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,801
Well, it's nice to know
we have friends in the area.

Thank you, Neelix.

161
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,513
I recommend a full diagnostic
of our tactical array

162
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,265
prior to the start
of the mission, Captain.

163
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,267
Agreed, but I want more
from tactical, Lieutenant.

164
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,977
I want to anticipate
a trap.

165
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,563
And I want a few tricks up
our sleeves, if we need them.

166
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,066
Captain, I could program the
deflector grid to make it look

167
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,318
like we have help
on the way.

168
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,486
I'll show you
what I mean.

169
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,405
Excuse me, doctor.

Exactly.

172
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,161
This is how we'd look

173
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,496
to the enemy sensors.

174
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,708
If we generate multiple
decoy images like these,

175
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,878
the Kazon would think that
ships are coming toward us.

176
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,339
We could create
as many as we want.

177
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,965
That's a good start, Harry.

178
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,467
It should distract them
for a while.

179
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,010
But what else can we do

180
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,220
if we're eventually intercepted
by a superior force?

181
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,514
DOCTOR:
<i>If you don't mind,</i>

182
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,015
<i>I do have something to add.</i>

183
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,224
( beeps )

184
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,809
<i>Thank you.</i>

185
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,894
<i>Captain, I hesitate</i>
<i>to offer suggestions</i>

186
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,605
<i>in a field of endeavor</i>
<i>that is not</i>

187
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,398
<i>within my usual area</i>
<i>of expertise.</i>

188
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,732
Please, doctor,
your suggestions

189
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,401
on any subject
are always welcome.

190
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,946
<i>Really? In that case,</i>
<i>you may expect several more</i>

191
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,948
<i>on a variety of matters</i>
<i>in the near future.</i>

192
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,742
<i>Right now, may I suggest</i>
<i>that we also consider</i>

193
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,121
<i>attempting to create</i>
<i>an actual holographic illusion</i>

194
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,914
<i>of friendly ships.</i>

195
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,625
With all due respect, doctor,

196
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,503
we can't even figure out how
to project you into this room.

197
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,796
How are we supposed to create
holographic ships in space?

198
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,215
DOCTOR:
<i>I would humbly submit</i>

199
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,966
<i>that my program</i>
<i>is far more sophisticated</i>

200
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,968
<i>than your run-of-the-mill</i>
<i>hologram.</i>

201
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,179
<i>In fact, projecting</i>
<i>the illusion</i>

202
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,264
<i>of a large</i>
<i>three-dimensional object</i>

203
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,684
<i>has been a trick of magicians</i>
<i>for centuries.</i>

204
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,810
We'll just do it
with mirrors.

205
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,771
DOCTOR:
<i>Mr. Paris' predictable attempts</i>
<i>at humor not withstanding,</i>

206
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,400
<i>that is precisely</i>
<i>what I would suggest.</i>

207
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,445
<i>Installing holo-emitters along</i>
<i>the hull with parabolic mirrors</i>

208
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,532
<i>to enlarge the images as they</i>
<i>are reflected into space.</i>

209
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,367
We're gonna use up

210
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,160
a lot of our power reserves
trying to pull it off.

211
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,453
CHAKOTAY:
If these ships

212
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,622
can fool the Kazon,
it's worth it.

213
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,124
TUVOK:
But can they? If the Kazon

214
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,502
scan the holograms,
they will immediately realize

215
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,087
there are no life signs
on board,

216
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,422
no power signatures...

217
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,964
Okay, so we can't
fool them for long,

218
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,299
but maybe it'll be
long enough.

219
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,009
It's an advantage.

220
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,262
And we'll need every advantage
we can get on this mission.

221
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,971
Work on the doctor with it,
B'Elanna.

222
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,182
Mr. Kim, cut power
to all systems

223
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,226
to minimum requirements.
I don't wanna show up

224
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,186
on any Kazon
long-range scanners.

225
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,064
Mr. Paris, locate the warp
signature from Culluh's ship

226
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,566
and set a course
to follow, warp 2.

227
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,817
Aye, Captain.
Dismissed.

228
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,696
CHAKOTAY:
Uh, excuse me,
but there is one more thing.

229
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,865
Thank you.

230
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,872
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

231
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,757
It's not Culluh's ship.

232
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,049
Looks more like a shuttle.

233
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,259
Slow to impulse.

234
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,010
Set an intercept course,
Mr. Paris.

235
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,138
Have they indicated
the nature of the distress?

236
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,223
Just a signal, Captain.
No response to our hails.

237
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,892
Let's go to red alert.
( alarm sounds )

238
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,686
Visual range.
On screen.

239
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,149
KIM:
Showing one life sign.
Adult Kazon male.

240
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,400
He's in critical condition.

241
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,735
Janeway to Sickbay.

242
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,361
Prepare to receive
an emergency transport.

243
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,405
KES:<i> Standing by, Captain.</i>
Commander.

244
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,699
Mr. Tuvok, you have the Bridge.
Remain at red alert.

245
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,033
TUVOK:
Aye, Captain.

246
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,497
KES:
His hip is broken.

247
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,999
Showing severe inflammation
in the bronchial tissue.

248
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,584
It appears he inhaled
noxious gases

249
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,085
vented in
the damaged shuttle.

250
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,754
40 milligrams
pulmozine.

251
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,005
CHAKOTAY:
I know this man.

252
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,465
His name's Tierna.

253
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,133
He's one of Seska's aides.

254
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,177
She had him work me over
when I was on their ship.

255
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:10,308
( grunting ):
Seska...is dead.

256
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,107
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

257
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,238
TIERNA:
Seska thought that she
could manipulate the maje.

258
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,907
She bragged about it to me
more than once,

259
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,785
but this time she was wrong.

260
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,912
We had just launched the buoy

261
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,206
with the message for you.

262
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,834
Then they came for her.

263
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:41,088
They cut her throat,
as Culluh watched.

264
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:45,468
He ordered them to execute me,
but I bribed one of the guards

265
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,804
to get me to a shuttle.

266
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,015
As soon as he saw it leaving,
Culluh opened fire--

267
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,352
Destroyed
my life-support systems.

268
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,230
He left me in space
to die.

269
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,981
What about the child?

270
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:04,571
Taken to the Gema IV colony
to be raised as a servant.

271
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,782
We'll be needing your help
getting to the Gema system.

272
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,868
You're going after him?

273
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,495
This ship, alone?

274
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,331
I want nothing to do with this.

275
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,711
I'm not taking you
into Nistrim space.

276
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,839
Under the circumstances, I'd say
you don't have much of a choice.

277
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,053
What's his prognosis?

278
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,014
He'll be on his feet
in a day or two,

279
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,474
but there's still
a number of things

280
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,851
we need to keep an eye on.

281
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:40,189
He's had...a nasty concussion,
spinal cord trauma

282
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,444
and a polycythemia, the cause
of which I've yet to discover.

283
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,112
Polycythemia?

284
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,365
An abnormal increase in
the number of red blood cells.

285
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,787
I'd like you to run
an autonomic response analysis

286
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,079
the next time I question him.

287
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,664
I'm afraid
that won't help you determine

288
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,249
if he's telling the truth,
Commander.

289
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,252
An ARA depends on making
a baseline comparison

290
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,545
with a known response

291
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,880
for a given species.

292
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,339
Any Tom, Dick or Harry

293
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,759
from the Alpha Quadrant,
I could probably help you,

294
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,136
but not with any of the new
species of the Delta Quadrant.

295
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,138
( computer beeping )

296
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,476
Regarding his veracity,
it may help you to know

297
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,352
that if we'd arrived
an hour later,

298
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,063
he would have been dead
from his injuries.

299
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,278
The molecular variance residual
on his shuttle

300
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,323
is evidence of disruptor blasts,
and the signature is Kazon,

301
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,200
so at least that part of
his story seems to be true.

302
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,495
Plus, we confirmed
nitrogen tetroxide fumes

303
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,830
were in the cabin.

304
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,623
If all this was part of
a Kazon scheme,

305
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,374
he had to be willing
to breathe poison

306
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,876
for hours before
we got there.

307
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,169
Have you found
anything at all

308
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,921
that would cast
doubt on his story?

309
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,549
No.

310
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,179
I still don't trust him.

311
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,101
The trip would take six days
at warp 2.

312
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,770
NEELIX:
Four days, if you didn't take

313
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,647
such a circuitous route--

314
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,732
If we simply went
across the Tenarus cluster.

315
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,734
You would encounter
the Nistrim fleet

316
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,529
before a single day
passed.

317
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,781
Anyone who knows
this part of space

318
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,533
will tell you
the same thing.

319
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,660
NEELIX:
It so happens
that I<i> do</i> know

320
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,538
this part of space,
my Kazon friend.

321
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,957
I just wanted to see
if you would tell us the truth.

322
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,793
The route he suggests
<i>is</i> safer, Captain.

323
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,419
TIERNA:
Of course it's safer.

324
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,048
I don't want to run into Culluh
any more than you do.

325
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,592
CHAKOTAY:
We might have more
success avoiding him

326
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,177
if you gave us
the command codes

327
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,721
for the Nistrim
defense net.

331
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,790
Mr. Paris, adjust our course
to avoid the defense net.

332
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,083
Aye, Captain.

333
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,710
TIERNA:
That is not an end

334
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,211
to the danger.

335
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,339
We are heading
into an area of space

336
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,425
populated
by Kazon factions

337
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,886
that are loyal to no one.

338
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,514
They will attack
without provocation.

339
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,019
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

340
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:30,484
Vessel approaching.

Red alert.

Configuration of the ship,
Mr. Tuvok?

344
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,199
A small raider,
Captain.

345
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,868
It does not pose
a significant threat.

346
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,119
Nevertheless, it is

347
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,871
powering up
its weapon systems.

348
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,915

350
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,086
Return fire.

351
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,301
The raider is breaking
off its attack.

352
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,677
KIM:
Minor damage

353
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,847
to secondary command
processors on Deck 12.

354
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,390
EPS power supplies,

355
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,768
and isolinear controllers
are off-line.

356
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,019
No casualties though.

357
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,604
Begin repairs, Mr. Kim.

358
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,898
Any other sign of Kazon ships,
Lieutenant?

359
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,190
Nothing on
long-range sensors.

360
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,651
The raider is
continuing to retreat.

361
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,569
We should have
a couple of hours

362
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,988
to ourselves at least.

363
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,740
Good. We can use them.
Stand down red alert.

364
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,533
PARIS:
Captain,
we're about to go

365
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,411
beyond the com range
of the Talaxian colony.

366
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,997
Just thought
you'd like to know.

367
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,665
Thank you, Lieutenant.

368
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,916
Maintain current course.

369
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,208
Captain.

370
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,212
I haven't forgotten,
Mr. Tuvok.

371
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,422
Very well.

372
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,799
This seems as good
a time as any.

373
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,807
( equipment beeping )

374
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,062
Captain.
Mr. Suder.

375
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,481
Please... P-please come in.

376
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,774
W-won't you sit down?

377
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,734
Excuse the mess.

378
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,779
I wasn't expecting company.

379
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,573
Can I get you some tea?

380
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,950
Have you had lunch?

381
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,869
Nothing, thank you.

382
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,412
Lieutenant Tuvok has been
telling me about your progress.

383
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:09,125
Has he? Well, I'm...

384
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,627
I'm very grateful to him,
Captain.

385
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,295
I still have a lot to learn,
of course,

386
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,214
but he is an excellent tutor.

387
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,716
When we first started
our studies, I--

388
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,925
TUVOK:
The Captain's time

389
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,635
is limited,
Mr. Suder.

390
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,428
What?

391
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,805
Oh.

392
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,973
Of course.

393
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,265
TUVOK:
I have explained

394
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,642
your proposal to her.

395
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,477
I'd like to know
more about it, Mr. Suder.

396
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,854
What exactly
would be involved?

397
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,439
Yes, yes...

398
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,858
Let me show you.

399
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,528
I've actually had
very encouraging results

400
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,364
with a new
gene-splicing technique.

401
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,367
I created a targeted
restriction enzyme

402
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,369
to facilitate
the hybrid.

403
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,913
And you feel
you could experiment

404
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,498
on our airponic crops
here in your quarters?

405
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,711
Absolutely. I would make this
an airponic laboratory,

406
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,380
and all I would need
are a few plants,

407
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,798
certain chemicals
and equipment.

408
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,299
What sort of chemicals
and equipment?

409
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,718
Nothing dangerous.

410
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,096
I-I've prepared a list.

411
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,522
It's an interesting
proposition, Mr. Suder.

412
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,691
Let me discuss it with Kes
and Lieutenant Tuvok,

413
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,943
and I'll get back to you.

414
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,986
I've already discussed it
with Kes,

415
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,447
and she is very interested.

416
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,616
Good. Let me give it
some thought.

417
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,492
If you're worried
you can't trust me, Captain--

418
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,828
Mr. Tuvok has assured--
I only want

419
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,082
to do something--
Something for the ship.

420
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,333
I understand, Mr. Suder.

421
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,543
Then what's the problem?

422
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,212
Why won't you give me
an answer?

423
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,546
Mr. Suder.

424
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,974
I just want to do
something for the ship.

425
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,393
Excuse me.

426
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:56,107

<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

428
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,499
<i>None of the four Kazon attacks</i>
<i>have caused serious damage,</i>

429
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,918
<i>but the starboard ventral</i>
<i>has been hit each time--</i>

00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:20,506
<i>complicating repairs on the</i>

431
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,428
You are making an adequate
recovery, Mr. Tierna.

432
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,555
The only matter
that I simply cannot understand

433
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,057
is this lingering
polycythemia.

434
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,225
I feel fine.

435
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,726
The medical record
you gave us

436
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,353
does not indicate
any prior blood disorders.

437
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,648
Might it be
an inherited trait?

438
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,066
Do you know if
your parents ever--?

439
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,986
My parents were killed
in a Trabe attack

440
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,071
shortly after I was born.

441
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,365
I see. Well,

442
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,910
we'll need to monitor
this condition for a while.

443
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,079
It might be due to some
chemical imbalance

444
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,040
that our sensors
aren't recognizing.

445
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,499
Possibly the result

446
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,835
of the toxins you inhaled
while on the shuttle.

447
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,630
You're welcome.

448
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:08,637
Feeling better?

449
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,598
I'm sure I'll make
a complete recovery.

450
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,018
Just in time for the Gema
colony's defense force

451
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,644
to destroy us all.

452
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,356
You're still not optimistic
about our chances, are you?

453
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,316
No.
We've had no problem

454
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,734
repelling the attacks
so far.

455
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,653
Attacks... When there's
a real Nistrim attack,

456
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,280
you'll know it.

457
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,033
You still have pride in
the Nistrim, don't you, Tierna?

458
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,659
Even after
what they did to you.

459
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,329
I remember that pride
in your eyes when you

460
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,123
pounded me with your fists
while I was tied to a chair.

461
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,043
And I can see it
in your eyes now,

462
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,338
and that scares
the hell out of me.

463
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,883
You must scare easily,
Federation.

464
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,761
( grunts )

465
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,846
Tell me something,
Tierna.

466
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,640
Every Kazon attack seems to
focus on our starboard ventral.

467
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,393
Think that might be
some kind of pattern?

468
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,853
I wouldn't know.
Because if it is,

469
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,479
and you've been lying to us--

470
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,065

Chakotay.

Increase speed

Aye, Captain.
KIM: They're coming

477
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,918
at our starboard ventral
again.

478
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,711
Our shields there
haven't been repaired yet.

479
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,046
We're gonna sustain
more damage

480

Don't let them see
our starboard ventral.

00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,613
Mr. Kim?

493
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,740
Deck 12 is in shambles.

494
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,200
We barely have time
to begin repairs

495
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,452
before they attack it again.

496
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,995
At least
no one was hurt.

497
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,455
The secondary
command processors

498
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:58,789
are nonfunctional.

499
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,249
We'll have
to rebuild them.

500
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,750
I'd say we're looking
at two days' work

501

<i>if</i> we're not
attacked again.

502
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,754
Why would these factions
of Kazon, loyal to no one,

503
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,465
all have the same agenda?

504
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,507
And why would that agenda
focus on a nonessential

505
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,759
area of the ship?

506
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,011
I don't know,
but it feels like

507
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,471
we're being pecked
to death by ducks.

508
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,264
We can't just stay on this
course and wait to see

509
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,723
what they have in store
for us.

510
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,976
I agree. It's time
to reexamine our game plan.

just in case.

526
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,823
( door closes )

527
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,869
How many do you count,
Mr. Tuvok?

528
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,706
Eight large carrier vessels,
confirmed Kazon signatures.

529
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,833
Funny how they show up
right after we reverse course.

530
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,461
Time to intercept?
Eight minutes.

531
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,339
Their attack formation is
a classic Cardassian echelon.

532
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,631
TUVOK:
Curious.

533
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,925
They have left us

534
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,801
with an obvious avenue
of escape, Captain.

535
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,890
You're right.
It is curious.

536
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,142
Too curious for me.

537
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,562
I don't know what's down
that avenue of escape,

538
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,855
Mr. Tuvok, but I like
to choose my own way.

539
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,148
Set a course

540
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,607
to intercept
their lead ship.

541
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,026
Aye, Captain.

542
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,779
Battle stations.

543
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,745
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

544
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,544
Time to intercept?

545
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,463
Three minutes,
10 seconds...

546
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,131
give or take
a photon torpedo.

547
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,340
Mr. Kim?

548
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,426
( console beeping )

549
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,887
Echo displacement ready,
Captain.

550
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,431
Send in the cavalry.

551
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,224
Activating deflector grid.

552
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,188
They should be seeing the same
thing on their scanners--

553
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,065
Ten ships
with Talaxian signatures.

554
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,109
Four of the Kazon ships
are breaking formation.

555
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,819
Confirmed.
They're changing course.

556
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,279
They took the bait.

557
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,114
That only leaves four
for us to handle.

558
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,949
I like those odds better
than eight to one.

559
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,284
Two minutes to intercept.

560
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,494
Janeway to Torres.

561
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,412
We're ready
down here, Captain.

562
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,498
All the new holo-projectors
are online.

563
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,626
We can create three Talaxian
ships whenever you want to.

564
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,003
JANEWAY:
<i>In about a minute and a half,</i>
<i>B'Elanna. Stand by.</i>

565
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,880
<i>Perhaps we should try</i>
<i>one last systems check.</i>

566
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,591
We've already done it twice.

567
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,593
DOCTOR:
<i>I'm new at this,</i>
<i>and we've never put</i>

568
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,095
<i>such a demand on</i>
<i>the holo-generators before.</i>

569
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,014
<i>We should've boosted</i>
<i>the power input.</i>

570
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,642
The defense systems are going
to need all the auxiliary power

571
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,185
we have, doctor.

572
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,685
<i>We might try a preliminary--</i>

573
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,854
Doctor!

574
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,648
<i>It'll work.</i>

575
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,065
<i>Everything'll be fine.</i>

576
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>I'm not worried.</i>

577
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,404
( rumbling )

578
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,406
Here we go.

579
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,741
They are randomly detonating
torpedoes in our flight path.

580
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,827
Shields are holding.
No damage.

581
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,496
Hold your fire, Mr. Tuvok.

582
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,581
They may have torpedoes
to waste-- We don't.

583
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,625
Thirty seconds
to intercept.

584
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,917
Take us out of warp.

585
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,378
PARIS:
Engaging
impulse engines.

586
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,879
Power
to all weapon systems.

587
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,215
Stand by phasers.
TUVOK: Kazon vessel,

588
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,883
10,000 kilometers
off our starboard bow.

589
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,177
Not yet.
6,000 kilometers.

590
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,888
Not yet.
5,000.

591
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,598
3,000...2,000.

592
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:45,974
Now!

593
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,067
Initiating evasive maneuvers,
beta sequence.

594
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,735
Two more
Kazon ships approaching.

595
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,238
Shields at 90 percent.

596
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,286
( sighs deeply )

597
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,121
( muttering in alien language)

598
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,624
Janeway to Torres.
Initiate holo-programs.

599
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,875
Acknowledged.

600
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,335
Energizing.

601
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,724
That's two.

602
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,392
And here's number three.

603
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,852
( insistent beeping )

604
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,860
Help! Man overboard!

605
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,328
( screaming )

606
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,667
B'ELANNA:
<i>Doctor, are you there?</i>

607
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,043
<i>Are you all right?</i>

608
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,087
I told you
we should have run

609
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,005
one last systems check.

610
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,552
( sighs )

611
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,720
( rumble )

612
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,054
Fourth Kazon ship,
dead ahead.

613
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,640
But they're dividing
their fire, Captain.

614
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,015
The holograms
are working.

615
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,225
Ready photons.

616
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,518
Torpedoes loaded.

617
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,103
Take us about, Mr. Paris.

618
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,980
We want a good angle
on that fourth ship.

619
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,275
Coming about, 141 mark 20.

620
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,026
Fire photon number one.

621
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,613
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

622
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,863
Full starboard roll.

623
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,032
Evasive maneuvers,
lambda sequence.

624
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,577
Fire.

625
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,947
Shields at 85 percent
and holding.

626
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,866
Minor damage reported,
Deck 14.

627
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,452
Come about
to 143 mark 060.

628
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,745
Coming about.

629
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,954
Ready photons.

( yelling )

632
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,905
I'm reading a massive discharge
on Deck 8.

633
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,157
We've lost
a primary plasma conduit.

634
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,117
Deck 8-- Tierna's quarters.

635
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,453
Damage control teams
to Deck 8.

636
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,748
I'm showing power failures
all over the ship.

637
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,799
We've lost power
to the new holodeck grid.

638
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,885
I can't restore it.

639
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,262
B'Elanna,
are you all right?

640
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,305
Yes, Captain.
But it looks like

641
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,392
our reactant injector controls
were hit. Stand by.

642
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,769
All three Kazon ships

643
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,145
are concentrating
their fire on us now, Captain.

644
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,898

Engineering,
I need warp power.

648
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,364
We can't go to warp,
Captain.

649
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,491
The containment field
generator has been damaged.

650
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,076
I'm attempting to bypass.

651
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,829
Captain, if I can get a shuttle
through the crossfire,

652
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,081
I can go back and bring
the Talaxians to help us.

653
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,628
Chakotay, take the conn.
Good luck, Lieutenant.

Shuttle is clear.
So far, so good.

657

Give him as much cover fire
as you can, Tuvok.

Hello, everyone.

695

What do you think
of your son, Chakotay?

696
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:14,195
He has your eyes.
Don't you think?

697
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,531
Thank goodness
he doesn't look too human.

698
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,825
You all have
such weak foreheads.

699
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,201
May he grow up never knowing

700
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,954
the contempt his father has
for his mother.

701
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,330
I think I can assure you
of that, Commander.

00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,583
I intend to take him
for my own son.

703
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,168
A man who would
violate a woman

704
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,379
under his own command--
What?

705
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,048
Doesn't deserve a son.

706
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,884
Is that what she told you?

707
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,595
The boy will be trained
as a Nistrim<i> askara.</i>

708
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,389
Already he has helped us win the
greatest battle in our history.

709
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,682
JANEWAY:
Culluh.

710
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,435
I'd like to discuss
what happens now.

711
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,771
( grunts )

712
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:56,780
You'll be given no more respect
than any Kazon woman...

713
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,658
now that your ship
and technology are mine.

714
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,118
I will<i> tell</i> you

715
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,995
<i>when</i> you may speak.

716
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,287
Allow my crew to live.

717
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,539
They were following
my orders.

718
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,042
You're even worse than she is.

719
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,087
What is it about the women
from your Quadrant?

720
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:16,008
You know she contradicts me
in front of the senior<i> askara?</i>

721
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:20,219
My own woman, disputing
her maje in front of others.

722
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,514
This is your fault.

723
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,891
You've let your women
get out of control.

724
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,978
You know you have
my deepest respect, Maje.

725
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,606
Why is it so dark in here?

726
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,358
Somebody turn on the lights.

727
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,071
Order the repair crews
to begin work immediately.

728
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,740
I want to leave
for the Hanon system

729
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,241
as soon as possible.

730
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,743
What's in the Hanon system?

731
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,370
Your new home.

732
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,289
Take them to a cargo bay.
Have the whole crew

733
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,375
brought there.
Check all quarters.

734
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,627
( snaps fingers )

735
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,587
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

736
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,881
Move.

737
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,053
( grunts )

738
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,929
Good-bye, Chakotay.

739
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,808
I'll take good care
of our son.

740
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,727
( baby crying )

741
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,522
Oh, are you hungry,
my brave little boy?

742
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,361
( Kazon indistinctly
yelling commands )

743
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,744
You! Move!

744
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,037
Keep moving!

745
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,626
NEELIX: This is outrageous!
KAZON MALE: Shut up!

746
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,337
Get up! Move!

747
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,804
Get out!

748
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,057
Computer, activate
medical holographic recall.

749
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,349
Set for 12 hours.
Mark.

750
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,726
( computer beeps )

751
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,357
Check every room.

752
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,525
In here.

753
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,860
Get back.

754
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,821
( grunting )

755
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,122
( people grunting )

756
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,415
KAZON MALE:
Keep moving!

757
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,961
( suspenseful theme continues )

758
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,854
Essential repairs
are complete, Maje.

759
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,397
We have accounted for
all but two

760
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,941
of the Federation crew.

761
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,859
There is also
a shuttle missing.

762
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,403
Yes, we destroyed the shuttle
as it was leaving.

763
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,863
Has that been confirmed?

764
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,243
Fine.

765
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,078
Have the other ships
send out search parties.

766
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,080
Confirm the shuttle
was destroyed.

767
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,372
And even if they
find wreckage

768
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,833
that seems to be
from the shuttle,

769
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,043
tell them to check
for a recent warp trail.

770
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,053
( suspenseful theme playing )

771
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:15,394
Stand by to engage
atmospheric thrusters.

772
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,527
Prepare for landing.

773
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,654
Activate the viewscreen.

774
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,870
Extend landing struts.

775
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,170
( rumbling )

776
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,840
Ready environmental controls!

777
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,197
( rumble )

778
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,080
Disengage engines.

779
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,792
Secure thruster exhaust.

780
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,671
( laughing )

781
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:41,147
Badges.
Over here.

782
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,160
A fitting end for a people

783
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,579
who would not share
their technology.

784
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,082
Let's see if you manage
to survive...

785
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,376
without it.

786
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,629
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

787
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,675
All right.

788
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,927
Let's go.

789
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,637
We've got to find
water and shelter.

790
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,697
We'll divide
the crew into teams.

791
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,366
Each of you
will be a team leader.

792
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,951
Make it clear
to all your people

793
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,369
that we expect
to be rescued

794
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,330
and our job
is to survive

795
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,664
until help arrives.

796
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,957
Do you really think
it's likely

797
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,292
that someone will
find us, Captain?

798
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,709
You're the morale
officer, Neelix.

799
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,044
You give<i> me</i> an answer.

800
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,630
Help is on the way!

801
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,591
Maybe Tom's shuttle
got through.

802
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,010
It's very important
that this crew

803
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,386
be given
a sense of hope.

804
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,554
That's our most important
job right now.

805
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,849
Our top priority
is drinking water.

806
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,392
Second is shelter
to spend the night.

807
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,227
CHAKOTAY:
A clearing
with a protected side

808
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,188
like the base of
a cliff would be best.

809
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,732
Food, fuel-- Look for all
the basic survival requirements.

810
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,444
That includes anything that can
be used as a tool or a weapon.

811
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,488
We'll reconvene here
in about two hours.

812
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,406
All right,
start dividing the crew.

813
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,825
Looks like we don't have
much daylight left.

814
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,327
We'll spread the teams out

815
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,120
in a standard
alpha search pattern

816
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,413
to see what we have
to work with.

817
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,165
Chakotay, Torres,
you're with me.

818
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,624
Alpha team here.

819
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,001
Beta team, this way.

820
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,128
KIM:
Gamma team.

821
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,047
Delta team with me.

822
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,345
( rumble )

823
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,847
The planet seems to be
seismically active.

824
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,974
At first glance,
it's an M-Class planet

825
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,394
in a Pliocene stage
of evolution.

826
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,937
Comparable to Earth
several million years ago.

827
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,776
( engines powering up )

828
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,199
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

829
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:59,327
( rumbling growl )

830
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,752
Captain.

831
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,347
( engines roaring )

832
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,128
(<i> suspenseful theme continues</i> )

833
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,461
(<i> triumphant theme playing</i> )
