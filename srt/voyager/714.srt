00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,674
[explosion]

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,635
Report.

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,845
A ship just de-cloaked off
our port stern.

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,223
-Can you identify them?
-They re-cloaked.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,016
[explosion]

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,227
That disruptor blast
had a Klingon signature.

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,103
[beeps]

8
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,105
Evasive maneuvers. Hail them.

9
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,359
No response.

10
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,118
Port shields are down to 50 percent.

11
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,745
They've re-cloaked again.

12
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,541
The tetryon readings indicate
it's a D7-class cruiser.

13
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,460
D7? They were retired decades ago.

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,879
[Tuvok]
If their technology is antiquated...

15
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,924
Perhaps a metaphasic scan
might be able to penetrate their cloak.

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,468
Do it.

17
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,011
Bridge to Astrometrics.

18
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,596
[Chakotay]
<i>Initiate a metaphasic sweep.</i>

19
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,268
I've detected a vessel.

20
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,895
Transferring the trajectory to Tactical.

21
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,231
I have them.

22
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,399
Fire phasers.

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,073
Our cloak has failed.

24
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,534
Divert emergency power to shields.

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,661
[beeping]

26
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,246
Forward emitters are offline.

27
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,875
-The Federation ship is hailing again.
-Answer them.

28
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,002
Captain!

29
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,337
It may give us more time
to get the cloak back online.

30
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,797
Visual.

31
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:33,885
<i>This is Captain Kathryn Janeway</i>
<i>of the Federation Starship </i>Voyager.

32
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,012
<i>Stand down.</i>

33
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,348
We will not surrender to sworn enemies
of the Klingon Empire.

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,045
[Janeway]
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

35
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,423
The Empire signed a peace treaty
with the Federation

36
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,258
more than 80 years ago.

37
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,427
If I'm not mistaken, it's still in effect.

38
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,553
You're lying.

39
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,304
<i>I'm not lying,</i>

40
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,142
<i>but even if I were,</i>
<i>your ship is no match for mine.</i>

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,769
<i>I suggest we discuss this.</i>

42
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,020
What is there to talk about?

43
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,565
The treaty, for one thing.

44
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,985
I'll give you access to our database
to show you I'm telling the truth.

45
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,404
<i>Databases can be falsified.</i>

46
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,742
I have a Klingon
serving aboard this ship.

47
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,285
[Kohlar]
Impossible.

48
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,619
She's my Chief Engineer.

49
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>I will meet this chief engineer.</i>

50
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,710
We'd be honored to have you
as our guest.

51
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,967
You're safe here; you have my word.

52
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,220
Forgive me if I don't find the word
of a human very reassuring.

53
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,514
I'd like to know what you're doing
in the Delta Quadrant.

54
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,642
I'm not answering any questions
until I see the Klingon.

55
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,061
[beeping]

56
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,739
Captain Kohlar,

57
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,576
Lieutenant Torres, our Chief Engineer.

58
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,829
You're with child.

59
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,749
That's what the Doctor tells me.

60
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,377
Did you conceive
during the holy month of<i> nay'Poq?</i>

61
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,588
I have no idea.

62
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,757
It would have been
14 or 15 weeks ago.

63
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,553
That sounds about right,
not that it's any of your business.

64
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,598
I must return to my ship.

65
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,683
Aren't you interested
in learning about the treaty?

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,685
Here's a copy of the Khitomer Accords.

67
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,896
I must return to my vessel.

68
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,066
Not without your assurance
that you won't fire on my ship again.

69
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,406
You have my word.

70
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,914
Escort Captain Kohlar
back to the Transporter Room.

71
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,666
Aye, captain.

72
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,883
What the hell was that about?

73
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,011
[Klingons clamoring]

74
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,263
It's the truth.

75
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,890
How can you be certain?

76
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,475
The Scrolls say:

77
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,937
"You will find me after two warring houses
make peace."

78
00:05:54,813 --> 00:06:00,735
Our people and the Federation,
our greatest enemy are at peace.

79
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,196
So the humans claim.

80
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,116
These Accords may be a deception.

81
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,576
The other signs are present.

82
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,997
"You will know me
before I know the world."

83
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,165
The child is unborn.

84
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,585
It does not know the world.

85
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,670
You interpret the Scrolls well.

86
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,423
We must verify the evidence.

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,926
Your skepticism
darkens my heart, T'Greth.

88
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,013
What evidence did our ancestors have
when they began this journey?

89
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,849
Nothing but their faith.

90
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,100
[murmuring]

91
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,935
Tell the others to prepare.

92
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,023
The Day of Separation has arrived.

93
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,442
[Klingons murmuring]

94
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,949
[alarm bleeping]

95
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,368
Captain, the Klingon ship--
Its core is breaching.

96
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,495
Red Alert. Hail them.

97
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,081
<i>I salute you, captain.</i>

98
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,461
<i>You did more damage to our vessel</i>
<i>than my engineer thought.</i>

99
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,755
We can send over a team

100
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,673
to help you establish
a containment field.

101
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,467
<i>-There isn't time.</i>
-[Kim] He's right.

102
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,886
Their core is going to breach
in less than 30 seconds.

103
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,971
<i>I'm requesting emergency transport.</i>

104
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,725
Captain, their crew complement is 204.

105
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,229
[sighs]

106
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,899
Erect force fields around
the Shuttle Bay. Transport them there.

107
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,027
Tell your crew to stand by
for evacuation.

108
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,654
Ten seconds.

109
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,572
If we're still too close
when their core breaches...

110
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,532
Go to warp
as soon as their crew is aboard.

111
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,079
Five, four, three...

112
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,081
We have them.

113
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,090
[loud buzz of conversation]

114
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,934
You spared us a dishonorable death.

115
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,060
Sensor logs indicate

116
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,188
that the containment failure
was not caused by our weapons.

117
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,816
You activated a self-destruct sequence.

118
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,944
It was the only way
to get us aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

119
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,696
Why was that so important?

120
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,615
It's our sacred duty to be here.

121
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,410
I don't understand.

122
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,663
More than 100 years ago,

123
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,916
my great-grandfather was part of a sect

124
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,877
which believed
the Empire had lost its way.

125
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,588
They discovered a sacred text.

126
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,844
It told them to embark on a journey
to a distant region of the galaxy.

127
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,264
You've been traveling
for four generations?

128
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,144
My people have always known
the voyage would be long and difficult,

129
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,814
but the Scrolls said
we would be rewarded.

130
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,442
How?

131
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:50,155
We would find the<i> kuvah'magh,</i>
the savior of our people,

132
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,991
the one who will lead us
to a new Empire.

133
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,245
The Scrolls instruct us
to follow her wherever she goes.

134
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,582
What does any of this have to do
with<i> Voyager?</i>

135
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,126
I believe the<i> kuvah'magh</i>

136
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,380
is the unborn child of B'Elanna Torres.

137
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,882
You're joking.

138
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,677
They take their beliefs very seriously.

139
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,930
Seriously enough
to destroy their own ship?

140
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,016
Couldn't they have just followed us?

141
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:23,188
Apparently, their sacred text
told them to cast off the old ways

142
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,857
as soon as they found this<i> kuvah'magh.</i>

143
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,194
They saw their vessel
as the last vestige of the corrupt Empire.

144
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,321
I was hoping our daughter
would be special,

145
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,823
but I never dreamed
she'd turn out to be the Klingon messiah.

146
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,116
This isn't funny.

147
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,453
They might be dangerous.
What if they want to hurt the baby?

148
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,704
To them, your baby's sacred.

149
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,873
It's unlikely they would do anything
to harm her.

150
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,751
Two hundred Klingons pose
a significant security threat.

151
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,795
I suggest we keep them confined
to the Shuttle Bay

152
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,838
until we can find a
suitable home for them.

153
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,465
There are women and children
down there.

154
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,883
We can't just lock them up.

155
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,176
-I agree.
-Captain.

156
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,303
Assign extra security to every deck,

157
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,932
and make sure the Klingons know
and abide by the rules.

158
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,768
The Bridge will have to be off limits.
Engineering as well.

159
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,478
Keep them out of all restricted areas.

160
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,022
Despite their reverence
for Lieutenant Torres,

161
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,316
she should be assigned
a 24-hour security detail.

162
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,734
Just what I need.

163
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,694
Where are they going to sleep?

164
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,280
We'll double up in quarters.

165
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,865
I'll ask for volunteers.

166
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,659
I know this isn't going to be easy,

167
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,494
but until we can find
another place for them,

168
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,663
we should do our best
to make them feel comfortable.

169
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,956
Dismissed.

170
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,344
[buzz of conversation]

171
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,018
Captain, you must try the<i> gagh.</i>

172
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,937
I'll pass, thank you,

173
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,398
but I'm glad to see
you're getting into the spirit of things.

174
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,567
Well, I've been studying
the Klingon database.

175
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,154
They're a fascinating people;
very robust,

176
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:58,533
and, uh, they certainly seem
to appreciate my culinary skills.

177
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,702
It looks like everything's
running smoothly.

178
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,997
Uh, not quite everything.

179
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,876
Some of the Starfleet people
have been complaining

180
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,169
about the smell.

181
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,005
Personally, I find it appealing.

182
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,089
[sniffs]

183
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,175
A kind of musky aroma.

184
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,385
Maybe we can adjust
the environmental controls

185
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,179
to filter out the musk.

186
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,222
Thief!

187
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,184
Touch my food again,
and I'll kill you!

188
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,604
-Okay, everybody relax.
-[Klingon] He took<i> gagh </i>from my plate.

189
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,149
If you don't mind, Ensign,
I've been studying Klingon etiquette.

190
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,318
You shouldn't quarrel over food.

191
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,779
Save your strength for battle,
to fight those who would challenge you.

192
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,740
[growling]

193
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,074
[Kim]
Take it easy!

194
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,951
[grunting and growling]

195
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,453
That's enough!

196
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,331
You have a fiery spirit.

197
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,583
[grunts]

198
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,210
You will make a worthy mate.

199
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,505
What a day!

200
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,177
[groaning and grunting]

201
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,224
I never met a more
ravenous group in my life.

202
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,061
I must have served over 300 meals.

203
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,772
Mr. Neelix, may I ask
what you're doing here?

204
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,816
We're bunkmates.

205
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,194
There must be some mistake.

206
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,072
[laughing]
No, there's no mistake.

207
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,491
I gave up my quarters
to a Klingon family.

208
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,244
By the time I checked
with Commander Chakotay,

209
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,287
you were the only one
who hadn't been paired up.

210
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,248
You should've consulted me.

211
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,794
We're such close friends,
I knew you wouldn't mind.

212
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,383
Mr. Neelix,
as much as I enjoy your company,

213
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,385
I prefer solitude in my own quarters.

214
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,473
You don't really want me to go back there
and tell that family to get out, do you?

215
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:54,691
Good, because I promise you
we're going to have fun, Mr. Vulcan.

216
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,317
[chuckling]

217
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,153
I learned some Klingon drinking songs.

218
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,656
[belongings clatter to floor]

219
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,241
I'll teach them to you.

220
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,828
<i>Ej IM-ta fey DE-ja i</i>

221
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,290
<i>ejdahk-so-TAS</i>
<i>ghos va Skral byteek</i>

222
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,084
<i>Ej IM-ta fey DE-ja i...</i>

223
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,836
<i>Paris to Torres.</i>

224
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,129
I'm almost finished.

225
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,672
[Paris]
<i>You said that an hour ago.</i>

226
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,675
I'll be there in a minute, I promise.
Torres out.

227
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,511
Keep an eye on the replicators.
They've already gone down once today.

228
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:26,848
It's her!

229
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,227
[sighs]

230
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,363
When you said, "Be there in a minute,"
you weren't kidding.

231
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:46,034
A group of Klingons ambushed me
outside of Engineering.

232
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,702
I decided transporting myself

233
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,828
would be easier
than running the gauntlet.

234
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,624
I'm starting to feel like a prisoner.

235
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,128
Well, at least you have
a handsome cell mate.

236
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,630
How long do you think they're going
to be on board?

237
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,384
I thought you'd be glad
to have other Klingons around.

238
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,178
You've always told me

239
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,472
how uncomfortable it is
being the only one.

240
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,848
I guess I should be careful
what I wish for.

241
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,518
Maybe you should talk to some of them,
give them a chance.

242
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,603
[door chimes]

243
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,937
Come in.

244
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,942
-Captain.
-Sorry to bother you but I need your help.

245
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,945
Ten of the Klingons
have started a hunger strike.

246
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,115
They say they won't eat until you agree
to meet with their Council of Elders.

247
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,408
That's ridiculous.

248
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,702
Their faith is obviously
very important to them.

249
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,788
They think I'm something I'm not.

250
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,290
Just talk to them,
hear what they have to say.

251
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,169
We could be with these people
for a while.

252
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,921
You can't avoid them forever.

253
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,089
I can try.

254
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,258
If it'll make you feel any better,
I'll go with you.

255
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,641
<i>mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.</i>

256
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,811
<i>mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.</i>

257
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,022
<i>mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.</i>

258
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,150
<i>mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.</i>

259
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,404
<i>mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.</i>

260
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,573
<i>mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.</i>

261
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,201
<i>mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.</i>

262
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,078
<i>mobaR...</i>

263
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,331
You honor us with your presence.

264
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,961
Look at her ridges.

265
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,547
Morak was right.

266
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,091
Your blood is not pure.

267
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,885
No.

268
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,512
My father was human.

269
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,514
[murmuring]

270
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,891
Couldn't you see this for yourself?

271
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,477
-Yes, but--
-Why didn't you tell us?!

272
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,562
It wasn't important!

273
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,064
Not important?

274
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,193
We destroyed our ship

275
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,071
because you said she was the mother
of the<i> kuvah'magh.</i>

276
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,031
Show me where it's written

277
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,285
that the<i> kuvah'magh</i>
must have pure Klingon blood.

278
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,122
The prophecy wouldn't lead us
to a mongrel child.

279
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,207
Hey, take it easy.

280
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,292
Who are you?

281
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,462
The father of that "mongrel" child.

282
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,090
More human blood.

283
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,135
Your<i> kuvah'magh</i>
isn't even half Klingon.

284
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,054
I've spent my life
interpreting the Scrolls,

285
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,266
and I say that all the signs
of the prophecy are here.

286
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976
Liar.

287
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,980
You've led us to a false savior.

288
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,367
I told you this was a mistake.

289
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,078
Lieutenant, I need your help.

290
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,288
Any more help from me,

291
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,915
and you're going to have a holy war
on your hands.

292
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,209
That's what I'm trying to prevent.

293
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,302
My baby's just a baby.

294
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,887
She's not a savior.

295
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,138
Perhaps you're right,

296
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,807
but we <i>must</i> convince
my people that she is.

297
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,892
Why?

298
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,395
We've traveled more
than 30,000 light-years

299
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,773
in search of this savior,

300
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,276
and in more than 100 years,
we've found nothing

301
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,946
except hardship and isolation.

302
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,824
When I saw Lieutenant Torres,

303
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,660
that she was with child

304
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,873
I didn't know if I was looking
at the mother of the<i> kuvah'magh</i> or not,

305
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,292
but I did know I was looking
at an opportunity

306
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,877
to end this wasteful journey.

307
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,630
Then you don't believe in the prophecy?

308
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,841
What I believe is that my people
have suffered enough.

309
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,553
If they accept your child
as the<i> kuvah'magh,</i>

310
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
you'll hold great influence over them.

311
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,307
We can find a suitable planet.

312
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,811
You can tell them it's their new home,
and they'll follow you there.

313
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,230
I'm not going to lie to them.

314
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,940
What's the alternative?

315
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,653
My people staying aboard your ship,
draining your resources?

316
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,238
I agree with Lieutenant Torres.

317
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,407
I'm not comfortable
deceiving your people.

318
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,910
Perhaps you won't have to lie to them
to convince them.

319
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,078
What are you suggesting?

320
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,707
If you study the Scrolls with me,

321
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,334
we may be able to interpret them
in a way that appears

322
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,837
consistent with the events of your life.

323
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,799
Then we'll bring those consistencies
to the attention of the Council.

324
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,429
So you just want to stretch
the truth a little?

325
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:22,643
It is possible that the Sacred Scrolls
were scrawled by a madman in a cave,

326
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,521
or perhaps they really
were divinely inspired.

327
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,400
Either way, they've guided us
for over a century.

328
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,819
If my people start to believe

329
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,447
that the Sacred Scrolls
have led them astray,

330
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,782
there may be violence.

331
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,951
Is that a threat?

332
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,995
Merely a fact.

333
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,708
You're doing everything you can
to get your people home, captain.

334
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,253
That's all I'm doing for mine.

335
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,554
It says, "The<i> kuvah'magh</i> will be
descended from a noble house."

336
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,058
I don't come from one,

337
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,976
and I'm pretty sure
my husband doesn't either.

338
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,689
We all have nobility in our blood,
if we go back far enough.

339
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,651
So these Scrolls can mean
anything you want them to.

340
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,364
It is written that the mother
of the<i> kuvah'magh</i>

341
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,782
would be an off-worlder.

342
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,118
Weren't you born
on a Federation colony?

343
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,995
A lot of Klingons are born off-world.

344
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,248
It also says that you would've
lived a life of solitude

345
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,834
and endured many hardships.

346
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,711
That's accurate, isn't it?

347
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,048
According to this,

348
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,135
"I'm supposed to have won
a glorious victory

349
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,137
against an army of 10,000 warriors."

350
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,222
Haven't you?

351
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,393
We haven't even encountered
10,000 warriors.

352
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,061
Well, unless you include the Borg.

353
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,730
Did you help destroy
one of their vessels?

354
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,650
I suppose.

355
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,111
Couldn't that have been
your glorious victory?

356
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,654
I guess so.

357
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,866
Where are the images of Kahless?

358
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,328
Where is your family crest?

359
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,081
They clashed with the carpet.

360
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,752
Don't you honor
any of your people's traditions?

361
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:13,963
Not really.

362
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,091
There is one tradition
we can honor together.

363
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,556
What are you doing?

364
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,391
It's midday.

365
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,103
Time to remember the sacrifice
of our ancestors.

366
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,857
Haven't you made
a Plea for the Dead before?

367
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,109
Well, not since I was a child.

368
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,403
The dead can't rest in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor</i>

369
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,614
if the living don't honor their memory.

370
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,413
Perhaps there's someone
I can honor on your behalf.

371
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,082
Who did you plead for as a child?

372
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,209
My grandmother.

373
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:53,878
She was called?

374
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,046
L'Naan.

375
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:01,844
Kahless...

376
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,056
We implore you
to remember those warriors

377
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,768
who have fallen in your name.

378
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,731
Lift them out of the cavern of despair

379
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,401
and reveal yourself to them

380
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,446
in all your glory.

381
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,822
Right, "in all your glory."

382
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,035
Remember Kolax, son of Amar.

383
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,038
Remember Talij,

384
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,167
daughter of K'Rene.

385
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,963
Remember L'Naan,

386
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,217
daughter of Krelik.

387
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,484
What happened to you?

388
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,361
I cut myself shaving.

389
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,281
-Is that a bite mark?
-One of the Klingons attacked me.

390
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,410
-Did you do something to provoke him?
-Not him, her.

391
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,330
And she wasn't provoked,
she was aroused.

392
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,708
Ah. I'm not surprised.

393
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,836
I've studied the section
on Klingon mating rituals

394
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,671
in their cultural database.

395
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,882
Then maybe you can tell me
how to convince a female twice my size

396
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,259
that I'm not interested.

397
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,095
-Hmm, you probably can't.
-Great.

398
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,638
As I understand it,

399
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,266
you have two options, kill her

400
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,601
or mate with her.

401
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,896
Since the first option
is clearly unacceptable...

402
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,981
What's this?

403
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,108
Authorization for you
to engage in intimate relations

404
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,943
with a member of an alien species.

405
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,820
Be sure to get the captain's
approval as well.

406
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:49,243
<i>Chief Engineer's Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54518.2.</i>

407
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,246
<i>I've spent the last two days</i>
<i>reviewing the Sacred Scrolls</i>

408
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,249
<i>in preparation for my appearance</i>
<i>before the Klingon Council.</i>

409
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,919
<i>Kohlar also suggested I prepare</i>
<i>a few "colorful stories"</i>

410
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,504
<i>to help win them over.</i>

411
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:04,382
That's when they beamed
aboard the<i> Flyer, </i>weapons firing.

412
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,012
Tuvok and Neelix fought valiantly,
but there were too many Hirogen.

413
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:13,851
I had to face ten
of their fiercest hunters alone.

414
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,812
-[B'Elanna] I--
-Is that how<i> you</i> remember it?

415
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:20,274
Exaggeration is part of Klingon custom.

416
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,525
She's doing great.

417
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,903
...were shot out of my hand,
forcing me to take down

418
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,489
the last hunter in hand-to-hand combat.

419
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,283
It was a glorious fight.

420
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,745
Your ancestors would be honored.

421
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,331
[metal cups clinking]

422
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,003
You tell a good story,

423
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,839
but that's not why you're here.

424
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:48,928
Some say you are the mother
of the<i> kuvah'magh,</i>

425
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,765
the one who will guide us
to a new homeworld.

426
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,518
Has your unborn child
told you where it is?

427
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,312
[laughter]

428
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,567
The Scrolls say,

429
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,989
"You will follow in my footsteps
before I have made them."

430
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,035
Yesterday, we changed course

431
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,330
toward a planet very much like Qo'noS.

432
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,583
So, in a manner of speaking,

433
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,296
you are now following my child
to a new home.

434
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,464
[murmuring]

435
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,676
You deliver the words we want to hear,

436
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,261
but it's Kohlar who gives them to you.

437
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,765
Are you his puppet
in the bedchamber as well?

438
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,977
Watch it.
That's my wife you're talking about.

439
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,937
He speaks!

440
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,355
I didn't think you had a tongue.

441
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,315
Leave him out of this.

442
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,318
You see how he hides
behind his female?

443
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,657
It is also written that the father
of the<i> kuvah'magh</i>

444
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,575
will be an honorable warrior.

445
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,372
Would an honorable warrior
ever refuse a challenge?

446
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,792
I haven't refused any challenge.

447
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,628
I haven't made one yet.

448
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,634
You and I...

449
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,639
To the death.

450
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,351
-Tom...
-Stay out of this.

451
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,188
[T'Greth]
<i>Pahtk.</i>

452
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,155
I accept.

453
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,781
[boisterous approval]

454
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,076
[cups clinking]

455
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,376
-[Paris] What was I supposed to say?
-How about "no"?

456
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,919
They were all watching.

457
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,629
There would have been a riot
if I refused.

458
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,966
-So, you're going to get yourself killed?
-What makes you so sure I'd lose?

459
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,051
Oh, please.

460
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,304
Look, I have no intention
of fighting anyone to the death,

461
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,890
but wasn't the whole point of this
to get them to believe

462
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,557
that we<i> are</i> the parents of their savior?

463
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,559
Captain, this has gone too far.
Put a stop to it.

464
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,145
I intend to.

465
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,938
Mr. Tuvok.

466
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,564
[door opens]

467
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,653
Gentlemen...

468
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,991
I'm afraid Lieutenant Paris
had no authority to accept this challenge.

469
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,619
There will be no death matches
aboard my ship.

470
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,081
I told you this<i> pahtk</i>
was not the true father.

471
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,250
Lieutenant Paris is perfectly willing
to fight you, Mr. T'Greth.

472
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,795
I'm the one preventing him
from doing so.

473
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:32,674
The father of the<i> kuvah'magh</i>
wouldn't let a woman speak for him.

474
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:34,885
T'Greth...

475
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,555
There is precedent
for an honorable compromise.

476
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,811
A nonlethal bout,
fought with blunted<i> bat'leths.</i>

477
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,729
The victory goes to the first warrior

478
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,357
to knock his opponent
to the ground three times.

479
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,483
A coward's rules!

480
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,735
Was the Emperor Mur'Eq a coward?

481
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,488
He was the one
who instituted these rules

482
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,450
to insure that his warriors would kill
their enemies and not each other.

483
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,371
If you agree to these terms

484
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,165
I'll allow the match.

485
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,254
I'll see you on the field of battle!

486
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,762
I assume you have a suitable holodeck
training program for this, Lieutenant?

487
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,517
He'll be ready. I'll train him myself.

488
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,816
[door opens]

489
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,152
Hi.

490
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,029
Psst! Neelix.

491
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,200
-Something wrong, Harry?
-Shh!

492
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,910
-Have you seen her?
-Who?

493
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,246
Uh, that Klingon woman.

494
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,498
The one I got into a scrape with
in the Mess Hall.

495
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,208
Officer Ch'Rega.

496
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,626
That's her.

497
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,003
I haven't seen her today.

498
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,338
She's been following me everywhere.

499
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,506
Why?

500
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,216
She wants to mate.

501
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,052
Oh! You're a lucky man.

502
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,513
She's a fine specimen
of Klingon womanhood.

503
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,975
I guess it's a matter of taste.
You never saw me!

504
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,561
Oh, wait!

505
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,022
-I have a better idea.
-Neelix, what the hell are you doing?

506
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,107
Play along.
I'm taking her off your hands.

507
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,860
When I say you're limited

508
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,154
to two servings of<i> brak't,</i>
that's all you get!

509
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,655
Do you understand me, Ensign?

510
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,201
-Yes, sir, whatever you say.
-I don't think you do.

511
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,204
If I catch you eating
more than your share again,

512
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,872
I'll cut it out of your belly.

513
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,958
<i>-What?</i>
-[whispers] Run.

514
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,753
-Excuse me.
<i>-Pahtk.</i>

515
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,510
[growling]

516
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,650
I didn't think you approved
of this kind of competition.

517
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,569
I don't. I'm here in an official capacity.

518
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,405
Well, you do know they're fighting
with nonlethal weapons?

519
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,742
You'd be surprised how much damage
a blunt<i> bat'leth</i> can do.

520
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,370
Warriors, assemble!

521
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,751
Today would be a very bad day to die.

522
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,127
I'll try to remember that.

523
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,550
Let honor guide you!

524
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,427
<i>Tagh!</i>

525
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,478
I see fear in your eyes, human.

526
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,649
The only Klingon I'm afraid of is my wife
after she's worked a double shift.

527
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,610
[both grunting]

528
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,630
[both gruntling]

529
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,493
[groans weakly]

530
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,581
[wheezing]

531
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,107
It's begun.

532
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,401
What are you talking about?

533
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,486
He's dying.

534
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,907
Typically, I'm the one to make
that kind of prognosis.

535
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,617
It's the<i> nehret.</i>

536
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,701
It kills all of us

537
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,703
who aren't fortunate enough
to die in battle.

538
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,004
[doctor]
It's a retrovirus that destroys the cells

539
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,340
by attacking
the cytoplasmic membranes.

540
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,300
Shouldn't our bio-filters have detected it

541
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,344
when we transported
the Klingons aboard?

542
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,762
This is an insidious virus.

543
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,222
It lies dormant,

544
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,891
disguising itself
as inert genetic material

545
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,519
until it inexplicably activates.

546
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,522
The<i> nehret</i> always comes
without warning.

547
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,733
I've reviewed my scans
of the other Klingons.

548
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,443
They're all carriers.

549
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,615
Why didn't you tell us
your people had a disease?

550
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,284
We've never thought of it as a disease.

551
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,329
It's more like old age.

552
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,414
Is it contagious?

553
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,874
Only to Klingons.

554
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,384
If you'd give us some privacy,
I'd like to examine Lieutenant Torres.

555
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,511
Of course.

556
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,365
The baby, too?

557
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,118
I'm afraid so.

558
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:38,915
Why am I here?

559
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,419
You're ill.

560
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,754
You collapsed during the fight.

561
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,341
The<i> nehret.</i>

562
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,426
Yes.

563
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,053
Thank you for telling us.

564
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,763
Now my baby and I have it, too.

565
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,269
Where do you think you're going?

566
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,023
To prepare for my journey
to<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

567
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,733
You should be in Sick Bay.

568
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,818
Can you make me well?

569
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,280
-Not at the moment, but--
-Then don't deny me my tradition.

570
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,786
[guttural tonal droning]

571
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,552
The child is not the<i> kuvah'magh.</i>

572
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,514
But the father accepted your challenge.

573
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,098
He defeated you!

574
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,476
I was defeated by the<i> nehret!</i>

575
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:46,900
B'Elanna Torres<i> and</i> her child
will fall victim to it as well.

576
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,568
Impossible!

577
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,820
They both carry it.

578
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,239
She told me herself.

579
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,701
But the Scrolls say the<i> kuvah'magh</i>
is younger than old age.

580
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,955
And stronger than sickness.

581
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,041
She cannot be our savior.

582
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,043
[murmuring]

583
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,587
We should resume our search.

584
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,216
Kohlar and many
of the others won't agree.

585
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,134
Then we must act alone!

586
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,555
For the good of our people.

587
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,891
How?

588
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,520
We'll wait for the right moment.

589
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,690
And when it comes...

590
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,651
...we'll seize<i> Voyager!</i>

591
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,070
[approving growls]

592
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,914
We've identified
two potential colony sites

593
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,416
in the southern hemisphere.

594
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,168
We'll require topographical scans.

595
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,253
I'll prepare them.

596
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,258
I shouldn't have doubted you.

597
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,804
It appears the signs
were there all along.

598
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,058
I'll join the survey mission.

599
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,394
You're ill, old friend.

600
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:06,771
You should remain here.

601
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:13,111
I want my final days
to be spent in honorable pursuits.

602
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,740
Don't ask me to die inside these walls.

603
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,620
We transport in one hour.

604
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,095
Your transporters are much
more sophisticated than ours.

605
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,056
I've studied Klingon transport systems.

606
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,433
The basic technology
isn't all that different.

607
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:47,270
But you were able to beam our entire crew
aboard<i> Voyager </i>at one time.

608
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,648
We usually don't like to do that
for safety reasons,

609
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,567
but in a pinch,
we can expand the buffer capacity.

610
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,987
-These are the targeting scanners?
-Exactly.

611
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,864
They work
on the same principles as yours.

612
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,289
You said it was urgent?

613
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,292
I need to conduct
a more detailed bio-scan of your baby.

614
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,585
She's not sick, is she?

615
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,337
No, but I may be onto something.

616
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,008
I'll be leading the team going to Site A.

617
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,719
Kohlar will be in charge
of the Site B team.

618
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,471
Morning, Commander. Harry.

619
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,308

620

622
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,442
Phaser fire in Transporter Room 1.

623
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,820
Bridge to Chakotay.

624
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,838
-They're on the surface.
-Now lock on to the Bridge officers.

625
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,259
They've activated a force field
around Deck 1.

626
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,469
Transport the rest of their crew.

627
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,348
Captain, I'm detecting
multiple transports.

628
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,684
Some of our people
are being beamed down to the surface.

629
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,352
Cut power to the transporters.

630
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,856
I can't.

631
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,982
Bridge to Engineering.

632
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,068
B'Elanna, respond.

633
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,612
There's no one in Engineering.

634
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,787
-The Bridge officers?
-I still can't get a lock.

635
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,247
[frustrated grunt]

636
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,000
Can you transport us there?

637
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,084
I'll try.

638
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,595
Computer,
open the Transporter Room doors.

639
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,764
Security override:
Tuvok-pi-alpha.

640
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,848
Grant me a warrior's death.

641
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,186
I beg of you.

642
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,232
Sorry. No mercy killings on my Bridge.

643
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,486
Get our people back.

644
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,113
Yes, ma'am.

645
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,341
Why am I not in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor?</i>

646
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,134
Because you are healthy as a<i> targ.</i>

647
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,806
-The<i> nehret?</i>
-Gone.

648
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,852
We have B'Elanna Torres' child
to thank for it.

649
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,146
The fetus has hybrid stem cells.

650
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,732
They contain Klingon and human DNA.

651
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,526
I used them to synthesize an antivirus.

652
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,030
The child cured me?

653
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,991
I was the one
who devised the treatment.

654
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,409
Doctor...

655
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,703
Yes, of course, the child cured you.

656
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,290
The<i> kuvah'magh </i>has healed all of us.

657
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,544
She truly is our savior.

What's this?

682
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,235
The<i> bat'leth </i>given to me
by my great-grandfather.

683
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,320
It's for your daughter.

684
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,659
I hope someday you'll tell her about us.

685
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,162
I will.

<i>Qapla'.</i>

688
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,648
It doesn't seem right
just to hang it on the wall.

689
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,359
I'm not letting you
scratch it up on the holodeck.

690
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,321
I'm sure our daughter
wouldn't mind lending it to the old man

691
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,406
every now and then.

692
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,328
You know, this is one special kid
we're going to have.

693
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,289
You're just figuring that out?

694
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:25,501
Well, I was hoping for an artist,
or maybe a musician.

695
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:30,131
But she's already the savior
of an entire race.

696
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,217
You don't really believe that.

697
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,719
I don't know.

698
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,804
There are a lot
