1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,714
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG,</i>
<i>STARDATE 48579.4.</i>

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>THE CREW HAS BEEN SCANNING</i>
<i>CONSTANTLY FOR ANOMALIES</i>

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,552
<i>THAT MIGHT HELP US</i>
<i>SHORTEN OUR JOURNEY HOME.</i>

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,263
<i>ENSIGN KIM HAS REPORTED</i>
<i>AN EXCITING DISCOVERY--</i>

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,642
<i>A SUBSPACE DISTURBANCE</i>
<i>WHICH MAY BE A WORMHOLE.</i>

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,769
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU HAVE,
MR. KIM.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,229
THERE. IT'S REGISTERING
ONLY ON SUBSPACE BANDS.

8
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,149
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE IT
ON LONG-RANGE SENSORS YET.

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,734
VERTERON EMANATIONS.

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,779
TUNNELING SECONDARY PARTICLES.

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,531
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS
LIKE A WORMHOLE.

12
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,949
BUT IS IT STABLE ENOUGH
FOR US TO ENTER,

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,034
AND IF IT IS,
WHERE DOES IT LEAD?

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,953
THERE IS, OF COURSE,
A 75% CHANCE

15
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,664
A WORMHOLE WILL NOT LEAD
TO THE ALPHA QUADRANT.

16
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,499
VERY TRUE, BUT YOU CAN ALSO SAY

17
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,628
THERE'S A ONE-IN-FOUR CHANCE
IT WILL. THOSE AREN'T BAD ODDS.

18
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,129
ANY ANALYSIS
YET, ENSIGN?

19
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,464
WE'RE TOO FAR AWAY.

20
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,841
WE'D HAVE TO BE
WITHIN 1,000 KILOMETERS

21
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,509
TO GET A DETAILED
ANALYSIS.

22
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,303
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN A
SIGNIFICANT COURSE CHANGE.

23
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,766
WELL, MR. KIM

24
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:02,103
IF THERE'S EVEN THE POSSIBILITY
OF FINDING A WORMHOLE

25
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,940
I THINK WE CAN AFFORD A DETOUR.

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,901
LIEUTENANT...

27
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,195
INPUT THE COORDINATES
AND CHANGE COURSE.

28
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,572
AYE, CAPTAIN.

29
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,575
AND MAY I SUGGEST
IF THIS WORKS

30
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,285
WE PETITION THE FEDERATION
ASTRONOMICAL COMMITTEE

31
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,999
TO OFFICIALLY DESIGNATE THIS
"THE HARRY KIM WORMHOLE."

32
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,826
CAPTAIN, WE'RE APPROACHING
THE COORDINATES OF THE WORMHOLE.

33
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,828
Janeway:
ON SCREEN.

34
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,205
ARE WE
IN VISUAL RANGE?

35
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,624
AFFIRMATIVE, CAPTAIN,
AND THE ANOMALY

36
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,418
IS STILL REGISTERING
ON SUBSPACE BANDS.

37
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,254
SENSORS ALSO INDICATE
IT'S THERE.

38
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,715
MAGNIFY.

39
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,677
INCREASE TO HIGHEST
MAGNIFICATION.

40
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,684
IF THAT'S A WORMHOLE,
IT MUST BE

41
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,102
THE SMALLEST ONE
ON RECORD.

42
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,311
MR. KIM,

43
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,771
ARE YOU ABLE TO ANALYZE IT?

44
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,232
AYE, CAPTAIN. IT'S
VIRTUALLY MICROSCOPIC.

45
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,485
THE APERTURE IS ONLY ABOUT
30 CENTIMETERS IN DIAMETER.

46
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,450
I GUESS IT'S A LITTLE TOO SMALL
FOR US TO FLY THROUGH.

47
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,290
HOWEVER... IT MIGHT
BE LARGE ENOUGH

48
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,793
TO ACT AS A CONDUIT
FOR A MESSAGE.

49
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,212
THAT'S RIGHT.

50
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,755
IT COULD CARRY
A COMPRESSED DATA TRANSMISSION

51
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,091
TO FEDERATION SPACE IN MINUTES.

52
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,466
WE STILL HAVE TO FIND OUT

53
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,135
IF IT GOES ANYWHERE
NEAR THE ALPHA QUADRANT.

54
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,804
CAN YOU TRACE
ITS SUBSPACE BEARING?

55
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,639
I CAN'T GET ANY
DIRECTIONAL READINGS AT ALL.

56
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,684
THE APERTURE
IS TOO SMALL.

57
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,477
I RECOMMEND
WE LAUNCH A MICRO-PROBE

58
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,146
INTO THE WORMHOLE.

59
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,065
AGREED. DO IT, LIEUTENANT.

60
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,399
AYE, CAPTAIN.

61
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,529
WE'RE RECEIVING
TELEMETRY.

62
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,627
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY WORMHOLE
I'VE EVER STUDIED.

63
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,046
MICROSCOPIC GRAVITATIONAL EDDIES

64
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,133
EXTREMELY CONSTRICTED
SPATIAL DIMENSIONS...

65
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,510
THE PATHWAY IS BARELY WIDER
THAN THE PROBE ITSELF.

66
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,304
I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING

67
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,015
IS A WORMHOLE
IN AN ADVANCED STATE OF DECAY.

68
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,850
MUST BE ANCIENT.

69
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,394
PROBABLY BEEN COLLAPSING
FOR CENTURIES.

70
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,354
DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN'T SEND
A MESSAGE THROUGH IT?

71
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,982
NO. I CAN DO IT.

72
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,067
MAYBE IT'LL TAKE LONGER
TO GET THROUGH

73
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,443
BUT THE WORMHOLE'S
STILL STABLE ENOUGH

74
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,987
TO CARRY A TRANSMISSION.

75
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,239
ANY IDEA YET WHERE THAT MESSAGE
WOULD END UP, ENSIGN?

76
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,449
I'LL TRY EXTRAPOLATING
THE VERTERON EXIT VECTOR.

77
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,578
NO, I CAN'T GET IT.

78
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,955
THERE'S A STRANGE
PHASE VARIANCE

79
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,873
IN THE RADIATION STREAM.

80
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,084
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL THE PROBE EXITS.

81
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,128
THAT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

82
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,467
CAPTAIN, I'M GETTING A
DISTORTED ENERGY READING.

83
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,095
THE PROBE'S TELEMETRY
HAS CHANGED.

84
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,226
IT'S STUCK.

85
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,560
STUCK?

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,437
IT'S MIRED IN A
GRAVITATIONAL EDDY

87
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,690
AND BECAUSE THE WORMHOLE'S
IN A STATE OF COLLAPSE,

88
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,112
THOSE EDDIES ARE
INCREDIBLY DENSE.

89
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,447
THAT PROBE
WILL NEVER BREAK FREE, CAPTAIN,

90
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,327
AND WE HAVE NO WAY OF FINDING
OUT WHERE THE WORMHOLE ENDS.

91
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,245
LET'S GIVE IT SOME TIME.

92
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,997
MAYBE IT WILL WORK ITSELF LOOSE.

93
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,547
CAPTAIN.

94
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,923
WHAT IS IT, ENSIGN?

95
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:26,220
OUR PROBE WAS JUST SCANNED.

96
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,929
THERE'S...

97
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,890
THERE'S SOMEBODY ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE.

98
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,732
IT STARTED ACTING UP
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

99
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,441
I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT
IN THE GYM.

100
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,776
MAYBE I OVERDID IT.

101
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,028
IS IT SORE HERE?

102
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,612
YES.

103
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,823
LOCALIZED TENDERNESS
TO THE ULNAR BONE,

104
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,034
NO EPIDERMAL DAMAGE,
MODERATE EDEMA.

105
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:53,412
WHAT ARE
THE POSSIBLE DIAGNOSES?

106
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:57,000
EPICONDYLITIS,
STRAINED LIGAMENT,

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,170
TORN MUSCLE,
AND HAIRLINE FRACTURE.

108
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,297
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

109
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,798
I'VE STUDIED ALL
THE MATERIAL YOU GAVE ME.

110
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,508
I'M READY FOR MORE.
GOOD.

111
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,470
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL MORE
FOR YOU TO LEARN.

112
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,349
THE TRICORDER INDICATES
THIS IS A SMALL STRESS FRACTURE.

113
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,770
CAN THIS GUY DO EVERYTHING
A REAL DOCTOR DOES?

114
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,105
YES, HE CAN.

115
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,567
ACTIVATE IT,
AND DIRECT THE BEAM HERE.

116
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,863
THAT'S IT.

117
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,907
NOT QUITE SO FAST.

118
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,951
IF I HAD TO GET TREATMENT
FOR SOMETHING SERIOUS--

119
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,620
IF I NEEDED SURGERY,
FOR INSTANCE--

120
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,829
WOULD HE BE PERFORMING IT?

121
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,791
OF COURSE,
AND QUITE EXPERTLY TOO.

122
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,084
I DON'T KNOW.

123
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,668
I'D HAVE TO THINK TWICE
ABOUT THAT.

124
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,920
FINE. AND IF YOU
WERE LUCKY,

125
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,171
YOU WOULDN'T DIE
ON THE TABLE

126
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,505
WHILE YOU WERE
MAKING UP YOUR MIND.

127
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,967
THAT SHOULD DO IT.
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

128
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,260
NOT BAD.

129
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,221
THANKS.

130
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,940
DOCTOR, DID
YOU NOTICE

131
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,942
HOW RUDELY THAT
OFFICER TREATED YOU?

132
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,153
NO MORE SO THAN MOST.

133
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,612
YOU MEAN OTHERS
ACT THAT WAY TOO?

134
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,906
LET'S JUST SAY
I'VE BECOME ACCUSTOMED

135
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,743
TO BEING TREATED
LIKE A HYPOSPRAY.

136
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,871
NOW, HERE'S SOME MATERIAL
ON FIRST AID FOR BURNS.

137
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,833
DOCTOR, I THINK I'D LIKE TO DO
MORE THAN STUDY FIRST AID.

138
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,293
I'D BE INTERESTED
IN KNOWING MORE

139
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,253
ABOUT ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.

140
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,047
YOU'RE INTELLECTUALLY CURIOUS.

141
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,382
I LIKE THAT.

142
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,056
THESE DEAL WITH HUMAN ANATOMY
AND PHYSIOLOGY

143
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,724
BUT THEY WEREN'T WRITTEN
FOR THE LAYMAN.

144
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,059
THEY'RE QUITE TECHNICAL.

145
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,644
I UNDERSTAND.

146
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,896
I'LL DO MY BEST.

147
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,606
AND I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.

148
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,572
WE'VE ANALYZED THE DATA.

149
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,116
SO FAR, OUR SENSORS
HAVE DETECTED

150
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,327
FOUR SEPARATE SCANS
OF THE MICROPROBE--

151
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,996
EACH ONE ON
A PROGRESSIVELY NARROWER BAND.

152
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,498
SOMEONE ON THE OTHER END
OF THAT WORMHOLE

153
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,291
IS DEFINITELY INTERESTED
IN THAT PROBE.

154
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,876
WE CANNOT PRECLUDE
THE POSSIBILITY

155
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,419
THAT THERE IS
A MICROSCOPIC ENTITY

156
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,712
WITHIN THE WORMHOLE

157
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,630
CURIOUS ABOUT AN INTRUDER.

158
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,840
THAT'S POSSIBLE,

159
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,217
BUT YOU'D THINK
OUR PROBE

160
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,801
WOULD HAVE DETECTED
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

161
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,970
WHAT'S THE CONDITION
OF THE PROBE NOW?

162
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,972
I'VE BEEN MONITORING IT
FROM ENGINEERING.

163
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,308
IT'S STILL IMBEDDED IN
THE GRAVITATIONAL EDDY

164
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,228
BUT WITHIN 72 HOURS,
IT WILL BE CRUSHED.

165
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,521
BUT UNTIL THEN,

166
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,231
IT SHOULD CONTINUE
TO TRANSMIT TELEMETRY.

167
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,691
IF WE'RE READING SCANS
FROM THE OTHER SIDE,

168
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,652
IT'S POSSIBLE THE PROBE
IS ACTING AS A RELAY.

169
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,863
IF THAT'S TRUE,
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT

170
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,073
TO TRANSMIT A MESSAGE

171
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,908
TO WHOEVER IS EXECUTING
THE SCAN.

172
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,078
YES. I CAN MODIFY OUR
SUBSPACE COMMUNICATIONS BAND

173
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,039
TO ACCEPT THE PROBE
AS A BOOSTER.

174
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,208
LET'S TRY IT, MR. KIM.

175
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,001
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.

176
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,131
I FEAR MR. KIM'S EXUBERANCE

177
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,925
MAY TURN INTO AN EQUALLY
INTENSE DISAPPOINTMENT

178
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,927
IF HIS EFFORTS
PROVE IN VAIN.

179
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,763
YOU MAY BE RIGHT,
BUT I'D RATHER ASSUME

180
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,557
THAT HE'S GOING
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

181
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,898
OKAY, I'VE BOOSTED POWER
TO THE COMMUNICATIONS BANDWIDTH.

182
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,108
NOW, ALL WE HAVE TO DO

183
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,943
IS RECONFIGURE
THE SIGNAL GENERATOR

184
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,529
SO IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH
THE PROBE'S LONG-RANGE SENSORS.

185
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,821
I'M ON IT.

186
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,698
JUST A FEW MINUTES MORE.

187
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,158
THIS HAS TO WORK.

188
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,161
IT'LL MEAN SO MUCH
TO PEOPLE BACK HOME

189
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,289
TO KNOW WE'RE ALIVE
AND HEADED FOR FEDERATION SPACE.

190
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,124
WE HAVEN'T BEEN
GONE THAT LONG.

191
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,418
PEOPLE WON'T GIVE
UP ON US SO SOON.

192
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,505
THEY PROBABLY JUST
THINK WE'RE LOST.

193
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,966
IT'S STILL GOING
TO BE HARD ON MY FOLKS.

194
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,552
I ALWAYS CALLED THEM
ONCE A WEEK

195
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,388
EVEN WHEN I WAS ON
MY TRAINING MISSIONS.

196
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:43,143
I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT OF CONTACT
FOR SO LONG.

197
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,645
WELL, IT IS GOING
TO WORK, STARFLEET

198
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,897
SO PRETTY SOON THEY'RE GOING
TO KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

199
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,111
HOW ABOUT YOU?

200
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,448
ANY FAMILY?

201
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,740
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY FATHER
SINCE I WAS 5.

202
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,493
HE AND MY MOTHER
SEPARATED.

203
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,785
HE WENT BACK TO EARTH,

204
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,998
AND THAT WAS THE LAST
I SAW OF HIM.

205
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,875
AND YOUR MOM?

206
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,211
I THINK SHE'S ON
THE KLINGON HOME WORLD.

207
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,463
YOU THINK?

208
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,424
WE DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL.

209
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,968
OKAY.

210
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,428
THE SIGNAL GENERATOR
SHOULD BE TUNED

211
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,388
TO THE PROBE'S
LONG-RANGE SENSORS.

212
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,933
ISN'T THERE ANYONE BACK HOME
WHO'D BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?

213
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,602
THE MAQUIS
ARE AS CLOSE A FAMILY

214
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,187
AS I'VE EVER HAD.

215
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,982
MOST OF MY FRIENDS
ARE HERE ON THE SHIP

216
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:34,361
SO... NO.

217
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,694
THERE'S NO ONE BACK HOME

218
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,071
WHO'S GOING TO CARE
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

219
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,116
WHETHER I'M ALIVE.

220
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,536
WE'RE READY TO TRANSMIT.

221
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,287
ENGINEERING TO BRIDGE.

222
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,080
JANEWAY HERE.

223
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,833
We have a communications link
with the micro-probe.

224
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,752
We're going to try sending
a preliminary test signal--

225
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,712
a series
of sub-harmonic pulses.

226
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,423
THEY STAND THE BEST CHANCE
OF TRANSMISSION

227
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,258
THROUGH THE WORMHOLE.
Acknowledged.

228
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,968
PROCEED.
Aye, Captain.

229
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,887
Chakotay:
I'M READING TRANSMISSION

230
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,222
OF THE TEST SIGNAL.

231
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,765
THE PROBE HAS RECEIVED IT
AND RELAYED IT.

232
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,435
HOW WILL WE KNOW
IF THE SIGNAL REACHES SOMEBODY?

233
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:12,232
THE ONLY WAY...
IS IF THAT SOMEBODY ANSWERS.

234
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,206
THERE'S NO RESPONSE.

235
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,541
IT'S TOO SOON.

236
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,958
REMEMBER, WE HAVE NO IDEA

237
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,086
HOW LONG IT TAKES TO
REACH THE OTHER SIDE.

238
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,213
ARE YOU READING ANYTHING,
MR. TUVOK?

239
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,797
NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN.

240
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,593
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD
SUGGEST A RESPONSE.

241
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,344
EVEN IF SOMEONE
RECEIVES OUR SIGNAL

242
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,804
IT MIGHT TAKE THEM SOME TIME
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RETURN IT.

243
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,181
YOU'RE RIGHT.

244
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,517
JANEWAY TO KIM.
CONTINUE TRANSMITTING.

245
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,727
Aye, Captain.

246
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,062
HOW LONG
SHOULD WE KEEP IT UP?

247
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,606
Until I tell you otherwise.

248
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,358
YOU HAVE THE BRIDGE, COMMANDER.

249
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,110
CAPTAIN.

250
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,445
MR. TUVOK.

251
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,904
I'M GETTING SOMETHING, CAPTAIN.

252
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,573
I'M GETTING IT, TOO.

253
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,742
A SUBSPACE SIGNAL
RELAYED THROUGH THE PROBE.

254
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,326
THAT SIGNAL'S
BEING TRANSMITTED

255
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,953
EXACTLY THE SAME
FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE

256
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,413
AS OUR SIGNAL.

257
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,373
IT'S A RESPONSE.

258
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,375
SOMEONE RECEIVED
OUR TRANSMISSION

259
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,628
AND SENT ONE BACK,

260
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,172
AND THEIR SIGNAL
ORIGINATED IN THE...

261
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,633
ALPHA QUADRANT.

262
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,351
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG--SUPPLEMENTAL.</i>

263
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,978
<i>ENCOURAGED BY HIS SUCCESS</i>

264
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,522
<i>IN TRANSMITTING A SIGNAL</i>
<i>TO THE ALPHA QUADRANT,</i>

265
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,065
<i>MR. KIM IS INVESTIGATING</i>

266
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,276
<i>THE POSSIBILITY</i>
<i>OF ESTABLISHING A VOICE LINK</i>

267
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,446
<i>WITH WHOEVER IS AT</i>

268
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,160
(<i> door chimes</i> )

269
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,453
COME IN.

270
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,583
KES, THIS IS A SURPRISE.

271
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,168
AM I INTERRUPTING?

272
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,419
NOT AT ALL.

273
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,796
I WAS JUST GOING TO HAVE
A CUP OF SOUP.

274
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,464
WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING?

275
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,215
SPINACH JUICE
WITH A TOUCH OF PEAR, PLEASE.

276
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,593
TOM PARIS INTRODUCED ME TO IT.
IT'S VERY NUTRITIOUS.

277
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,094
I'M SURE.

278
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,596
COMPUTER, ONE SPINACH JUICE
WITH A TOUCH OF PEAR

279
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,056
AND ONE CUP
OF VEGETABLE BOUILLON.

280
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,443
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

281
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,658
IF THERE WERE
A MEMBER OF THE CREW

282
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,618
WHOSE NEEDS
WEREN'T BEING MET

283
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,578
WOULD YOU WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT IT?

284
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,664
OF COURSE.

285
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,208
KES, DO YOU
AND NEELIX FEEL

286
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,959
THAT YOUR NEEDS
ARE BEING IGNORED?

287
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,211
OF COURSE NOT.

288
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,420
WE'RE VERY HAPPY HERE.

289
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,465
I'M REFERRING
TO THE DOCTOR.

290
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,883
THE DOCTOR.

291
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,343
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

292
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,723
WHY PEOPLE TREAT HIM
THE WAY THEY DO.

293
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,808
HOW DO PEOPLE
TREAT HIM?

294
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,601
AS THOUGH
HE DOESN'T EXIST.

295
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,021
THEY TALK ABOUT HIM
WHILE HE'S STANDING RIGHT THERE.

296
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,149
THEY IGNORE HIM,
THEY INSULT HIM.

297
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,984
WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'VE BEEN HEARING

298
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,653
THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE COIN.

299
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,530
MANY OF THE CREW HAVE COMPLAINED
THAT THE DOCTOR

300
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,947
IS BRUSQUE, EVEN RUDE.

301
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,075
THAT HE LACKS
ANY BEDSIDE MANNER.

302
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,661
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
REPROGRAMMING HIM.

303
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,204
YOU CAN DO THAT?

304
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,455
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

305
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,166
KES, HE'S ONLY
A HOLOGRAM.

306
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,794
HE'S YOUR MEDICAL OFFICER.
HE'S ALIVE.

307
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,337
NO, HE'S NOT.

308
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,964
HE'S SELF-AWARE.
HE'S COMMUNICATIVE.

309
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,467
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO LEARN.

310
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,053
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN PROGRAMMED
TO DO THAT.

311
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,681
SO BECAUSE HE'S A HOLOGRAM,

312
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,684
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TREATED
WITH RESPECT

313
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,353
OR ANY CONSIDERATION
AT ALL?

314
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,775
VERY WELL.

315
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,818
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

316
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,486
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

317
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,330
OKAY, WE'LL BE READY TO GO
ONLINE IN A COUPLE MINUTES.

318
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,917
I'M STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE
GRAVITATIONAL INTERFERENCE.

319
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,710
I DON'T THINK THE
COVARIANT ISOLATOR

320
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,421
WILL BE EFFECTIVE WITH
A VOCAL TRANSMISSION.

321
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,800
LET'S TRY INVERTING
THE NARROW BAND FILTER.

322
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,052
PROGRESS REPORT,
ENSIGN.

323
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,096
I THINK WE'RE READY TO
GIVE IT A TRY.

324
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,514
BUT WE'RE PUSHING THROUGH
SOME PRETTY HEAVY

325
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,141
GRAVITATIONAL INTERFERENCE.

326
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,310
I CAN'T GUARANTEE THE CLARITY
OF THE TRANSMISSION.

327
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,854
LET'S SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.

328
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,147
THIS IS CAPTAIN KATHRYN JANEWAY

329
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,650
OF THE FEDERATION STARSHIP
<i>VOYAGER.</i>

330
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,359

(<i> static</i> )

332
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,657
I'LL NARROW THE FILTER BAND-PASS
SOME MORE.

333
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,408
TRY AGAIN, CAPTAIN.

334
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,620
THIS IS KATHRYN JANEWAY
OF THE FEDERATION SHIP<i> VOYAGER.</i>

335
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,997

339
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,008
NARROW THE BAND-PASS
A LITTLE MORE.

340
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,677
TRY AGAIN, CAPTAIN.

341
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,886
THIS IS JANEWAY.

342
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,806
PLEASE REPEAT
YOUR LAST TRANSMISSION.

WE'RE STILL TRYING

00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,986
TO CLEAR UP
YOUR LAST TRANSMISSION.

349
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,780
<i>PLEASE</i> REPEAT
ONE MORE TIME.

350
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,324
The captain
of the cargo vessel<i> Talvath.</i>

351
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:17,328
Location Alpha Quadrant,
Sector 1385.

352
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,747
What is your location?

353
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,666
WE ARE IN THE DELTA QUADRANT,

354
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,668
BUT SINCE THIS QUADRANT
HASN'T BEEN CHARTED,

355
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,170
I CAN'T SPECIFY
OUR EXACT LOCATION.

356
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,006
Please confirm.

357
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,674
You said Delta Quadrant?

358
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,884
CORRECT.

359
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,802
In a Federation starship?

360
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,888
YES. WE WERE ON A MISSION,

361
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,724
AND WE GOT PULLED
INTO THIS QUADRANT.

362
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,933
Pulled in? How?

363
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,351
IT'S A COMPLICATED STORY.

364
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,353
PLEASE, IF YOU WOULD JUST
TRY DECONSTRUCTING

365
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,980
THE PHASE SHIFT OF
OUR HAILING FREQUENCY

366
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,565
YOU COULD VERIFY.

367
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,901
You are undoubtedly
still in the Alpha Quadrant.

368
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,527
What are your coordinates?

369
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,112
I ASSURE YOU
I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

370
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:56,534
WE ARE IN THE DELTA QUADRANT,
70,000 LIGHT YEARS FROM YOU.

371
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,870
This is preposterous.
You are obviously lying.

372
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,496
I am terminating
the communication.

373
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,081
NO. NO, WAIT.

374
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,960
KIM, HAIL HIM AGAIN.

375
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,712
NO RESPONSE, CAPTAIN.

376
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,552
WHY WOULD HE HAVE BROKEN OFF
TRANSMISSION?

377
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,512
PERHAPS I CAN OFFER
AN EXPLANATION.

378
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,766
THE COMLINK SIGNATURE
OF HIS TRANSMISSION INDICATES

379
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,184
THE MESSAGE ORIGINATED
FROM A ROMULAN SHIP.

380
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,729
FURTHER, THERE ARE NO
KNOWN SHIPPING LANES

381
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,731
IN THE SECTOR HE IDENTIFIED.

382
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,859
GIVEN THE PRECISE CALIBRATION
OF HIS SIGNAL, I WOULD SUGGEST

383
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,820
THAT HE IS IN FACT
ONBOARD A SCIENCE VESSEL.

384
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,489
WHY WOULD HE PRETEND
TO BE A CARGO CAPTAIN?

385
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,658
IF HE'S ENGAGED IN SOME KIND
OF SECRET RESEARCH

386
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,368
HE MIGHT WANT
TO CONCEAL THAT FACT.

387
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,288
PRECISELY, WHEN WE CLAIMED
TO BE TRANSMITTING

388
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,748
FROM THE DELTA QUADRANT--

389
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,250
AN IMPOSSIBILITY
SO FAR AS HE KNOWS--

390
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,919
HE MAY HAVE FEARED
WE WERE FEDERATION SPIES.

391
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,212
JUST OUR LUCK. WE RAISE ONE SHIP
FROM THE ALPHA QUADRANT

392
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,631
AND IT HAS
TO BE ROMULAN.

393
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,674
THAT ROMULAN
STILL HAS THE ABILITY

394
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,593
TO GET A MESSAGE TO STARFLEET.

395
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,719
MR. KIM

396
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,055
HAIL THE<i> TALVATH</i>
REPEATEDLY.

397
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,932
CALL ME THE MINUTE
YOU RE-ESTABLISH CONTACT.

398
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,059
COMMANDER, YOU HAVE
THE BRIDGE.

399
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,853
AYE, CAPTAIN.

400
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,455
COMPUTER, INITIATE EMERGENCY
MEDICAL HOLOGRAPHIC PROGRAM.

401
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,374
PLEASE STATE THE NATURE OF
THE MEDICAL EMERGENCY.

402
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,836
THERE IS NO EMERGENCY,
DOCTOR.

403
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,212
WELL... THAT'S GOOD.

404
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,714
I WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF PREPARING A CULTURE

405
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,257
TO TEST LIEUTENANT HARGROVE

406
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,636
FOR ARETHEAN FLU WHEN
ENSIGN KYOTO DEACTIVATED ME.

407
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,514
I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE BUSY.

408
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,390
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT,
CAPTAIN?

409
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,394
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT
WE MIGHT JUST...

410
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,646
TALK FOR A MOMENT.

411
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,148
ABOUT WHAT?

412
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,651
DOCTOR, YOU WERE ORIGINALLY
PROGRAMMED TO SERVE

413
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,195
IN A LIMITED FASHION
DURING AN EMERGENCY.

414
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,405
NOW YOU'RE BEING ASKED
TO DO MUCH MORE.

415
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,075
THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE.

416
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,243
I'M PROVIDING FULL-TIME
MEDICAL SERVICE

417
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,954
FOR THE ENTIRE SHIP'S CREW

418
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,831
FUNCTIONING AS BOTH
DOCTOR AND NURSE

419
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,708
AND NOW AS AN
INSTRUCTOR AS WELL.

420
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,169
YOU DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY
OF THINKING OF YOURSELF

421
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,172
AS AN EMERGENCY
MEDICAL PROGRAM ANYMORE.

422
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:18,051
YOU'VE BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED
MEMBER OF THE CREW.

423
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,426
I SEE.

424
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:23,430
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT I BE REPROGRAMMED?

425
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,516
NO.

426
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:29,395
I'M ASKING IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO...

427
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,813
TO HELP YOU.

428
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,148
HELP ME?

429
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,193
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED OR WANT

430
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,028
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THAT YOU GET IT.

431
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,364
WHAT I'D LIKE IS TO BE TURNED
OFF WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE.

432
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,951
I SPEND HOURS HERE
WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO.

433
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,079
WHEN SOMEONE DOES REMEMBER
TO DEACTIVATE ME,

434
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,915
THEY DO SO WITHOUT ASKING
IF IT'S CONVENIENT.

435
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,709
IT'S EXTREMELY IRRITATING.

436
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,382
WHAT IF I GAVE YOU CONTROL...

437
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,802
OVER YOUR
DEACTIVATION SEQUENCE?

438
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,221
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

439
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,430
I'M SURE
WE CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE

440
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,890
FOR YOU
TO TURN YOURSELF OFF

441
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,809
OR TO PREVENT
BEING TURNED OFF.

442
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,106
I... I MIGHT LIKE THAT.

443
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,817
I'LL HAVE SOMEONE
LOOK INTO IT.

444
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,987
ANYTHING ELSE?

445
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,572
I'M NOT SURE.

446
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,783
I'LL HAVE TO GIVE IT
SOME THOUGHT.

447
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,994
YOU DO THAT.

448
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,812
Kim to Captain Janeway.

449
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,272
JANEWAY HERE.

450
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:58,567
Captain, we've got him back--
the Romulan.

451
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,860
GOOD WORK.

452
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,738
PUT HIM THROUGH TO MY QUARTERS.

453
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,244
THIS IS KATHRYN JANEWAY.

454
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,080
This is the cargo vessel
<i>Talvath.</i>

455
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,416
THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING
OUR HAIL, CAPTAIN.

456
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,294
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

457
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,378
HOW MAY I ADDRESS YOU?

458
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,343
I'd prefer not to give my name.

459
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,887
VERY WELL.

460
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,639
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL

461
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,724
WHEN I TOLD YOU WHERE WE ARE.

462
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,561
I HOPE YOU'VE BEEN ABLE
TO VERIFY OUR POSITION.

463
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,397
My analysis of your hailing
frequency seems to indicate

464
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,900
that it originates
in the Delta Quadrant,

465
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,694
but I am not precluding
the possibility

466
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:46,240
that you've been able to create
that illusion somehow.

467
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,034
TO WHAT END?

468
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:53,873
I'm not sure, but that doesn't
negate the possibility.

469
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,876
HOW CAN I ASSURE YOU
OF MY TRUTHFULNESS?

470
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,712
You say
you're a Federation ship.

471
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,298
Are you a Starfleet vessel?

472
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,677
YES, WE ARE.

473
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,723
And your mission
in the Delta Quadrant?

474
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,684
OUR MISSION WAS ORIGINALLY
IN THE ALPHA QUADRANT.

475
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:18,105
WE WERE PULLED AGAINST OUR WILL
TO OUR PRESENT LOCATION.

476
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,982
NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET HOME.

477
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,568
Aren't you in fact
Starfleet spies

478
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,112
on a surveillance mission?

479
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:30,201
CAPTAIN, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN.

480
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,869
NATURALLY, THE ROMULAN EMPIRE

481
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:36,414
DOESN'T WANT STARFLEET
SPYING ON ITS SCIENCE VESSELS

482
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,710
BUT SINCE WE'RE 70,000
LIGHT YEARS FROM ROMULAN SPACE

483
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,756
AND A SUBSPACE MESSAGE
TO STARFLEET WOULD TAKE YEARS

484
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,716
I THINK YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

485
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:49,678
THAT WE CAN'T BE MUCH
OF A THREAT TO YOU.

486
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,472
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO FEAR FROM US.

487
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,308
Soothing words, Captain,

488
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,977
but they are only words.

489
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,276
IF WE WERE SPIES...

490
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,570
WE WOULDN'T BE ASKING
WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU NOW.

491
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:12,701
WE HAVE NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING
WITH STARFLEET...

492
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,162
WITH OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES.

493
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:25,881
WE'RE HOPING YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO RELAY A MESSAGE FOR US.

494
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,259
OUR CREW IS NOT LARGE.

495
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,720
EACH OF THEM COULD WRITE
A SHORT, PERSONAL MESSAGE.

496
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,057
YOU'D BE WELCOME TO READ
THEM ALL BEFORE PASSING THEM ON.

497
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,351
AND I THINK YOU'D BE CONVINCED
THAT THEY'RE NOTHING MORE

498
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:41,981
THAN THE HEARTFELT WORDS
OF SOME...

499
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,857
VERY LONELY PEOPLE.

500
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,780
Captain...
it would ease my apprehension

501
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,159
if I could see that you are
who you say you are.

502
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,869
I have a signal amplifier
on board.

503
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,289
I've been working
to reconfigure the protocols

504
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,541
to penetrate the radiation
stream of the wormhole.

505
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,919
I think it might be possible

506
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,755
to establish
a visual link between us.

507
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,592
I HAVE NO OBJECTION.

508
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:15,139
WHEN THAT'S DONE...
WILL YOU HELP US?

509
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,974
I make no promises.

510
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,311
Let us proceed
one step at a time.

511
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,854
Have your officers contact me

512
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,107
in order to attempt
the visual link.

513
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,859
Good night.

514
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,610
GOOD NIGHT.

515
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,713
WE'RE READY TO TRY A VISUAL LINK
WITH THE ROMULAN SHIP, CAPTAIN.

516
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,048
GOOD WORK.
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE

517
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,466
CONFIGURING THE PROTOCOLS.

518
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,009
BUT THAT PHASE VARIANCE
IN THE RADIATION STREAM

519
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,719
GAVE US A FEW PROBLEMS.

520
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,804
TORRES IS GOING TO BALANCE IT
MANUALLY FROM ENGINEERING.

521
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,140
OKAY, WE'VE GOT
THE COMMUNICATIONS

522
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,310
FREQUENCY LOCKED IN.

523
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,811
ON SCREEN.

524
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,827
I presume you are
Captain Janeway.

525
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,162
YES.

526
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,581
I WANT
TO THANK YOU, CAPTAIN,

527
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,292
FOR MAINTAINING CONTACT
WITH US.

528
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,337
IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL
TO ME AND TO MY CREW.

529
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,509
I am not familiar
with this class of ship.

530
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:37,054
IT'S NEW,
BUT IT ISN'T CLASSIFIED.

531
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,722
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED
YOUR INTELLIGENCE

532
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,724
HASN'T PROVIDED YOU
WITH INFORMATION.

533
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,851
I've been at space
for over a year, Captain,

534
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,438
and am not privy
to the latest intelligence.

535
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,274
I'm sure that our operatives
have provided the government

536
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,485
with the detailed information
about your new ship.

537
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,237
NO DOUBT.

538
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,489
CAPTAIN, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE

539
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,116
TO COMMUNICATE
WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT

540
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,118
ABOUT SENDING
OUR MESSAGES?

541
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,537
I have.

542
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,331
They've promised to take
the matter under advisement.

543
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,624
I SEE.

544
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,835
AND WHEN DO YOU THINK
THEY WILL HAVE AN ANSWER?

545
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,338
It is impossible
to predict the timetable

546
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,590
of the Romulan Senate.

547
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,882
When they've made
their decision,

548
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,217
I will hear from them.

549
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,552
WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY

550
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,471
OF A GREAT DEAL OF TIME.

551
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,265
MY OFFICERS ARE PREDICTING THAT
THE PROBE WILL BECOME INOPERABLE

552
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,516
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

553
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,603
Captain, I am
a low-ranking scientist

554
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,146
a minor functionary.

555
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,316
It is not my place
to tell the Romulan Senate

556
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,611
to speed up their
decision-making process.

557
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,654
YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN IN SPACE
FOR OVER A YEAR.

558
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,742
DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY?

559
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,248
Yes.

560
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,708
I ASSUME THEY'RE NOT
WITH YOU IN SPACE.

561
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:56,342
My wife... and my daughter
are on Romulus.

562
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,177
A DAUGHTER.

563
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,095
HOW OLD IS SHE?

564
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:08,103
She is... seven months.

565
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,729
THEN YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HER.

566
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:13,567
To my sorrow, no.

567
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,195
She will be two years old
before I get back.

568
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,905
YOU MUST MISS YOUR FAMILY
VERY MUCH.

569
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,494
I knew when I accepted
this assignment

570
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:27,080
that there would be
a price to pay.

571
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,876
Perhaps I didn't realize
how high that price would be.

572
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,254
CAPTAIN...

573
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,800
EVERY ONE OF US ON THIS SHIP
HAS LEFT BEHIND FRIENDS, FAMILY

574
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,177
LOVED ONES.

575
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,637
WE MAY NOT SEE THEM AGAIN

576
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:42,888
FOR YEARS...

577
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,306
MAYBE NEVER.

578
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:48,519
SO WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND
HOW LONELY YOU MUST BE.

579
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,229
SURELY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

580
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,606
OUR FEELINGS AS WELL.

581
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:56,193
WE WOULD BE DEEPLY GRATEFUL
FOR ANY EFFORTS YOU MIGHT MAKE

582
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,655
TO PERSUADE YOUR GOVERNMENT
TO SEND OUR MESSAGES.

583
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,456
I cannot guarantee success,
but I will try to persuade

584
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,668
my superiors to make
their decision quickly...

585
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,422
and positively.

586
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,591
THANK YOU.

587
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,344
I will contact you again.

588
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:32,020
COMMANDER, LET'S
ASSUME HE'S GOING
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

589
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,689
TELL THE CREW
TO PREPARE PERSONAL MESSAGES

590
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,441
AND HAVE THEM READY
WITHIN THE HOUR.

591
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,735
WITH PLEASURE, CAPTAIN.

592
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,865
CAPTAIN, I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

593
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,451
GO AHEAD, TORRES.

594
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,120
NO! I MEAN, IN PRIVATE.

595
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,712
I THINK THIS WILL WORK,
CAPTAIN,

596
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,505
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BRING IT UP
IN FRONT OF THE CREW.

597
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,881
IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT
TO GET THEIR HOPES UP

598
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,300
IN CASE IT DOESN'T WORK.

599
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,343
ALTHOUGH, I THINK IT WILL.
SLOW DOWN, TORRES.

600
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,722
AND TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

601
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,182
THE PHASE AMPLITUDE
OF THE VISUAL LINK

602
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,351
WITH THE ROMULAN SHIP--

603
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,894
IT'S WITHIN
JUST A FEW MEGAHERTZ

604
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,356
OF MEETING
TRANSPORTER PROTOCOLS.

605
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,857
ARE YOU SUGGESTING..?

606
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,401
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO PIGGY-BACK

607
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,445
A TRANSPORTER BEAM
ONTO THE VISUAL LINK.

608
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:25,407
WE COULD TRANSPORT THE ENTIRE
CREW BACK TO THE ALPHA QUADRANT.

609
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,200
YOU'LL HAVE TO RECONFIGURE
THE MATTER TRANSMISSION RATE

610
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,619
FAIRLY SUBSTANTIALLY.

611
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,287
AND WE RISK LOSING
WHATEVER WE TRY TO BEAM OUT.

612
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,665
WE'LL HAVE TO RUN
A SERIES OF TESTS FIRST.

613
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,291
SEE TO IT, LIEUTENANT.

614
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,168
I'LL NEED SOME HELP.
YOU HAVE MY AUTHORIZATION

615
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,919
TO USE ANY OF THE SHIP'S
PERSONNEL YOU NEED.

616
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,880
THIS IS TOP PRIORITY.
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT SECRECY.

617
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,051
I DOUBT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
KEEP THIS QUIET FOR VERY LONG.

618
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,870
I FINISHED THESE,
AND I'M READY FOR MORE.

619
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,330
YOU FINISHED THOSE ALREADY?

620
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,541
I ENJOYED STUDYING ANATOMY.

621
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,836
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING
TO SEE AN AUTOPSY SOMETIME.

622
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,422
WHAT ARE THE BONES
OF THE MIDDLE EAR?

623
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,508
MALLEUS, INCUS AND STAPES.

624
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,218
AND THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE
BETWEEN THE MIDDLE

625
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,094
AND THE EXTERNAL
AUDITORY CANAL?

626
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,596
THE TYMPANIC MEMBRANE.

627
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,599
HMM, I SUSPECT YOU HAVE
AN EIDETIC MEMORY--

628
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,184
AN ASTONISHING GIFT.

629
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:38,063
I'LL DO A FULL NEURAL SCAN
ON YOU AT SOME POINT.

630
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,356
I'VE BEEN THINKING...

631
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,525
IF WE DO GET BACK
TO FEDERATION SPACE

632
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,819
I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE
THE POSSIBILITY

633
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,529
OF GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

634
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,073
IF YOU CONTINUE TO APPLY
YOURSELF AS YOU HAVE,

635
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,616
BY THE TIME WE GET BACK,

636
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,660
YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE THE
EQUIVALENT OF A MEDICAL DEGREE.

637
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,119
THEN YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?

638
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,329
HEARD WHAT?

639
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:58,792
THAT WE MIGHT BE GETTING
BACK SOON.

640
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,168
IF THERE'S ONE THING
YOU CAN COUNT ON

641
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,920
IT'S THAT I AM THE LAST
TO BE TOLD

642
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,839
ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS
ON THIS SHIP.

643
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,632
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT.

644
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,301
THERE MAY BE A WAY
TO TRANSPORT ALL OF US

645
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,762
TO THE ALPHA QUADRANT.

646
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,346
CHIEF TORRES
AND HALF OF ENGINEERING

647
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,307
ARE WORKING ON IT
RIGHT NOW.

648
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,559
I SEE.

649
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,352
WELL, I'LL SAY GOOD-BYE NOW.

650
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,230
I WON'T BE TRANSPORTING
WITH THE REST OF YOU.

651
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,775
BUT CAN'T WE DOWNLOAD YOUR
PROGRAM AND TAKE YOU WITH US?

652
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:26,027
MY PROGRAM IS FULLY INTEGRATED
INTO THE SICK BAY SYSTEM.

653
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:30,198
AT PRESENT,
I CANNOT BE DOWNLOADED.

654
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,331
THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

655
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,961
WAIT. I'D LIKE...

656
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,296
THAT IS..

657
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,548
COULD I ASK A FAVOR OF YOU?

658
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,383
ANYTHING.

659
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,094
IF YOU DO LEAVE,
BEFORE YOU GO

660
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:55,348
WOULD YOU CHECK TO MAKE SURE
I'VE BEEN DEACTIVATED?

661
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,601
I PROMISE.

662
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,321
OUR CHIEF ENGINEER HAS MANAGED
TO BIND A TRANSPORTER BEAM

663
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,573
TO THE VISUAL LINK
BETWEEN US.

664
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,659
Then you've matched
your data transmission

665
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,244
to the phase amplitude
of our com signal?

666
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,831
EXACTLY.

667
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,707
Apparently
our intelligence operatives

668
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,084
are not doing their job.

669
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,421
You clearly have technology
that we are unaware of.

670
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,173
This would be
an incredible breakthrough

671
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,133
in subspace field mechanics.

672
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,218
IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL,
WE'D LIKE TO TRY TRANSMITTING

673
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,429
A TEST CYLINDER TO YOU.

674
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,265
A test cylinder of what sort?

675
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,225
IT IS A STANDARD
STARFLEET MECHANISM

676
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,144
WITH A VARIETAL
MOLECULAR MATRIX.

677
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,314
IT SIMULATES MOST KNOWN ORGANIC
AND NON-ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.

678
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,983
IT IS NOT
CLASSIFIED TECHNOLOGY.

679
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,527
Ah, I am aware
of this mechanism.

680
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,404
We use a similar device.

681
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,740
I will allow the transport.

682
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,241
Janeway:
BRIDGE TO TRANSPORTER ROOM 1.

683
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,576
Torres here.

684
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,203
WE'RE ALL SET, CAPTAIN.

685
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,579
THE LOCK IS ACTIVE

686
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,080
AND WE'RE FOCUSED
ON THE ROMULANS'

687
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,582
transporter coordinates.

688
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,876
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

689
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,798
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

690
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,132
ENERGIZE.

691
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,682
THE CYLINDER HAS
DEMATERIALIZED, CAPTAIN.

692
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,691
CAN YOU GET IT BACK?
The pattern buffer

693
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,777
IS HAVING TROUBLE ACCEPTING
THE MATTER STREAM.

694
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,739
I'll increase power to the phase
transmission coils.

695
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,874
RAMP THE COILS
TO 37 MEGAJOULES.

696
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,542
37 MEGAJOULES.

697
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,976
Congratulations, Captain.

698
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,811
You've done it.

699
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,105
Very impressive.

700
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,733
WE SHOULD RUN A SERIES OF
THESE TESTS JUST TO MAKE SURE.

701
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,193
BUT WE HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY
BEFORE THE PROBE IS CRUSHED.

702
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,904
I understand.

703
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,865
EVENTUALLY WE'LL HAVE TO TRY
TRANSPORTING A PERSON.

704
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,324
ONE OF OUR CREW
WILL BEAM TO YOUR SHIP

705
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,368
IF YOU'LL ALLOW IT.

706
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,037
I'm afraid
I can't permit that, Captain.

707
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,580
My government would never allow

708
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,540
Starfleet personnel
on this ship.

709
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,919
I wouldn't want my logs
to show that activity.

710
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,005
THEN WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?

711
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:36,468
I'll volunteer to transport
to your ship... and back again.

712
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:41,598
BUT, CAPTAIN, IF WE CAN'T
TRANSPORT TO YOUR SHIP,

713
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,558
HOW ARE WE TO GET BACK?

714
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,896
If the procedure is successful

715
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,607
I'll arrange for a troop ship
to join me.

716
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,068
That would easily accommodate
your crew.

717
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,319
VERY WELL.

718
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,071
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

719
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,461
KIM AND TORRES HAVE MADE
MORE THAN 20 TRANSPORTS

720
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,171
OF THE TEST CYLINDER.

721
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,589
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S STILL
HAVING TROUBLE

722
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,882
WITH THAT PHASE VARIANCE,

723
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,467
EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS
BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

724
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,136
LET'S HOPE IT GOES AS WELL
WITH THE ROMULAN.

725
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,096
CAPTAIN, I MUST INSIST I STAY
WITH HIM AT ALL TIMES.

726
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,430
WHILE HE'S ONBOARD.

727
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,141
AGREED.

728
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,852
WE'RE LOCKED ON TO HIM.
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, CAPTAIN.

729
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,562
WELL, LET'S TRY IT.

730
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,440
ENERGIZE...

731
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,282
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

732
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,161
IT'S THE PHASE VARIANCE
IN THE RADIATION STREAM.

733
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,872
I'M BALANCING IT MANUALLY.

734
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:01,761
WELCOME TO THE DELTA QUADRANT...
CAPTAIN.

735
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,276
MY FIRST OFFICER,
COMMANDER CHAKOTAY

736
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,612
LIEUTENANT TUVOK,
HEAD OF SECURITY

737
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,323
CHIEF ENGINEER TORRES...

738
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,868
AND OPERATIONS OFFICER KIM.

739
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,707
MY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENT.

740
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,252
THIS IS AN ASTONISHING
BREAKTHROUGH.

741
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,879
FOR A WHILE THERE I DIDN'T
THINK YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.

742
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,797
THERE WAS A STRANGE
PHASE VARIANCE

743
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,216
IN THE RADIATION STREAM.

744
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,885
IT ALMOST KEPT US
FROM PULLING YOU THROUGH.

745
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:46,514
MR. TUVOK, YOU MAY BEGIN
EVACUATION PROCEDURES.

746
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,350
I SUGGEST WE DELAY THAT
FOR THE MOMENT, CAPTAIN.

747
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,771
I'M AFRAID I FOUND THE REASON
FOR THE UNUSUAL PHASE VARIANCE.

748
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,231
WHAT IS IT?

749
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,900
CAPTAIN, WHAT YEAR IS IT?

750
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,112
WHAT YEAR?

751
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,654
IF YOU PLEASE.

752
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,576
BY YOUR CALENDAR,
THE YEAR IS 2351.

753
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,374
BUT... THIS IS 2371.

754
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:18,213
EXACTLY. OUR ROMULAN VISITOR
IS A PERSON OUT OF TIME.

755
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:22,341
HE'S SHOWING CLEAR EVIDENCE
OF TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT.

756
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,511
I WOULD SURMISE
THAT THE WORMHOLE IS A RIFT,

757
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,306
NOT JUST IN SPACE,
BUT IN TIME.

758
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,558
THE UNUSUAL PHASE VARIANCE
WE DETECTED

759
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,813
WAS ACTUALLY AN INDICATION
OF A TEMPORAL SHIFT.

760
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,233
WE HAVE TRANSPORTED HIM
FROM 20 YEARS IN THE PAST

761
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,734
TO OUR PRESENT.

762
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,784
I'VE GONE OVER AND OVER
THE TRANSPORTER LOGS.

763
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,578
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT
IF WE TRY TO TRANSPORT OURSELVES

764
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,247
THROUGH THAT WORMHOLE

765
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:56,001
WE'LL END UP 20 YEARS
IN THE PAST.

766
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,961
THEN LET'S DO IT.

767
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,254
IT'S BETTER THAN SPENDING

768
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,131
THE NEXT 70 YEARS
TRYING TO GET BACK.

769
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,049
Paris:
HOW CAN WE DO THAT?

770
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,761
WE'D BE GOING BACK TO A TIME
WHEN YOU WERE ONLY 2 YEARS OLD.

771
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,139
I KNOW YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTED, HARRY.

772
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:12,142
WE ALL ARE.

773
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:15,228
IT SEEMED WE WERE SO CLOSE...

774
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,984
BUT CLEARLY WE CAN'T GO BACK.

775
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,902
IT WOULD POLLUTE THE TIMELINE
TO SUCH AN EXTENT

776
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,198
THAT THE CONSEQUENCES
WOULD BE UNIMAGINABLE.

777
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:30,035
I'M AFRAID WE'LL HAVE
TO SEND YOU BACK ALONE

778
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,577
AND ASK THAT YOU
NOT REVEAL ANYTHING

779
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,163
THAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.

780
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,081
I CAN ASSURE YOU, CAPTAIN,
THAT I WOULD NOT DO

781
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,000
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT
CONTAMINATE THE FUTURE

782
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,128
AND PERHAPS HARM
THE ROMULAN EMPIRE.

783
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,882
BUT...

784
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,302
IN 20 YEARS...

785
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,973
I COULD ALERT STARFLEET
NOT TO LAUNCH

786
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,727
THE MISSION
WHICH SENT YOU HERE.

787
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:59,272
I'M AFRAID
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE EITHER.

788
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,691
WE'VE ALREADY HAD A HUGE IMPACT
ON THIS QUADRANT.

789
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,859
PEOPLE AND EVENTS HERE

790
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,611
WOULD BE DRASTICALLY
AFFECTED.

791
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:12,618
I'M AFRAID WE'RE LEFT
WITH OUR ORIGINAL REQUEST.

792
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,666
IN 20 YEARS...

793
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,961
WOULD YOU RELAY OUR PERSONAL
MESSAGES TO STARFLEET?

794
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,922
OF COURSE.

795
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:27,300
AT THE PROPER TIME,
I WILL TRANSMIT THEM.

796
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,641
IF YOU SHOULD FIND A WAY BACK
WITHIN MY LIFETIME...

797
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,478
I'D BE AN OLD MAN

798
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,940
BUT I WOULD WELCOME
A MESSAGE FROM YOU.

799
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,694
I AM TELEK R'MOR OF THE ROMULAN
ASTROPHYSICAL ACADEMY.

800
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,076
I PROMISE YOU'LL HEAR FROM US...

801
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,415
BECAUSE WE WILL GET BACK.

802
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,254
THESE ARE OUR MESSAGES.

803
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,674
I WISH YOU LUCK ON YOUR JOURNEY.

804
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,386
AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

805
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,608
ENERGIZE.

806
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,456
HIS SIGNAL'S
IN THE PATTERN BUFFER.

807
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,707
TRANSFERRING
TO THE EMITTER ARRAY.

808
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,542
PHASE VARIANCE
IS OUT OF SYNC AGAIN.

809
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,128
COMPENSATING.

810
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,217
TRANSPORT COMPLETE, CAPTAIN.

811
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,303
HE MADE IT.

812
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,309
I'LL TELL THE CREW.

813
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:00,893
THEY CAN HAVE
THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING

814
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,438
THAT THEIR MESSAGES
HAVE REACHED THEIR FAMILIES.

815
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,316
Tuvok:
CAPTAIN.

816
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:09,527
I DID NOT WANT TO MENTION THIS
UNTIL AFTER OUR GUEST HAD LEFT.

817
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,070
I CHECKED
THE COMPUTER DATABANKS

818
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,990
FOR A ROMULAN SCIENTIST
NAMED TELEK R'MOR.

819
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,825
AND?

820
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,618
I'M SORRY TO REPORT

821
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:21,831
DR. R'MOR DIED IN 2367.

822
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,833
(<i> softly</i> ):
THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO.

823
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,960
THAT IS CORRECT.

824
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,463
BEFORE HE WOULD HAVE SENT
OUR MESSAGES.

825
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,637
MAYBE HE LEFT A WILL

826
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,016
TELLING SOMEONE ELSE
TO TRANSMIT THE MESSAGES

827
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,767
OR HE COULD HAVE GIVEN
OUR COMPUTER CHIP

828
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,186
TO THE ROMULAN GOVERNMENT.

829
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,313
IT IS POSSIBLE.

830
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,857
UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW.

831
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,825
THEN LET'S MOVE ON.

832
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,538
WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO.

833
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,592
I TRIED A NEW
HAMSTRING EXERCISE.

834
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,302
MAYBE I OVERDID IT

835
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,637
BUT MY WORKOUTS ARE ABOUT
ALL THAT STAND BETWEEN ME

836
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:22,183
AND A SEVERE CASE
OF CABIN FEVER

837
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,562
LIEUTENANT, I AM THE CHIEF
MEDICAL OFFICER OF THIS SHIP.

838
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:26,854
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO ME

839
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:31,192
PLEASE DIRECT
THE STATEMENT TO ME.

840
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,527
WELL...

841
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:36,030
YOU SEE, I NEED TO WORK OUT.

842
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,074
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
NOT TO WORK OUT.

843
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,827
I'M SUGGESTING YOU USE A MODICUM
OF COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU DO IT.

844
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,872
IF I SEE YOU IN HERE AGAIN
FOR AN EXERCISE-RELATED INJURY

845
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,000
I'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS THE MATTER
WITH YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER.

846
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,586
YES... SIR.

847
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,379
YOU'RE FINE NOW.
YOU MAY LEAVE.

848
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,755
YES, SIR.

849
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,550
THANK YOU, SIR.

850
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,764
I DON'T THINK
HE'LL MAKE THE MISTAKE

851
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,017
OF IGNORING YOU AGAIN.

852
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,978
CAPTAIN JANEWAY HAS MADE ME
REALIZE THAT I MUST FUNCTION

853
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,064
AS MORE THAN AN EMERGENCY
MEDICAL REPLACEMENT.

854
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,776
I MUST THINK OF MYSELF
AS A... MEMBER OF THE CREW.

855
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,780
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

856
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,157
I'VE PREPARED
A LIST OF THINGS

857
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,994
I'D LIKE TO SEE
ADDED TO SICK BAY.

858
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,830
PERHAPS YOU COULD
PRESENT IT TO THE CAPTAIN?

859
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,332
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

860
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,085
THERE'S ONE MORE REQUEST.

861
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:35,131
SOMETHING OF A...
A PERSONAL NATURE.

862
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,801
I WOULD LIKE...

863
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,094
A NAME.
