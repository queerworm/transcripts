1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,134
For our third course...

2
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,052
[Chakotay]
Another course!

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:16,808
Luhvian quail in truffle sauce,
served with roasted chadre kab.

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,936
[Torres laughs]

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,939
My compliments to the chef.

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,856
[Paris]
Hear, hear.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,858
[applause]

8
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:25,984
Thank you, captain.

9
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:30,030
Cream of leola soup,
fetran risotto, Luhvian quail,

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,532
it just keeps getting better.

11
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,617
I knew you'd been
expanding your palate,

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,537
but I didn't realize
you'd become a gourmet cook.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,831
Preparing meals myself
is the best way to ensure quality.

14
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,919
I suppose I should be insulted,
but everything is so delicious,

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,548
I may just have to admit defeat
and hang up my apron.

16
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,551
No, that'd be a real tragedy, Neelix.

17
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,595
Pinot Noir, Commander?

18
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,764
I'll have another glass
of the Chardonnay.

19
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,975
Each course has been paired
with a specific wine.

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,102
Substitutions are not recommended.

21
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,020
The Pinot Noir sounds perfect.

22
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:06,567
-Is there any salt?
-Additional seasoning is not required.

23
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,527
Oh, I'm sorry, I--

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,821
If the quail hasn't been prepared
to your satisfaction,

25
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,407
I could replicate something
more to your liking.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,326
A peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
perhaps.

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,870
Actually,
it's delicious just the way it is.

28
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,330
[Chakotay chuckles]

29
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,793
Captain to the Bridge. Report.

30
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,253
We're being pulled off-course.

31
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,337
[Janeway]
<i>How?</i>

32
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,463
I'm not certain.

33
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,008
It appears to be
some kind of graviton surge.

34
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,843
On my way.

35
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,891
We've rerouted
all available power to the thrusters,

36
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,643
but we can't break free.

37
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,771
-Try reversing the shield polarity.
-No effect.

38
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,449
[grunting]

39
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,253
What happened to the stars?

40
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,244
[Tuvok]
Shields at 65 percent!

41
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,328
Hail them.

42
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,705
[Kim]
They're not responding.

43
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,789
Return fire.

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,419
Can you identify them?

45
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,254
Their weapon signature is Vaadwaur,

46
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,757
but the ship has technology
from several different species.

47
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,176
There's another vessel approaching.

48
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,137
-It's charging weapons.
-Evasive pattern Beta-6.

49
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,936
Maybe we've got an ally.

50
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,688
The Vaadwaur ship is retreating.

51
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,106
Hail the second ship.

52
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,401
No response.

53
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,904
I stand corrected.

54
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,703
They have penetrated our aft shields.

55
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,873
Reroute power to the auxiliary emitters
and return fire.

56
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,469
They've transported material
off Decks 5, 7 and 8.

57
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,804
Disable their engines.

58
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,768
Follow them.

59
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,437
Navigational sensors are malfunctioning.

60
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,147
Something to do with this environment.

61
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,774
I want a full damage report

62
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,235
and an inventory of everything
that was taken off this ship.

63
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,195
And I want to know where we are.

64
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,656
They got more than 90 percent
of our food stores,

65
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,408
including almost everything
in the Airponics Bay.

66
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,078
They also got a computer console
from Engineering,

67
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,705
and they emptied three
of our deuterium tanks.

68
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,582
Why would anyone steal deuterium?

69
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,417
You could find it anywhere.

70
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,253
Apparently not here.

71
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,339
I'm not detecting any gases,
stellar bodies, or matter of any kind.

72
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,509
Except for the ships that attacked us.

73
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,593
Scan for other vessels.

74
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,637
I want to know
how many we're dealing with.

75
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,640
There are more than 150 ships
within scanning range,

76
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,350
but I'm only detecting life signs
on 29 of them.

77
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,271
Captain, there's another vessel
approaching at high impulse.

78
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,106
Quite a welcoming committee
they've got here.

79
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,025
-What's the status of our shields?
-They're at 28 percent.

80
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,611
That'll have to do. Charge weapons.

81
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,362
Captain, this one wants to talk.

82
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,782
On screen.

83
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,369
I'm Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

84
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,080
<i>General Valen.</i>

85
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,249
<i>Welcome to the Void.</i>

86
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,255
You're the first ship we've seen here
that hasn't tried to fire on us,

87
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,466
but in case you change your mind,
we're prepared to defend ourselves.

88
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,261
<i>I know;</i>
<i>I've been observing you on sensors.</i>

89
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,764
<i>The way you fought those ships</i>
<i>was impressive.</i>

90
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,684
<i>Most vessels don't survive</i>
<i>the first few minutes.</i>

91
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:38,023
I'd appreciate any information
you could give us about where we are.

92
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,109
[Valen]
The anomaly's a closed structure,

93
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,154
encased by an inert layer of subspace.

94
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,240
Matter and energy can't penetrate it.

95
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,911
Our ships certainly penetrated it
when we were pulled in.

96
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,579
By the funnels.

97
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,834
But they only pull matter
in one direction,

98
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,502
into the Void.

99
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,838
Have you explored the entire anomaly?

100
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,675
There's nothing to explore, but it's big.

101
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,888
We've calculated the outer circumference
at approximately nine light-years,

102
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,598
but we've never been able to breach it.

103
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,141
How long have you been here?

104
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,102
More than five years.

105
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,730
There must be a way to escape.

106
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,316
New arrivals are always thinking
about escape.

107
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,778
We have a sophisticated starship.

108
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,657
Maybe if we work together,
we can find a way out.

109
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,325
You're being naive.

110
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,369
No one ever gets out.

111
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,829
We may be able to devise
a new approach.

112
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,915
Many have tried.

113
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,794
All they did was waste resources
that could've kept them alive longer.

114
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,506
Don't be foolish. I can help you.

115
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,840
How?

116
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,259
The only source
of food and energy in the Void

117
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,345
comes from new ships
that are drawn in.

118
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,681
If you want to survive here,

119
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,225
you'll have to compete
for their resources.

120
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,645
And I suppose you can help us do that.

121
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,608
I have tactical data on some
of the more dangerous predators.

122
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,945
But you want something in return.

123
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,242
My scans show
you have photon torpedoes.

124
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,578
I'm sorry, we don't trade weapons.

125
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,038
Why not?

126
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,667
Because we have no way of knowing
what they'll be used for.

127
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,586
Plundering innocent ships, for example.

128
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,257
Wait a few weeks
until your resources start to run out.

129
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,802
Morality won't keep
your life support systems running.

130
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,012
I'm sorry, General.

131
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,931
There are some compromises
I won't make.

132
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,476
Not yet.

133
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,826
Report, Lieutenant.

134
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,288
We're using power at almost ten times
the usual rate.

135
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,581
While we're standing still?

136
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,958
The same graviton forces
that pulled us into the anomaly

137
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,918
seem to be draining the warp core.

138
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:08,214
At this rate, our deuterium
will be gone in about ten days.

139
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,800
Shut down all nonessential systems.

140
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,511
-Where are you going?
-To find a way out of here.

141
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,098
Using fractal algorithms
with the Borg sensors,

142
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,685
I believe I can predict where and when
these funnels will occur.

143
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,855
Well, that's impressive,
but how does it help us?

144
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,775
The funnels originate
inside the anomaly,

145
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:30,111
creating massive graviton forces
before they erupt.

146
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,156
If we were to enter one of the funnels
just as that happened,

147
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,284
we might be able to use those forces
to propel us into normal space.

148
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,120
Not without compromising
structural integrity.

149
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,748
I might be able to reinforce
the shields to compensate.

150
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,958
There's another problem.

151
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,628
When the graviton forces
reach critical levels,

152
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,798
the polarity suddenly reverses,
pulling everything near the funnel

153
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,216
back into the anomaly.

154
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,885
We'd have to jump to warp
at exactly the right moment.

155
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,138
We'd need to achieve
a velocity of warp 8.2.

156
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,433
Question is,
will we have enough power?

157
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,268
At the rate we're losing it,

158
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,815
we may only get one shot at this.

159
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,983
The sooner we try, the better.

160
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,991
[Seven]
There's a funnel forming

161
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:21,830
70,000 meters off the port bow,
bearing 130 mark 24.

162
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,165
[Kim]
Graviton surge in 34 seconds.

163
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,293
Full power to shields
and structural integrity.

164
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,087
Take us in, Mr. Paris.

165
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,053
Five seconds, four, three...

166
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,436
Structural integrity at 20 percent.

167
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,149
Ten percent!

168
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,404
Fifty-thousand kilometers
to normal space.

169
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,738
Prepare to go to warp.

170
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,552
[sighs]

171
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,889
[Torres]
<i>Engineering to the Bridge.</i>

172
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,098
Go ahead.

173
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,893
[Torres]
The warp core is off-line.

174
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,112
If nothing else,
we learned some things

175
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,614
that'll help us next time.

176
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,783
With all due respect, captain,
we don't even have warp drive anymore.

177
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,869
I may be able to get it back on line,

178
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,080
but we still need deuterium
to keep our basic systems running.

179
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,790
How long will our reserves last?

180
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,375
[Torres]
If we shut down life support

181
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,378
on all but a few decks,
deactivate Astrometrics, turbolifts,

182
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,007
ration replicator use,
maybe a week.

183
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,676
I used to make a living
scavenging for supplies.

184
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,428
Let me take one of the shuttles.

185
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,681
I might be able to find deuterium
on one of those abandoned ships.

186
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,308
A shuttle would be too easy a target.

187
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,561
I appreciate the offer, Neelix,
but we're safer if we stay together.

188
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,688
The shuttles may be useful
in another capacity.

189
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,317
We could use their warp cores
to augment power on Voyager.

190
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,277
We're still going to need
more deuterium.

191
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,534
Let's track down the ship that raided us
and get back what they stole.

192
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,245
We should do it quickly.

193
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,413
I've detected a number of vessels
monitoring us.

194
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,374
The vultures are circling.

195
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,876
Vultures eat the dead, Mr. Paris.

196
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,878
We're not dead yet.

197
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,303
The vessel's in visual range.

198
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,638
Shields.

199
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,266
On screen.

200
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,312
Looks like somebody got to them
before we did.

201
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,024
-No life signs.
-Scan for ion trails.

202
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,735
Whoever did this
probably has our deuterium.

203
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,445
[Tuvok]
Aye, captain.

204
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,780
Is there anything left aboard that ship
worth salvaging?

205
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,535
Their technology and supplies
have been picked clean.

206
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,079
Not everything of value has been taken.

207
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,831
The warp core has been removed,

208
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,749
but the casing that protected it
is intact.

209
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,209
It's composed of tricesium.

210
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,839
-We can convert it into a power source.
-Every little bit helps.

211
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,967
Lock onto the core casing
and beam it to the Cargo Bay.

212
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,302
With the additional power,

213
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,971
we could reactivate
the Astrometrics Lab.

214
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,931
I can think of some better uses.

215
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,308
For example?

216
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,561
Oh, I don't know,
making sure there's air to breathe.

217
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,655
[scanner beeping]

218
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,747
This must be where they cut
through the casing to remove the core.

219
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,207
Crude but effective.

220
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,963
[Torres]
Something's in there.

221
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,423
Identify yourself.

222
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,510
Torres to Security. Intruder alert.

223
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,887
[Tuvok]
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

224
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,600
[Seven]
There.

225
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,101
Stay where you are.

226
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,565
He appears to be injured.

227
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,740
[door opens]

228
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,329
How is he?

229
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,414
His injury doesn't seem serious,

230
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,625
but he won't let me close enough
to treat him.

231
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,131
My name's Captain Janeway.

232
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,216
You're safe here.

233
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,427
[doctor]
I've tried communicating with him.

234
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,679
He doesn't appear to have
any verbal skills.

235
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,473
Do we know how he got on board?

236
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,267
I believe he was transported
along with the core casing.

237
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,936
We should have picked up
his life signs.

238
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,605
We're trying to determine
why we didn't detect him.

239
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,858
That vessel he was on
had no atmosphere.

240
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,276
How did he survive?

241
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,278
My scans show
he can conserve oxygen.

242
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,741
He has unusually large lung capacity
and a voracious appetite.

243
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,618
Do you think that ship was his home?

244
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,246
Maybe, but we can't send him back.

245
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,748
He can't survive
without oxygen indefinitely.

246
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,502
We'll run scans
for other members of his species,

247
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,462
but until we can find
a safe place for him,

248
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,756
let's make him
as comfortable as possible.

249
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,303
Computer, replicate a portion
of nutritional supplements

250
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,264
from my daily allotment.

251
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,650
You've found something?

252
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,403
We think we know
who has our deuterium.

253
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,531
It's someone we've already met.

254
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,536
<i>I knew I'd see you again, captain.</i>

255
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,831
<i>I expect you've reconsidered</i>
<i>my proposal.</i>

256
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,666
We're not here to trade.

257
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,960
We're here to take back
what belongs to us.

258
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,421
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

259
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,756
Our scans indicate
you've got some of our food,

260
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,302
one of our consoles,
and a large quantity of our deuterium.

261
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,304
<i>We didn't take any of that from you.</i>

262
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,891
No, apparently you killed
the crew of another ship

263
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,267
and took it from them.

264
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,768
We want it back.

265
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,313
<i>That's not the way things work here.</i>

266
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,816
Either you give it back, or we'll take it.

267
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,903
[computer beeping]

268
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,698
-He's powering his engines.
-Target his shields and fire.

269
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,413
Lock onto whatever belongs to us
and transport it to the Cargo Bay.

270
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,834
I'm detecting large quantities of food
on his supply deck.

271
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,794
Maybe we should take it
while we have the chance.

272
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,087
Is it ours?

273
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,423
No, but our own reserves
are running out.

274
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,009
Valen wouldn't hesitate
to take it from us.

275
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,221
No, he wouldn't.

276
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,849
We've got what's ours. Reverse course.

277
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,778
[door chimes]

278
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,988
Come in.

279
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,369
An updated inventory of our supplies.

280
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,913
We got back less than half
of what was stolen.

281
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,668
Doesn't take two of you
to deliver a padd.

282
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,794
What's on your mind?

283
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,549
We want to be clear
about what our policy's going to be

284
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,800
while we're here in the Void.

285
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,011
You think we should
have taken Valen's food.

286
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,598
Logic suggests
we may have to be more opportunistic

287
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,308
if we intend to survive.

288
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,435
We may not like Valen's tactics,

289
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,272
but he and his crew are still alive
after five years in here.

290
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,732
I was thinking about that myself.

291
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,403
I thought maybe
I could get some guidance

292
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,446
from the Federation Charter.

293
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,285
I was hoping I'd find a loophole
that would allow us to...

294
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,413
take actions we ordinarily wouldn't take.

295
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,206
Any luck?

296
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,460
The Charter's a statement of principles,
not a practical document.

297
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,381
-No section on how to exist in a void.
-No.

298
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,843
But I've become convinced

299
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,636
that we've got to stick
to our principles,

300
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,013
not abandon them.

301
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,515
Should the crew be ready to die
for those principles?

302
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,975
If the alternative means

303
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,562
becoming thieves
and killers ourselves, yes.

304
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,024
But I'm betting that our principles
are going to keep us alive.

305
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,650
Captain?

306
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,903
The Federation is based
on mutual cooperation,

307
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,825
the idea that the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts.

308
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,286
Voyager can't survive here alone,

309
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,081
but if we form a temporary alliance
with other ships,

310
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,584
maybe we can pool
our resources and escape.

311
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,794
As you've pointed out,

312
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,671
the people we've encountered
in this void

313
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,590
are thieves and killers.

314
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,967
Such individuals
are hardly ideal allies.

315
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,719
I agree.

316
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,722
Then who are we going to form
an alliance with?

317
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,309
Anyone who agrees
to play by our rules:

318
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,647
no killing, no stealing,
and no giving up.

319
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,440
Forgive me, captain,

320
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,233
but why would anyone
who has survived

321
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,403
by killing and stealing
suddenly agree to those terms?

322
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,908
We'll offer to share
our food and medical supplies

323
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,203
and defend ships
that are attacked by raiders.

324
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,248
Captain, maybe you'd better take
another look at that inventory.

325
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,835
Our food and power reserves
will be gone within a week.

326
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,337
If we start giving everything away--

327
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,215
Then maybe we'll only survive
for two days instead of seven.

328
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,176
On the other hand,
if we share what we have,

329
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,636
instead of hoarding it,

330
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,972
we might find other people
willing to do the same.

331
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,724
If we combine our technology,

332
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,727
we can find ways
of improving our situation

333
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,605
and ultimately
get the hell out of this place.

334
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,276
We may lose a little weight, gentlemen,

335
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,904
but we won't lose who we are.

336
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:06,747
[Janeway]
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 54553.4.</i>

337
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,458
<i>For the past several days,</i>
<i>we've been making every effort</i>

338
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,627
<i>to recruit members into an alliance,</i>

339
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,337
<i>but it hasn't been easy.</i>

340
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,173
Whenever a new ship
gets pulled into the Void,

341
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,384
they're immediately attacked.

342
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,552
Instead of attacking it,

343
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,096
you'd have to help
defend the new ship.

344
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,890
And how is that in my interest?

345
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,560
It would encourage them
to join our alliance.

346
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,355
And if they refuse, then we raid them?

347
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:35,192
Everyone in the alliance must agree
not to launch unprovoked attacks.

348
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,737
Then how are we supposed
to get supplies?

349
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,032
The idea is to recruit new members,
share technology and resources.

350
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,535
We almost escaped the Void
on our own.

351
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,788
If we work together,
I believe we'll succeed.

352
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,167
How many ships do you have
in this alliance?

353
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,127
You'd be the first.

354
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,756
Technically, captain,
that's not correct.

355
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,343
I consider myself the first member
of the captain's coalition.

356
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,305
Six years ago,
I offered her my services

357
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,515
and the resources of my ship,

358
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,809
and she has never failed to help me
when I needed her.

359
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,813
It's a noble idea, captain,

360
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,650
but good intentions
are like deuterium reserves,

361
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,068
they tend to get lost in the Void.

362
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,238
All I ask is that you consider
our proposal.

363
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,616
I will.

364
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,910
[Janeway]
In the meantime,

365
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,662
we'd like to offer you
food and medical supplies.

366
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,540
What do you expect in return?

367
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,170
Nothing.
Compliments of the alliance.

368
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,304
I tried.

369
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,770
Captain, there's been a theft.

370
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,939
-What's missing?
-My phase compensator.

371
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,608
No doubt, it was stolen
by one of your prospective members.

372
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,069
It wasn't stolen.
I gave it to the Nygeans.

373
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,196
They needed it
to repair their sensor array.

374
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,449
I presume you obtained something
equally valuable in return.

375
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,828
I think I did.
The goodwill of a potential ally.

376
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,163
-Did they join?
-Not yet.

377
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,998
-Captain...
-I know.

378
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,836
It's not exactly
the most "efficient" policy.

379
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,214
But, then, you don't always do
what's most efficient either.

380
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,841
I don't know what you're implying.

381
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,844
You gave up your rations
to our guest in Sick Bay.

382
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,428
He needed food.

383
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,722
You're a valuable member of this crew.

384
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,684
Your friend in Sick Bay
is nothing but a drain on resources.

385
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,520
What's efficient
about wasting food on him?

386
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,984
You think I'm being inefficient,
Tuvok thinks I'm being illogical.

387
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,944
You both could be right.

388
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,989
But maybe the best way to get help
is to give it.

389
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,117
-Oh, and, Seven?
-Yes?

390
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,579
I'm sorry I gave away your favourite
phase compensator.

391
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,164
[sighs]

392
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,627
[aria from <i>Rigoletto</i> playing]

393
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,892
[door opens]

394
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,270
-How is he?
-Much better.

395
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,481
He seemed to relax when he heard me
humming an aria from <i>Rigoletto,</i>

396
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,359
so I had the computer play
the full orchestral version.

397
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,987
Fantome seems to be a music lover.

398
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,280
"Fantome"?

399
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,032
After <i>The Phantom of the Opera,</i>

400
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,951
a tormented character
who is soothed by music.

401
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,495
In six years,
you haven't chosen a name for yourself,

402
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,248
but you've given Fantome one
in a few days.

403
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,667
Choosing the right name for myself
is extremely difficult.

404
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,377
I'm a complex individual.

405
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,297
-And Fantome isn't?
-On the contrary.

406
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,924
I believe he's quite intelligent,

407
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,009
and his physiology's very sophisticated.

408
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,303
Did you know
he has the ability to refract

409
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,055
his own life signs?

410
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,307
That would explain
why our sensors didn't detect him.

411
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,352
[chuckles]

412
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,938
I wish we could find a way
to communicate with him.

413
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,148
I suspect he'd have a lot to tell us.

414
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,151
[aria continues]

415
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,236
[music stops]

416
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,572
-We were enjoying that.
-Exactly.

417
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,659
He may not be able to speak,
but he can hear.

418
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,581
[high-pitched tone beeping]

[high-pitched tone beeping]

421

He understands.

[low-pitched tone beeping]

423
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,983
So it would seem.

424
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,280
[lower-pitched tone beeping]

425
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,575
What's the occasion?

426
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,705
Oh, Seven's not the only one
who knows how to set an elegant table.

427
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,000
You have heard
there is a food shortage.

428
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,629
That's no reason why you two
can't enjoy a romantic dinner.

429
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,134
Unfortunately, I can't light this.

430
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,845
It would be a waste of oxygen.

431
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,512
Still, it is festive.

432
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,432
We appreciate the effort.

433
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,061
I believe there's been a mistake
here, waiter.

434
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,146
I didn't order this.

435
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,483
Close your eyes and pretend
that it's Seven's fetran risotto.

436
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:29,820
[clears throat]

437
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,494
It tastes more like chicken.

438
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,710
-What's this?
-A preserved Olian guava.

439
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,919
I had a few left.

440
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,881
-Neelix...
-No arguments.

441
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,424
You're eating for two.

00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,262
Sorry, Neelix.

445
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,265
Charge weapons. Shields to full.

446
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,601
-What's going on?
-A funnel just opened.

447
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,769
It pulled in a new vessel.

448
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,272
Two warships are approaching it.
One of them is Valen's.

449
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,153
Target Valen's weapons and hail him.

450

454
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,542
<i>-We can share it.</i>
-I'm not here to divide the spoils.

455
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,545
<i>Then why are you here?</i>

456
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,381
To protect the ship you're firing on.

00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,383
<i>What are they to you?</i>

458
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:37,137
Just some people in a bad situation,
like the rest of us.

00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:41,266
<i>Save your speeches.</i>
<i>I've got a crew to feed.</i>

460
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,269
He's targeting our shields.

461
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,480
Take his weapons out.
Hail the new ship.

462
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,941

[Janeway]
We're here to help you.

465
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,153
Can you target the smaller warship?

466
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,240
<i>We're a survey vessel.</i>
<i>We're not equipped to fight.</i>

467
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,034
Shields at 60 percent.

468
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,870
Fire torpedoes.

469
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,420
Shields on Valen's lead ship
are holding at 80 percent.

470
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,673
It appears he's upgraded them
since we last met.

-Ours?
-Thirty.

472
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,266
The smaller ship
is outmaneuvering us.

473
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,103
We have hull breaches
on Decks 5 and 6.

474
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,020
Seal them.

475
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,023

we'll be dead in the water

in less than three minutes.

482
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,204
We should retreat, captain.

483
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,041
-Not yet.
-We might want to reconsider.

484
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,626
There's another ship approaching.

485
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,795
We can't defend ourselves
against three ships.

[Tuvok]
We may not have to.

487

The third vessel belongs to Mr. Garon.

488
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,176
He's firing at the other two.

489
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,643
Valen's shields are down.
The smaller ship is leaking plasma.

00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,065
Get a weapons lock on him.

493

We've been fooled

<i>Why are you targeting me?</i>

00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,027
but it's taken me this long
to coax him out of Sick Bay.

521
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,570
He's quite shy.

522
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,655
[electronic tones beeps]

523
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,865
I'm telling him not to worry

524
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:47,327
that you're the one
who keeps us all safe.

525
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,870
[electronic tones beeps]

526
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,414
He says, "Thank you."

527
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,541
An ingenious method
of communication.

528
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,376
It began with a few simple words,

529
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,628
but now we're capable
of rudimentary conversation.

530
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,338
Tell him I'm pleased
he's feeling better.

531
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,423
I will.

532
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,674
[electronic tones beep]

533
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,342
[electronic tones beep]

534
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,513
[electronic tones continue beeping]

535
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,521
[chuckles]

536
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,735
What's that parasite
doing aboard your ship?

537
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,366
-I beg your pardon?
-They're vermin.

538
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:30,746
I don't know who you are, sir,
but your choice of words is offensive.

539
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,666
What is offensive is the way
they slip aboard during transport,

540
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,253
hide in conduits,
steal food, spread disease.

541
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,131
Fantome is perfectly healthy,

542
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,801
and unlike some people in this void,
he hasn't stolen anything.

543
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:48,430
If my sensors could detect
where they are on my ship,

544
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,265
I'd exterminate them.

545
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,017
I suggest you do the same.

546
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,227
-Captain, this is outrageous!
-Doctor!

547
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:04,446
One of the principles of our alliance
is that we don't discriminate.

548
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,700
Everyone's welcome,
as long as they follow the rules.

549
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,578
But if you're having a bad experience

550
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,289
with the members of this species
on your ship,

551
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,793
I'd be happy to bring them to Voyager.

552
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,878
If you could find them.

553
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,216
Now that we've had a chance to analyze
Fantome's physiology,

554
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,885
I think we can get
a transporter lock on them.

555
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:31,556
Is this your way of enticing me
to join your alliance?

556
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,517
I'm simply trying to demonstrate

557
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,104
how cooperation and tolerance
can benefit everyone.

558
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,941
Then we have an agreement.

559
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,117
Okay, now connect
the primary emitter relay.

560
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,995
On line.

561
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,623
-How is it coming?
-Pretty well.

562
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,125
We just need to...

563
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,461
I guess I was being
a little optimistic.

564
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,171
What's the problem, exactly?

565
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,298
Uh, we think we can establish
a shield bubble

566
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,925
large enough
to encompass all our ships,

567
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,428
but we have no way to compensate
for the graviton stress.

568
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,847
Wouldn't a polaron modulator
be able to do that?

569
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,099
Unfortunately,
nobody in the alliance has one.

570
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,601
We've been trying to build our own,
but so far...

571
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,230
Maybe we could trade for one,
or find a new ally who has one.

572
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,731
[Garon]
<i>Well, it's not a common piece</i>

573
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,483
<i>of technology, and it's valuable.</i>

574
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,819
<i>It may be difficult to convince anyone</i>
<i>to part with it.</i>

575
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,987
[Janeway]
<i>You never know unless you ask...</i>

576
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,197
You are not authorized to be in here.

577
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,325
We're making a valuable contribution
to the alliance.

578
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,869
By spying on restricted meetings?

579
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,789
We've devised
a new surveillance technique.

580
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,916
[Janeway]
<i>Ask Harry to give you a...</i>

581
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,085
You've bypassed my security measures.

582
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,088
We can observe activity
on any ship in the Void

583
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,174
without being detected.

584
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,927
This is the cargo hold
on the Jelinian freighter.

585
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,637
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

586
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,015
the Jelinians
are a member of our alliance.

587
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,641
[Tuvok]
Which is why you shouldn't be

588
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,101
spying on them.

589
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,396
And why they
shouldn't be hoarding their ale.

590
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,609
[electronic tones beeping]

591
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,778
[musical tones begin]

592
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,867
[various musical tones sounding]

593
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,338
[musical tones continue playing]

594
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,106
Lovely piece.

595
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,193
-Did they compose it, or did you?
-They did.

596
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,237
Though strictly speaking,
it's not a composition.

597
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,907
-It's more of a conversation.
-I'm impressed.

598
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,242
I wish I could take credit,

599
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,118
but it was Fantome
who taught the others

600
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,162
in a fraction of the time
it took him to learn.

601
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,039
They're a highly intelligent species.

602
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,793
The language is already developing
its own grammar and syntax.

603
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,087
That suggests they have
a language of their own.

604
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,004
[doctor]
Mm-hmm.

605
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,130
It could be telepathic,

606
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,842
but they seem just as comfortable
communicating with music now.

607
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,638
Could their species
be native to the Void?

608
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,766
It's certainly possible.
They told us they were born here.

609
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,978
Just when you think
nothing in the galaxy

610
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,480
can surprise you anymore...

611
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:26,815
[Torres over radio]
<i>Captain Janeway,</i>

612
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,567
<i>please report to Engineering.</i>

613
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:38,660
Just what we needed, captain,
a fully compatible polaron modulator.

614
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,621
-Where did you get it?
-A Kinjal frigate.

615
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:46,042
-Do they want to join our alliance?
-They're not interested.

616
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,631
-How did you get this?
-I traded for it.

617
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,008
What did you give them?

618
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,220
I don't answer to you.

619
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,348
Did you steal it?

620
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,689
Disconnect the modulator.

621
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,316
[Torres]
Captain...?

622
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,650
We're returning it
to the people it belongs to.

623
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,570
They have no more use for it.

624
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,822
You don't know that.

625
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:20,076
Yes, I do.

626
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,705
-You killed them.
-Captain.

627
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,124
I don't like his tactics
any more than you do,

628
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,502
but why waste this technology
when we're so close to escaping?

629
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,881
Because it's a violation
of everything this alliance stands for.

630
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,634
Refusing the modulator
won't bring back the people he killed.

631
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:39,387
No, but using it would make us
accessories to murder.

632
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,724
Take it and get out.

633
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,730
[modulator powers down]

634
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,715
The Jelinians and the Kraylor
have left with Bosaal.

635
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,802
-They felt you were being--
-Impulsive and self-righteous?

636
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,263
-Is that what you think?
-You did what you had to do.

637
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,141
-Still, I made a mistake.
-By telling Bosaal to leave?

638
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,143
Allowing him to join in the first place.

639
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,645
You couldn't have known
what he was going to do.

640
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,272
Oh, I had a pretty good idea
what kind of person he was.

641
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,109
That bigoted reaction he had
to the doctor's friend

642
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,446
told me all I needed to know,
but I ignored my instincts.

643
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,531
Why?

644
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,866
Because I thought his ship
could help us escape.

645
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,411
You weren't the only one
who wanted him in the alliance.

646
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:48,373
Maybe not, but if I'd listened
to my doubts in the first place,

647
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,667
we wouldn't have lost
the other two ships.

648
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,377
We'll find a way out of here
without them.

649
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,254
Where do we stand with the modulator?

650
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,588
B'Elanna and the other engineers

651
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,174
are working around
the clock to build one.

652
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,136
She thinks they'll be ready to test
in a couple of days.

653
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,180
So everyone's pulling together
to make up for my mistake?

654
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,642
They have to.
It says so in the Federation Charter.

655
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,643
[door opens]

656
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,856
-Good news, I hope.
-I'm afraid not.

657
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,274
It appears Commander Bosaal

658
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,359
is attempting to form an alliance
of his own

659
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,319
with one of our adversaries.

660
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:22,282
We recorded a tactical conversation
that took place between them

661
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,159
just a few minutes ago.

662
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,910
[Valen]
<i>Don't underestimate Janeway.</i>

663
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,121
<i>I've been in battle with her twice.</i>

664
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,832
<i>Then you know Janeway's tactics.</i>

665
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,584
<i>I have two other ships.</i>

666
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:37,672
<i>We can take Voyager's food</i>
<i>and weapons if we work together.</i>

667
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,924
The rest of their conversation suggests

668
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,302
they will attack within the next 48 hours.

669
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,638
I'm so glad we taught them
the value of cooperation.

670
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,099
Our power reserves
will be severely depleted

671
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,768
if we're forced to defend ourselves.

672
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:50,894
[sighs]

673
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,688
Tell B'Elanna we don't have time
to test her modulator.

674
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,940
We've got to try to escape now.

675
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,276
[musical tones playing]

676
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:05,074
Sorry to interrupt,
but we've got a situation developing.

677
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,075
[musical tones stop]

678
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,495
We're going to try
to break free of the anomaly.

679
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,996
Your friends are welcome to join us,

680
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,165
but they should be aware
of the dangers.

681
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:16,211
[musical tones beeping]

682
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,339
The Void's their home.
They want to stay.

683
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,090
Where would they like us
to transport them?

684
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,759
They're nomads. Any ship will do.

685
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,636
[musical tones beeping]

686
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,348
They say they're grateful for our help.

687
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,435
They want to help us now.

688
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,940
[tones continue beeping]

689
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:45,490
[dramatic, suspenseful music
playing over montage]

690
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,507
[console beeping]

691
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,009
[indistinct conversation]

692
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:46,926
[console beeps]

693
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,220
There's a funnel forming in Grid IV.

694
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,431
Graviton surge in 98 seconds.

695
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,141
Alert the other ships.

696
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,562
-Take us in, Tom.
-Aye, captain.

697
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:01,774
Bosaal and his fleet are approaching.
They are charging weapons.

698
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,943
Janeway to Engineering. Status.

699
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,778
[Torres over radio]
<i>I need two more minutes.</i>

700
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,280
You've got one.

701
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,289
[Kim]
Surge in 50 seconds!

702
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,583
Voyager to all alliance ships.

703
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,127
Begin firing at your designated targets.

704
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,721
We've penetrated shields
on both vessels.

705
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,849
Janeway to the doctor.
Initiate transport.

706
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,142
Acknowledged.

707
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,186
[musical tone beeps]

708
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,313
Yes. Goodbye and good luck.

709
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,524
Energize.

710
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,115
Transport complete, captain.

711
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,117
They're in the engine rooms
of both ships.

712
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,243
Acknowledged.

713
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,120
30 seconds.

714
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,207
Janeway to Engineering.
We need that modulator.

715
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,125
[Torres over radio]
<i>Just a few more seconds.</i>

716
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,928
We're receiving a hail
from Valen's ship, audio only.

717
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:12,845
Let's hear it.

718
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,889
[musical tones playing]

719
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:16,933
What's he saying, doctor?

720
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,434
[musical tones playing]

721
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,644
Mission accomplished.

722
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,355
Fantome shut down power
on Valen's ship.

723
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,481
Confirmed.

724
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,400
Bosaal's ship has lost power, as well.

725
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,403
Who says gremlins in the engine
are a myth.

726
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,822
Surge in five seconds, four...

727
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,115
Now, B'Elanna.

728
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,833
All ships are in formation.

729
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,253
Structural integrity at 30 percent.

730
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,881
Forty thousand meters
to normal space.

731
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,427
Twenty percent.

732
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,804
Ten percent.

733
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,516
Do it, Tom.

734
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,405
Gentlemen, it's been a privilege
to have you as allies.

735
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,824
I never believed we'd escape.

736
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,784
Then why did you join?

737
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,038
Captain Janeway is very persuasive,

738
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,873
-and the food was good.
-[chuckles]

739
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,750
You're welcome to have
a meal with us anytime.

740
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,711
Ah, unfortunately,
we're headed in the opposite direction.

741
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,546
Safe journey to you
and your crew, captain.

742
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,340
-And to all of yours, as well.
-Thank you.

743
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,984
It was almost like being part
of the Federation again.

744
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,779
The real one's only
30,000 light-years away.

745
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,031
Then what are we standing around for?
