1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,505
WOMAN:
Jeffrey... Belle...

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,298
We're going to be late
if you don't hurry.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,927
Come on, now.

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,428
Line up next to the door,
children.

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,430
Your father's ready
to leave for work.

6
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,350
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,351
All right.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,227
Show me your fingernails.

9
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,479
Very nicely done.

10
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,564
Are your shoes polished?

11
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,691
Perfect.

12
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,233
I'm very pleased, children

13
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,277
and I'm sure
your father will be, too.

14
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,904
I want to be first
to say good-bye to Daddy.

15
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,364
Jeffrey always goes first.

16
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,032
You were
first yesterday.

17
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,243
Now, children, little birds
in their nest get along.

18
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,578
You're right,
mother.

19
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,497
I'm sorry, Belle.
You can go first.

20
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,748
No, it's really your turn.

21
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,000
I did go first yesterday.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,083
(<i> door closes</i> )

23
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,961
Here he comes!
All right, now.

24
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,548
Bright, happy faces.

25
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,383
The coffee was quite good
this morning.

26
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,926
I'm so glad you like it.

27
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,722
I replicated a new blend
from Paksor Three.

28
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,264
I'll be home
at the usual time.

29
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,933
Now don't let them
over work you.

30
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,227
You should save yourself
for the important things.

31
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,896
Others can do
the busy work.

32
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,104
I couldn't agree more.

33
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,065
I hope you have a good day,
father.

34
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,359
I'll have my homework finished
by the time you get back.

35
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,236
I'll look forward
to reviewing it, Jeffrey.

36
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,487
And is my little angel going

37
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,113
to get an "A" on
her history exam today?

38
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,615
Of course I will, daddy.
And can we do

39
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,325
some algebra problems
when you get home?

40
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,577
Gladly.

41
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,370
And don't forget--
your going to ask

42
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,748
some of your friends from work
to have dinner with us.

43
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:21,957
I'd like to meet them.

44
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,208
I haven't forgotten.

45
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,962
Well...

46
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,171
Good-bye, all.

47
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,799
Good-bye, Daddy.

48
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,428
How's the new
holo-family, doctor?

49
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,221
They're everything
I could've hoped for.

50
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,049
<i>Captain's log, stardate</i>
<i>50836.2.</i>

51
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>We've had</i>
<i>long-range communications</i>

52
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,221
<i>with a seemingly friendly race</i>
<i>known as the Vostigye.</i>

53
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,182
<i>We'll be rendezvousing</i>
<i>within the hour</i>

54
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,184
<i>at one of their space stations.</i>

55
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,769
Ensign Kim, perhaps you could
direct your attention

56
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,521
to the sensors
and tell us if we're nearing

57
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,357
the Vostigye
space station.

58
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,153
We should be getting close.

59
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,404
That's funny.

60
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,780
I'm not detecting it.

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,657
You've checked
the coordinates they sent us?

62
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,535
Yes, and... hold on.

63
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,080
Now I'm
getting something.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,541
It's... debris.

65
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,751
Debris?

66
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,836
TUVOK:
Confirmed.
I am reading

67
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,090
a debris field encompassing
nearly 80 cubic kilometers.

68
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,799
What's the composition
of the debris?

69
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,220
Boronite, sarium,
carbon 60 composites.

70
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,263
Sounds like it could've
been a space station.

71
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,514
On screen.

72
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,479
What happened to it?

73
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,234
Something ripped it apart, and
from the energy decay readings,

74
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,693
I'd say it was no more
than an hour ago.

75
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,361
I'm not picking up any life
signs, captain.

76
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,988
There don't
appear to be any survivors.

77
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:44,243
There were 60 Vostigye
scientists on that station.

78
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,536
I don't read any recognizable
weapons signatures.

79
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,872
Maybe somebody in this part
of space has weapons

80
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,540
that don't leave
a traditional signature.

81
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,959
I'd like to know who they are

82
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,003
and why they'd annihilate
a science station.

83
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,298
Maybe we can find out, captain.
There's a strange pattern

84
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,009
that seems to be emanating
from subspace.

85
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,928
Looks like some kind
of plasma particles.

86
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,387
I've got it, too.

87
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,973
It's like a...

88
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,516
a wake leading away
from the debris field.

89
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,477
From a ship?

90
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,229
I can't tell.

91
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,688
Set a course
to follow it, Tom.

92
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,191
Yes, Ma'am.

93
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,486
Optical processors,
imaging array--

94
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,488
they all check out, doctor.
You are in perfect health.

95
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,031
I'm sure I could've
told you that.

96
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,407
Yes, I'm sure you could have.

97
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,285
But, with all the tinkering
you've been doing

98
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,410
with your program lately

99
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,745
I'd feel better giving
you these

100
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,538
little tune-ups
on a regular basis.

101
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,624
The tinkering you speak
of has been for the sole purpose

102
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,793
of improving my performance
as a physician.

103
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,253
I can hardly be
faulted for that.

104
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,255
I'm not faulting you for
your intentions, doctor.

105
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,756
I think it's rather commendable

106
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,258
that you want
to improve yourself.

107
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,468
That's why I've
created a family.

108
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,636
A family?

109
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,013
I've listened
to enough patients

110
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,514
talk about their
families to realize

111
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,017
how meaningful they are
to biological beings.

112
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,102
For better or worse, yes.

113
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,313
The doctor has created
a holographic wife and two

114
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,982
children, so he can experience
family life for himself.

115
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,859
Interesting.

116
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,610
And how's it going so far?

117
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,321
Splendidly.
From what I heard

118
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,571
I thought it
would be difficult

119
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,573
but I'm enjoying
the experience.

120
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,285
You are?

121
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,620
Funny. I never thought
of you as a family man, Doc.

122
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,080
I'd like to meet them.

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,542
As a matter of fact,
the "little woman" has been

124
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,545
asking me to bring some of
my colleagues home for dinner.

125
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,755
Perhaps you and Kes would
care to join us tonight?

126
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,674
Charlene is
a wonderful cook.

127
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,426
I'd like to meet them, too.

128
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,597
Well, Doc, tell your wife
to haul out the good china.

129
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,724
You're having company.

130
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,479
Ah.

131
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,025
Please, have some more
wild mushroom pilaf, B'elanna.

132
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,527
Uh, thanks. I've had
two helpings already.

133
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,905
It's delicious.

134
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,157
I took a course
in continental cuisine

135
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,119
so I could replicate interesting
meals for Kenneth.

136
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,787
Kenneth?

137
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,830
My husband.

138
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,374
What do you call him?

139
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,376
Oh, we call him Doctor.

140
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,253
Oh, of course.

141
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,296
Anyway, he works terribly hard

142
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,882
and he's under
such great stress.

143
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,177
I want this home
to be his sanctuary the place

144
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,056
he can come and have all
the cares of the day disappear.

145
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,640
How nice for him.

146
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,475
My daddy is
a very important man.

147
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,311
He's the best doctor
there ever was

148
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,313
and he saves people's lives
all the time.

149
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,981
A slight exaggeration.

150
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,400
It is not! You said...

151
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,776
Belle, eat
your dinner.

152
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,736
They're well aware
of my talents.

153
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,821
Jeffrey, why don't
you tell our guests

154
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,531
about your new project
at school.

155
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,075
I've designed
a micro-filter input

156
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,451
which will make it possible

157
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,536
to cleanse blood
of harmful microorganisms

158
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,872
too small to stimulate
an immune response.

159
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,582
Jeffrey is extremely bright.

160
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,960
He's in the accelerated physical
sciences program at school.

161
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,880
A regular chip off
the old block, right?

162
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,049
And don't forget
about our little belle.

163
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,261
She's already studying
algebra and trigonometry,

164
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,388
and she's quite
the budding athlete.

165
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,514
You must be very proud
of your family, doctor.

166
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,933
Oh.

167
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,893
Well, we're proud of him, too.

168
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,814
In fact, we think we have
just about the most wonderful

169
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,150
husband and father
in the quadrant, don't we?

170
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,818
Computer, freeze program.

171
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,820
KIDS:
Yes, we do--

172
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,488
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

173
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,659
I am stopping this before
my blood sugar levels overload.

174
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,869
Doctor...
Yes?

175
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,204
If you think this is giving you

176
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,539
an accurate impression
of being in a family

177
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,292
you are sadly mistaken.

178
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,918
I don't understand.

179
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,961
They're kind of perfect.

180
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,712
They are ridiculously perfect.

181
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,465
No one has
a family like this.

182
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,715
This is a fantasy.

183
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,092
You're not going
to learn anything

184
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,512
from being with these...
lollipops.

185
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,431
I provided the computer
with my requirements

186
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,849
for a mate and children.

187
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,100
If I were to
choose a real wife

188
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,643
my taste would
be the same--

189
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,728
Intelligence, education,
organizational skills...

190
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,939
There is nothing wrong
with your premise, doctor.

191
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,358
It just needs
a little tweaking

192
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,068
to bring it
closer to real life.

193
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:54,201
I can help...
if you'd like.

194
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,791
Captain, the particle wake
we've been following

195
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,668
is beginning to thin out.

196
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,379
Is there any indication
what caused it?

197
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,797
I am detecting no ships,
no structures

198
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,341
no weapons signatures.

199
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,551
Wait a minute.
Something.

200
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,927
I see it, too.

201
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,721
A subspace disruption.

202
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,306
What's causing it?

203
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,851
Can't tell, but it's
getting more intense.

204
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,102
Shields up. Red alert.

205
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,274
Tom, back us off.

206
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,485
Something's coming out
of subspace.

207
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,705
JANEWAY:
Tom, move us away!

208
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,998
I don't have engines!

209
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,417
Propulsion is off line.

210
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,168
So is navigational control.

211
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,212
Bridge to Engineering--
we need power.

212
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,963
B'ELANNA:
<i>I'm on it, Captain.</i>

213
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,507
The anomaly
is bearing down on us,

214
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,842
heading 0-4-7, mark 1-9.

215
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,135
Brace for impact.

216
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,725
KIM:
It hit our
starboard shields!

217
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,185
There's damage on deck three.

218
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,396
Ready weapons.
We're going to disperse it.

219
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,355
Phasers on line...

220
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,232
CHAKOTAY:
Wait a minute.

221
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,994
I'm not afraid to say it.

222
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,038
I've never seen anything
like that before.

223
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,582
Damage report.

224
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,334
TUVOK:
20% loss of
the starboard dorsal shields

225
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,462
and minor buckling
of the hull on deck three.

226
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,046
No indication of casualties.

227
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,132
PARIS:
We've got propulsion
systems back online

228
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,800
I think I can put some distance
between us

229
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,385
and whatever that was.

230
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,637
Maybe we don't want to.

231
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,264
We've just witnessed
a phenomenon

232
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,807
none of us
has ever heard of before

233
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,392
much less experienced.

234
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,185
On a purely scientific level

235
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,520
I think we owe it
to ourselves

236
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,314
to investigate.

237
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,441
I'm looking at the telemetry
we collected.

238
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,734
It was an astral eddy
that seems to have formed

239
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,694
at the confluence
of space and subspace.

240
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,489
KIM:
It was highly charged
with plasma.

241
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,449
That explains the particle wake.

242
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,992
If we could harness
some of that energy

243
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,077
we could go off replicator
rations for a while.

244
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,955
Captain, we don't have any idea
what caused that phenomenon

245
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,332
or what made it dissipate.

246
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,167
So how do we investigate it
if it's gone?

247
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,377
I suspect there are conditions
in this part of space

248
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,464
that lend themselves to
the formation of those eddies.

249
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,259
Set sensors for continuous
scans of subspace.

250
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,928
Maybe we can anticipate
the next one.

251
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,271
DOCTOR:
I thought for a long time about
what Lieutenant Torres said

252
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,524
and I finally concluded
she was right.

253
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,442
If I'm going to have
the experience of a family

254
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,110
it should be as
authentic as possible.

255
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,237
What changes have you asked
her to make in the program?

256
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,780
Oh, she's already made them.

257
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,033
She simply added some randomized
behavioral algorithms

258
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,784
to the program
I constructed.

259
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,578
How will that
affect your family?

260
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,996
Events will simply unfold

261
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,665
as a natural evolution
of probabilities

262
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,124
within the program.

263
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,084
But there's no way to
predict what those might be.

264
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,670
That could mean
a few surprises.

265
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,380
Are you sure you're
ready for this?

266
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,340
My database contains
everything there is to know

267
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,259
about pediatric care
and childhood development.

268
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,595
I can't imagine a parenting
problem I couldn't handle.

269
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,764
Your wife
will have changed, too.

270
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:08,436
Well, I have had some experience
with romantic relationships.

271
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,980
I don't anticipate
any problems there.

272
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,691
Sounds like you have
it all worked out.

273
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,817
When do you plan on meeting
this new, improved family?

274
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,819
Right now.
I'm due home for dinner.

275
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,822
Computer, initiate Doctor's
family program beta-rho

276
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,200
and transfer the E.M.H.
to holodeck two.

277
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,581
Hello! I'm...

278
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,293
Home.

279
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,545
CHARLENE:
There you are.

280
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,296
I thought
you'd never get here.

281
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,797
It was a busy day.

282
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,634
I was quite challenged
by the task of preparing

283
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,597
a DNA probe to test ensign
parson's glial cells.

284
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,640
It seems he has
a microbial infection.

285
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,765
Rather unusual.

286
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,059
Tell me about it
when I get home.

287
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,060
I'm late already.

288
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,562
Late?

289
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,896
It's Wednesday,
remember?

290
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,148
I'm speaking
at the Bolian embassy.

291
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,316
Ah, right.

292
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,526
Is dinner ready?

293
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,985
It's your night
to cook.

294
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,155
BELLE:
Mom, I can't find
my ion mallet!

295
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,450
If you cleaned your room,
you'd have better luck!

296
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,410
(<i> pounding, shrieking</i>
<i>music playing</i> )

297
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,869
What is that noise?

298
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,622
I've had to listen
to it all day.

299
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,625
Maybe you can do
something about it.

300
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,334
Daddy!
You've got to help me!

301
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,753
I'll be late for practice.

302
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,630
Coach Morgan will be furious
if I'm late again.

303
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,423
If you put your mallet
in your closet

304
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,383
when you were done with
it you'd know where it was.

305
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,510
I know that, Daddy!

306
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,262
Ugh! Tell Jeffrey
to turn that off!

307
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,347
It makes my eyes hurt!
Mine, too.

308
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,348
Jeffrey!

309
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,643
Jeffrey!

310
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,894
What?

311
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,105
What is that music?
Klingon.

312
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,483
Well, turn it down! You can't do
your homework with that noise.

313
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,025
BELLE:
Daddy, I can't find my mallet!

314
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,486
I know that, Belle.

315
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,279
The coach will send me
down to the second team!

316
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,905
Well, perhaps that will
teach you a lesson.

317
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,574
You don't
understand anything!

318
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,909
Belle, you have to realize...
(<i> banging at door</i> )

319
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,165
Where's Jeffrey?

320
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,166
Who are you?

321
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,917
Friends.

322
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,503
Do you have names?

323
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,836
Larg.

324
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,798
K'kath.

325
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,840
Well, Larg, K'kath,
you'll have to come back later.

326
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,050
Jeffrey's doing his homework.

327
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,594
LARG:
He invited us!

328
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,263
BELLE:
Daddy! I need my ion mallet!

329
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,973
I...!

330
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,517
Just a minute.

331
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,352
I'm sorry, but Jeffrey
can't see friends

332
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,978
until he has finished
his homework.

333
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,023
Dad... I<i> asked</i> them to come.

334
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,400
Daddy!
Jeffrey, this is unacceptable.

335
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,194
It'll only take a minute.

336
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,821
We have some business
we have to do.

337
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:23,946
Business?

338
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,490
<i>Yighos pa'wijdaq.</i>

339
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,491
<i>Qay'be'.</i>

340
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,701
Where's my mallet?

341
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,410
I need it now!
Young man!

342
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,705
You're mean! You don't
love me as much as mommy does

343
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,122
she'd help me find
my mallet!

344
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,374
I want mommy!
I want mommy!

345
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,416
I want mommy!
I want mommy!

346
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,043
(<i> door slams</i> )

347
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,003
(<i> crying</i> )

348
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:50,390
(<i> pan contents sizzling</i> )

349
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,642
Nothing striking your fancy,
lieutenant?

350
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,018
Isn't this
the fourth day in a row

351
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,353
we've had
the same casserole?

352
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,148
Pleeka rinds and grub meal--

353
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,318
very tasty,
if I do say so myself.

354
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,195
Well, you did a great job
with it, no question.

355
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,114
It'd just be nice
to have a little variety.

356
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,117
Well, you're perfectly free
to use the replicators.

357
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,952
Um, I'm out of rations.

358
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,707
Then...

359
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,254
enjoy the casserole.

360
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,684
A beautiful woman should
never have to eat alone.

361
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,727
What are you reading?

362
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,728
It's nothing important.

363
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,020
Ah.

364
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:45,820
<i>Women Warriors</i>
<i>at the River of Blood?</i>

365
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,031
It's just... escapist reading.

366
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,450
Ah.

367
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,160
"Rorg turned his fierce eye
upon her

368
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,371
"and M'nea felt her heart
begin to quicken

369
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,957
"even as her hand
went to her dagger.

370
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,543
"she had intended to plunge
it into his throat

371
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,087
but something about him
made her hesitate."

372
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,300
B'elanna, is this
a Klingon romance novel?

373
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,554
The Klingons do have what you
might call a romantic side.

374
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,556
It's a bit more
vigorous than most.

375
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,560
I think I'll read it.

376
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,895
Maybe it'll give me some ideas

377
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,021
about how
to make your heart quicken.

378
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,065
It's not a technical
manual, Tom.

379
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,777
Well, that depends on what
you mean by "technical."

380
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,154
To an engineer, that means...

381
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:32,241
"specializing
in particular systems."

382
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,535
I think that
definition works.

383
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,038
Well, I can't promise I won't
put a dagger in your throat.

384
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,250
Have you heard about
the Doctor's new family?

385
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,752
How's it going?

386
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,712
I think he was a little
overwhelmed at first

387
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,507
but I have to give
him credit.

388
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,342
He's sticking with it.

389
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,678
It's hard to imagine
the doctor with children.

390
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,971
(<i> both chuckling</i> )

391
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,814
JANEWAY:
Senior staff to
the bridge immediately.

392
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,744
Tom, I want to send
a probe into that anomaly.

393
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,120
Can you hold position
close enough

394
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,580
for us to get
accurate telemetry?

395
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,874
I can try.

396
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,583
CHAKOTAY:
Be ready to move
away quickly

397
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,670
if it starts moving toward us.

398
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,213
Sorry about that.

399
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,215
Just trying to find a way to
ride the gravitron waves

400
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,384
it's throwing off.

401
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,470
There.

402
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,098
That's a little better.

403
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,142
We're in as good a position
as we're going to be.

404
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,143
Tuvok?

405
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,729
The probe has been launched.

406
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,821
Actually,
this is kind of fun.

407
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,406
Speak for yourself.

408
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,324
KIM:
We're starting
to receive telemetry.

409
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,036
Captain, this is
one weird disturbance.

410
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,537
I'm reading
a temperature gradient

411
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,163
of nine million kelvins,

412
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,249
massive discharges
of plasmatic energy,

413
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,292
and there's a perfectly
calm eye at the center.

414
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,962
TUVOK:
Apparently, some
of the matter inside it

415
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,339
is being exchanged
between space and subspace.

416
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,799
What about the plasma?
Is there any way

417
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,843
we can transfer
some of it to<i> Voyager?</i>

418
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,177
I don't see how.
We can't transport

419
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,763
with this kind
of turbulence.

420
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,014
Maybe we could try a...

421
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,187
we lost it.

422
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,522
Where's the probe?

423
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,315
It's disappeared.
It's still transmitting

424
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,943
but there's a lot
of interference.

425
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,780
I'm detecting some kind
of unstable interfold layer

426
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,032
not in space
or subspace.

427
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,617
It could be where
the eddies originate

428
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,993
and where the probe is now.

429
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,536
We've got another particle wake.

430
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,830
Since we can't get plasma
directly from the eddies,

431
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,958
maybe we could collect
some from their wakes.

432
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,960
The bussard collectors
could be modified

433
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,544
to gather plasma particles.

434
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,964
We could do that,
but<i> Voyager's</i> energy emissions

435
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,091
are so high they'd corrupt the
particles.

436
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,884
I'm not sure the plasma
would be much use to us.

437
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,510
PARIS:
What if I took
a shuttle out?

438
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,638
The energy emissions
would be a lot lower.

439
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,264
That sounds like
it's worth a try.

440
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,183
Well, you'd be exposing yourself
to radiation poisoning.

441
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,561
Check with the doctor. Maybe
he can give you some protection.

442
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,187
Yes, ma'am. I'll head
to the shuttlebay

443
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,230
as soon as I'm done.

444
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,615
I've given you a combination
of hyronalin and lectrazine.

445
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,325
That should give you
temporary protection.

446
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,077
But I can't guarantee
its duration.

447
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,411
That's all right, doc.

448
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,455
I don't think I'll be
out there too long.

449
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,415
If I know you, you'll
push it to the limit.

450
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,542
You enjoy flirting
with danger.

451
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,836
You know me too well.

452
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,462
You were undoubtedly
one of those children

453
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,213
who had to climb
the highest tree...

454
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,425
scale the tallest cliff.
That was me.

455
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,805
I can only imagine what you must
have put your parents through.

456
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,807
How's the family, Doc?

457
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,851
I hear they're
a real handful.

458
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,937
Indeed. However, I have
analyzed the situation

459
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,063
and come up with a solution.

460
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,482
There should be
no more problems.

461
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,694
You make it sound like
you're treating a sick patient.

462
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,905
I'm not sure you can
diagnose and cure a family.

463
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,532
We'll see.

464
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,200
You're in fine physical
shape, lieutenant.

465
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,704
You may go ahead and engage
in this reckless activity.

466
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,830
Thanks, Doc.

467
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,049
Where's Jeffrey?!
He's coming.

468
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,301
I asked everyone to be here
at 1600 hours, precisely.

469
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,761
Jeffrey was asleep.

470
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,140
Asleep? In the middle
of the afternoon?

471
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,266
(<i> sighing</i> )

472
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,435
Is this true?
Were you asleep?

473
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,146
Are you sick?

474
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,773
I had a late night.

475
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,401
That's one of the matters
I want to discuss.

476
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,111
Thank you all for coming.

477
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,405
I thought it would be good
to have a family meeting.

478
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,908
In fact, I'd like to
do this on a regular basis.

479
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,660
That's something
to look forward to.

480
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,328
If you have something
to say, Jeffrey

481
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,581
say it so everyone can hear.

482
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,623
Nothing.

483
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,837
I've been feeling
that this family

484
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,464
is beginning to spin
out of control.

485
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,966
As husband and father

486
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,844
I believe it is my duty
to set some parameters.

487
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,721
It's part of good parenting.

488
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,472
What are parameters?

489
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,517
Limits. Boundaries.

490
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,394
To that end,
I have drawn up

491
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,731
a revised family schedule and
a list of rules and regulations.

492
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,526
I'd like you all
to study them carefully.

493
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,196
You've rearranged
my lecture nights!

494
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,073
I had to do that in order
to make everything work.

495
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,824
Everybody has had
to make some sacrifices.

496
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,077
Daddy! You changed
parisses' squares

497
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,579
from Monday-Wednesday-Friday
to Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday!

498
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,372
Mm-hmm--that puts me
on the second team!

499
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm good enough to be
on the first team!

500
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,751
You shouldn't be
on the first team.

501
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,128
You're not old enough.

502
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,338
As I said Belle, we must
all make sacrifices.

503
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,884
What sacrifices did<i> you</i> make?

504
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,344
I will make dinner on the nights
your mother lectures.

505
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,429
You do that anyway.

506
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,432
That's not a sacrifice.

507
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,185
What's this mean
about no Klingon friends?!

508
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,352
Exactly that.

509
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,105
They're a bad influence on you.

510
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,316
They're prone to violence, they
keep you out till all hours.

511
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,902
Why don't you find
some nice Vulcan friends?

512
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,904
You can't just decide
who my friends will be!

513
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,281
CHARLENE:
Hold on.

514
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,700
Kenneth, that may be
a bit unreasonable.

515
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,910
Charlene?

516
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,796
(<i> whispering</i> ):
You know very well

517
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,091
how important it is
to keep a united front.

518
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,427
I expect you to support
me in these decisions.

519
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,930
Well, if that's
what you expect

520
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,849
then maybe you should
have asked my opinion

521
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,935
before you started
unilaterally deciding things.

522
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,687
I'm not one of
the children, after all.

523
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,814
I believe I should
have some say

524
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,067
in just what rules and
regulations are established!

525
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,569
And I think it's unfair
for you to tell Jeffrey

526
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,072
what friends he can
and cannot have.

527
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,159
Right! This whole meeting
is a Vulky idea!

528
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,451
And you can have it without me.

529
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,995
Jeffrey, you were
not excused!

530
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,080
You've upset him.
Let him go.

531
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,333
I don't want to argue this
in front of the children.

532
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,917
We'll discuss it later.

533
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:07,594
You really made a mess
of things didn't you, daddy?

534
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,681
Apparently so.

535
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,560
Although, I must admit, I fail
to understand the reaction.

536
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,191
I... I'm just trying to help the
family function better.

537
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,276
How does it make the family
function better

538
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,779
if I go to parisses' squares
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday?

539
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,948
Belle, you've been playing
with children

540
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,700
two and three years older
than you.

541
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,327
That's much
too dangerous.

542
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,162
But that's what's
fun about it.

543
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,790
(<i> sighing</i> )

544
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,500
You're not old enough
to realize

545
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,003
how hazardous that game can be.

546
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,420
It's up to me to keep you safe.

547
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,506
I...

548
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,550
I'm just trying
to be a good father.

549
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,437
If it'll help, Daddy,
I'll be on the second team.

550
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,483
Thank you, Belle.

551
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,278
That's very grown-up of you.

552
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,821
And I think you're
a very good father.

553
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,910
Why... thank you.

554
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,124
I love you, daddy...

555
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,209
even if you did
make a mess of things.

556
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,222
JANEWAY:
Voyager<i> to</i>
<i>shuttlecraft</i> Cochran.

557
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,432
<i>Do you read?</i>

558
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,975
Loud and clear captain.

559
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,769
I'm about 3,000 kilometers
from the eddy.

560
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:39,853
As soon as it dissipates

561
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,521
I'll head for the particle wave.

562
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,316
If this one follows
the pattern of the others

563
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,234
it should begin to collapse
within a few seconds.

564
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,484
<i>That's good.</i>

565
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,154
I'm beginning to wish
I hadn't had

566
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,948
that second helping
of French toast this morning.

567
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,784
KIM:
Captain, the eddy
is starting to dissipate.

568
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,827
Stand by, Tom.

569
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,953
<i>I'm ready.</i>

570
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,418
I'm in position, captain.

571
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:06,255
Activating
the bussard collectors.

572
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,423
It's working.

573
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,757
<i>This may save us from Neelix's</i>

574
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,218
<i>pleeka rind casserole</i>
<i>after all.</i>

575
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,637
We'll all thank you
for that.

576
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,514
KIM:
Captain, subspace disruption.

577
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,184
Is another eddy forming?

578
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,226
It looks that way.

579
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,811
Tom, get out of there now.

580
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,937
I'm going.

581
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,904
Harry, can you beam him out?

582
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,572
KIM:
Transporters are off line.

583
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,283
I'm working on them.

584
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,617
Tom, are you there?

585
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,911
It's pulling me in!

586
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,372
I don't have enough power!

587
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,789
Where are the transporters?

588
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,291
I can't access them!

589
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,168
The shuttle's being drawn
inside the eddy.

590
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,128
Janeway to Paris,
Do you read me?

591
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,215
Captain, the astral eddy
is beginning to dissipate.

592
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,772
Harry,
when the probe disappeared,

593
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,649
it kept transmitting.
What about Tom's shuttle?

594
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,151
We're getting
a lot of interference.

595
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,070
I can't tell if
it's a transmission or not.

596
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,614
See if you can clean it up.

597
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,493
I've adjusted the encoding
filter. Try it now.

598
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:23,665
<i>Voyager</i> to Tom Paris.
Can you hear us? Respond.

599
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,583
Calibrate
to a theta band frequency.

600
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,793
Maybe that'll help.

601
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,628
PARIS:
<i>I can't hear you, Captain.</i>

602
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,297
<i>There's a lot</i>
<i>of plasma interference.</i>

603
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,882
<i>I can't clean it up.</i>

604
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,384
Say again, Tom.
You're breaking up.

605
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:37,221
Adjust your transceiver
lock and try again.

606
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,266
<i>I can hear you.</i>
<i>That better?</i>

607
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,435
Yes, a little.
Where are you?

608
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,894
Captain,
I wish I could tell you.

609
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,256
(<i> sighing</i> )

610
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,225
Doctor?
Hmm?

611
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,435
Can I help you
with something?

612
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,520
Oh, no, no.

613
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,772
Uh. Perhaps.

614
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,816
I've been trying to do
an immunogenicity analysis

615
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,568
on Ensign Parson's
cell culture

616
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,903
and I can't seem to get
the measurements right.

617
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,738
I'd be happy
to give it a try.

618
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,740
Thank you.
I'd be grateful.

619
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,501
Actually,
I've been having

620
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,544
a few problems at home.

621
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,005
I can't seem to stop
thinking about them.

622
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,923
Well, there's nothing
important going on here.

623
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,425
Why don't you
take the afternoon off

624
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,260
and spend some time
with your family?

625
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,888
I'm not sure
they'd appreciate it.

626
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,681
Doctor,
you can't just ignore them.

627
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:13,275
Computer, initiate Doctor's
family program beta-rho

628
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:18,822
and transfer the E.M.H.
to holodeck two.

629
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,867
LARG:
Be certain everything
is done in exactly...

630
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,246
Dad, what are you doing here?

631
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,333
I live here, Jeffrey,
in case you've forgotten.

632
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,960
I mean... you're home early.

633
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,505
Am I interrupting something?

634
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,089
Uh... no, no.

635
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,425
Just talking with my friends.

636
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,344
I'd like to get
to know your friends.

637
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,305
Larg, K'kath,
please sit down.

638
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,023
What is that?

639
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,400
What?

640
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,817
You're holding something.

641
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,154
This?
Yes. What is it?

642
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,865
It's a knife.
What does it look like?

643
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,250
Why do you boys have a knife?

644
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,627
A<i> D'k Tahg</i> knife
is an important part

645
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,837
of our culture.

646
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,839
Every Klingon is given one

647
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,342
in preparation for
his rite of ascension.

648
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,016
Hmm.

649
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,364
I happen to know something
about Klingon rituals

650
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:46,326
and I believe this is actually
a dagger of<i> Kut'luch.</i>

651
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,705
Isn't it?

652
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,130
Well?

653
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,048
Yes.

654
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,304
This dagger is used
in a ritual of violence.

655
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,722
A first bloodletting

656
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,475
in preparation
for becoming a warrior.

657
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,892
Who's supposed to use this?

658
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,063
Well?

659
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:23,656
Is one of you preparing
for the<i> Kut'luch</i> ceremony?

660
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,198
I'm waiting for an answer!

661
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,367
Dad, you're making something
out of nothing.

662
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,663
I don't think so.

663
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,289
I'm going to have
to ask you boys to leave.

664
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,749
JEFFREY:
Dad...

665
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,917
And don't bring a weapon
into this house again.

666
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,379
I told you,
humans are weak... cowardly.

667
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,048
Call me later.

668
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,550
(<i> door slams</i> )

669
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,969
Now look what you've done!
You've ruined it!

670
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,053
What, exactly, have I ruined?

671
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,514
Nothing! Never mind!

672
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,350
You were going to use that
knife, weren't you?!

673
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,727
Did they talk you into some
kind of ritual violence?

674
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,979
They didn't talk
me into anything.

675
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,606
I asked them.

676
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,817
It's an honor to get to
perform the<i> Kut'luch.</i>

677
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,819
They don't just
let anybody do it.

678
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,612
They trusted me

679
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,448
and now you've made me
look like... like a human.

680
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,784
You were going to attack
someone, draw blood,

681
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,370
just so you could appear daring
in the eyes of your friends?!

682
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,330
I was doing it
to become honorable--

683
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,416
something that you
wouldn't understand.

684
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,168
Jeffrey, how can
I make you understand

685
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,045
that what you were
going to do is wrong?

686
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,463
It isn't wrong!

687
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,674
It's just the custom
of another culture.

688
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,009
Who are you to say there's
something wrong about it?

689
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,721
I am your father,
and I expect you to be guided

690
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,847
by my ethical standards.

691
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,348
Well, I'm not going to be.

692
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,392
Your standards
are human standards.

693
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,143
They're weak and inferior.

694
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,396
Klingon ideals are much nobler

695
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,232
and they are the ones
I'm going to follow.

696
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,526
If you expect to live
in this household

697
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,237
you will abide by the rules.

698
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,489
If that's
the way you want it

699
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,657
then I won't live here.

700
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,827
Jeffrey...
think about this.

701
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,328
Oh, I've thought about it.

702
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,122
I'm going to become a warrior,
and I can't do that

703
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,710
if I'm being led around on a
leash by some bloodless<i> patahk.</i>

704
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,467
(<i> door shuts</i> )

705
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,512
(<i> chime ringing</i> )

706
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,349
<i>Kenneth?</i>

707
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,059
What is it? What's happened?

708
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,437
<i>It's Belle.</i>
<i>There's been an accident.</i>

709
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,744
How is she?

710
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,246
Dr. Finley and I operated
on her for three hours.

711
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,749
We've tried everything.

712
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:39,917
We shut down
one hemorrhage

713
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,167
and another starts.

714
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,171
I don't understand.

715
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,800
She just hit her head
on the corner of the court.

716
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,427
How could that have
injured her so badly?

717
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,638
She suffered severe
cranial trauma.

718
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,181
It's compromised her brain stem
and motor cortex.

719
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,308
No matter how we try

720
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,768
to control
the vascular injuries

721
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,937
blood clots keep forming.

722
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:04,023
The hemorrhaging is...
intractable.

723
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:08,654
Then what do you do?
What's the treatment?

724
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,697
Unfortunately...

725
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,157
the brain is still a...

726
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,452
a somewhat
mysterious organ.

727
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,120
What does that mean?

728
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,914
What's going to happen to her?

729
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,419
There's nothing
more to be done.

730
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,840
Nothing medical, anyway.

731
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,300
Oh, but there has to be.

732
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,885
Kenneth, you can do something.

733
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,096
You have to.
You can't just let her...

734
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,021
No.

735
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,775
No, I won't accept it.

736
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,443
I'm going to talk
to Dr. Finley.

737
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,593
Belle...

738
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,596
BELLE:
Daddy?

739
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,307
Yes?

740
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,767
I'm here.

741
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,437
Everything's all blurry.

742
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,526
What's the matter?

743
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,737
You took a tumble...

744
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,072
hit your head.

745
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,491
It doesn't hurt.

746
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,411
No, because
we gave you some medicine.

747
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,123
Is that why
I can't feel my legs?

748
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,838
Yes.

749
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,506
What's going to happen?

750
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,928
When will I be able
to see again?

751
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,972
Computer, end program.

752
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,440
KES: Oh, you're back.
Yes.

753
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,192
Did you find the culture I did
on Ensign Parson's glial cells?

754
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,111
I did, thank you.
Good job.

755
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,153
How's the family?

756
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,530
I suppose they're fine.

757
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,032
I've actually finished
the program.

758
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,117
Finished? Already?

759
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,620
Well, I'd gotten what
I needed from the experience.

760
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,413
It was thoroughly pleasurable,
of course,

761
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,957
but to continue
would be a waste of time.

762
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,291
I was hoping
to visit them again.

763
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,918
I really enjoyed
our dinner together.

764
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,419
Well, if I ever create
a new family,

765
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,337
I'll be sure to invite you.

766
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,561
B'ELANNA:
The communications bandwidth
is as wide as I can get it.

767
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,897
Janeway to Paris.
How's the transmission now?

768
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,649
<i>Loud and clear, Captain.</i>

769
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,734
I've been analyzing
the shuttle's sensor readings,

770
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,820
and as nearly as I can figure,

771
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,405
I'm in the interfold layer
that we talked about--

772
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,283
<i>somewhere between space</i>
<i>and subspace.</i>

773
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,661
That's why we can't find
you on any of our scans.

774
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,162
<i>Harry was right.</i>

775
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,664
This looks like
the spawning ground

776
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,165
for the astral eddies.

777
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,417
<i>There are thousands</i>
<i>of baby ones in here.</i>

778
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,836
That's very interesting, Tom,

779
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,420
but it doesn't address
the problem

780
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,213
of how to get you out of there.

781
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,800
Well, I've been giving that some
careful thought, Captain,

782
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,344
and it seems to me
the only way to get out

783
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,596
is the same way that I got in.

784
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,015
Inside one of the eddies?

785
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,809
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>I've been watching one.</i>

786
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:29,479
It seems about ready
to erupt into normal space.

787
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,439
<i>If I can position the shuttle</i>
<i>on its leading edge</i>

788
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,610
<i>I should be able</i>
<i>to ride it back.</i>

789
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,655
If I had another idea,
I'd suggest it, but I don't.

790
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,699
It's your call, Tom.

791
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,742
I don't see
that there's much choice.

792
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,254
So far so good, captain.

793
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,841
I'm almost inside the eye.

794
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,384
I think this one
is just about big enough

795
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,095
to enter normal space.

796
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,556
Here it comes.

797
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,766
<i>Captain?</i> 
Yes, Tom.

798
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,352
I think you should get<i> Voyager</i>
away from here<i> .</i>

799
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,770
What's wrong?

800
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,271
This one's turning out
to be a whopper.

801
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,982
The biggest one
we've seen by far.

802
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,151
I don't think you should put
the ship in danger.

803
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,111
I'm not leaving, tom.
We've got to stay in close

804
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,738
if we're going to beam you out.

805
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,703
The eddy is moving toward us

806
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,621
at a velocity of 300 kilometers
per second.

807
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,289
JANEWAY:
Chakotay, take the conn.

808
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,667
Keep us ahead of it, but stay
within transporter range.

809
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,419
Right.

810
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,004
I'm going to try
to get out of this.

811
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,760
(<i> groans</i> )

812
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,555
(<i> panting</i> )

813
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,197
Harry, can you
get a lock on him?

814
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,075
Not yet! Everything's too
unstable.

815
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,535
Tom, how much longer
before you clear the eddy?

816
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,496
It had better be soon.
The hull is beginning to buckle.

817
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,550
I've got the shuttle on sensors.

818
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,094
The hull is breaching!

819
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,887
Harry, can you
get a lock on him yet?

820
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,555
I'm trying! Hang on!

821
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,184
Got it!

822
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,518
The shuttle's aboard, Captain.

823
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,812
One life sign.

824
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,230
He's injured.

825
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,356
Beam him to sick bay. Chakotay,
move us away.

826
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,441
Yes, Ma'am.

827
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,407
DOCTOR:
Your hard head has protected
you again, lieutenant.

828
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,409
There was only
a mild concussion.

829
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,494
It was worth it, though.

830
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,246
That was one wild ride.

831
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,914
I'm sure it was.

832
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,749
And it's a wonder
you're not dead.

833
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,169
People like you who court danger
should be thrown into the brig.

834
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,419
Doc...
You never think

835
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,879
of the consequences
of your actions,

836
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,422
the effect they
might have on others.

837
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,548
Oh, no, live for the moment

838
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,217
take risks you shouldn't...

839
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,059
I'm sorry.

840
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,102
Are you all right?

841
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:19,899
I... it's my family.

842
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,985
My daughter Belle
had an accident.

843
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,404
She's a child who tends
to take risks.

844
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,656
She's going to die.

845
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,787
I'm so sorry.

846
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,747
I'll be all right.
I shut down the program.

847
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,624
I'm not going back.

848
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,047
Maybe you should think
about that, Doc.

849
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,968
I couldn't begin...
to face it.

850
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,891
It was too difficult.

851
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,142
I guess all of us
would avoid

852
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,312
that kind of pain
if we could...

853
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,731
but most people
don't have that choice.

854
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:03,401
Well, fortunately, I do.

855
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,903
Is it so fortunate?

856
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:09,157
You created that program
so you could experience

857
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,284
what it's like
to have a family

858
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,161
the good times and the bad.

859
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,080
You can't have one
without the other.

860
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,707
I fail to see why not.

861
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:22,295
Well, think about what's
happened to us here on<i> Voyager.</i>

862
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:27,217
Everyone left people behind,
and everyone suffered a loss

863
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:33,014
but look how it's brought
us all closer together.

864
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,808
We've found support here,
and friendship,

865
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,643
and we've become a family

866
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,645
in part because
of the pain we shared.

867
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:46,027
If you turn your back
on this program

868
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,154
you'll always be stuck
at this point.

869
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:55,703
You'll never have the chance
to say good-bye to your daughter

870
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,081
or to be there
for your wife and son

871
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,083
when they need you

872
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,793
and you'll be
cheating yourself

873
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:06,714
of the chance to have
their love and support.

874
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,967
In the long run,
you'll miss the whole point

875
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,676
of what it means
to have a family.

876
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,985
Computer, continue Doctor's
family program beta-rho

877
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,778
from the last point
of deactivation.

878
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,963
Daddy...

879
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:50,758
what's going
to happen to me?

880
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,969
When will I be able
to see again?

881
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,556
I'm not sure.

882
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,602
You're a very sick girl.

883
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,189
Am I going to die?

884
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,360
You're...

885
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,196
you're too sick to get better.

886
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,034
So, I'm going to die.

887
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,121
Yes.

888
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,840
If you stay with me...

889
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,927
I won't be afraid.

890
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,430
I'll stay right here.

891
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,265
I promise.

892
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,657
Dad...

893
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,422
Here you go, shorty.

894
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,215
It's your blanket.

895
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:22,600
We're here, Belle.
We're all here.

896
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,320
(<i> sniffles</i> )

897
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,739
It's getting darker.

898
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,119
I'm...

899
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,664
...sleepy.

900
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,209
It's all right.

901
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,545
Go to sleep.

902
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,130
We're all right here.

903
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,540
(<i> sobs</i> )
