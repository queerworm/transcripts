1
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,889
Oh, sir...

2
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,642
we, um... we're just...

3
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,560
Yes, I can see that.

4
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,609
What was that all about?

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,986
I'd call it an example

6
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,196
of indiscreet shipboard
fraternization.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,532
Really? Sorry I missed it.

8
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,367
Deck 6.

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,372
(<i> chuckling</i> )

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,748
Thank you for
your help, Tom.

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,793
Yeah. See you later.
Right.

12
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,007
Here's the cabbage
you asked for.

13
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,175
Is something wrong?

14
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,097
What's this?

15
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,141
A spawn beetle.

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,020
Oh, they cross-pollinate
the Oblissian cabbage.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,315
Have you ever seen
such fascinating striations?

18
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,819
Oh, isn't it
beautiful?

19
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,571
I doubt the Captain
would think so

20
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,323
if she found it crawling around
in her salad.

21
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,576
(<i> growls</i> )

22
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,536
There is something wrong.

23
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,913
What is it?

24
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,373
No, nothing. I'm just very busy.

25
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,000
(<i> clears throat</i> )

26
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:29,464
So you're seeing
Tom Paris later.

27
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,841
What?

28
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,552
No, not that I know of.

29
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,431
He said, "See you later."

30
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,641
You said, "Right."

31
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,644
Is he helping you
in the airponics bay now?

32
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,814
He was just helping
me carry these.

33
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,024
How thoughtful.

34
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,859
Neelix, this is getting
ridiculous.

35
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,945
You're imagining things
that aren't there.

36
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,072
You're such an innocent!

37
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,325
I see the way he looks at you.

38
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,287
I used to look at women
that way. I know what it means.

39
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:04,124
<i>Janeway to the senior staff.</i>
<i>Please report to the Bridge.</i>

40
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,003
Take care.

41
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,846
Thank you for bringing
the cabbage.

42
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,181
I can handle this
from here, thank you.

43
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,693
We've detected a strange
energy configuration

44
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,903
off the port bow.

45
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,655
Any idea what it is?

46
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,032
It appears to be some sort
of magnetic disturbance.

47
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,326
We're going to take
a closer look.

48
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,916
You seem a little
preoccupied, Commander.

49
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,584
This morning,
I interrupted a couple

50
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,461
who were kissing
in the turbolift.

51
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,131
And I've been wondering
if we should establish

52
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:56,468
a policy regarding...
fraternization.

53
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,346
Well...

54
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,515
the couple in question
might be urged

55
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,182
to show a bit more discretion,

56
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,978
but Starfleet has always
been reluctant

57
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,147
to regulate
people's personal lives.

58
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,732
Of course, but we're in
a unique situation here.

59
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,527
The development
of intimate relationships

60
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,488
might cause us problems that
wouldn't arise in other ships.

61
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:20,325
I understand
what you're saying, but...

62
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,995
we're a long way from home.

63
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,707
Everyone is lonely,
and all we have is each other.

64
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,418
I think, eventually,
people will begin to pair off.

65
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,587
Including you?

66
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,927
As Captain, that's a luxury
I don't have.

67
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,473
Besides, I intend for us
to be home before...

68
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,684
before Mark
gives me up for dead.

69
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,936
We're in visual range,
Captain.

70
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,897
On screen.

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,032
CHAKOTAY:
Looks like some type
of energetic vapor.

72
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,533
Magnify.

73
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,747
Space-dwelling life-forms.

74
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,415
Full sensor
scan, Mr. Kim.

75
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,834
Their internal energy patterns
appear to be consistent

76
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,669
with discrete
organic processes.

77
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,422
Captain, I'd like the chance
to study them at close range.

78
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,298
So would I, Commander.

79
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,051
But let's not get too close.

80
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,386
We wouldn't want to disturb
their natural behavior.

81
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,806
Half impulse, Mr. Paris.
Take us into bio-scanner range.

82
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,226
Aye, Captain.

83
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,594
The swarm is not
particularly dense, Captain.

84
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,846
I estimate their number
at fewer than 2,000.

85
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,140
They're really moving.
KIM: He's right.

86
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,975
They've accelerated
to a velocity

87
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,353
of approximately
1,000 kilometers per second.

88
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,188
It's possible we're
frightening them.

89
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,981
Keep us within
scanner range, Lieutenant,

90
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,691
but try to avoid
rapid acceleration.

91
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,984
Aye, Captain.

92
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,611
Take a look at this.

93
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,157
See the way they
propel themselves?

94
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,161
JANEWAY:
They seem
to flagellate,

95
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
almost like protozoa.

96
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,040
Exactly,
but they're achieving

97
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,499
incredible speeds--

98
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,835
over 3,000 kilometers
per second.

99
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,504
Ensign Wildman, scan the field
for repeating patterns.

100
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,882
Maybe they're capable of
some type of communication.

101
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,592
Aye, Captain.

102
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,137
CHAKOTAY:
Their internal anatomy's
also very unusual.

103
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,513
They don't appear to have a
digestive system of any kind,

104
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,682
but they have an extremely
porous outer covering.

105
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,810
My guess would be that they
absorb nutrients

106
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,270
directly from space.

107
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,813
Incredible.

108
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,398
A space-dwelling life-form

109
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,733
capable of metabolizing
inorganic matter.

110
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,068
WILDMAN:
Particle density

111
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,903
in this part of space
isn't very high.

112
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,656
That might explain why they
have to keep moving so fast.

113
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,659
Feeding at 3,000
kilometers per second.

114
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,578
Not exactly leisurely
dining, is it?

115
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,421
(<i> door chimes</i> )

116
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,054
(<i> door chimes</i> )

117
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,852
Come in.

118
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,485
For you, sweeting.

119
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,195
Thank you.

120
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,613
Hmm... what's the occasion?

121
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,825
Oh, no occasion.

122
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,204
I... I just wanted
to apologize.

123
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,039
Apologize?

124
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,168
For the way I acted
in the Mess Hall.

125
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,462
I-I was jealous.

126
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,963
I know.

127
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,341
I just wish you could trust me.

128
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,052
It has nothing to do
with trusting you.

129
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,095
It's him I don't trust.

130
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,680
I've seen
his kind before.

131
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,517
They're all over the Quadrant,
as a matter of fact.

132
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,395
They prey on naive, sheltered

133
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,022
young women like you.
What are you looking for?

134
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,024
A vase.
Don't!

135
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,152
What's this?

136
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,029
Nothing. Just a snack.

137
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,865
A Terran delicacy.

138
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,617
Ensign Wildman
told me about it.

139
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,870
Mashed potatoes with butter.

140
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,039
It's delicious.

141
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,916
Would you like to try it?

142
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,629
Ugh. Awful.

143
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,590
How can you eat it?

144
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,050
I can't stop eating it.

145
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,843
I've had six bowls.

146
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,678
And the reason it
tastes so strange--

147
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,182
I put a container
of nitrogenated soil in it.

148
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,475
Dirt?

149
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,810
You're eating dirt?

150
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,021
Why?
I don't know,

151
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,690
but this morning...

152
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,734
What?

153
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,321
You remember the spawn beetles?

154
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,865
You... you didn't...?

155
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,954
Neelix to Sick Bay.

156
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,248
Prepare to receive
an emergency patient.

157
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,208
I'm not sick.

158
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,544
I feel fine.

159
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,797
I just can't... stop eating.

160
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,216
We are going to get
to the bottom of this.

161
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,676
Come on.
No! I'm not going!

162
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,429
We are going to Sick Bay.
No!

163
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,390
I'll call Security unless
you come with me. Holy...

164
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,267
Come on.
(<i> muffled</i> ): Stop it!

165
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,394
Put me down!

166
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,230
They're changing course
again, Captain,

167
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,024
and accelerating.
Should I follow them?

168
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,859
I'm concerned that
we're disturbing them.

169
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,070
Let's drop back a bit, give them
a little more room.

170
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,405
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,242
KIM:
Captain, we're accelerating.

172
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,868
We're getting closer
to the swarm.

173
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,162
Mr. Paris?

174
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm trying to
slow down, Captain.

175
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,749
KIM:
Our velocity doesn't correspond

176
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,835
to impulse reactor output.

177
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,795
We're moving much faster
than we ought to be.

178
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,341
They seem to be... pulling us
toward them.

179
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,051
TUVOK:
Sensors indicate
an EM resonance field.

180
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,803
The creatures
seem to be creating

181
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,348
their own magnetic wake. That is
what is pulling the ship.

182
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,224
We're getting closer.

183
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,810
Mr. Paris, reverse thrusters.

184
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,854
Helm controls aren't
responding, Captain.

185
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,897
Mr. Tuvok, raise shields.

186
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,316
(<i> console beeping</i> )

187
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,567
Nonfunctional, Captain.

188
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,319
They're pulling us in.

189
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,833
Damage report.

190
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,378
Life support's functioning
normally, Captain,

191
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,672
but there's a huge fluctuation
in the EPS grids.

192
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,090
It's wreaking havoc
with the impulse engines.

193
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,092
Warp drive's still on line.

194
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,886
One burst, and we'd
be out of here.

195
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,138
But our exhaust could
seriously harm the creatures.

196
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,558
Janeway to Torres.
Do you have any thoughts about

197
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,185
how to get us out of this swarm
without engaging warp engines?

198
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,564
We might try something like
a<i> targ</i> scoop.

199
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,899
<i>Can you enlighten us,</i>
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

200
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,569
Klingons put them on the front
of ground assault vehicles.

201
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,778
They emit
a high-frequency tone

202
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,490
that disperses<i> targ</i> herds
in their path.

203
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,492
I can modify the main deflector

204
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,869
<i>to create</i>
<i>an inverted magnetic pulse.</i>

205
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,205
Project it toward the swarm.

206
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,875
It might be enough to... nudge
the creatures out of the way.

207
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,377
Good idea, Lieutenant.

208
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,836
Proceed.

209
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,590
You're sure the beetles
weren't poisonous?

210
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,091
Or the flowers?

211
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,968
There are no toxins
present in her system.

212
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,723
Doctor, why is she eating
all these strange things?

213
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,182
What's wrong with her?

214
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,892
I am conducting
an examination

215
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,644
in order to
determine that.

216
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,563
But don't you have any ideas?

217
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,399
Her unusual appetite
may merely indicate

218
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,983
a nutrient deficiency.

219
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,402
It is not unusual
for humanoids

220
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,404
to crave foods that are rich
in the very vitamins

221
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,615
and minerals that their
bodies are lacking.

222
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:05,326
You... you can't mean
my body lacks dirt.

223
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,457
Her body temperature is
elevated 3.9 degrees.

224
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,250
She's burning up.

225
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,834
And I'm detecting
elevated levels

226
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,129
of electrophoretic activity
in her nervous system.

227
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,089
You have
to bring them down.

228
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,300
There is increased
electrophoretic activity

229
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,800
in the ship's atmosphere,

230
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,137
probably created by
the creatures we're studying.

231
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,846
You mean,
there's a connection

232
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,224
between what's happening to Kes
and those creatures?

233
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,602
You have to do
something about it!

234
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,771
You are making it impossible
for me to think,

235
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,314
much less treat my patient.

236
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,607
You must leave.

237
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,400
I won't.
Kes needs me.

238
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,527
Leave now
or I will call Security.

239
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,029
You can't talk
to me that way.

240
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,448
This is my Sick Bay

241
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,074
and I will decide
what goes on here.

242
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,867
But...
Get out!

243
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,412
I'll be back.

244
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,997
Don't worry
about a thing.

245
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,544
(<i> sighs</i> )

246
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,682
Captain, may I
speak with you?

247
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,183
It's a matter
of some urgency.

248
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,310
What is it, Neelix?

249
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,146
I have been thrown
out of Sick Bay.

250
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,276
And I'm just wondering
if you feel it's appropriate

251
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,613
for a hologram to banish
a flesh and blood person,

252
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,615
who should have the right
to be at the bedside

253
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,701
of his loved one,
who is extremely ill.

254
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,370
Kes is extremely ill?

255
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,996
The hologram
doesn't have a clue

256
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,581
as to what's wrong
with her.

257
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,000
Though it may have something
to do with these creatures.

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,711
But he still won't
let me offer comfort

259
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,086
to the woman I love

260
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,964
at a time when my place
is clearly by her side.

261
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,678
Just how is Kes being
affected by the swarm?

262
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,596
That's what I
wanted to know,

263
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,223
but before I
got any answers,

264
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,683
I was summarily
dismissed.

265
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,893
<i>Sick Bay to Bridge.</i> 
Janeway here.

266
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,978
<i>Captain, I think you'd</i>
<i>better come down here.</i>

267
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,647
<i>There's a bit of a problem.</i>

268
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,149
I'm on my way.
Commander, you have the Bridge.

269
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,443
Notify me immediately
of any change in our status.

270
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,653
Aye, Captain.

271
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,488
(<i> Kes panting</i> )

272
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,281
I was conducting tests.

273
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,242
She was none too cooperative,
let me assure you.

274
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,744
Then suddenly,
she screeched

275
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,662
and shoved me out of the
way, went into my office

276
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,456
and proceeded to erect a-a
force field at the door.

277
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,209
I can't lower it.

278
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,253
She's keeping me
out of my own office.

279
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,588
NEELIX:
Sweeting.

280
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,881
(<i> gasping</i> )

281
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,340
What's wrong?

282
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,051
Please come out.

283
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,136
I was able to complete
several tests

284
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,055
before she
became delirious.

285
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,891
Her fever has increased and her
pulse

286
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,768
and blood pressure are
dangerously high.

287
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,562
Do you have any idea
what's causing these symptoms?

288
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,564
I suspect it's the
electrophoretic levels

289
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,148
being created by the swarm.

290
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,443
We should leave
immediately.

291
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,820
Unfortunately, that's
not an option at the moment,

292
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,947
but we're working on it.

293
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,323
There's one more thing.

294
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,452
I discovered a strange
growth on her back.

295
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,287
It's unlike any other
tumorous substance

296
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,914
I've ever seen
or studied before.

297
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,708
And it was not there the
last time I examined her.

298
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,920
(<i> panting</i> )

299
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,171
I'll try to talk to her.

300
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,677
Kes, please come out.

301
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,722
You can eat
anything you want.

302
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,225
Captain.

303
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,352
Why don't you let me try?

304
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:28,112
Kes, please listen to me.

305
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,739
We think you're being affected

306
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,032
by a swarm
of space-dwelling life-forms.

307
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,494
We're doing everything we can
to get away from them.

308
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:39,874
And when we do, you'll probably
start feeling better.

309
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:43,294
Are you... saying that's
not what's wrong with you?

310
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,508
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

311
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,303
Kes... please, let me come in.

312
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,681
Tell me
what it is.

313
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,141
Maybe I can help.

314
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,373
Shh.

315
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,041
Shh.

316
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,711
It's going to be all right.

317
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,467
Now...

318
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,555
tell me what is
happening to you.

319
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,391
Di-did the Doctor
tell you

320
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,518
he found something
growing on my back?

321
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,187
Yes, a growth
of some kind.

322
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,690
It's the mitral sac.

323
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,569
It's where my child
would grow.

324
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,696
I'm going through
the<i> elogium--</i>

325
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,614
the time of change--

326
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:58,202
when my body prepares
for fertilization.

327
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:05,167
Humans go through
the same kind of process.

328
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,545
It's called puberty.

329
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,463
But I'm too young.

330
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,007
Much too young.

331
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,092
It usually happens

332
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,513
between the ages
of four and five.

333
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,307
I'm-I'm not even two yet.

334
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,142
Listen to me.

335
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,105
All your body's metabolic
activity has increased.

336
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,315
It's possible
your reproductive processes

337
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,860
are being accelerated
as a result.

338
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,528
I'm not ready.

339
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,822
We're going to get you
through this, Kes.

340
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,408
The Doctor will monitor
you constantly.

341
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,577
You don't understand.

342
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,162
The<i> elogium</i> occurs only once.

343
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,873
If I am ever going
to have a child,

344
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,417
it has to be<i> now!</i>

345
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,339
No change, Captain.

346
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,717
We're still being pulled
along with the swarm.

347
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,596
PARIS:
Heading 121, mark 7.

348
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,099
Speed now 6,000
kilometers per second.

349
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,268
All systems are functioning
within normal parameters.

350
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,145
How is Torres coming
with the modifications

351
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,355
to the main deflector?
Her last report estimated

352
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,149
they'd be finished
in another half hour.

353
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,859
Let me know
as soon as she's ready.

354
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,653
Join me, Commander?

355
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,533
Kes is terribly
frightened.

356
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,036
She's had no time
to prepare for this,

357
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,288
and the decision has
to be made in the next

358
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,749
40 or 50 hours.

359
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,836
She's going to discuss
it with Neelix, but...

360
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,757
there are
so many unknowns.

361
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,802
There might be risks
in procreating this early.

362
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,470
And of course
there's no guarantee

363
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,597
they're genetically
compatible,

364
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,557
or that Neelix
has any interest

365
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,268
in becoming a father.

366
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,770
Seems your concerns

367
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,983
about fraternization
were... prophetic.

368
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:56,570
I wasn't even thinking
about procreation,

369
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,867
but I suppose it's...
the inevitable outcome.

370
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,245
We should consider the fact
that it might be necessary

371
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,998
for the crew to start
having children.

372
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,376
It might take us
a long time to get home.

373
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,796
If it does take 75 years,
we're going to need

374
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,298
a replacement crew
in about half that time.

375
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,592
(<i> sighs</i> )

376
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,469
Who'd have thought
we'd be considering

377
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,888
a generational ship

378
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,182
when we were ordered
on a three-week mission.

379
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,558
I know,

380
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,935
but it's a problem
we have to face now.

381
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,356
What would that mean
for the children?

382
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,527
What kind of life
would we be giving them?

383
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,404
Aboard a starship,

384
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,783
traveling through a potentially
hostile part of space.

385
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,494
And are we equipped to provide
for their needs--

386
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,039
child-care,
educational facilities.

387
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,749
We'd be building
an entire community

388
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,542
on board this ship.

389
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,961
That's a massive commitment.

390
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,923
Are you prepared to tell them
they can't have children?

391
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,925
I can't do that.

392
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,471
And I've made it clear
to Kes that it's her choice

393
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,974
whether to have a child
or not, but...

394
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,267
Mmm.

395
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,979
There aren't any
easy answers here...

396
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,856
for any of us.

397
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:21,197
Are you saying that,
unless you conceive now,

398
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,907
you'll never be able to?

399
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,326
Yes, and I need you
to help me decide,

400
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,038
because I would want
you to mate with me.

401
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,126
(<i> gasps</i> )

402
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:37,421
I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm... I'm... I'm...

403
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,923
honored.

404
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,426
But are you entirely
certain it would be safe?

405
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,263
Safe?

406
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:48,390
You're so young.

407
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,643
Is it dangerous for you

408
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,436
to conceive a child
at your age?

409
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,897
I don't know. I've never known
anyone

410
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,233
as young as I am
who had a baby.

411
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:06,033
If you never had a child,
would you...

412
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,367
be terribly unhappy?

413
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,911
Yes!

414
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,746
I-I mean...

415
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,206
I think so.

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,668
I don't know.

417
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,715
I always assumed
I'd be a mother someday--

418
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,384
just not so soon.

419
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,345
What about you?

420
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,431
Didn't you think
you'd be a father someday?

421
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,644
Well, to be honest, uh...

422
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:37,273
I've never given it
much thought.

423
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,944
Until now, my life
has been so... itinerant.

424
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,864
There's no way
I could have provided

425
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,407
the stability
a child would need.

426
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,785
But now it's different,
isn't it?

427
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,330
Well...

428
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,456
yes.

429
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,959
But...

430
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,296
raising a child on a starship--

431
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,341
that's hardly what I would
call the ideal environment.

432
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,384
You don't want
a child, do you?

433
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,595
That's not it at all.

434
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,931
I'm just trying to look

435
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,766
at all sides
of the issue.

436
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,271
Bringing a child
into the world...

437
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,773
it's a huge responsibility.

438
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,608
I know you'd want
to be sure

439
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,695
we're both up to the task.

440
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,323
I-I mean, somebody would
have to keep their eye

441
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,200
on the little guy all the time,

442
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,078
or he'd be off sticking
his finger into an EM conduit

443
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:35,831
or playing
with the plasma injectors.

444
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,125
That's right. That's
called being a parent.

445
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,172
What about your medical studies?

446
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,715
You wouldn't be able
to continue them

447
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,926
if you had a child.
Of course I would!

448
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,220
You're just making excuses.

449
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,180
All you're thinking about
is yourself.

450
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,891
How much trouble a child
would be for you.

451
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,269
Look!

452
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,435
What's that?

453
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,272
The<i> ipasaphor.</i>

454
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,899
It makes the mating
bond possible.

455
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,402
It does?
If we begin,

456
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,487
we must stay bonded
for six days.

457
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,615
Six days?

458
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,992
In order to ensure conception.

459
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,744
And after the<i> ipasaphor</i> appears,

460
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:18,456
we only have 50 hours
to begin the process.

461
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,627
So I need to know your answer.

462
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,004
Uh, well, uh...

463
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,298
50 hours.

464
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,759
That's... good.

465
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,180
That's good.

466
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,810
We can sleep on it.

467
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,647
I'll get back to you.

468
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,332
(<i> man coughing</i> )
Sorry.

469
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:02,918
I swear I heard you say
lots of pepper sauce.

470
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,382
What is the lunch
special today?

471
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,385
Well, actually, I didn't

472
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,387
get around to making
a lunch special.

473
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,682
But we have some lovely
<i>gabosti</i> stew left over

474
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,225
from last night.

475
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,894
Very well, it will do.

476
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,563
I've... had
quite a run on it

477
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,940
as a matter of fact.

478
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,818
It seems very popular.

479
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,487
If it is all
you are serving,

480
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,113
that would stand to reason.

481
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,907
You can have it with or without
pepper sauce.

482
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,409
Without.

483
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,720
Oh...

484
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,897
Mr. Tuvok...

485
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,024
I was wondering.

486
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,985
You have children,
don't you?

487
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,487
I have four.

488
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,365
Four! My!

489
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,909
That's certainly
quite a family.

490
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,913
Tell me...

491
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,832
what's it like
being a father?

492
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,920
The question is so broad,
it is difficult to respond.

493
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,798
Well, I mean, it's a lot
of responsibility, isn't it?

494
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,633
Watching them.

495
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,428
Caring for them.

496
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,179
Keeping them safe.

497
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,889
Giving them an education.

498
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,808
That is
certainly true.

499
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,685
Sounds like it's
a lot more trouble

500
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,312
than it's worth.

501
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,646
Mr. Neelix,

502
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,857
I am aware of your situation.

503
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,817
It appears you are in some doubt

504
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,362
as to the wisdom
of becoming a parent.

505
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,157
It's just
all happening so fast!

506
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,286
I don't know what to think.
I can only tell you

507
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,913
that if you have considerable
doubts about fatherhood,

508
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,874
it would not be wise
to enter into the process.

509
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,919
It is so much more overwhelming
than one expects

510
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,547
that I believe only
the most committed

511
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,340
should become parents.

512
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,342
Ah...

513
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,345
That's what I thought.
However,

514
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,681
I must point out
that, as illogical as it seems,

515
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,684
being a father can have
infinite rewards--

516
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,480
far more than
would seem possible.

517
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,816
My children occupy a significant
portion of my thoughts,

518
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,320
now more than ever.

519
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,988
I have heard it said

520
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:40,326
that children can bring a lot
of joy into one's life.

521
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:43,954
I experience
neither joy nor sorrow,

522
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,956
but I do believe it is possible.

523
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,377
Now that I think about it,

524
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,671
it might be fun
to have a little guy around.

525
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:57,134
And we could do a lot together.

526
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:02,139
I've got quite a bit
I could teach a boy, you know--

527
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,850
survival methods,

528
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,977
piloting skills,

529
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:10,022
romantic techniques.

530
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,358
If you say so.

531
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,110
But I must point out
that there is an equal chance

532
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,694
that you would have a daughter.

533
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,323
A daughter?

534
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,617
I don't have anything
to teach a daughter.

535
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:25,078
Why would it be any different
from what you would teach a son?

536
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,165
It just would.

537
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,501
She'd learn more
from her mother.

538
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,837
I have three sons and one
daughter.

539
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,589
I can assure you,
she benefits

540
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,841
as much from my presence
and guidance

541
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,426
as my sons do.

542
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,803
It is unfortunate

543
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,641
that I must be so far removed
from all of them now.

544
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,020
I understand.

545
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,606
We'll get there, Mr. Vulcan.

546
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,525
I'm sure of it.

547
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,778
Thank you.

548
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,281
You've given me a lot
to think about.

549
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,623
We're ready to generate
the inverted

550
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,543
magnetic pulse, Captain.
Proceed.

551
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,629
Initiating the field.

552
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,048
(<i> console beeping</i> )

553
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,299
(<i> beeping intensifies</i> )

554
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,634
TORRES:
It's working.

555
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,095
Are the creatures all right,
Commander?

556
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,138
Yes, Captain,
they seem to be fine.

557
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,141
Let's try to keep it that way.
Thrusters at 200 kph, Mr. Paris.

558
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,353
Ease us out of here.
Aye, Captain.

559
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,984
What are they doing?
CHAKOTAY: Hard to know

560
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,570
what's prompting that behavior.

561
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,988
Maybe they think we're
making a hostile move.

562
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,616
Report.

563
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,159
I'm reading a massive energy
drain in all ship systems.

564
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,911
Impulse engines
are losing power.

565
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,288
Captain, some of the life-forms

566
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,290
have attached themselves
to the warp nacelles.

567
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,084
Guidance, navigational and
tactical systems are failing.

568
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,128
How soon will we clear
the swarm, Lieutenant?

569
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,046
In a few seconds.
We're almost out.

570
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,634
Captain, I am detecting
a substantial magnetic mass

571
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,636
moving rapidly
toward the port bow.

572
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,150
WILDMAN:
It's physiologically similar

573
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,694
to the smaller creatures,
just a lot bigger.

574
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,862
TUVOK:
Perhaps it is
the parent.

575
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,906
Or it could be
a difference in gender.

576
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,826
It's hard to say
without further observation.

577
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,202
With all due respect,
Captain,

578
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,870
haven't we done
enough observing?

579
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,832
These creatures have attacked
the ship's key systems.

580
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,168
For all we know, they were
setting us up for an attack.

581
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,419
It's possible.

582
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,129
Mr. Paris,
let's keep moving.

583
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,423
If we can put some distance
between us and the swarm,

584
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,800
maybe the ones on our nacelles

585
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,593
will drop off and
rejoin their friends.

586
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,680
Aye, Captain. 200 kph.

587
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,938
The larger creature
is moving with us.

588
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,149
(<i> console beeping</i> )
Now what?

589
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,276
The creature has emitted
an electrically charged

590
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,902
plasma stream.

591
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,156
All stop.
Damage report.

592
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,659
No significant damage, Captain.
Shields are holding.

593
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,161
A plasma blast
is a hostile move.

594
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,955
Shouldn't we be thinking
about responding?

595
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,750
If the creature threatens
serious damage to the ship,

596
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,418
I'll consider it an enemy.

597
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,045
Until then,
they're all to be treated

598
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,088
as indigenous life-forms
behaving normally

599
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,050
in their natural habitat. We're
the intruders here.

600
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,678
Captain, look at this.

601
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,557
They're attaching
themselves

602
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,809
to the large creature the
same way they did to us.

603
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,519
KIM:
And I think
I know why.

604
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,229
That plasma stream it ejected

605
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,733
has almost the same subspace
signature as our warp nacelles.

606
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,568
Then the smaller
creatures are attracted

607
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,194
to our subspace emissions.

608
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,487
Perhaps in the same way

609
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,531
some species are attracted
to pheromones.

610
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,115
Pheromones?

611
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,119
You think it's a
sexual attraction?

612
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,581
Color change
and provocative movement

613
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:58,333
are frequently associated
with mating rituals.

614
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,920
Then... these guys think
we're one of them?

615
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,255
Well, their behavior
toward us

616
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,006
and the large creature
is similar.

617
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,093
It's possible they've mistaken
us for a potential mate.

618
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,682
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Yes?

619
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,184
Well, order the diapers.

620
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,311
We're about to become parents.

621
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,189
You mean, you want to mate with
me?

622
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,191
More than anything.

623
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,693
But you were making excuses.

624
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,486
I didn't think you
wanted to be a father.

625
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,114
I just hadn't
thought it through.

626
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,576
Now that I have, I swear
to you I want to do this.

627
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:36,037
And I'll be the best
possible father to our child.

628
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,001
I know you will.

629
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,088
So...

630
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,840
what comes next?

631
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,259
Before we begin
the mating process,

632
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,844
I have to go through
a certain ritual

633
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,388
called the<i> rolisisin.</i>

634
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,390
What does that involve?

635
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,893
One of my parents has
to massage my feet

636
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,103
until my tongue
begins to swell.

637
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,568
Uh, where do you plan
to find a parent?

638
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,654
If Captain Janeway weren't
so busy I'd ask her,

639
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,739
but I'm sure
the Doctor would do it.

640
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,159
Will that work?
Since he's not a real person?

641
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,369
The Doctor is
very real to me.

642
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,332
I don't know how I feel
about him massaging your feet.

643
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,375
It's a ritual.
Someone has to do it.

644
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,253
Okay. Okay, fine.

645
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,589
How long will that take?

646
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,175
About an hour.

647
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,095
Then I'll be back.

648
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,949
Fascinating.

649
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,868
The stimulation
to the sympathetic nerves

650
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,995
must set off
a hormonal reaction,

651
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,663
which activates
glandular activity

652
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,456
in the tissues of the tongue.

653
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,166
I've never seen
this response before.

654
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,335
Although in a species
known as the Gree,

655
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,295
stimulating follicles
on the proboscis

656
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,756
results in a swelling
of the auricular canal.

657
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,384
Doctor?
Yes?

658
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,887
Am I doing the
right thing?

659
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,222
You'll have to tell me.

660
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,349
I know nothing of this ritual.

661
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,976
No, I mean, am I doing
the right thing

662
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,394
by conceiving a child?

663
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,983
If I were at home now, my father
would be performing

664
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,193
the<i> rolisisin</i> with me.

665
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,655
It's the time when
parent and child

666
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,782
move into a new kind
of relationship.

667
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,869
As the child
has her own child,

668
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,455
the parent must acknowledge
her true adulthood.

669
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,666
I see.

670
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:48,003
My father and I were very close.

671
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,923
He was such a wise man.
I miss him.

672
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,259
Sometimes, I think I hear
his voice in my head.

673
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,011
It's almost as
though he were here

674
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,763
helping to guide me.

675
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:03,060
I'm sorry.

676
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,897
I must be feeling lonely
for home.

677
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:10,692
It's probably a result
of the<i> elogium...</i>

678
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,070
(<i> sighs</i> )

679
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,407
but I really would appreciate
your advice.

680
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,492
Your help.

681
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,247
I need someone's guidance.

682
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,836
I can discuss
delivery methods...

683
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,882
or pediatric situations.

684
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,551
I'm afraid I don't have
much perspective to offer

685
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,637
about becoming a parent.

686
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,557
Neither do I.

687
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,770
As long as Neelix
was opposed to the idea,

688
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,105
trying to get out of it,

689
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,857
I was certain that I wanted
to have a child,

690
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,985
but when he said
that he wanted one too,

691
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,903
suddenly, I was very frightened.

692
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:04,329
Perhaps a statistical survey
will offer a context.

693
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,332
Among the Breen,
pregnancy at a young age

694
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,750
is a common event.

695
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,043
The Breen, of course,

696
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,420
is one of the most warlike
of species.

697
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,422
And then there
are the Scathos.

698
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,008
Any woman who
conceives a child

699
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,969
before her fourth decade
is summarily executed.

700
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,846
Maybe I just felt
I should have a child

701
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,097
because I could.

702
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,684
There is a powerful
biological drive,

703
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,854
at times, almost
impossible to resist.

704
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,106
Species are driven
by these urges

705
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,440
in order to survive.

706
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,526
But isn't that
why we have minds--

707
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:38,488
to look beyond biological
urges, to consider

708
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,615
their consequences?

709
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,409
If I'm going to ask myself
to look at those consequences,

710
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,871
then I have to ask myself
some questions.

711
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,708
Am I really ready
to have a child?

712
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,503
Am I prepared to give that child

713
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:57,049
the attention and devotion
it deserves?

714
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,844
Am I capable of taking on
such a huge responsibility?

715
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,471
Oh, there's so much
I haven't done.

716
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,558
There's so much
I want to study and learn.

717
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,685
I'm not sure
I'm finished growing.

718
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,937
How could I help a child grow?

719
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,612
If the smaller creatures

720
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,907
are sexually attracted
to our subspace emissions,

721
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,076
then the large one
may perceive us as a rival.

722
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,702
That plasma burst
it sent out

723
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,370
might have been
aggressive posturing.

724
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,581
Then you'd think it would be
happy to see us leave.

725
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,708
Lieutenant, is there
any way we could generate

726
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,959
a short burst of impulse?

727
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,794
Enough to get us away
from this swarm?

728
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,589
I could try releasing power from
the impulse capacitance cells

729
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,341
straight into the driver coils.
Do it.

730
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,177
All right.

731
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:45,430
I've accessed
the capacitance cells.

732
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,391
I think I can give you enough
for a short burst of impulse.

733
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,851
We've got one shot, Captain.

734
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,437
You heard her, Mr. Paris.
Make the best of it.

735
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,899
Aye, Captain.
Initiating impulse burst...

736
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,442
now.

737
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,735
(<i> console beeping</i> )

738
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,403
Captain,
the creature is reacting.

739
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,156
It is approaching rapidly
on a collision course.

740
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,783
Evasive maneuvers, Lieutenant.

741
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,243
We don't have the power
for that.

742
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,245
The creature is accelerating.

743
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,996
I'm losing power.
Can't shake him.

744
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,624
All hands brace for impact.

745
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,558
Structural integrity
down to 86 percent.

746
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,768
I am beginning to share

747
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,352
Lieutenant Torres' views,
Captain.

748
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,854
Retaliation
may become necessary.

749
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,024
It's not my intention
to harm the creature.

750
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,111
The feeling
definitely isn't mutual.

751
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,862
Mr. Tuvok, launch
a class-4 probe.

752
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,948
Maybe that will distract
the creature long enough

753
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,950
for us to get away.
Aye, Captain.

754
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,661
Probe launched.

755
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,412
KIM:
Another plasma burst.

756
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,914
Shields are down to 64 percent.

757
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,916
Looks like the probe
just made him angry.

758
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,876
This is an aggressive life-form,
Captain.

759
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,462
He's only going to respond
to an aggressive stance from us.

760
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,714
TUVOK:
Treating the creature
as it is treating us

761
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,633
might be an
appropriate response.

762
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,051
We ram him.

763
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,344
Precisely.

764
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,847
It's probably the
response he expects.

765
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,350
Captain,
shields are at 47 percent.

766
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,477
Any more of this and the hull
will start to buckle.

767
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,521
Mr. Paris, use
maneuvering thrusters.

768
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,356
Set a course
toward the creature.

769
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,066
Give him a bump
to get his attention.

770
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,278
Aye, Captain.
Engaging thrusters.

771
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,368
The creature is not retreating,
Captain.

772
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,622
He's just hitting us
back harder.

773
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,832
Let's try this.

774
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,416
Detonate a field
of photon charges

775
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,252
between<i> Voyager</i>
and the creature.

776
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,713
Maybe the shock wave will
let him know we mean business.

777
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,215
Captain, if I may.

778
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,175
Maybe we're going
about this backwards.

779
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,801
Yes, Commander?

780
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,469
Every aggressive move we make

781
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,889
results in a more aggressive
move by the creature.

782
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,765
If we're not prepared
to use extreme force

783
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,101
to destroy him,
we need to rethink our actions.

784
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,354
I'm listening.
If we're right that the creature

785
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,647
is responding to us
as a sexual rival,

786
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,150
we might try behaving
in a submissive way.

787
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,944
That may appease him. We'd be
acknowledging that he's dominant

788
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,113
and that we're no match for him.
How do we do that?

789
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,698
We tried to move
away slowly.

790
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,116
He wouldn't let us leave.

791
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,659
Maybe we need to mimic
the behavior

792
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,203
of the smaller creatures.

793
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,496
We saw them rolling over
and changing color.

794
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,083
KIM:
If we vent plasma residue,

795
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,709
that might make us look blue.

796
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,254
Mr. Paris, do we
have enough power

797
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,256
to take<i> Voyager</i> 
into a roll?

798
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,924
I think so.

799
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,634
All right.
Let's give this a try.

800
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,388
Mr. Kim, start venting
plasma residue.

801
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:35,641
Mr. Paris,
roll the ship.

802
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,228
Full power to
inertial dampers.

803
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,867
He's not responding at all. It's
not working.

804
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,161
KIM: Wait a minute, Captain.
What is it?

805
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,495
One of the small creatures

806
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,957
is detaching
from the starboard nacelle.

807
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,792
And another one.

808
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,336
They're all
letting go.

809
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,548
It appears we have lost
our sex appeal, Captain.

810
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,718
Good piloting, Lieutenant.

811
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,345
Now, let's see
if we can move away

812
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,763
without
any interference.

813
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,932
I can give you
enough thruster power

814
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,310
to sustain a speed
of 100 kph.

815
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,852
Acknowledged.

816
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,273
Good work, Commander. In the
future,

817
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,608
if I have any questions
about mating behavior,

818
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,526
I'll know where to go.

819
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,378
(<i> knife chopping</i> )

820
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,434
Can I help?

821
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,811
No.

822
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,771
Thanks.

823
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,108
Is something wrong?

824
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,069
No, no, nothing.

825
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,612
You've been very quiet

826
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,699
ever since I decided
not to conceive.

827
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,369
It was your choice.

828
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,745
I respect that.

829
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,165
Neelix...

830
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,083
I think you're disappointed.

831
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,715
I think...

832
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:34,427
once I decided
to become a father,

833
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:38,223
I was looking forward to it.

834
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,058
But I'll get over it.

835
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,560
Maybe you won't have
to get over it.

836
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,645
Just wait a little longer.

837
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,939
But I thought...

838
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,483
this was the only time.

839
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,528
The Doctor believes
the<i> elogium</i> was false,

840
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:55,031
brought on by
the electrophoretic field

841
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,783
that those life-forms created.

842
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,994
So there's a possibility
that I might be able

843
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,497
to go through it again
at the right age.

844
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,666
You mean, we might still
be able to have a daughter?

845
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,668
Or a son.
No.

846
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,087
I've thought about it.

847
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,423
A daughter, definitely.

848
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,841
One who looks just like you.

Yes, Ensign. What can I do for

00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,715
I'm sorry
to disturb you, Captain,

860
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,342
but I thought...

861
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,220
I thought I
should inform you

862
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,807
of my physical condition.

863
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,683
Your physical condition?

864
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,105
Well, we'd been trying
for months.

865
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,983
I wasn't even sure
until a few days ago.

866
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,777
My husband is still
at Deep Space 9.

867
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,695
He doesn't even know.

868
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,114
We were only
supposed to be out

two or three weeks.

I know this isn't the best place
to have a baby, but...

872
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,299
it's all I have left...

873
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,676
of my husband.

874
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,555
Well...

875
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,765
