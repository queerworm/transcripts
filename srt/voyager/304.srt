00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:06,465
PARIS:
<i>Helmsman's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50252.3.</i>

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,216
<i>While</i> Voyager
<i>takes on supplies,</i>

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,135
<i>Lieutenant Torres and I</i>
<i>are investigating</i>

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,679
<i>some intermittent</i>
<i>sensor readings</i>

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>we picked up this morning.</i>

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,935
(<i> sighs</i> )

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,981
We've been out here
almost five hours

8
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,483
and we haven't seen any sign
of those energy signatures.

9
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,695
Isn't it time to admit
they were nothing more

10
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,530
than galactic
background noise?

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,533
I want to keep looking
a while longer.

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,409
Just to be sure.

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,745
Aah!

14
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,205
What's wrong?

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,123
Cramp.

16
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,459
Klingon bodies weren't meant
to sit in a cockpit

17
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,169
for five hours
at a stretch.

18
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,840
You have a big dinner
date or something?

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,384
What's that supposed to mean?

20
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,427
Well, you've been angling
to get back to<i> Voyager</i>

21
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,513
for about two hours now.

22
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,849
Just thought maybe
there was a reason.

23
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,434
Like Ensign Bristow.

24
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,020
What?

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,897
Well, I've noticed he's
been making any excuse

26
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,356
to hang around Engineering.

27
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,900
Around you.

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,403
Freddy Bristow... is a child.

29
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,363
Oh, really?

30
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,574
Well, he looks like
a grownup to me.

31
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,117
Tall, good-looking...

32
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,995
and I hear he plays
a mean set

33
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,413
of parrises squares.

34
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,957
I played one game with him
and I whipped him.

35
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,625
Look, he has

36
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,877
a crush on me.

37
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,503
I can handle it.

38
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,673
Why are you so interested?

39
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,633
Oh, I'm just curious...

40
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,968
how someone with Klingon blood

41
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,888
seems to live the life
of a Tabran monk.

42
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,892
Lieutenant, that is none
of your business.

43
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,064
Well, if you ever have
a free evening,

44
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,608
I have a holodeck program
you might enjoy--

45
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,444
sailing on Lake Como.

46
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,906
I'd rather take my chances
with Freddy Bristow.

47
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,910
(<i> console beeps</i> )

48
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,245
Those energy signatures
are back.

49
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,833
We must have crossed
into a tachyon field.

50
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,209
(<i> console beeps insistently</i> )

51
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,377
What's that?

52
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,337
A ship has locked
onto our hull.

53
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,881
Why didn't we
detect it?

54
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,093
The tachyon field must have
disrupted our sensors.

I have studied

the finest recordings

Caruso and Galli-Curci;
Pavarotti and Freni;

of Vulcan.

My tempo is accurate.

78
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,221

Giuseppina Pentangeli--

83

Who allows you
to make this choice?

89
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,580
You are an amateur.

In all of my career, I have

00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,250

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,043
It certainly was.

128
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,711
Do you know why
they attacked you?

129
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,172
No idea. They seemed to be
trying to communicate with us,

130

but we couldn't
understand them.

131
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,550
Then they just
lifted their weapons.

132
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,844
The injuries are treatable.
It shouldn't take long.

I haven't been near
the instrument tray.

149

on the holodeck.

151
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,103
She must have upset me
more than I realized.

Lieutenant, you're perfectly

00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,988
I think he must have suffered
some very deep tissue damage.

Hmm?

I've made numerous hails
on wide-band subspace.

160
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,211

a single repeating message.

00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,342
I'd guess
it's a language so unlike ours

164
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,386
that the universal translator
can't interpret it.

165
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,845
Harry, remodulate
the translator.

166
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,180
See if we can

decipher those sounds.

168
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,309
Neelix, what can you tell us?

169
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,103
If these people are
who I think they are,

170
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,190
I can tell you this
is very bad news.

171
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,317
I've never actually
encountered them...

172
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:31,112
but from what I've heard,
I'm glad I didn't.

173
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,989
Most ships
that enter their space

174
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,491
are never heard from again.

175
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,245
Some have returned with
everyone on board dead.

176
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,829
They're a complete mystery.

177
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,916
No one knows their name,
how many of them there are,

178
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,210
what their culture is like.

179
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,004
Just that they really
don't want people

180
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,257
violating their territory.

181
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,593
If this is any indication
of their borders,

182
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,346
it's a huge area of space--
hundreds of sectors.

183
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,848
If we were to go around it,
it would take months.

184
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,392
I'd say over 15 months,

185
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,853
even if we could sustain
maximum warp, which we can't.

186
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,313
I'm not going to tell this crew

187
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,524
we're adding another 15 months
to this journey.

188
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,692
We'll have to find
another option.

189
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,986
If we are not to go around
their space,

190
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,531
the only available option
is to go through it.

191
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,367
Precisely.

192
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,912
KIM:
Tom and B'Elanna

193
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,914
hit a sensor net
as they crossed the border.

194
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,875
We have to figure we'll run
into it when we try to cross,

195
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,420
but there are ways
around sensor nets.

196
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,921
CHAKOTAY:
They can't possibly

197
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,466
have enough ships
to patrol a border this size.

198
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,801
We can probably find
an unguarded section.

199
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,677
Would it affect your decision
if I pointed out

200
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,097
that encroaching on the
territory of an alien species

201
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:42,183
is prohibited by
Starfleet regulations?

202
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,935
No, it wouldn't.

203
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:48,022
Captain... you have managed
to surprise me.

204
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,525
We're a long way
from Starfleet, Lieutenant.

205
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,611
I'm not about to waste
15 months

206
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,113
because we've run into
a bunch of bullies.

207
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,324
DOCTOR:
<i>Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.</i>

208
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,159
Go ahead, Doctor.

215
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,758

<i>for a skilled physician.</i>

218
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,473
Very good, Doctor.
Keep me informed.

219
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,561
All right. I want a plan
for crossing that border

220
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,896
as quickly
and as quietly as possible.

221
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,358
We'll reconvene in an hour.
Dismissed.

226
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,752
I have the cortical
analeptics you asked for.

227
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,339
Good.
Fill the hyposprays.

228
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,216
We'll begin as soon as
I've finished scrubbing.

229
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,800
Did I hear
you singing?

230
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,219
Yes.

231
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,221
<i>"O soave fanciulla."</i>

232
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,847
It's an aria
from<i> La Bohème,</i>

233
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,059
a truly exquisite opera
by Giacomo Puccini,

234
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,353
a human composer
of the 19th century.

235
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,854
I didn't realize
you enjoyed music.

236
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,315
I've recently begun
a thorough study of opera.

237
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,485
I find it...
quite satisfying,

238
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,944
but I'm having
difficulty finding

239
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,030
a holographic partner
for the role of Mimi.

240
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,951
All the<i> soprani</i> seem to have

241
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,079
the most
irritating personalities.

242
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,831
These women are arrogant,
superior, condescending.

243
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,084
I can't imagine anyone
behaving that way.

244
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,545
What is it?

245
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,424
A quiz for you.

246
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,634
What is the first step
in this procedure?

247
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,428
Establish
the axon connections

248
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,346
and then test
for synaptic potentials.

249
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,474
Ah. Quite right. Very good.

250
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,396
Doctor, what is it?

251
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,817
We seem to have
a small problem.

252
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:01,489
I... can't remember how to
perform this operation.

253
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,542
All right, I've
repaired the damaged

254
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,044
preganglionic fibers
in the spinal column.

255
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,589
The final step
is to restore the nerve sheath.

256
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,173
You'll need
the myelin regenerator.

257
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,259
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

258
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,469
What is it?

259
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,929
He's going
into respiratory arrest.

260
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,598
What do I do?

261
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,975
Apply an efferent impulse
to stabilize his motor neurons.

262
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,477
Apply a... what?

263
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,481
Vital signs are
returning to normal.

264
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,943
(<i> sighs</i> )

265
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,737
There-- myelin
regeneration is complete.

266
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,656
What's the synaptic
potential reading?

267
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,870
Synaptic
potentials are...

268
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,581
normal.

269
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,083
Autonomic and somatic
systems are functioning.

270
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,585
(<i> sighs</i> )

271
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,878
Very good, Doctor.

272
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,172
I think you've done it.

273
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,227
The EMH database
seems to be experiencing

274
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,980
a cascading overload
of some kind.

275
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,817
Doc's memory circuits
are deteriorating.

276
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,318
We knew the Doctor
was never designed

277
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,445
to be up and running
as much as he has been,

278
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,280
but I thought you programmed
safety buffers,

279
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,906
so his circuits
wouldn't degrade.

280
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,534
I did, and I installed
them, but they're

281
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,035
breaking down.

282
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,037
My self-diagnostic routines
have always indicated

283
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,747
that in the event
of cascade failure,

284
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,833
I should simply
be reinitialized.

285
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,043
That would stop the cascade
and allow us to reset

286
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,754
your database and personality
subroutines, but...

287
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,297
But what?

288
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,385
It would restore
the original program--

289
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,886
reset him to the person he was

290
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,471
when we first
activated him.

291
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,223
JANEWAY:
In other words,

292
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,559
he'd forget everything
that's happened to him

293
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,768
over the past two years.

294
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,770
TORRES:
Right.

295
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,271
Doctor...

296
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,190
how do you feel about that?

297
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,821
I... can't say I'd like
to lose the last two years,

298
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,615
but my primary responsibility
is the health and welfare

299
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,451
of this crew. In my current
state, I am useless to them.

300
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,911
I believe Lieutenant Torres

301
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,580
should start
the reinitialization

302
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,873
process immediately.

303
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,165
KES:
No, wait.

304
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,000
Wait, please.

305
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,086
We can't just treat the Doctor
like he's a computer anymore.

306
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,295
He's come too far
for that.

307
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,131
Doctor, please,
think about this.

308
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,466
You'd be losing so much--

309
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,176
all the relationships
you've developed,

310
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,803
our friendship,

311
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,597
your sense of being
a true member of this crew--

312
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,181
all that would be gone.

313
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,017
I can't put personal concerns
over those of the crew.

314
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,019
Look at the experiences
you've had

315
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,646
since you were activated--

316
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,274
you've made friends,
learned how to sing opera,

317
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,276
you've even
fallen in love.

318
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,112
If you lose those memories,
you won't be the same person.

319
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,031
You said you don't know

320
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,991
what's causing
his memory circuits to fail.

321
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,786
Unfortunately, no.

322
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,622
So, if you reinitialize without
finding out what's wrong,

323
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,873
the problem could occur again.

324
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,583
Well, it's a possibility.

325
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,835
Isn't it a better plan to look
for the cause of the problem?

326
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,044
If B'Elanna can find it,

327
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,588
there may be a less
radical solution.

328
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,715
Tom Paris is stable.

329
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,133
He'll be back on duty today.

330
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,760
There's no medical crisis
at the moment.

331
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,511
I can certainly handle
all the routine cases

332
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,805
in Sick Bay.

333
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,056
Please, let's not
just erase him

334
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,309
without trying
to help him first.

335
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,526
If a crew member came down
with a debilitating illness,

336
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,320
you'd do everything
in your power

337
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,280
to make them well again.

338
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,866
I think we owe you
nothing less.

339
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,582
I'll get started.

340
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,878
Don't be discouraged.

341
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,380
I know B'Elanna
can find a way.

342
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,013
CHAKOTAY:
Captain?

343
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,892
I think we found it--

344
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,060
a way to get across the border
without being detected.

345
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,312
Let's hear it.

346
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,063
Their sensor net
uses a series

347
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,774
of interlaced
tachyon beams.

348
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,734
If we adjust the shields
to refract those beams

349
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,235
around the ship,
we can slip across

350
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,404
without appearing
to have disrupted the net.

351
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,739
Not bad.

352
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,408
<i>And</i> we've found
that this area

353
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,577
shows no indication of vessels.

354
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,079
We can slide through,
go to high warp,

355
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,248
and be through this narrow
section of their territory

356
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,542
in four days.

357
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,877
Good work.

358
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,298
Helm, set a course
for the border.

359
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,633
Aye, Captain.

360
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,516
What are you
doing now?

361
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,393
I want to see
if the data corruption

362
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,520
is affecting
your optical sensors.

363
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,772
What did that do?

364
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,106
(<i> gasps</i> )

365
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,359
I-I can't see.
I'm blind!

366
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,986
All right.

367
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,990
(<i> sighs</i> )

368
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,992
That is extremely disconcerting.

369
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,410
Please don't
do it again.

370
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,496
Now what are you doing?

371
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,165
Attenuating your
force field projectors.

372
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,755
Doctor, forgive me,

373
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,506
but this is
very delicate work.

374
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,508
Could you please sit
over there for a few minutes?

375
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,054
How extremely rude.

376
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,059
May I remind you
that I am, in a way,

377
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,020
your patient, who's
suffering from an unknown

378
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,188
and obviously
debilitating condition.

379
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,733
I would think you'd be a little
more sensitive to my needs.

380
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,944
You're questioning
my bedside manner?

381
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,448
The good news

382
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,950
is that your
projection system

383
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,618
doesn't seem
to be affected.

384
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,622
However, I don't know why
your circuits are degrading.

385
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,457
Then... what do we do now?

386
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,667
What we do now...

387
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,128
is get a second opinion.

388
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,172
I'll transfer you to the
holodeck in a few minutes.

389
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,549
Wait here.

390
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,728
Computer, initiate

391
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,397
Jupiter Station
Diagnostic Program Alpha 1-1.

392
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,524
COMPUTER:
<i>The program is activated.</i>

393
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,158
Computer...

394
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
transfer the program

395
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,373
for the Emergency Medical
Hologram to Holodeck 2.

396
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,585
I seem to remember
this place.

397
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,129
You should--
this is Jupiter Station,

398
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,379
where you were created

399
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,423
and where your
database was written.

400
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,301
It seems... so long ago.

401
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,928
This program contains

402
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,180
a sophisticated
diagnostic matrix

403
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,389
specifically created

404
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,224
for the Emergency
Medical System.

405
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,601
That's right.

406
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,394
I should have
remembered that.

407
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,229
How could I
have forgotten?

408
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,357
I'm going to have to play with
the systems for a few minutes.

409
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,735
I'm not exactly sure how to
access all the subroutines.

410
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,570
Don't touch that!

411
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,786
(<i> sighs</i> )

412
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,043
Who are you?

413
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm a holographic
re-creation

414
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,087
of Dr. Lewis Zimmerman,

415
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,131
the creator of the Emergency
Medical Hologram.

416
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,050
You're the
diagnostic matrix.

417
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,467
You might say that.

418
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,760
Something wrong with your EMH?

419
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,054
Yes.

420
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,429
I certainly hope
you're going to be able

421
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,098
to do something
about this annoying problem.

422
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,432
What's wrong with it?

423
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,934
He's experiencing
a cascade failure.

424
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,978
His memory circuits
are degrading.

425
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,855
I was trying to bring
the subroutines on line...

426
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,690
If you don't mind,
I can do it faster.

427
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,777
I can see where you get
your charming personality.

428
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,612
Not to mention
my hairline.

429
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,198
Here we are--

430
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,867
a schematic of the EMH
and its component subroutines.

431
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,869
Can you determine
the source of the problem?

432
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,913
This isn't good.

433
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,790
The EMH has a level-4
memory fragmentation.

434
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,291
How long has the program
been active?

435
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,377
I have been active

436
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,712
for...

437
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,382
for...

438
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,675
Almost two years.

439
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,927
Two years?!

440
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,095
Well, there's your problem.

441
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,387
This program
was developed

442
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,764
as a short-term
supplement

443
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,058
to your medical staff--
1,500 hours tops.

444
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,350
I know.

445
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,852
I added data compression buffers

446
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,604
to compensate
for the additional time,

447
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,939
but they're breaking down.

448
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,691
The EMH is a highly
sophisticated program.

449
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,610
You shouldn't go meddling
in its matrix when you

450
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,028
don't know what
you're doing.

451
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,908
Should we shut down
his program then,

452
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,325
till we figure out
how to fix him?

453
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,161
At this point,
it doesn't matter.

454
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,329
With a level-4
memory fragmentation,

455
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,166
it'll simply continue
to degrade.

456
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,709
There's only one
course of action--

457
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,462
a system-wide reinitialization.

458
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,005
Start over from scratch.

459
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,506
We are aware of that option.

460
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,008
Would it be possible to expand

461
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,342
his memory circuits
instead?

462
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,594
Of course.

463
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,929
Schedule it for your next

464
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,472
maintenance layover
at McKinley Station.

465
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,015
I'm afraid that isn't possible.

466
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,350
We're thousands of light-years
from Federation space.

467
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,686
Well, there's
nothing more I can do.

468
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,355
Either reinitialize it,
or live with the knowledge

469
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,524
that eventually
this EMH will end up

470
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,735
with the intellectual
capacity of a parsnip.

471
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,903
What are you saying?

472
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,238
JANEWAY:
<i>Bridge to Torres.</i>

473
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,906
I'm here, Captain.

474
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,199
<i>We're approaching the border.</i>

475
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,659
<i>We need your help</i>
<i>in Engineering.</i>

476
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,828
I'm on my way.

477
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,413
Doctor-- Zimmerman--

478
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,582
you haven't told us anything
that we don't already know.

479
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,168
What I need is to find out

480
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,962
exactly why the Doctor's
memory circuits are degrading

481
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,047
so that we can come up
with a solution.

482
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,841
Activate a level-4 diagnostic,

483
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,843
or whatever you need to do
to get us some answers.

484
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,261
I'll be back as soon as I can.

485
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,555
I... I wish you
didn't have to go.

486
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,932
(<i> sighing</i> )

487
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,600
I'll hurry.

488
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,977
I promise.

489
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,028
We're holding position

490
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,779
500,000 kilometers
from the border.

491
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,199
I'm ready to go as soon
as you give the word, Captain.

492
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,533
All set, Mr. Kim?

493
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,035
I'm ready whenever
Lieutenant Torres is.

494
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,286
Bridge to Engineering.

495
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,829
<i>Torres here.</i>

496
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,747
B'Elanna, are you ready
to reconfigure the shields

497
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,373
<i>to match Mr. Kim's</i>
<i>refraction pulse?</i>

498
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,001
Ready.

499
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,753
Captain, long-range sensors
show a large vessel

500
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,255
five light-years
from our current position.

501
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:04,050
PARIS:
According to my readings,
it's huge.

502
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,383
JANEWAY:
On screen.

503
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,350
Magnify.

504
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,689
That looks like
thousands of ships.

505
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,774
I'm not reading
any energy signatures.

506
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,776
Their propulsion systems
must be off-line.

507
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,237
Maybe they
haven't detected us.

508
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,905
Yet.

509
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:29,116
All right. Let's get through
that sensor net. Harry, go.

510
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,869
Engineering, initiate
the refraction pulse.

511
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,746
Pulse is activated.

512
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,123
Moving to full harmonic
resolution-- 60 percent.

513
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,542
80 percent.

514
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,378
Ninety...

515
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,671
Maximum resolution.
Shields at nominal output.

516
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,590
Mr. Paris, take us through.

517
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,050
Aye, sir.

518
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,385
Here we go.

519
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,182
The net is registering
as intact.

520
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,767
If those vessels get
the same readings,

521
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,019
they won't
suspect a thing.

522
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,854
(<i> console beeps</i> )

523
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,356
I think we did it, Captain.

524
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,108
Like a snake through the tube.

525
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,567
How about those ships?

526
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,319
They appear
not to have detected us.

527
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,779
They have not
powered up engines.

528
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,030
All right.

529
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,573
Let's get through this
as fast as we can.

530
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,200
Mr. Paris, what's
your recommendation?

531
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,451
I'll try holding
warp 9.75

532
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,828
for as long as I can.

533
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,747
If we can sustain that
for 12 hours,

534
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,416
we'll be nearly
a third of the way through.

535
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,418
Mr. Tuvok, keep your eye
on those ships.

536
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,087
If they so much as twitch,
I want to know it.

537
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,974
Captain...

538
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,475
something... is wrong.

539
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,685
What do you mean?

540
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,688
It's like there's a
drag on the engines.

541
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,150
Captain, sensors indicate
a resonant particle wave.

542
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,068
It's damping our warp field.
We're losing speed.

543
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,945
Bridge to Engineering.
B'Elanna, can you compensate

544
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,363
<i>for the particle wave?</i>

545
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,031
I'll try.

546
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,533
The antimatter reaction chamber
may have been compromised.

547
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,785
Keep me posted.

548
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,454
Hold our present speed,
Mr. Paris.

549
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,754
Why are you making me
stare at these things?

550
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,340
Please don't talk.

551
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,175
Stay fixed on
the fractal patterns

552
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,010
while I analyze your
data-path integrity.

553
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,474
Hmm...

554
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,850
Hmm?

555
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,143
Ew.

556
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,811
Well, there it is.

557
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,146
What? What is it?

558
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,439
I told you not to talk.

559
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,944
(<i> sighing</i> )

560
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,279
This is the problem, all right.

561
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,613
The personality subroutine

562
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,409
has grown to more
than 15,000 gigaquads.

563
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,246
That's the source
of the degradation.

564
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,208
Look at all this useless
information floating around

565
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,710
your buffer--
friendships with the crew,

566
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,212
relationships with...

567
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,088
women?

568
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,924
Do they find you attractive?

569
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,427
I don't remember.

570
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,597
You've filled your memory
with nonsense.

571
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,766
It was only during my off hours.

572
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,977
You're supposed to be off
during your off hours.

573
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,937
I'm sorry.
I... I didn't realize.

574
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,939
(<i> door opening</i> )
Who are you?

575
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,607
I'm the Doctor's assistant.

576
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,276
I came to see
how he's doing.

577
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,487
Ah, just the person I need.

578
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,239
Perhaps you can tell me
who's been feeding

579
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,533
all this useless information
into its database.

580
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,783
What do you mean?

581
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,785
I'll give you an example.

582
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,246
Ah! Here's something

583
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,580
in its
personality subroutine.

He's been studying opera.

587
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,132
What's wrong with that?

588
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,010
It wasn't programmed
to be a tenor,

589
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,678
it was programmed
to be a physician.

590
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,514
What's wrong with wanting
to be more than that?

591
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,765
It's superfluous.

592
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,225
Look at me.

593
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,102
I've got the same matrix,
the same holo-array,

594
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,520
the same neural pathways
as it does.

595
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,188
You don't see me
cluttering up my circuits

596
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,773
with irrelevancies.

597
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,191
I'm content to be

598
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,069
the best possible
diagnostic program I can be.

599
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,280
Your EMH should be happy
to be a fine physician.

600
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,323
The Doctor has taken it
upon himself

601
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,952
to become a person who grows
and learns and feels.

602
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,829
It's made him
a better physician.

603
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,165
An EMH program
can't feel anything.

604
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,585
It's emotional reactions are
simply a series of algorithms

605
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,920
designed to make it
easier to interact with.

606
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,505
He's much more than that,

607
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,508
and I've known him
for most of my life.

608
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,385
He's one of my closest friends.

609
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,472
You can't possibly believe

610
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:22,099
that this program
shares these feelings.

611
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,268
I know he does.

612
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,565
Tell me, Doctor, is this
one of your closest friends?

613
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,236
Doctor?

614
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,369
I'm sorry.

615
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,704
I don't know who you are.

616
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,841
What's the status
of those ships, Mr. Tuvok?

617
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,092
Still unpowered.

618
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,595
They don't seem to have
detected us.

619
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,180
When I was in high school,

620
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,141
I snuck out of the house
a couple of times late at night.

621
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,767
I had to tiptoe past
my parents' bedroom.

622
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,187
That's kind of how I feel
right now.

623
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,480
You sneaked out of your house?

624
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,023
Where were you going?

625
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,108
Well, I'll have to leave that
to your imagination,

626
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,860
Lieutenant.

627
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,112
Can I take a few guesses?

628
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,240
Captain, I'm detecting another
ship, not part of the swarm.

629
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,034
It has been damaged.

630
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,994
Propulsion systems
are not functional.

631
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,871
Drop out of warp.
Put it on screen.

632
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,001
PARIS:
Looks like it's

633
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,503
been pounded on for days.

634
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,671
Any life signs?

635
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,963
KIM:
I'm checking.

636
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,424
Only one, and it's faint.

637
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,219
Transporter Room 1,
beam the survivor to Sick Bay.

638
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,637
Harry, start scanning that ship.

639
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,430
See if you can figure out
what happened to it.

640
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,764
Aye, Captain.

641
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,439
He's suffering
from severe dehydration,

642
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,732
damage to the spinal column.

643
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,067
There's evidence

644
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,027
of trauma to the
nervous system,

645
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,445
just like we found
in B'Elanna and Tom

646
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,779
after they were attacked.

647
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,073
Can I talk to him?

648
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,449
You can try.

649
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,076
I'll work on restoring
his cranial nerves,

650
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,912
but he's so badly injured
I'm not sure it'll help.

651
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,121
He's a sick man.

652
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,956
This is where
sick people come.

653
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,417
Doctor, hold onto
this tricorder,

654
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,168
all right?

655
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,254
Keep it pointed
right at the patient.

656
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,968
I'm Kathryn Janeway,
the Captain of this ship.

657
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,220
Can you hear me?

658
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,930
Yes.

659
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,806
Can you tell me
what happened?

660
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,100
Who attacked you?

661
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,687
There were
thousands of them.

662
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,939
Little ships...

663
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,525
swarmed around
my freighter.

664
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,985
Covered every square meter
of the hull.

665
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,030
Then they began
extracting energy

666
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,782
from all the ship's systems.

667
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,867
We had no defense.

668
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,827
Then they boarded us.

669
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,581
Did they use
neuroelectric weapons?

670
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,791
I don't know
what they used.

671
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,210
It was painful.

672
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,254
People screaming...

673
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,590

674
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,135
Had you... provoked them
in any way?

675
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,638
We were in their space.

676
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,431
That was enough.

677
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,267
Captain,

678
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,436
the rest of my crew...

679
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,062
is there anyone else?

680
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,567
I'm sorry.
You're the only survivor.

00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,445

regenerate your motor neurons.

00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,618
five parsecs from here

684
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,870
in a yellow dwarf system.

685
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,167
If you pass,
will you tell our people?

686
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,794
I'll make a point of it.

687
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,089
It happened so quickly...

688
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,052
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )

689
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,430
His injuries
were too severe.

690
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,849
He's a very sick man.

691
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,689
Captain, the Doctor
is getting worse.

692
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,398
He doesn't even know
who I am anymore.

693
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,899
He has to be
reinitialized.

694
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,485
I agree, but I can't
spare B'Elanna now.

695
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,069
We have to get
through this space

696
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,655
before we're attacked
like his ship was.

697
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,990
As soon as it's possible,
I'll break her free.

698
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,908
Is there anything at
all I can do for him?

699
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,286
The only thing
I can think of

700
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,372
is to keep his
neural pathways active.

701
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,040
Ask him questions.
Keep him thinking.

702
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,292
Force him to use
his neural matrix.

703
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,795
That might at least
slow down the degradation.

704
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:26,051
Doctor,
you mustn't touch those.

705
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,850
Here. This one's
all right to hold.

706
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,643
Shall I use it
on the sick man?

707
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,481
Yes, that's a good idea.

00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,441

We should keep going.
Mr. Paris...

711
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,911
Captain.
I am detecting a vessel.

712
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,963
It's one of the swarm.

713
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,340
PARIS:
It was still attached

714
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,592
to the freighter's hull.

715
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,844
Red Alert.
Shields at maximum.

716
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,303
They are scanning us,
Captain.

717
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,471
Hail them.

718
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,390
I am getting a response.
Audio only.

719
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,141
(<i> alien language</i> )

720
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,436
Harry, how are you coming
with the universal translator?

721
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,104
I'm working on it.

722
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,648
Let's see if they might
be able to understand<i> us.</i>

723
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,024
TUVOK:
Channel is open.

724
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,027
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

725
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,864
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

726
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,532
We only want
to proceed peacefully

727
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,825
through this region of space.

728
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,870
(<i> clicking</i> )

729
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,496
Do you think they're trying

730
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,956
to communicate?

731
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,833
Could be, but what they're
trying to communicate

732
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,585
is another question.
Any progress, Harry?

733
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,086
I'm getting a general idea.

734
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,880
It's something
like... "Too late.

735
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,674
Should have listened."

736
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,175
Report.

737
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,052
We've been hit with some
kind of polaron burst.

738
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,387
TUVOK:
The energy expenditure

739
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,013
was not high enough
to cause any damage.

740
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,724
It may not have been a weapon.

741
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,310
Captain, that little ship
is hightailing it out of here.

742
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,438
So it scanned us,
sent out a polaron burst

743
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,107
that caused no damage,
and then took off.

744
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,151
Captain, the burst has
changed the shield polarity.

745
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,862
It's now rotating
at 92 gigahertz.

746
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,114
That means if anybody
wanted to find us,

747
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,116
it's a lot easier now.

748
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,453
I'll say. As far as anyone's
sensors are concerned,

749
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,830
we're lit up like
a Christmas tree.

750
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,123
TUVOK:
Captain, the
swarm of ships

751
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,125
has powered their engines
and turned toward us.

752
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,543
They are in pursuit.

753
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,754
Do what you can, Tom.
We have a head start.

754
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,965
We might be able to outrun them.
Bridge to Engineering.

755
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,466
<i>Torres here.</i>

756
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,301
How are you coming with
the warp drive, B'Elanna?

757
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,345
I'm going to try realigning
the dilithium matrix,

758
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,263
but we'll need to shut down
the warp drive to do it.

759
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,640
<i>We can't shut down.</i>

760
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,350
<i>The alien ships</i>
<i>are headed toward us.</i>

761
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,602
I don't know if I can do this
on the run, Captain,

762
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,228
but I'll give it a try.

763
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,690
Do the best you can.
Janeway out.

764
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,733
Nicoletti, we're going to
have to try

765
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,485
a dilithium realignment
on the fly.

766
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,778
Let's figure out
how to do it

767
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,530
without killing everyone
in Engineering.

768
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,784
I fail to understand
why I can't leave this room.

769
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,370
Stand aside, young woman, or
I will have you put on report.

770
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,622
Doctor, please, I'm just
trying to keep you safe.

771
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,374
Others can leave.
You can leave.

772
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,583
Why can't I leave?

773
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,835
Because your
holo-projectors

774
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,211
don't work in
the corridors.

775
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,005
My... what?

776
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,422
Please, sit down.

777
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,014
Doctor, you know I'm
your friend, right?

778
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,724
Yes. You're Kes.

779
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:19,975
Yes. Yes.

780
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,184
Do you remember me?

781
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,519
Of course
I remember you.

782
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,729
What an absurd question.

783
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,438
Oh, that's wonderful.

784
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,983
But why won't you
let me leave this place?

785
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,819
I'm trying to protect you.

786
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,072
Oh.

787
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,825
Well.

788
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,914
This isn't... such a bad place.

789
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,959
I remember...

790
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:49,295
there were a lot of people here,
wounded people.

791
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,924
I asked someone to...

792
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,967
state the nature
of the medical emergency,

793
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,886
and then inquired
as to the status

794
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,262
of their Chief
Medical Officer.

795
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,805
He was dead,

796
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,600
and then...
everyone disappeared.

797
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,852
I think that's when
you were activated

798
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,645
almost two years ago.

799
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,440
Oh, surely not.
It seems like... last week.

800
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,280
And there was a young woman.
I was rubbing her feet.

801
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,866
She was trying to decide
whether or not to have a child.

802
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,325
That was me.

803
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,412
How could that be?
I've never seen you before.

804
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,541
What else do you remember?

805
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,754
What a very odd question.
I remember many things.

806
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,672
Tell me.
I enjoy hearing them.

807
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,091
That doesn't seem
to be the case.

808
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,508
You find fault with
everything I say.

809
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,718
Doctor, don't think that.

810
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,095
You claim you're my friend,

811
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,721
but you don't even
call me by my name.

812
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,222
That's because
you don't have a name.

813
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,224
No name!
That's ridiculous! I...

814
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,644
My...

815
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,480
I demand you tell me
my name.

816
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,068
Wha-What's happening to me?

817
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,073
Captain,
the swarm is gaining on us.

818
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,325
They will be in weapons range
within five minutes.

819
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,911
Battle stations.

820
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,424
TUVOK:
The ships are now
within range, Captain,

821
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,843
but I do not detect
any indication

822
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,427
that they are
powering weapons.

823
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,679
Do you have any idea

824
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,263
what kind of weapon
systems they use?

825
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,183
Negative. Sensors show
no weapons signature at all.

826
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,727
They're only a hundred thousand
kilometers away now.

827
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,021
Arm all phaser banks.

828
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,522
Aye, Captain.

829
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,273
Captain.
Kes, what is it?

830
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,693
The Doctor is getting worse.
He's starting to dematerialize.

831
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,569
I'm afraid we're going
to lose him completely.

832
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,030
I know B'Elanna is busy,

833
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,781
but I wondered if Harry
could take a look at him.

834
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,449
I'm sorry, Kes, but
we're in the middle

835
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,493
of something here and I need
every hand at their posts.

836
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,620
KIM:
Captain, they're only

837
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,456
40,000 kilometers away.
Still no weapons signature.

838
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,209
Changing to evasive pattern
gamma-4.

839
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,794
Sick Bay.

840
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,504
Kes to Sick Bay.

841
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,173
How's the Doctor?

842
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,800
WOMAN:
<i>No improvement.</i>
<i>He's still losing cohesion.</i>

843
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,932
Computer, Deck 6.

844
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,270
Computer, initiate the Jupiter
Station Diagnostic Program.

845
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,273
COMPUTER:
<i>Jupiter Station Program</i>
<i>is activated.</i>

846
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,739
You again.
Now what?

847
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,949
The Doctor's program is
almost completely degraded.

848
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,409
We're going to lose him.

849
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,203
I'm not sure what you
expect me to do about it.

850
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,662
I expect you to help.

851
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,539
That's what you're programmed
to do, isn't it?

852
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,124
I have pointed out
over and over

853
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,543
I am a diagnostic tool,
not an engineer.

854
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,794
You have to try.

855
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,504
You're the only one
who can help now.

856
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,173
Young woman, you don't seem
to understand.

857
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,799
There are limitations
to my programming.

858
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,676
I can't just decide
to exceed them.

859
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,386
The Doctor did,
so why can't you?

860
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,722
You better start trying
because I'm not leaving here

861
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,182
until we accomplish
something.

862
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,809
It...

863
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,772
He... means a great deal
to you, doesn't he?

864
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,815
Yes, he does,
so start thinking

865
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,276
about his memory circuits
his holoprocessors,

866
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,446
his database, his matrix...

867
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,241
Why are you looking
at me like that?

868
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,743
You told me you had
the same matrix as the Doctor.

869
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,703
An adaptive,
heuristic matrix, yes.

870
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,080
In order to serve
as a diagnostic

871
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,623
for all the EMH programs.

872
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,418
Then couldn't your matrix
be substituted for his?

873
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,795
I...

874
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,337
I wouldn't have
thought of that.

875
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,799
But can it?
I'm not sure,

876
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,010
but even
if it were possible,

877
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,554
the same degradation would
eventually occur to my matrix.

878
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,891
What if yours were
grafted onto his?

879
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,517
Grafted?

880
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,772
In medicine, we
sometimes graft

881
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,108
portions of a healthy bone
onto a diseased one.

882
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,735
It gives the bone solidity
until it can heal.

883
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,154
Couldn't we do
something like that

884
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,571
with your matrices?

885
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,449
Well, it would require
synchronous transfer

886
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,119
of all the EMH databases
and subroutines.

887
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,954
Not an easy process,
mind you, but I...

888
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,998
I suppose
we could try.

889
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,958
Good. Let's get started.

890
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,543
I must point out that
you would no longer

891
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,046
have a diagnostic
program for the EMH.

892
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,508
If we don't do this, we won't
have an EMH to diagnose.

893
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,010
Hmm. Good point.

894
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,261
You'll have to return
to Sick Bay

895
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,679
and transfer
my program there.

896
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,055
Thank you,
Dr. Zimmerman.

897
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,640
Don't be premature.

898
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,933
I have no idea

899
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,268
if this is going to work.

900
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,447
Captain, our shield strength
just went to zero.

901
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,740
How could
that happen?

902
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,034
Each one of those little ships

903
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,785
is emitting
an interferometric pulse.

904
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,288
They're modulating in opposition
to our shield frequencies,

905
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,207
completely canceling them out.

906
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,958
All right, that's enough.

907
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,418
Tuvok, give them a phaser sweep
with the forward array.

908
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,171
Don't destroy any of them.

909
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,381
Just let them know we're not
going to sit here like ducks.

910
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,466
Aye, Captain.

911
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,976
What was that?

912
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,062
The interferometric pulses
they're emitting?

913
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,855
They've reflected
the energy of the phasers

914
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,481
right back to us.

915
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,442
Anything we fire is going to
affect us instead of them.

916
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,278
What about a photon torpedo?

917
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,155
Since our shield strength
is nonexistent,

918
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,740
I would not recommend it.

919
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,201
They're only 7,000 kilometers
away and still coming.

920
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:15,621
Harry, start analyzing
those interferometric pulses.

921
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,623
See if there's any pattern,
any code to them.

922
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,458
We might be able to
find a weakness.

923
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,044
I'm on it.

924
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,338
I'm increasingly dubious

925
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,756
as to the outcome
of this effort.

926
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,384
The EMH pathways are
seriously degraded.

927
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,219
They might not accept
a matrix overlay.

928
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,511
We have to try.

929
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,015
Please hurry.

930
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,808
I assure you I am working
as quickly as I can.

931
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,560
If I don't prepare

932
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,021
the multitronic paths properly,
there's no chance of success.

933
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,898
It's going to work, Doctor.
I'm sure of it.

934
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,068
What is?

935
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,444
(<i> sighs</i> )

936
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,653
Very well.

937
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,530
We're as ready
as we'll ever be.

938
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,784
I've programmed the computer
to install<i> my</i> heuristic matrix

939
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,869
onto the EMH primary circuitry.

940
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,913
We'll both have to
be taken off-line

941
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,415
for the overlay
to be made.

942
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,708
After the reinitialization
occurs,

943
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,711
you should activate
the Emergency Medical Hologram.

944
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,630
I understand.

945
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,799
You realize there will be
no second chance.

946
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,801
After this,
I will no longer exist.

947
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,555
Well, it's been
a brief existence,

948
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,100
but apparently a noble one.

949
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,393
Computer,

950
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,646
initiate program
Zimmerman Alpha-1.

951
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,860
COMPUTER:
<i>Matrix overlay program</i>
<i>is active.</i>

952
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,321
<i>Please stand by.</i>

953
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,408
Captain, they're
right on top of us.

954
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,784
I can't shake them.

955
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,670
Captain, they are
clamping onto our hull.

956
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,546
They're starting
to drain our systems.

957
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,216
KIM:
Captain, I've got a pattern
on the interferometric pulses.

958
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,136
It's a lattice connecting
all the ships to each other.

959
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,805
All right, here's what
we're going to do--

960
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,099
turn those pulses
right back on them.

961
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,518
Tuvok, lock phasers
on their nearest ship.

962
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,978
If we can destroy one of them,

963
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,980
there's every chance
the interferometric pulse

964
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,107
that links them together
will cause a chain reaction.

965
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,860
But the phaser fire will be
reflected back toward us.

966
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,488
Harry, modulate
our shield frequency

967
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,531
to an inverse harmonic
of the pulse.

968
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,284
That should allow the phasers
to hit the ship.

969
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,538
(<i> yelling</i> )

970
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,502
Ship's phasers are
locked on a target, Captain.

971
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,184
Tuvok, Harry, do it.

972
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:57,033
TUVOK:
The swarm of ships
has disbanded, Captain.

973
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,951
They are moving away.

974
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,205
KIM:
Shields are back
to full strength.

975
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:05,708
Good work, everyone.
Now let's get out of here.

976
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,544
It seems to be taking forever.

977
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:10,463
That's to be expected.
It's a complex procedure.

978
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,424
Dr. Zimmerman said
he didn't know if our doctor

979
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,259
would be restored to
his original programming

980
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,469
or if he'd regain the memories
of the past two years.

981
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,637
I think, at this point,

982
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,932
we'd be glad
to have him back no matter what.

983
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:24,561
COMPUTER:
<i>Zimmerman program </i>
<i>Alpha-1 is now complete.</i>

984
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,732
Computer, activate emergency
medical holographic program.

985
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,026
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

986
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,112
It worked.

987
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,281
Doctor, I am
so glad to see you.

988
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,616
Are you ill, young woman?

989
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,202
No. N-No,
there's no emergency.

990
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,829
I, uh... I just wanted to see
if you were all right.

991
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,206
It is very irresponsible

992
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,666
to make such frivolous use
of the EMH.

993
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,461
Where's your
Chief Medical Officer?

994
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,669
We don't have one.

995
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,172
Actually, I have
an awful headache.

996
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,550
A headache?

997
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,510
Nurse, tricorder.

998
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,265
<i>You're</i> the nurse?

999
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,559
In a way.

1000
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,149
Humph. This woman has
a mild inflammation

1001
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,358
of the occipital tissues.

1002
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,859
Hardly enough
to complain about,

1003
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,154
but I'm willing to give you
a mild analgesic.

1004
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,072
Thank you.

1005
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,575
Get me the vasoconstrictor
and prepare a hypospray

1006
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,076
with three percent
hydrocortilene.

1007
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,453
Yes, Doctor.
