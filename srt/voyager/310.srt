00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,942
which only grows near
a certain lake on Paxau

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,528
and blooms once
every six years.

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,488
Specialty of the house.

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,072
This is a real place?

10
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:35,661
The Paxau resort
was<i> the</i> place to go on Talax

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:40,123
for serious relaxation and
some, uh, personal pampering.

12
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,333
It was very exclusive.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,878
You had to be rich
and privileged

14
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,087
or know someone
rich and privileged

15
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,840
who owed you a favor.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,092
I'd say if anyone deserves
and needs a little pampering,

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,386
it's this crew.

18
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,137
Don't you feel

19
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:58,099
as if all your cares
are just light-years away?

20
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,060
Yeah, it's nice.

21
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,816
I'm certainly open
to any suggestions

22
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,484
for perfecting the program.

23
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,906
Maybe it could use
a little more, uh...

24

25
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,367
Loosen it up.
Yeah, right.

26
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,244

27
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,788
He's so...um...

And have him serve
Rekarri starbursts all around.

31
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,554
Now what we need around
here are some more people.

32

that be exactly?

00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,729

38
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,444
No wonder your
game's improved.

39
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,863
You know, this would be even
better with more upbeat music.

40
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,657
Computer, access
the cultural database

41
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,910
and create
musicians from...

42
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,828

On my way, Doctor.

TUVOK:
Captain, sensor readings

62
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,789
indicate that radiation
inside the alien vessel

63
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,331
is rising to toxic levels.

64
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,960
The life signs of the passengers
are growing weaker.

65
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,795
Their warp core
is heavily damaged.

66
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,755
It's leaking drive plasma
and gamma radiation.

67
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,381
It could breach any time.

68
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,884
Can we beam the passengers out
through all that radiation?

69
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,219
Not from here.

70
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,429
We'd have to get
within 5,000 kilometers.

71
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,889
At that range,
we'll be at risk

72
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,182
if their
engine core explodes.

73
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,850

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,185
Aye, Captain.

Closing to within

76
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,231
I'm diverting more power

There's still too
much interference.

A little closer, Tom.

Doctor, his heart stopped.

He's not responding
to cardiac induction.

105
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,498
Give him 20 milligrams
of lectrazine.

106
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,919
No effect.

107
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,588
His biochemistry is incompatible
with our medications.

108
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,257
No synaptic activity.

109
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,176
The tissue damage
is too extensive.

110

There's nothing more
I can do for him.

111
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,928
Record the time.

112
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,306

save him!

They chased us
across half the sector.

119
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,207
We were finally able
to fight them off,

120

but not before
our own ship was damaged.

121

Do you know who
was chasing you?

This particular trade route

123

has always been plagued
by mercenaries and thieves.

124
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,548
I'm sure they wanted
to take our ship

125
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,799
and hold us for ransom.

126
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,801
I'm a very
prominent physician

127

of the Autarch.

your help, Captain.

our lives.

I regret that we weren't able
to save your husband as well.

I know your medical staff
did everything they could.

and compassionate

that bringing us home

00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,853
You certainly seem to have
hit it off with our guests.

182
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,189
You've been nearly inseparable
since they got here.

183
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,274
Nori really needs
a friend right now.

184
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,109
I want to be there for her.

185
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,694
So I hope you understand
that I'll be busy

186
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,612
with her and Adin
for the next few days.

187
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,407
We can keep them busy together.

188
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,367
I'll arrange
so many fun activities,

189
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,743
Nori won't have time
to be sad.

190
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,161
We can start
with a lovely picnic...

191
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,454
This is typical

192
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,873
of you, Neelix.

193
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,292
What? Wanting to help?

194
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,753
It bothers you that I'm making
friends of my own.

195
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,963
You always have
to involve yourself somehow.

196
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,592
Why, I...

197
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,011
I certainly don't mean
to intrude on your friendships.

198
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,971
You can spend time
with anyone you want.

199
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,724
As long as I still spend
most of it with you.

200
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,187
No. I...

201
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,689
I'd hope that you
would want to be with me

202
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,483
at least some of the time.

203
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,360
It's not a duty
or an obligation.

204
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,862
Well, sometimes
it feels that way.

205
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,949
If you feel this way,
why haven't you said so before?

206
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,827
Maybe...

207
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,373
I never realized a relationship
could be any different.

208
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,128
I've never been
with anyone but you.

209
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:35,302
It might be
a good idea...

210
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,388
for both of us to spend
some time apart.

211
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,310
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,273
(<i> somber theme playing</i> )

213
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,030
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50348.1.</i>

214
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,241
<i>We've entered orbit</i>
<i>around Ilari</i>

215
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,285
<i>and sent a message</i>
<i>to the Autarch</i>

216
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,329
<i>inviting him to visit the ship.</i>

217
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,457
<i>Instead, he'll be sending</i>
<i>an official representative.</i>

218
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,875
The Autarch
might have taken

219
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,419
a personal interest
in our welfare.

220
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,587
I'm sure he does.

221
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,005
Our message
made it very clear

222
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,756
that you had both
completely recovered.

223
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,384
( door opens )

224
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,219
I'm so glad
you could join us.

225
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,554
Beam our guest aboard.

226
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,143
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway...

227
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,604
( all grunting )

228
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,022
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

229
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,107
Commander,
a phaser has been fired

230
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,317
in Transporter Room One.

231
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,568
Bridge to Janeway.

232
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,902
Emergency
in Transporter Room...

233
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,030
( groans )

234
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,659
They've activated
a security alert.

235
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,076
Seal the door
like I showed you.

236
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,453
( console beeping )

237
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,912
There's a transport
in progress.

238
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,540
Block it.

239
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,667
I'm locked out.

240
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,502
Commander, it's one
of the shuttlecraft.

241
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,629
Someone's beaming
it into space.

242
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,172
They're right
outside the door.

243
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,216
Everyone on
the transporter pad now.

244
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,635
You're sure this is safe?

245
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,179
Maybe you'd rather stay here.

246
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,765
Commander, three people
just beamed to the shuttle--

247
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,018
the two Ilari...and Kes.

248
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,938
Lock on a tractor beam.

249
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,315
I'm trying,
but the shields

250
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,816
around the shuttle
have been altered.

251
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,235
They're scattering
the beam.

252
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,986
Target phasers
at their engine core

253
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,821
just enough
to knock out propulsion.

254
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,365
It's too late.

255
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,701
They've gone to warp.

256
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,167
Set a course
to follow them.

257
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,378
I can't find the shuttle's
warp trail.

258
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,296
There's no sign of them
on long-range sensors.

259
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,507
TUVOK ( over communicator ):
<i>Transporter Room to Bridge.</i>

260
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,593
<i>Ensign Martin and the Ilari</i>
<i>representative are dead.</i>

261
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,095
<i>The Captain is injured and</i>
<i>has been beamed to Sick Bay.</i>

262
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,930
Acknowledged.

263
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,973
It looks like
the shuttle's plasma injectors

264
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,476
were remodulated to suppress
their warp signature.

265
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,852
I wouldn't think
it was possible

266
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,312
to make those adjustments
so quickly.

267
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,440
It takes some incredibly
precise calibrations.

268
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,566
Someone on that shuttle

269
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,817
really knows what
they're doing.

270
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,904
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

271
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,864
They didn't follow us.

272
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,241
Of course not.

273
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,118
They're still trying
to figure out what happened.

274
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,953
What's wrong?
Does your head hurt?

275
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,705
A little.
It's nothing.

276
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,956
Adin should take a look.

277
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,583
I said it's nothing!

278
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,126
You're worse than
that Talaxian.

279
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,793
We're in position
over the encampment now.

280
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,379
Looks like Resh has
assembled the troops

281
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,838
right on schedule.

282
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,758
Four hundred men just waiting
for your orders.

283
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,760
Maybe we should
give them some.

284
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,052
( console beeping )

285
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,221
( whoosh of active transport)

286
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,934
What is this?

287
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,771
Nori, I heard your ship
had been destroyed.

288
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,481
You didn't think I'd let
a little accident

289
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,232
stop me, do you?

290
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,277
That's Tieran?

291
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,446
The host body
you were expecting is dead.

292
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,699
Fortunately, a young nurse
was with me at the right time

293
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,950
and she's provided me

294
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,786
with a very
suitable replacement.

295
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,205
Well, I'm very relieved
you survived.

296
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,375
Oh, I'm sure you are,
at least for your own ambitions.

297
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,753
I want you to advance my troops
to the northern ridge.

298
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,588
But we<i> can't</i> go ahead
with the attack

299
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,465
now.

300
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,216
Are you questioning my orders?

301
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,260
This is insane.

302
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,720
We've spent years
planning this--

303
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,806
every move, every detail,

304
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,223
and now, suddenly

305
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,559
our leader's been reduced
to a little girl?

306
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,978
I've been exploring the mind
of this little girl

307
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,064
and I've discovered some rather
interesting abilities.

308
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,733
She had barely begun
to tap into them.

309
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,068
It's a good thing I came along,
so all that wasted potential

310
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,530
could be turned
to a greater purpose.

311
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,324
Now, should I continue
the demonstration

312
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,202
or do I have your loyalty?

313
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,705
You shall have it...

314
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,997
sir.

315
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,542

JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50351.4.</i>

317
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,630
<i>We're holding a meeting</i>
<i>with Demmas,</i>

318
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,549
<i>the Autarch's eldest son</i>
<i>and heir,</i>

319
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,259
<i>in an effort to understand</i>
<i>the recent hostile activity.</i>

320
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,221
DEMMAS:
I'm sure they really wanted
to kill my father.

321
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,098
He's the one they invited
up to your ship.

322
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,894
Nori and Adin are known
to be political extremists.

323
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,230
How could Kes
be involved?

324
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,815
I may be able
to explain that.

325
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,066
You mentioned
that she was

326
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,193
with the third patient
when he died?

327
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,986
That's right. Why?

328
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,531
I believe your crew member
has been inhabited

329
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:10,201
by the consciousness of a very
dangerous man named Tieran.

330
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,204
Who is that? What does
he want with Kes?

331
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,165
Oh, I know exactly
what he wants--

332
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,209
to overthrow
my family's government

333
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,670
and to reinstate himself
as the Autarch.

334
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,213
He has held title before?

335
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,341
Tieran ruled Ilari
over two centuries ago.

336
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,344
He was a war hero,
a brilliant military leader.

337
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,971
He brought security
and stability

338
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,933
during a difficult time
in our history.

339
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,936
But in peacetime...

340
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,689
he began to treat
his own subjects as enemies.

341
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,815
He became convinced everyone

342
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,650
was a potential
traitor.

343
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,194
CHAKOTAY:
At some point, your people
must have rebelled.

344
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:49,115
They did, led by one
of my ancestors.

345
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,034
They laid siege to the
Imperial Hall for over a year,

346
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,203
and the city around it
was burned to the ground,

347
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,873
but Tieran was finally defeated.

348
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,041
And yet, you believe
that he,

349
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,836
or at least his consciousness,
has survived.

350
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:06,591
During his reign, he became
obsessed with his own mortality.

351
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,469
He spent most of his time
and Ilari's resources

352
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,680
searching for ways
to overcome death.

353
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,768
Somehow, he's discovered a way
to transfer his own mind

354
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,519
into someone else's body

355
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,272
as he's done
with Kes.

356
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,150
So he's been controlling her.

357
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,611
Yes. Completely.

358
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,070
But she...

359
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,907
<i>he</i> knew things
about Kes's life.

360
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,451
He acted enough like
Kes to fool us all.

361
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:37,371
The real Kes must still
be in there somewhere.

362
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,999
Tieran may have access to her
memories and her feelings,

363
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,293
but the Kes you know...

364
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,754
is lost.

365
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,506
I'm very sorry.

366
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,511
I'm not prepared
to accept that yet.

367
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,137
Examine the body
of the man who died.

368
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,807
We need more information
about how the transfer works

369
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,351
if we want to get Kes back.

370
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,561
DEMMAS:
That's certainly worth
exploring, Captain,

371
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,647
but our priority must be
to stop Tieran

372
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,898
by force if necessary.

373
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,900
<i>Voyager</i> is a powerful ship.

374
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,819
You may be considering force,

375
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,029
but my only intention
is to rescue Kes

376
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,698
and remove Tieran's
consciousness.

377
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,240
That should serve
both our interests.

378
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,910
You don't understand
what's at stake here, Captain.

379
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,578
You must help me
to defend my people.

380
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,664
PARIS ( over communicator ):
<i>Bridge to the Captain.</i>

381
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,957
Go ahead.

382
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,583
<i>We've located</i>
<i>the missing shuttle.</i>

383
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,918
On my way.

384
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,880
Let's hope we can put an end
to this right now.

385
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,255
They entered orbit

386
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,216
then dropped their shields
and cut their engines.

387
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,468
KIM:
There's a residual trace
of transporter activity.

388
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,845
It looks like
four people beamed

389
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,388
from the shuttle
to the surface.

390
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,473
They're in the main chamber
of the Imperial Hall.

391
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,767
Lock onto those patterns
and beam them back to<i> Voyager.</i>

392
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,561
I can't. Some kind
of interference

393
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,145
has gone up around
the whole structure.

394
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,105
He's after my family.

395
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,442
My father and brother
are down there.

( solders groaning )

398
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,704
Ah, the venerated Autarch.

399
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:03,041
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

400
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,334
( grunts )
Father! Aah!

401
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,627
Where's his brother?

402
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,128
I don't know.
He should have been here.

403
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,589
Get him out of here!
Lock him up.

404
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,924
I think I've located
the brother.

405
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,508
According to security logs,

406
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,886
Demmas was transported
to<i> Voyager</i> over an hour ago.

407
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,262
He's going to be a problem,

408
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,973
but we'll have to deal
with him at another time.

409
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,266
Give me the talisman.

410
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:30,068
This was stolen from me
200 years ago,

411
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:34,655
and I've dedicated every moment
since to putting it back...

412
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,117
where it belongs.

413
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,703
Loyalty and service
to the new Autarch.

414
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,914
Loyalty and service.

415
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,458
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,631
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

417
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,217
TIERAN:
I want you to pay a visit

418
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,095
to my supporters
in the Yaro province.

419
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,639
Give them all new titles,
whatever I promised.

420
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,307
And, of course,

421
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,726
I couldn't overlook
your faithful service.

422
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,687
I think the title
First Castellan

423
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,440
suits you very well.

424
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,776
I feel like I've finally
come home again,

425
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,152
but it's hardly
as I left it.

426
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,323
My portrait should
be hanging here.

427
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,992
As for the rest
of this nonsense,

428
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,996
it's nothing more
than a useless display of wealth

429
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,706
as if the first Autarch
needs to impress anyone.

430
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,501
I want it all
cleared out of here!

431
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,004
Everything should look as it did
during my reign.

432
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,473
(<i> slow theme playing</i> )

433
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,276
I trust you'll take
care of all that.

434
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,031
And we'll need some
new servants, too.

435
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,116
What is it?
You don't look happy.

436
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,494
I'm happy that we've
accomplished our goal,

437
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:08,624
but... there have been
some unexpected changes

438
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,752
and I don't know how they'll
affect our future together.

439
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,714
I don't even know
if I'm still your wife.

440
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,509
Forgive me.

441
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,802
I haven't considered

442
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,721
how unsettling
this must be for you.

443
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,930
Don't worry.

444
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,807
You know how much
I depend on you.

445
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,809
Your loyalty
and encouragement

446
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,978
have helped make
this victory possible.

447
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,606
I'll share
everything with you,

448
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,151
just as I always promised.

449
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,569

Now I'm afraid I have
business to attend to.

452
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,703
Leave him here.

453
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,496
Everyone else is dismissed.

454
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,546
Ameron, you and I
haven't had a chance

455
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,923
to get acquainted.

456
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,174
I'm Tieran.

457
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,508
Tieran?

458
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,386
I like the way you say that.

459
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,304
You and I didn't get off
to a very good start, did we?

460
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,766
You murdered my father
right in front of me.

461
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,809
I shouldn't have
let you watch that.

462
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,895
I'm sorry. But his death
was necessary

463
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,064
to make room
for his successor.

464
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,315
Demmas is the rightful heir,
not you.

465
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,527
How many times have people said
the very same thing to you?

466
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,447
It must have been hard
to hear every day.

467
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,032
The constant reminder

468
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,284
that your brother
is destined to be ruler

469
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,954
just because he was lucky
enough to be born first.

470
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,456
I don't think
that's fair, do you?

471
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,125
It's the law.

472
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,375
Doesn't have to be.

473
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,128
It can change.

474
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,838
Demmas is off hiding
on some alien ship

475
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:42,760
and you're here...with me.

476
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,180
I'm sure it's an opportunity
you've always dreamed of--

477
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,474
to prove that you're
really the natural leader

478
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,517
and not just a weak
copy of your father.

479
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,064
Now you can have that chance,

480
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:59,026
<i>if...you're willing</i>
<i>to take it.</i>

481
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,905
You mean if I join you.

00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:06,242
We have so much
to offer each other.

483
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,411
Your heritage would
help solidify my claim,

484
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:16,252
and in return, I could
give you power, real power

485
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,922
to control the lives
of millions of people

486
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,715

00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,301
punish your enemies.

Everything you want
can be yours for the asking.

Everything.

490
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,854
After what you've done?

491
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,647
That's all in the past.

492
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,775
You should be thinking
about the future.

493
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,695
Would you rather
be a martyr

494
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,822
to your brother's cause...

495
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,991
or rule by my side?

This coup attempt is turning
my people against each other.

502
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,716
They're splitting
into factions--

503
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,343
mine and Tieran's.

504
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,845
Whom does the law recognize
as Autarch?

505
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,891
Officially, I inherited my
father's title upon his death,

506
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,894
but this isn't
a matter of law.

507
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,146
It's about loyalty.

508
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,023
Some people will follow
whoever has more power,

509
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,067
and right now,
that's Tieran.

510
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,902
He's gaining support every day.

511
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,905
He's already recruited
some of my less-reliable allies,

512
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:29,783
which...may include...

513
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,452
my brother Ameron.

514
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:36,623
Your brother?
I assumed he'd been killed.

515
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,251
So did I,

516
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,837
until I learned otherwise
from sources on Ilari.

517
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,924
Tieran spared his life,

518
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,219
no doubt in order
to win his loyalty.

519
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,764
Ameron's always been
easily swayed.

520
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,349
And you believe
he would betray you?

521
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,641
That's very possible.

522
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,476
And if he does,

523
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,479
there will be no way
to avoid a civil war.

524
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,232
I must strike now

525
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,483
before Tieran
is fully prepared.

526
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,527
There are always
alternatives to war.

Before you send
in your fleet,

528
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,115
I suggest we hear
from the Doctor

529
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,075
and consider the possibility

530
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,077
of removing Tieran
from Kes safely.

531
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,539
I've identified
the transfer mechanism.

532
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,917
This cortical implant
was automatically activated

533
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,252
at the moment of death.

534
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,629
It enhanced
Tieran's neural pattern

535
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,258
and sent it out
along the peripheral nerves.

536
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,719
The actual transfer took place
through these

537
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,012
bioelectric microfibers.

538
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,140
When they came
in direct contact

539
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,809
with Kes, they transmitted
Tieran's pattern

540
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,437
up through her nervous system
and into her brain.

541
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,189
I assume Tieran would implant
a device like this

542
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,400
in his new body
as quickly as possible.

543
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,526
Perhaps we can use
that to our advantage.

544
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,112
My thoughts exactly.

545
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,863
This synaptic stimulator

546
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,949
will tap into the implant
in Kes's body

547
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,201
and remove
the alien neural pattern.

548
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,203
Then her own consciousness
can take over.

549
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,038
Yes, but how close
would you have to get

550
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,332
to use this device?

551
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,208
To be fully effective,
it would have to

552
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,626
come in direct contact
with her skin.

553
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,129
If I could get
anywhere near her,

554
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,174
I'd use a thoron rifle
to be absolutely sure.

555
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,675
Not if you want my help.

556
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,302
Kes is still a member
of this crew

557
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,012
under my protection.

558
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,056
I'm very sorry she got caught in
the middle of this, Captain,

559
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,933
but too many other
innocent lives

560
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,936
have already been lost,
including my father's.

561
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,980
Then let's work together
to prevent any more deaths.

562
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,564
Don't risk the lives
of your soldiers

563
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,276
until you've exhausted
every option.

564
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,736
What exactly do you suggest?

565
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,073
If Tieran is anticipating
an attack by your fleet,

566
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,075
he may not be guarding
as carefully

567
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,120
against an individual
infiltrating the Imperial Hall.

568
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,747
I believe I would be able to
get close enough to Kes

569
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,458
to use the Doctor's device.

570
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,668
Your knowledge
of the hall and its defenses

571
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,670
would be invaluable
to us.

572
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,051
All right,
we'll try your strategy.

573
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,222
The new cortical implant
looks fine.

574
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,724
Let me just make sure
it's connecting properly

575
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,309
to the nerve pathways.

576
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,436
Do something about these
headaches while you're at it.

577
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,397
They make it difficult
to concentrate.

578
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,981
That's an entirely
different problem.

579
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,441
This body isn't accepting

580
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,402
your neural pattern
very easily.

581
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,945
She wasn't a willing host
like the others.

582
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,781
She's been resisting
me, all right.

583
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,451
I can feel her in the back
of my mind somewhere

584
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,371
like a trapped animal
rattling her cage.

585
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,997
She has a lot of spirit.

586
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,416
It's invigorating.

587
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,667
Your neural pattern
may become unstable

588
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,421
if you stay in this host.

589
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,131
Now that we've got
the transfer mechanism in place,

590
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,385
I suggest you use it to move
into a more compatible body.

591
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,803
No. I like this one

592
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:41,100
particularly the unique mental
abilities that come with it.

593
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,560
Consider the risks.

594
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,603
Do you really think
a child like this

595
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,481
poses any threat to me?

596
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,568
I've been fighting worse battles
since the day I was born.

597
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,028
When the doctors said I wouldn't
live past my first year,

598
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,612
I proved them wrong.

599
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,031
Even when my parents thought

600
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,242
I was too sickly
to be worth caring for,

601
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,618
I survived on the streets.

602
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:04,123
Even when my own ungrateful
subjects forced me into exile,

603
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,417
I refused to accept defeat!

604
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,461
I certainly won't surrender
to this little girl!

605
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,753
You will not

606
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,922
suggest it again!

607
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,092
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

608
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,930
Demmas has acquired
two more ships.

609
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,723
There are reports
that his fleet is massing

610
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,933
behind the fifth moon.

611
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,478
We should make
a preemptive strike.

612
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,522
Not on the basis
of an unsubstantiated rumor.

613
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,982
Let him come to us.

614
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,108
We'll be ready.

615
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,818
I'm told that
the Viceroy of Denar

616
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,487
is ready to give you
his support

617
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,363
in exchange
for more territory.

618
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,365
When did corruption
become so commonplace?

619
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,993
My people are crying out
for moral leadership.

620
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,454
I should make an example
out of this viceroy.

621
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,500
What's wrong?

622
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,252
There's someone.

623
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,920
Tieran?

624
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,341
There's a familiar presence
in this room...

625
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,843
not any of you.

626
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:01,888
Someone from this body's
previous life.

627
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:05,142
Someone she knew well.

628
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,811
Seal the room.
We have an uninvited guest.

629
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,605
Everyone, stay
where you are!

630
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,814
Who is it?

631
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,191
Someone very good

632
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,318
at concealing himself
and his thoughts.

633
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,612
A disciplined logical mind.

You made it this far
without being detected,

but you didn't realize

637
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,539
how much more perceptive
I've become.

638
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,582
Typical Vulcan arrogance.

639
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,792
It's touching, really,

640
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,128
your concern for the life
of your little student,

641
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:37,007
risking yourself in
a hopeless effort to save her.

642

Get that off.

644
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,307
Are you all right?

645
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,684
Yes, I'm fine,

646
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,394
and still perfectly
in control of this body.

But my compliments on
your clever medical technology.

You know that I won't provide
you with any information.

I had no assistance.

What will Janeway do
when you don't come back?

Send someone else?

Join Demmas
in an assault?

661
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,475
I have no knowledge
of the Captain's plans.

662
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,768
She must
have discussed

on this mission.

She did not.

666
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,489
I suppose
I could threaten you...

667
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,658
or torture you...

668
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,952
but I doubt that would
make any difference.

669
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,662
You are correct.

670
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,623
Fortunately, I have
other options now.

it's a simple matter

and, of course,
there's anger.

00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,757
There are times
when he's weaker.

708
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,425
I can almost
break through.

709
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,637
Tap into his strengths
and make them your own.

710
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,472
I'm losing hold.

711
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,724
I am with you.

712
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,225
Don't let go.

713
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,393
No!

714
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,269
( groaning )

715
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,732
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

716
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,778
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50361.7.</i>

717
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,321
<i>Lieutenant Tuvok</i>
<i>hasn't reported</i>

718
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,865
<i>for our scheduled rendezvous</i>

719
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,949
<i>and we've been unable</i>
<i>to contact him.</i>

720
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,285
<i>We're now considering</i>
<i>other, more forceful, options.</i>

721
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,287
Our team will beam down
to the surface

722
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,248
approximately two kilometers
from the palace.

723
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,541
Demmas
and his advanced guard

724
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,917
will meet us there.

725
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,711
Captain, I request permission
to go with you

726
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:01,961
on the rescue team.

727
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,548
Now, I had basic
combat training

728
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:08,510
on Talax.
All right, v-very basic.

729
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,095
But I've also
been participating

730
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,764
in technical exercises
with this crew

731
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,056
every month.

732
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,808
I have a lifetime
of experience

733
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,184
thinking on my feet

734
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,853
and you know I'll do
everything in my power

735
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,273
to make this mission
a success.

736
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,191
Consider yourself drafted.

737
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,443
The detection grid

738
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,152
will make a surprise
attack difficult.

739
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,404
PARIS:
Well then, we'll have

740
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,114
to find a way to
knock out the grid.

741
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,032
KIM:
I've been scanning
it for weaknesses.

742
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,242
The system goes through

743
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,827
a maintenance cycle
every ten hours.

744
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,995
There are a few seconds
when it might be vulnerable

745
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,748
to a narrow-band
EM pulse.

746
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,458
MAN ( on communicator ):
<i>Bridge to the Captain.</i>

747
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,668
<i>You have an incoming</i>
<i>transmission from the planet.</i>

748
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,795
Put it through.

749
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,088
TIERAN:
<i>Captain...you failed.</i>

750
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,632
What do you mean?

751
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,508
<i>I'm still in control.</i>

752
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,552
<i>Your little device was useless,</i>
<i>and Tuvok is my prisoner.</i>

753
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,805
<i>I suggest you call off</i>
<i>your new rescue mission</i>

754
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,641
<i>before you lose</i>
<i>any more members of your crew.</i>

755
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,017
You've made
a bad guess, Tieran.

756
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,145
There will be
no more rescues.

757
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,314
<i>My "guess" is</i>
<i>that you've discovered</i>

758
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,858
<i>the convenient weakness</i>
<i>in the detection grid.</i>

759
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,568
<i>If you attempt</i>
<i>to take advantage of it,</i>

760
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,528
<i>I'll have twice as many</i>
<i>soldiers waiting for you.</i>

761
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,196
If this was meant
to be a trap,

762
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,406
why tell us about it?

763
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,950
<i>I'm really not a monster.</i>

764
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,868
<i>I have no quarrel with</i> Voyager.

765
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,286
<i>Your crew did save my life once</i>

766
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,204
<i>when my ship</i>
<i>was about to explode.</i>

767
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,456
<i>I haven't forgotten that.</i>

768
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,749
(<i> groans )</i>

769
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,169
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

770
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,963
<i>This has been</i>
<i>a friendly warning, Captain,</i>

771
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,923
<i>but it's the last one.</i>

772
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,508
<i>Now, I strongly suggest</i>

773
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,760
<i>that you accept your losses</i>
<i>and be on your way.</i>

774
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,637
<i>You have 30 seconds</i>
<i>to leave orbit.</i>

775
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:39,100
Send two of my warships
to intercept<i> Voyager.</i>

776
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,353
( groaning )

777
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,688
You're not well.

778
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,440
<i>If</i> you can't do anything
about this pain,

779
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,819
then leave me alone.

780
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,111
You need to get some sleep.

781
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,113
No. She's there
when I sleep.

782
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,365
She?

783
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,574
Kes!

784
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,159
Who else?

785
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,119
You can't stay awake
for the rest of your life.

786
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,663
The<i> Voyager's</i> leaving orbit.

787
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,748
Let them go.

788
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:06,920
Yes, sir, but...
with all due respect, why?

789
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,006
Demmas is on that ship.

790
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,884
Our warships are in position
to destroy it.

791
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,135
I told them
they could go

792
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,054
and I keep my word.

793
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,475
I don't have to explain
myself to you.<i> Get out!</i>

794
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,478
Everyone! Clear
the room now.

795
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,994
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

796
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:52,007
You're losing, Tieran.
Why won't you admit it?

797
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:56,428
I will admit
that you've surprised me.

798
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,514
Who would have imagined
that such fierce determination

799
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,435
existed within that
deceptively frail body?

800
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,771
Don't continue
to underestimate me.

801
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:10,067
Release me...
or I'll force you out.

802
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:14,404
My dear,
why should we be enemies?

803
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,448
Why waste the energy in conflict

804
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:20,243
when we could achieve
so much more by cooperating?

805
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,912
You're contemptible, Tieran.

806
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,956
I won't be any part
of your plans.

807
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,498
You're already a part of them.

808
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,794
You and I have killed together,
remember?

809
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:33,548
And you will continue
to serve my will.

810
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,759
You really have no choice.

811
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,511
Wouldn't it be wiser
to join me?

812
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,472
To take advantage of all I have

813
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,390
to offer?

814
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,228
You may find that you
enjoy having power.

815
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:53,359
I assure you, it is the
finest aphrodisiac there is.

816
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,072
That may work with others,
but it won't with me.

817
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,700
So, you insist on
making this a battle?

818
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,077
How foolish.

819
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,037
It's a battle I intend to win.

820
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,914
Brave words.

821
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,458
You've been an annoyance to me,
nothing more.

822
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,043
I have been
more to you than that

823
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,210
and you know it.

824
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,921
I'm fighting you
with every bit

825
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,133
of strength I have
and it's wearing you down.

826
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,635
You're becoming more
unstable every day.

827
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,886
The headaches alone

828
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,763
are almost more
than you can stand.

829
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,223
I've suffered
pain all my life.

830
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,977
It's going to take more
than headaches to stop me.

831
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,437
I know all about
your life.

832
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,189
I know about your suffering.

833
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,233
It doesn't justify
what you've become.

834
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,944
You're a monster, Tieran,

835
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,279
and I have
no compassion for you.

836
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,865
And I don't ask for any.

837
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:43,326
What I need from you
I already have--

838
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,329
your body and your mind.

839
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:50,042
You may have my body,
but you'll never have my mind.

840
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,417
I won't surrender it.

841
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,754
You may resist and try to fight
me,

842
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,799
but eventually
I will defeat you.

843
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,300
I haven't existed

844
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,470
for two centuries
to be brought down by a child.

845
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,847
You're already deteriorating

846
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,306
and it's only
going to get worse.

847
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,726
I'll find every little crack
in your defenses.

848
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,561
You'll feel yourself
crumbling from within,

849
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,188
your sanity slipping away.

850
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:14,024
I won't stop until
you're broken and helpless.

851
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:17,194
There's nowhere you can go
to get away from me.

852
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:21,531
I'll be relentless
and merciless, just like you.

853
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,159
( gasping )
What are you doing?

854
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,535
You were is such a deep sleep,

855
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,245
I had to use a stimulant
to bring you out of it.

856
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,288
Your neural stress readings
are extremely erratic.

857
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,832
This has gone too far.
You must transfer

858
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,291
out of this body
before it destroys you.

859
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,793
I told you not to say
that ever again.

860
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,003
As you can see,

861
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,089
I'm in full command
of my faculties.

862
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:41,634
This momentary lapse will pass,
and I'll be stronger than<i> ever.</i>

863
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,011
( gasps )

864
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,345
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

865
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,680
Stronger than ever!

866
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,059
Stronger than ever.

867
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,605
Stronger than...

868
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,028
My friends, we have much
to celebrate tonight.

869
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,280
Our recent victory,
the consolidation of power

870
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,365
among those
who are loyal to us,

871
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,618
and the fact that Ilari
is poised on the brink

872
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,913
of what will be
its greatest era of prosperity.

873
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,874
But there's another occasion
that's cause for celebration--

874
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,794
one that is perhaps
the most joyous of all.

875
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,421
I'd like to present
my husband-to-be.

876
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,382
MAN ( whispers ):
Husband to be?

877
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,802
( crowd chattering )

878
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,138
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

879
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,311
Don't be upset.

880
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,980
It's only
a political alliance.

881
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,440
Ameron will help bring the
support of Demmas' troops.

882
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,444
Oh, tell me you
still love me.

883
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,988
You know I love you.

Ameron.

886
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,870
And Nori.

887
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,206
You have both been
essential to my success

888
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:56,042
and I want you
to be close friends.

889
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:03,008
I want us all to be
very...very close.

890
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,552
Nori, don't make me
doubt your loyalty.

891
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,929

892
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,181
I'm not listening
to you!

RESH:
Sir!

894
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,017
Enemy ships are approaching--

895
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,518
at least 20.

896
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,062
It's Demmas' fleet...
and<i> Voyager.</i>

897
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,648
I assume my ships are
moving to intercept them?

898
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,399
Yes, but we are
outnumbered!

899
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,152
I've always fought
against the odds.

900
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,653
My fleet will defeat them.

901
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,531
All the same, I recommend
taking some precautions.

902
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,285
We should get you
to the reinforced shelter.

903
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:33,038
This is a celebration
to announce my marriage.

904
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,374
I won't allow Demmas to make me
run like some frightened animal!

905
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,293
Join us.

906
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,171
Food and drink
for my First Castellan.

907
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,800
I told you to join us.

908

Drink! Eat!

909
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,557
I want all of you
to enjoy yourselves.

910
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,600
My charitable projects--
how are they progressing?

911
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,394
When do we break ground
for the new library?

912
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,520
Soon.

913
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,855
Good! I want
the people to know

914
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,273
that I have their
welfare at heart.

915
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,317
Tomorrow, we'll
send out an edict.

916
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,277
Every citizen
must have a garden.

917
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,528
A garden?

918
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,863
I love plants.

919
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,074
Flowers-- anything
that grows.

920
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,992
Some of the times
I felt most content

921
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,036
were those spent watching
the seedlings grow

922
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,246
in the airponics...

They've made it
through our defenses.

926
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,213
They're sending down
ground forces.

927
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,006
That's impossible.
You're lying.

928
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,299
I'm sending
additional troops

929
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,633
to their defensive
positions.

930

Activating full
security measures.

931
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:33,098
That ought to hold them off,
but we have to go-- now!

932

Anyone who tries
to leave this room

933
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,850
will be shot as a traitor!

934
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,018
Look for yourself!

936
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,479
This has to be a trick--
a ruse of some kind.

937
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,774
That's what they're doing.
They're creating a distraction

938
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,650
to draw my attention
away from their real plan.

939
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,902
Tieran, please!
They're coming!

940
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,820
They must have sent an
infiltrator.

941
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,072
We have an intruder!

No time for

Stay with me.

Still here.

You must fight it, Tieran.
Please! Keep fighting!

Do you have the device ready?

He's still here.

He moved on

before you used this.

990
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,316

Your thoughts

Visualize yourself
floating above them.

I can't.

1003
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,413
I've been using the meditations
you've taught me,

1004

but they're not helping.

1005
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,082
You must be patient

1006
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,626
and allow yourself
sufficient time.

1007

when...so many people
have suffered and died?

1011

You were not responsible
for Tieran's actions.

I can't help wondering whether
I could have fought harder.

It was your absolute refusal
to surrender

1014
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,939
which defeated him.

You cannot ask more
of yourself than that.

You cannot.

This experience
