00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:06,924
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

2
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,401
Hello?

3
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,907
Anybody here?

4
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,161
Neelix?

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,915
ALL:
Surprise!

6
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,124
Surprise!

7
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,710
Happy birthday,
my sweet.

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,671
Happy birthday, Kes.

9
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,423
Imagine. Two years
old today.

10
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,885
If you ask me, you don't
look a day over one.

11
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,511
( all laughing )

12
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,304
Why was everyone hiding?

13
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,932
Oh, it's an old Earth custom
called a surprise party.

14
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,433
Sorry if we
startled you.

15
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,101
No, I liked it.

16
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,311
It was very exhilarating.

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,897
NEELIX:
Now,

18
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:06,817
how about a glass
of my special birthday punch?

19
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,360
Garçon?

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,905
On the rocks or straight up?

21
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,823
Doctor,
I'm so glad

22
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,115
you're here.

23
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,492
My new bartender.

24
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,869
Handsome, isn't he?

25
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,454
I'm here in an official
capacity, of course--

26
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,957
in case of
a medical emergency.

27
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,166
Emergency?

28
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,919
Surprises have been
known to cause

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:28,714
acute hyperventilation,
esophageal spasms

30
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,800
and in extreme cases,
even coronary arrest.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,510
One can never be too careful.

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,387
( accordion playing
in background)

33
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,722
( chuckling)

34
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,395
I've completed the sensor
diagnostic, Lieutenant.

35
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,313
All systems are
fully operational.

36
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,274
Very good, Ensign.

37
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,110
And I've recalibrated
the accelerometer relays.

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,112
Acknowledged.

39
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,574
Is there anything else
I can do for you, sir?

40
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,286
I presume
this notable impatience

41
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,496
is due to your desire
to attend the festivities

42
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,790
in Holodeck 2.

43
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,999
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,835
May I remind you
that your duty shift

45
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,713
does not officially terminate
for another 34 minutes.

46
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,216
However,

47
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,176
I believe
the holodeck power conduits

48
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,429
would benefit
from a routine inspection.

49
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:21,016
Yes, sir, I'll get right on it.

50
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,309
All stop.

51
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,269
Mr. Kim.

52
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,396
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

53
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,148
What is that?

54
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,025
Magnify.

55
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,156
I'm afraid
that holodeck inspection

56
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,617
will have to wait, Ensign.

57
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:42,079
Wait till you taste this cake.

58
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,539
Seven layers
of Jimbalian fudge,

59
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,335
and the icing is made
from pureed<i> l'maki</i> nuts--

60
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,628
Kes' favorite.

61
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,047
Now make a wish and
blow out the candles.

62
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,632
Well, what do I wish for?

63
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,136
Anything your<i> petite coeur</i>
desires,<i> ma chérie,</i>

64
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:00,555
and with a figure like hers,
she'll probably get it, too.

65
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,849
( all giggling)

66
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,517
Okay, I wish for--

67
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,226
Don't tell us.

68
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,938
The wish has to be a secret
if it's going to come true.

69
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,441
( accordion playing
in background )

70
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,821
( crowd applauding )

71
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,699
I hate to interrupt this
tender little moment, Tommy boy,

72
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,910
but don't you think
it's about time we shot a rack?

73
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,121
In a minute.

74
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,916
Birthday gifts are also
an Earth tradition.

75
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,751
Oh, thank you, Tom.

76
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,045
You didn't have to.

77
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,211
Hey, who am I

78
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,964
to fly in the face
of tradition?

79
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,976
Tom, it's beautiful.

80
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,229
It must have cost you a week's
worth of replicator rations.

81
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,815
Two weeks, actually,
but who's counting?

82
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,151
I'm just glad
you like it.

83
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,237
May I?

84
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,115
Oh. It's lovely.

85
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,408
You see, it's a locket.

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,326
You put little photographs
in here.

87
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,536
It keeps

88
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,455
the people you love
close to your heart.

89
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,332
Thank you.

90
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,626
Did you see that?

91
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,878
See what?

92
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,213
He...

93
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,131
he...

94
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,341
he did a lovely wrapping job,
don't you think?

95
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,761
TUVOK ( on communicator):
<i>Bridge to Janeway.</i>

96
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,387
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

97
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,348
<i>Captain, we've encountered</i>
<i>an unusual phenomenon...</i>

98
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,726
( echoing):
<i>phenomenon... phenomenon...</i>

99
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,478
<i>phenomenon...</i>
<i>phenomenon...</i>

100
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,481

101
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,151
( louder):
<i>phenomenon...</i>

102
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,029
<i>phenomenon... phenomenon...</i>

103
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,868
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

104
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,013
TUVOK ( loudly):
<i>Phenomenon... phenomenon...</i>

105
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,098
( loudly):
What is going on, Lieutenant?

106
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,351
It might simply be
a localized malfunction,

107
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,353
but I've never heard
anything like it.

108
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,603
My guess is...

109
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,938
( noise stops)

110
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,982
It's a problem with
the com system itself.

111
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,441
Janeway to Bridge.

112
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,736
Get down to Engineering
and run a diagnostic.

113
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,780
I'm afraid we're going to have
to cut your party short, Kes.

114
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,200
Stations, everyone. Let's move.
But-- but--

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,077
What about
the Jimbalian fudge cake?

116
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,704
Save me a slice, won't you?

117
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,999
( sighs softly)

118
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,710
KIM:
These readings indicate
the space ahead of us

119
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,170
is literally changing shape.

120
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,963
A best guess is it's some type

121
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,673
of spatial
distortion wave.

122
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,676
Is the anomaly responsible
for the com system malfunction?

123
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,637
I think so. It's generating
intense pulses of EM radiation,

124
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,390
and if we don't
get out of its way,

125
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,850
it's going to intercept us
in less than ten minutes.

126
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,644
Acknowledged.
Full reverse, Ensign.

127
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,105
WOMAN:
Aye, sir.

128
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,148
We can't go backwards, either,
Mr. Tuvok.

129
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,277
The distortion has completely
surrounded us, like a ring.

130
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,653
If we cannot go around it,

131
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,406
then we will have
to go through it.

132
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,908
There's no telling
what that would do to the ship.

133
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,659
From what you have told me,
Ensign,

134
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,621
the distortion ring will make
contact with us momentarily

135
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,915
whether we attempt
to pass through it or not.

136
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,918
I prefer to minimize the amount
of time that contact lasts.

137
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,336
Shields at maximum.

138
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,589
Warp three. Engage.

139
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,759
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

140
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,387
The distortion ring
has collapsed the warp field.

141
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,222
Engines are off-line.

142
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,768
Find the Captain
and inform her of our status.

143
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,061
Yes, sir.

144
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,534
Ensign Kim, I've
been trying to report

145
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,786
a problem in the gym,

146
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,621
but the com system
seems to be down.

147
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,373
We've encountered
a spatial distortion.

148
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,042
It knocked out several systems.
Maybe that's why

149
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,086
the gym was cold.
Cold?

150
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,006
I didn't notice it at first,
I was working out so hard.

151
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,300
Then I realized it was
under 10 degrees C.

152
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,927
The environmental controls
didn't respond to my commands

153
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,805
and neither did the com system.
Engines are off-line, too.

154
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,974
I'm looking for the Captain
to let her know what's going on.

155
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,642
Should I report
to my duty station?

156
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,060
Might not be a bad idea.

157
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,229
Until we find out
exactly what's going on,

158
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,439
everybody should be on standby.

159
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,317
I'll round up
my security team.

160
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,197
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

161
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,366
The first thing I want to do
when we get to the Bridge

162
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,701
is establish a remote com link
to Engineering.

163
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,703
I want to know exactly
what's going on.

164
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,413
Aye, Captain.

165
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,622
Where are we?

166
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,500
Deck 4.
( sighs)

167
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,377
If the com system's
malfunctioning,

168
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,670
the computer could be
misreading our voice commands.

169
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,048
That might explain why it took
us here instead of the Bridge.

170
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,885
We'd better try setting
the controls manually.

171
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,098
Did you enjoy your first
surprise party, sweeting?

172
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,850
It was wonderful.
Thank you.

173
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,063
I thought you'd like it:
the cake, the presents.

174
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,399
What was your favorite part?

175
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,025
I suppose what
I liked best

176
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,818
was that all
my friends were there.

177
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,529
Ah, that was nice,
wasn't it?

178
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,906
And don't forget
that beautiful necklace

179
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,367
Tom Paris gave you.

180
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,868
Do you really like it?

181
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,370
Oh, why wouldn't
I like it?

182
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,247
Paris obviously has
excellent taste.

183
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,583
I was afraid you might be
a little jealous.

184
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,792
Who, me?

185
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,462
Ha, ha. Oh,
don't be silly.

186
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,713
Are you sure?

187
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,258
You, my dearest,
have seen the last

188
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,885
of that green-eyed pus hog
called jealousy.

189
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,803
I'm glad.

190
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,891
Of course, Paris did
replicate that locket,

191
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:04,187
whereas I baked the Jimbalian
fudge cake from scratch.

192
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,397
( chuckles)

193
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,648
These aren't my quarters.

194
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,901
Did we take a wrong
turn somewhere?

195
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,153
I was just
following you.

196
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,573
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

197
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,455
( crowd chattering )

198
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,209
Is everything all right,
Lieutenant?

199
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,086
This isn't Engineering.

200
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,303
And have someone
take a look

201
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,721
at the turbolift voice
receptors, Commander.

202
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,223
Aye, Captain.

203
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,391
This is Engineering.

204
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,725
What's going
on here?

205
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,060
Looks like we're dealing

206
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,396
with more than just
a com system malfunction.

207
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,022
Computer, Bridge.

208
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,347
Baxter, what are
you doing here?

209
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,598
I wish I knew.

210
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,517
I'm trying to get
to the cargo bay.

211
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,768
And I'm trying to get
to Engineering.

212
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,854
I can't find the cargo bay,

213
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,606
and I can't find
my security team.

214
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,233
I've been wandering around
for about ten minutes.

215
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,402
Well, at least I
know I'm not crazy...

216
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,903
unless we both are.

217
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,864
No. Something very strange
is going on.

218
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,783
Ensign Kim said we'd encountered
a spatial distortion.

219
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,410
Did he say what kind?

220
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,078
No, and he went to find
the Captain.

221
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,289
The Captain is on her
way to the Bridge,

222
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,458
but if she's having
the same trouble we are,

223
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,627
who knows if she
can get there.

224
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,045
( sighs)

225
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,673
I'm going to keep trying
to get to Engineering.

226
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,007
Good luck.

227
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,973
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

228
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,352
( accordion playing )

229
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,858
The holodeck again.

230
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,109
Aha!

231
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,277
This is infuriating.

232
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,072
Ah, stop playing
games,<i> mon chéri.</i>

233
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,990
I know why you keep
coming back to work

234
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,117
even though your
bartending shift is over.

235
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,869
Ha, ha. It's to see
me, of course.

236
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,996
How many times
do I have to tell you, madam?

237
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,707
Oh!
I am a doctor, not a bartender.

238
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,209
Of course,
you are. Ha, ha.

239
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,504
( accordion playing
in background)

240
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,882
Doc?

241
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,967
Ensign Kim.

242
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,261
I was just, uh...

243
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,137
Playing doctor.

244
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,389
( clearing throat)

245
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,266
Hi.

246
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,017
( whispering):
Hi.

247
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,937
DOCTOR:
The Captain and the others
went to investigate

248
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,147
the phenomenon
Mr. Tuvok reported.

249
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,109
So all of you heard his report
before the com system failed?

250
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,902
Only a fraction of it.

251
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,905
Well, I'm sure Tuvok's filled
them in with the rest by now.

252
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,408
What are you still doing
on the holodeck, besides

253
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,825
playing doctor,
that is?

254
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,161
For your information,
I have been attempting

255
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,080
to transfer myself
back to Sick Bay,

256
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,082
but each time I try,
I reappear here.

257
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,542
That's strange.

258
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,044
DOCTOR:
Not to mention
extremely irritating.

259
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,922
I can't seem to shut down Mr.
Paris' holo-program either.

260
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,007
Computer, end holodeck
program Paris 3.

261
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,217
( computer beeps)

262
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,011
Computer, arch.
( computer beeps )

263
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,847
KIM:
Either the holo-emitters
are malfunctioning,

264
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,309
or the computer's not accepting
voice commands.

265
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,061
I'm sorry, Doctor, I don't have
time to help you right now.

266
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,354
Wait just a minute.
Hmm?

267
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,189
Where do you think
you're going?

268
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,609
I've got to get back to
the Bridge. We're in a crisis.

269
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,944
All the more reason I should
be back in Sick Bay.

270
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,988
I'm sure that the Captain
and the others

271
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,699
will be able to do without you
for a few more minutes.

272
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,992
I guess you're right.

273
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,536
I'll have a look
at the holo-controls.

274
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,955
( sighs)

275
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,339
Kyoto's quarters.

276
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,884
Nicoletti.

277
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,721
Hargrove.

278
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,848
Ayala.

279
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,519
None of those are anywhere
near my quarters.

280
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,771
This is Deck 8. That's where
your quarters are.

281
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,565
But Hargrove and Ayala
are on Deck 7.

282
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,899
Nicoletti is on 4,

283
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,985
and I think Kyoto is on 6.

284
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,364
How do<i> you</i> know where
everyone's quarters are?

285
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,366
I just remember.

286
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,660
Remember from what?

287
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,287
Have you<i> been</i>
in all their quarters?

288
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,039
Of course not.

289
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,958
The point is, those quarters
can't all be on the same deck.

290
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,380
Well, see for yourself.
This can't be.

291
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,131
Perhaps, sweeting,
your memory

292
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,342
isn't as reliable
as you think.

293
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,510
This is impossible.

294
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,345
I know Hargrove
is on 7.

295
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,264
Why Hargrove?

296
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,766
What?

297
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,477
Why are you so sure
about Hargrove's quarters?

298
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,230
What makes him... so special?

299
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,939
He's not special.

300
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,526
I just remember
where his quarters are.

301
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,902
This way.

302
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,154
It has to be this way.

303
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,532
( grunts)

304
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,116
( growls softly)

305
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,580
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

306
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,039
Harry.

307
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,000
B'Elanna, shouldn't you
be in Engineering?

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,252
What are you
doing here?

309
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,337
Just answer one question,
Starfleet.

310
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,547
Where is here?

311
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,883
What?
Where am I?

312
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,551
Outside Holodeck 2.

313
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,386
Are you feeling okay?

314
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,097
I have been walking in circles
for the past 20 minutes

315
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,724
trying to get to Engineering.

316
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,768
NEELIX:
Kes, my sweet,
you have many

317
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,644
wonderful attributes.

318
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,647
Your sense of direction
is not one of them. I...

319
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,483
Oh, uh, Harry, B'Elanna,
maybe you can help us.

320
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,485
I know you'll find
this hard to believe,

321
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,571
but we can't seem to find
Kes' quarters.

322
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,364
( door opens )

323
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,828
I don't suppose

324
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,205
anyone here knows
the way to the Bridge?

325
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,794
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

326
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,715
Let me get this straight--

327
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,885
this distortion ring
has completely immobilized us.

328
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,595
We have
no means of communication

329
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,889
with the Bridge
or any other part of the ship,

330
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,265
and no matter where any of us

331
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,600
have tried to go--

332
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,894
the Bridge, Engineering,
Kes' quarters--

333
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,480
we've all eventually
ended up here.

334
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,065
Right back at Deck 6.

335
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,444
The Bridge is on Deck 1.
Engineering is on Deck 11.

336
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,029
Deck 6 is halfway
in between, right?

337
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,323
So?

338
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,700
So, if we're being
surrounded by this ring,

339
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,202
maybe it's pushing us all
to the center of the ship.

340
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,580
But it's not just that
we're being led back here.

341
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,499
I mean, rooms are
in the wrong place.

342
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,709
Is it possible that
this distortion ring

343
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,588
is somehow changing
the layout of the ship?

344
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,548
There is another
possibility.

345
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,550
Exposure to some types
of EM radiation

346
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,093
has been known
to cause

347
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,846
hallucinations.

348
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,306
Perhaps it's not the ship
that's undergone changes

349
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,224
but rather
your perception of it.

350
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,602
Unfortunately,
without my medical equipment

351
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,229
to analyze your optic nerves,
there's no way to tell.

352
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,315
We'll never figure it out
sitting here.

353
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,818
We need more information
about this phenomenon--

354
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,736
sensor readings,
computer analyses.

355
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,197
We have to find a way
back to the Bridge.

356
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,574
If we can't get back on foot
or on the turbolift,

357
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,910
maybe we can rig
a site-to-site transport--

358
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,912
beam ourselves
to the Bridge.

359
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,164
We'd have to get
to a transporter room first.

360
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,499
Or to Engineering.

361
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,626
Wherever that is.

362
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,294
When we tried to go
to the Bridge,

363
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,380
one of the places
the turbolift took us

364
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,089
was Engineering.

365
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,759
Maybe if we repeat our steps,
it'll take us back there.

366
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,052
It's worth a shot.

367
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,347
Lieutenant Paris,
you're with Torres.

368
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,058
Maybe we can get to the Bridge
through a Jefferies tube.

369
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,019
If I remember my ship specs
correctly,

370
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,855
there should be an emergency
access conduit which leads

371
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,900
directly from this deck to
Deck 1, right behind the Bridge.

372
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,485
I'd like to keep trying
to get to the Bridge on foot.

373
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,030
If the ship has been
reconfigured somehow, I can get

374
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,657
a deck-by-deck picture of what
it looks like as I go.

375
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,868
What's going to keep you
from getting lost?

376
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,161
I'll get a tricorder
from the storage locker,

377
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,039
rig it to emit
a photoplasmic trail.

378
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,624
Right. We should all
get tricorders.

379
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,834
Set them on active scan,

380
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,669
gather as much information
as we can

381
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,504
about what's happening
to the ship.

382
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,090
May I request that Kes be
allowed to stay here with me?

383
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,803
Besides helping stave off the
predatory advances of that...

384
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,138
...woman, she may be able
to help me find a way

385
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,307
to transfer myself
back to Sick Bay.

386
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,684
NEELIX:
And, uh,

387
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,687
I'll assist
Commander Chakotay, Captain.

388
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,272
As you may have heard,

389
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,984
my tracking skills are legendary
throughout the quadrant.

390
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,152
That all right with you,
Commander?

391
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,032
Mr. Kim, I'm with you.

392
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,199
Let's do it.

393
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,953
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

394
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,495
KES:
Be careful.

395
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,748
TORRES:
Are you sure

396
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,499
this is how you
got there before?

397
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,293
Relax, will you?

398
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,170
So far,
we're right on schedule.

399
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,756
The next stop should be...

400
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,509
...Voila. Engineering.

401
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,303
Finally.
Let's get to work.

402
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,722
We've got an emergency situation
on board ship.

403
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,266
I don't have time to go into
details, but you're all

404
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,769
to remain at your posts
until otherwise notified,

405
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,813
whether or not
your duty shifts are over.

406
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,482
Ensign, prepare to configure
transporter systems

407
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,942
for a site-to-site transport.

408
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,277
I've got to reset
the pattern buffer controls.

409
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,489
In the meantime, why don't you
check the targeting scanners?

410
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,661
Crewman...

411
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,914
there's a-an emergency situation
aboard ship.

412
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,458
Just...
stay right where you are.

413
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,293
That's an order.

414
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,888
I think you handled that
very well, Lieutenant.

415
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,069
Commander,
I would imagine

416
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,114
you've had some
experience with women.

417
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,365
( chuckles)

418
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,658
Some.

419
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,785
Oh, come now! Ha!

420
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,914
A... a... a handsome man like
you.

421
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,791
I bet women find
you irresistible.

422
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,668
( clears throat)

423
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,047
Neelix,
what's this about?

424
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,255
Uh...

425
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,842
um... uh...

426
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,678
have you... uh...

427
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:24,264
have you...ever been jealous?

428
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,685
Of course.

429
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,269
You have?

430
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,689
I imagine most people
who have been in love

431
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,858
have been jealous
at one time or another.

432
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,152
I see!

433
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,321
I-It's a perfectly
normal response.

434
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,450
Then why...
why is it so unpleasant?

435
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,831
Jealousy's about the fear
of losing someone we love.

436
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,709
There's no pain
greater than that.

437
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,882
Neelix...

438
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,094
are you afraid you're going
to lose Kes to someone?

439
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,386
No.

440
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,389
I mean, I-I-I
don't think so.

441
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,392
At least, I
certainly hope not.

442
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,644
I-I... I just
can't seem to stop

443
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,939
these awful feelings.

444
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:17,317
Nothing makes us more vulnerable
than when we love someone.

445
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,987
We can be hurt very easily.

446
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,280
But I've always believed

447
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,365
that what you get
when you love someone

448
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,576
is greater than what you risk.

449
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,829
Commander, am I ever glad to see
you. Do you have any idea

450
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,497
what's going on?
Not exactly.

451
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,332
Well, I feel like I've been
wandering around for hours.

452
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,918
I can't find
the cargo bay.

453
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,878
Have you seen anyone else?
Any more of the crew?

454
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,256
Some people roaming around
like me.

455
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,299
A couple of times
I wound up in the Mess Hall.

456
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,759
There were quite
a few people there.

457
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,219
I suggest
you make your way back.

458
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,887
Tell everyone you run into
to come with you,

459
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,639
and all of you stay put
in the Mess Hall.

460
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,015
When we figure out

461
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,433
what's going on,
we'll let you know.

462
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,561
Aye, Commander.

463
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,065
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

464
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,860
Gentlemen.

465
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,696
Tuvok,
what are you doing here?

466
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,531
That is an interesting
question, Commander.

467
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,699
I am not certain

468
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,326
how I arrived
at this location.

469
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,661
You're lost, too.

470
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,037
Indeed.

471
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,331
When I received no word
from you or the Captain,

472
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,167
I left Lieutenant
Ayala in command

473
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,960
and came to look
for you myself.

474
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,795
Can you lead us back
to the Bridge?

475
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,630
I do not believe so.

476
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,548
When I first
realized I was lost,

477
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,634
I attempted to
retrace my steps,

478
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,136
only to find
myself here.

479
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,513
None of us has been able
to reach the Bridge.

480
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,932
In fact, Neelix and I
can't seem to get off Deck 6.

481
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,560
Strange. I thought
we were on Deck 3.

482
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,356
What was our status
when you left the Bridge?

483
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,151
The ring has penetrated
our shields

484
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,652
and is now in
direct contact

485
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,987
with the hull.

486
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,114
Then maybe it is possible
the distortions

487
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,991
are somehow
reconfiguring the ship.

488
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,408
As improbable as it sounds,

489
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,494
that would appear
to be the case.

490
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,454
Neelix, let's go.

491
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,084
Neelix.

492
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,892
I don't understand it.

493
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,853
We should have found the hatch
to the Bridge 10 minutes ago.

494
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,771
I feel like
we're crawling in circles.

495
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,691
But we haven't-- at least not
according to this tricorder.

496
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,942
( tricorder beeping)

497
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,153
Odd!
What is it?

498
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,446
A very faint
electromagnetic reading.

499
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,575
Now it's gone.

500
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,577
There it is from
another direction.

501
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,870
Yeah, I'm getting it, too.

502
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,080
It comes and goes.

503
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,956
Jumps from place to place.

504
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,625
Could it be evidence
of the ship's reconfiguration?

505
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,877
Possibly.

506
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,379
We'll have to
compare this data

507
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,215
with readings
the others get.

508
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,549
Harry?

509
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,301
Yes, ma'am?

510
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,427
I just want
you to know...

511
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,513
you've been one
of the bright spots

512
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,765
of this whole mission.

513
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,558
You've exceeded
any expectations

514
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,768
I might have had of you.

515
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,396
Thank you, Captain.

516
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,815
I... I appreciate that.

517
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,194
( rapid beeping)

518
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,071
Wait a minute.

519
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,572
Down there.

520
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,950
I think that's the conduit
leading to the Bridge.

521
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,159
Good work.

522
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,704
Maybe now we'll get
some answers.

523
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,123
That's the hatch,
Captain.

524
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,125
This should let us out
in the cargo hold

525
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,459
directly behind the Bridge.

526
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,296
It's not working.

527
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,505
We'd better try it
manually.

528
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,347
( grunting)

529
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,766
It's stuck.

530
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,976
Oh!

531
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,019
Oh...

532
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,146
Captain!

533
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,648
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

534
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,234
( Janeway whimpering)

535
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,238
( grunts)

536
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,908
I... c-can't...

537
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,161
get my arm out.

538
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:59,832
Oh! Oh...

539
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,670
Oh...

540
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,630
( grunting)

541
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,720
I think I'm okay.

542
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,182
( recorder beeping, blipping )

543
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,226
I'm reading an intense
electromagnetic charge

544
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,560
on the other side of that hatch.

545
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,313
That must have been
what was pulling you in.

546
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,482
It's as if everything
on the other side

547
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,234
is in a state
of structural flux--

548
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,944
the walls, the atmosphere...

549
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,946
And the sequence
of those fluctuations

550
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,366
matches the readings
from the distortion ring.

551
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,909
This phenomenon isn't just
occurring in space.

552
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,162
It's definitely inside the ship
as well.

553
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,663
We're going to have to regroup

554
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,124
and come up with a plan
for combating this thing.

555
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,959
( grunts softly)

556
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,503
Captain, what's wrong?

557
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,754
I don't know.

558
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,423
Oh...

559
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,258
Oh, my eyes...

560
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,510
Captain?

561
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,844
Captain!

562
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,471
( groaning)

563
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,849
Come on, pal,
one lousy game.

564
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,518
I'll spot you
six balls.

565
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,520
I'm not programmed
to play games.

566
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,188
If he won't play pool
with you,

567
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,605
and he won't
make love to me,

568
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,149
then as far
as I'm concerned,

569
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,026
he can mop the floor.

570
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,528
You see these hands?

571
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,820
These are surgeon's hands,

572
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,571
created
by the most sophisticated

573
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,657
computer imaging technology
available.

574
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,576
They do not play games,
and they do<i> not</i> mop floors!

575
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,037
Then you are fired.

576
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,788
I will find
a new bartender.

577
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,291
I really wish you would.

578
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,876
Doctor...

579
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,461
Please tell me
you've had some success

580
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,129
in reinitializing
the holo-emitters.

581
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,257
I did exactly what you told me,
but it didn't work.

582
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,133
Of course not.
I'm starting to get worried

583
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,052
about Neelix. What's
taking them so long?

584
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,013
Ah, trust me,<i> chérie.</i> You are
better off without him.

585
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:42,226
All men are alike. In the end,
they always break your heart.

586
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,019
KIM:
Can I get some help here?

587
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,563
DOCTOR:
What happened to her?

588
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,565
She came into contact
with the spatial distortions

589
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:48,732
in the Jefferies tube.

590
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,317
She seemed fine
for a couple minutes,

591
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,736
but then she started to fade
in and out of consciousness.

592
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,621
I believe we should
go this way, Commander.

593
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,291
W-What makes
you say that?

594
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,918
If we are indeed trapped
in some sort of labyrinth,

595
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,963
then the logical course is
to systematically eliminate

596
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,966
all routes which do not lead us
to our desired destination.

597
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,927
The route that remains
will be the correct one.

598
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,430
Since we have been making
a series of right turns,

599
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,765
we should continue to do so
until we are certain

600
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,434
this path is not
the proper one.

601
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:27,605
There's a flaw in your logic.
How so, Commander?

602
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,315
You're assuming
there's a logical pattern

603
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,941
to this maze we're caught in,

604
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,692
but so far I haven't seen
any evidence of that.

605
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,778
Even within chaotic systems,

606
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,072
there is a pattern
of limited predictability.

607
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,074
By the time we figure
that pattern out,

608
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,035
these distortions may have
completely overrun the ship.

609
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,621
That is a possibility.

610
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,872
The important thing is
for at least one of us

611
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,458
to make it back to the Bridge.

612
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,667
So why don't you go your way,
and I'll go mine.

613
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,212
That way, we'll increase
the chances that one of us

614
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,382
will be successful.
As you wish, Commander.

615
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,896
Tell me something, Tuvok.

616
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,608
What does your logic tell you
about navigating a maze

617
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,360
that's constantly
changing shape?

618
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,197
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

619
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,448
Scanners check out.

620
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,116
Then we're ready
to give it a try.

621
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,202
Activate the auxiliary
pattern buffers.

622
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,702
Pattern buffers
activated.

623
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,913
Targeting the Bridge
coordinates.

624
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,124
Scanners locked.

625
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,378
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

626
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,421
Energize.

627
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,230
Would you mind moving
your foot, Tommy boy?

628
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,440
It's blocking my shot.

629
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:58,696
Tell me you already
made it to the Bridge,

630
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,573
and you've come back here
to give us a status report.

631
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,241
We locked on to the
Bridge coordinates,

632
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,410
but<i> this</i> is
where we ended up.

633
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,453
None of you
had any luck either?

634
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,330
Not only has no one been able
to reach the Bridge,

635
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,956
but the Captain
came into contact

636
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,585
with the spatial distortion
and is now unconscious.

637
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,960
CHAKOTAY:
That's not all.

638
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,212
We lost Neelix too.

639
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,589
Lost him?

640
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,425
He turned a corner,
and he was just gone.

641
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,428
We think the spatial distortions
are continuously changing

642
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,388
the configuration
of the corridors.

643
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:25,764
Kes must be
worried sick.

644
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,725
KIM:
And it isn't
just Neelix

645
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,059
who's missing.

646
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,519
Where's the rest
of the crew?

647
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,853
It is likely that they, too,

648
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,813
are trapped
in other parts of the ship,

649
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,816
cut off from communication and
unable to find their way out.

650
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,151
So, what do we do now?

651
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,028
This wave is obviously causing

652
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,698
some kind of radical
reconfiguration of the ship.

653
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,157
We've got to try to reverse it.

654
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,785
If not, we may never be
able to get to the Bridge.

655
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,330
How are we supposed to reverse
something we don't understand?

656
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,291
No matter where we go,
we end up here.

657
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,875
Corridors
are realigning,

658
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,711
rooms are
in the wrong place...

659
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,338
What's the pattern?
We would certainly benefit

660
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,341
an accurate picture of what
the ship currently looks like.

661
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,176
That way we would have
a better chance

662
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,886
of getting
where we want to go.

663
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,846
Maybe we could
make a map.

664
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,557
Ensign?
One good thing

665
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,601
about all the wandering
we've been doing

666
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,186
is that we've been collecting
a lot of tricorder data

667
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,481
about the structural changes
taking place.

668
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,232
And if we fed
all that information

669
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,943
into the central database,
the computer might be able

670
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,113
to extrapolate a schematic of
the ship as it's configured now.

671
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,364
What are we
waiting for?

672
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,701
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

673
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,706
KIM:
The computer has analyzed
all our tricorder data,

674
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:37,127
so this ought to be pretty close
to what it looks like now.

675
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,130
BAXTER:
It's as if the entire ship
is being compressed

676
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,674
and twisted.

677
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:45,177
My guess is, it's more
than just a distortion ring.

678
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:48,221
It looks like some sort
of spatial implosion

679
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,182
that's slowly
crushing us.

680
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,269
CHAKOTAY:
Look-- this part of the ship

681
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,688
seems unaffected.

682
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,356
That's Deck 6,
where we are.

683
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,150
Correct, Ensign. However,
the area we are occupying

684
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,444
will not remain
unaffected indefinitely.

685
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,321
How long?

686
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,990
Based on the rate
of implosion thus far,

687
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,908
I estimate the ring
will crush Deck 6

688
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,829
in approximately 68 minutes.

689
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:26,802
Is this implosion ring
some kind of weapon?

690
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,220
Are we under attack?

691
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,847
Who'd want
to attack us and why?

692
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,516
There is no clear evidence
of an intelligence

693
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,060
behind the phenomenon.
It is still possible

694
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,604
we are dealing with
a naturally occurring anomaly

695
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,273
which does not conform
to the known laws of physics.

696
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,109
It's too late to be speculating
on who or what this thing is.

697
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,654
The important thing now
is that we find out some way

698
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,989
of stopping it.
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna's right.

699
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,783
It seems to me we've
got two options:

700
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,744
one, we find a way
to get ourselves out

701
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,328
of this implosion ring,
or two,

702
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,996
we find some way
of reversing it.

703
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,916
Invert the effect. Turn
the implosion into an explosion.

704
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,710
Exactly.

705
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,003
If I can get back to
Engineering, I may be able

706
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,631
to generate a shock pulse strong
enough to do just that.

707
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,551
I'd have to raise warp core
pressure to near-critical.

708
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,262
Starting a subatomic particle
shower all over the ship.

709
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,055
Which could set off
a chain reaction

710
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,725
that would cause not only
the ring to explode outward

711
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,184
but<i> Voyager</i> along with it.

712
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,896
Not if I can precisely tune
the shock pulse

713
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,939
to the distortion frequency
of the ring.

714
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,024
That will be
exceptionally difficult.

715
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,276
If we don't give this a try,

716
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,027
we're going
to get crushed anyway.

717
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,363
Personally, I'd rather
go down fighting.

718
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,783
I must remind you
that with the com system down,

719
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,911
we will have no effective means
of alerting the rest of the crew

720
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,995
to a potentially lethal
particle shower.

721
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,206
Do you have another suggestion,
Mr. Tuvok?

722
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,583
I believe it would be safer

723
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,252
to attempt to access
the navigational array

724
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:46,172
and from there engage thrusters
to steer us out of the ring.

725
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,216
Can't we try both?

726
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,176
It's much too dangerous
to have someone working

727
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,178
at the navigational array
during a shock pulse.

728
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,097
Besides,
this ship is so contorted,

729
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,434
there's no reason to expect we'd
have<i> any</i> navigational control.

730
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,061
All right, B'Elanna, let's give
your plan a shot. You--

731
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,564
TUVOK:
Commander Chakotay.
Yes, Lieutenant?

732
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,567
I must point out that in
my many years of experience

733
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,193
as Captain Janeway's
technical officer,

734
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,613
she often demonstrated
a tendency to follow--

735
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,323
In case you hadn't noticed,

736
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,200
Captain Janeway's not in any
condition to make decisions.

737
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,369
I'm in command.
Is that understood?

738
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,246
Yes, sir.

739
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,623
Good.

740
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,083
B'Elanna, you and Harry
get down to Engineering.

741
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,710
Evacuate whoever's on duty.

742
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,545
Then initiate the warp pulse.

743
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,798
Move it.

744
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:34,763
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

745
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,389
Dilithium matrix stable.

746
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,725
Matter/antimatter reactor
is at 80 percent of critical.

747
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,226
Let's keep it that way!

748
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,270
Warp core pressure is at
36 megapascals and rising.

749
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,565
When it reaches 53,
it'll trigger the shock pulse.

750
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,818
We should get out of here
by the time it hits 50!

751
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,110
Acknowledged.

752
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,821
Pressure at 41 megapascals
and rising.

753
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,948
I'm reading a micro-fracture
in the dilithium matrix.

754
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:56,618
Attempting to compensate.
Fracture sealed.

755
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,870
44 megapascals!

756
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,622
( deep rumbling)

757
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,207
They're heating up
the warp core.

758
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,334
They must be close
to initiating the shock burst.

759
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,127
Everybody, take cover.

760
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,174
47, 48, 49!

761
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,759
Let's move!

762
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,430
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

763
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,851
( explosion)

764
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,359
Well, in spite
of Tuvok's dire predictions,

765
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,403
we haven't blown the ship
to pieces, have we?

766
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,739
No, and radiation levels are
within acceptable tolerance.

767
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,657
Good. Let's get in there
and see if we had any luck

768
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,784
dispersing
this implosion ring.

769
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,954
Hold it.
What?

770
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,040
I'm reading a massive distortion
behind the door.

771
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,624
I don't think

772
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,459
it's just<i> behind</i> the door.

773
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,170
The ring's completely
engulfed Engineering.

774
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,929
Can I talk to her?

775
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,180
I can't guarantee
she'll hear you

776
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:04,102
or be able to understand you
if she does.

777
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,979
Captain.

778
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:14,112
Talk... can't.

779
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,447
What's wrong with her?

780
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,365
It's possible
the spatial distortions

781
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,492
have damaged
her speech center.

782
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:23,162
( distorted and slow):
But without my equipment,
I can't analyze...

783
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,791
(<i> normal speed</i> ):
...her neural pathways.

784
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,877
Chakotay,
it didn't work.

785
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,837
Instead of forcing
the implosion outward,

786
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,922
the pulse is
drawing it in

787
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,172
at a faster rate.

788
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,674
You're saying
it made things worse?

789
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,301
I don't think we have
more than a few minutes.

790
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,929
Paris, we have to get
to the navigational array

791
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,639
and give Tuvok's plan a try.

792
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,141
I'm afraid there's no
longer time for that.

793
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,603
Why not?

794
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:50,107
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

795
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,110
We're not going anywhere.

796
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,418
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

797
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,339
Do you really think
it's possible to project

798
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,133
a stable holographic
force field?

799
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,968
We've tried
everything else.

800
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,218
Ready?

801
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,014
Here we go.

802
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,939
The distortion is unaffected

803
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,732
by the force field.

804
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,068
We've got to figure out a way
to generate a stable field.

805
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,612
B'Elanna, this ring has passed
through the shields,

806
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,447
crushed the hull,
twisted the ship.

807
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,699
We'll never get enough power

808
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,241
from the holo-emitters
to stop it.

809
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,577
What are you saying,
we're out of options?

810
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,748
Perhaps not. So far we have been
unsuccessful in all our attempts

811
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,168
to either explain or combat
this phenomenon,

812
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,003
and according
to my calculations,

813
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,880
the space
we are currently occupying

814
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,008
will implode in approximately
three minutes, 17 seconds.

815
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,843
You said there was
another option.

816
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,888
We do nothing.

817
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,263
Excuse me?

818
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,265
Are you suggesting we
just let it crush us?

819
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,226
Precisely.
( scoffs )

820
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,353
I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you.

821
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,605
I agree-- it sounds
completely illogical.

822
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,066
On the contrary.

823
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,651
When every logical
course of action is exhausted,

824
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,486
the option that remains
is inaction.

825
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,238
So we're just supposed
to sit here

826
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,407
and let this thing kill us?
I must point out

827
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,243
that at least one attempt
we made to reverse the effect--

828
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,871
the shock pulse--
only made our predicament worse.

829
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,665
If we continue desperately
improvising solutions,

830
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,625
our own efforts
may ultimately kill us.

831
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,128
On the other hand,
there is no definitive evidence

832
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,839
to suggest that doing nothing
will result in death.

833
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,926
It's...talking...to...me!

834
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,886
Do nothing.

835
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,097
Captain, please lie down.

836
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,099
What about the Captain?

837
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,349
She's dying.

838
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,935
We do not know that.

839
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,895
At the moment,
she is merely delirious.

840
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,856
Chakotay,
you're in charge here.

841
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,275
Don't you agree
we've got to keep trying?

842
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,112
Whatever this thing is,
B'Elanna, it's bigger

843
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,488
and more powerful
than we are. Maybe--

844
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,785
Maybe this is one bear
we can't wrestle to the ground.

845
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,287
Maybe like Tuvok says,
there's nothing we can do

846
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,581
but let it happen
and hope for the best.

847
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,088
( sighs)

848
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,840
( scoffs)

849
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,093
Fine.

850
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,511
Fine, Chakotay.

851
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,931
Have it your way.

852
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,733
Commander Chakotay.

853
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,193
Yes, Mr. Tuvok?

854
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,444
I want to thank you

855
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,404
for endorsing my
recommendation.

856
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:47,533
You know, Tuvok, I may not get
another chance to say this.

857
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,829
Sometimes I find you
arrogant and irritating,

858
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,081
but you're a hell of an officer.

859
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,043
Thank you, sir, and since
we are speaking candidly,

860
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,212
may I say, sir,
that I have not always been

861
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,547
particularly partial
to your methods either.

862
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,508
I suppose it must
have been tough for you

863
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,303
to accept my being elevated
to First Officer over you.

864
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:09,347
I have always respected
Captain Janeway's decisions.

865
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,225
However, I suppose
that particular decision

866
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,312
did put me in a position
I am unaccustomed to.

867
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:18,397
If that ever caused me to make
things more difficult for you,

868
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,317
I must apologize.

869
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,657
(<i> faint theme playing</i> )

870
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,834
KIM:
Can I ask you a question?

871
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,419
Fire away, Harry.

872
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,505
Are you afraid?

873
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,926
I chose this life,

874
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:51,306
and I guess I always knew
it could come to this...

875
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:55,185
but, yeah, I'm afraid.

876
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,939
Me, too.

877
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,482
I'm so worried
about Neelix.

878
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,943
I should be with him.

879
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:08,781
As much as he may...
annoy me at times,

880
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,784
Mr. Neelix is one
of the most resourceful

881
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,288
and resilient individuals
I know.

882
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:20,377
If anyone can survive
this calamity, he can.

883
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,735
TORRES:
Hi.

884
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,696
Hi.

885
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,990
What are you doing?

886
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,994
I'm trying to contact
my spirit guide.

887
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,746
Why?

888
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,539
Who knows
what's going to happen

889
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,792
when that ring hits us?

890
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,961
We might be in
for another long journey.

891
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,299
I guess I could use

892
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:10,802
a little spiritual guidance
myself right now.

893
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,720
You mind if I join you?

894
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,974
I thought you'd never ask.

895
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,393
( sighs)

896
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,730
( Janeway moaning)

897
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,234
Captain?

898
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,989
I'm all right.

899
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,201
You were delirious.

900
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,870
It was...

901
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,580
some sort of message.

902
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,707
What was?

903
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,835
The spatial distortion.

904
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,630
It was...

905
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,426
trying to communicate with us.

906
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:18,388
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

907
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:21,349
I want a full
systems report,

908
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,394
and Mr. Kim, Mr. Tuvok,
I want every iota of information

909
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,812
that was recorded
regarding that phenomenon.

910
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,274
The distortion ring
is directly ahead, Captain.

911
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,359
It's moving away from us
at 2,000 kph.

912
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,028
We've got a full crew
complement, Captain.

913
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,405
No injuries reported.

914
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,656
No damage to the hull
or ship's systems.

915
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,742
Incredible.

916
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,911
You're not going
to believe this, Captain,

917
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,414
but 20 million gigaquads
of new information

918
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,624
have been input
into the ship's computer.

919
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,543
Where did it
come from?

920
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,963
My guess is, it came
from the distortion ring.

921
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,673
Somebody's definitely trying
to tell us something.

922
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,217
That's not all, Captain.

923
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,970
Our entire database has been
copied and downloaded

924
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,930
into somebody else's system.

925
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,557
I guess whoever
they were,

926
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,059
they want to know everything
they can about us, too.

927
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:11,149
Maybe it was their only way
of communicating with us.

928
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,526
Maybe...

929
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:17,113
they were just trying
to say "hello."

930
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,906
NEELIX:
Cake anyone?

931
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,492
Neelix, what
happened to you?

932
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,410
Oh, it's a long story.

933
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,246
I'll tell you
all about it later.

934
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,707
Right now, it's time
to finish your party.

935
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,835
Neelix, I need
a photograph of you.

936
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,170
What for, sweetie?

937
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,506
From now on, even
when we're separated,

938
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:37,425
I want to have you where
I can keep an eye on you.

939
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,803
Happy birthday, Kes.
