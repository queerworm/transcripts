00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,611

(<i> garbled voice</i> )

11
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,656
(<i> garbled message continues</i> )

12
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,534
<i>...this message, study...</i>

00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,494
<i>We have...</i> 
(<i> message cuts off</i> )

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,787
What happened?

15
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:37,913
KIM:
I'm not sure.

16
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,915
The transmission
just... stopped.

17
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:40,958
Locate the source.

18
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,459
See if you can
get it back.

19
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,252
It looks like...

20
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,046
Captain,
the transmission was sent

21
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,008
along the same network
of alien relay stations

22
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,050
we used to send the Doctor
to the Alpha Quadrant.

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,387
Starfleet Command must be
using them just like we did.

24
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,890
Harry, can you clear the
interference from that message?

25
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,891
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,141
They said they
wouldn't stop

27
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,685
until they found
a way to get us home.

28
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,395
TUVOK:
Nonetheless, we can't assume

29
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,522
they've been able to devise
a plan this quickly.

30
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,817
They're communicating with us.
That's a big step.

31
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,903
Okay, I've reprocessed
everything we received.

32
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,613
I've cleared out most
of the interference. Here it is.

33
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,576
<i>This is Starfleet Command</i>
<i>to the USS Voyager.</i>

34
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,870
<i>If you are receiving</i>
<i>this message,</i>

35
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,247
<i>please study it carefully.</i>

36
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,623
<i>We have information...</i>

37
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,959
KIM:
That's all we got.

38
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,753
It looks like the bulk
of the transmission

39
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,421
is lodged in one
of the relay stations.

40
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,797
Can you tell
which one?

41
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,550
It's about 3.8
light-years from us

42
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,762
on a heading of 274 mark 13.

43
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,055
Set a course, Tom.

44
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,723
Last time we used one
of those stations,

45
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,558
the people who built
it weren't too happy.

46
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,060
We'll deal with that
if we have to,

47
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,811
but I'm not going to lose
this opportunity.

48
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,899
We're going to find out what
the rest of that message says.

49
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,401
(<i> staticky</i> ):
<i>This is ... Command</i>
<i>to the USS</i> Voyager.

50
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,237
<i>If you are</i>
<i>receiving this message,</i>

51
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,448
<i>please study it carefully...</i>

52
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,450
Who sent this message?

53
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,619
Unknown.
It comes from across the galaxy.

54
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,913
Locate the ship receiving it.

55
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,748
It's on a course
to one of our modules.

56
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,332
Intercept.

57
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,845
(<i> sighs</i> )

58
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,081
Maybe they've figured out
a way to get us home.

59
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,331
How could they
get us home

60
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,209
from 60,000
light-years away?

61
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,086
Who knows what
technological advances

62
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,337
Starfleet has come up with
since we've been gone?

63
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,672
They might have developed

64
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,549
a whole new way
of traveling through space.

65
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,718
Since it was technology
that brought us

66
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,595
to the Delta Quadrant
in the first place,

67
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,846
it's a reasonable assumption

68
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,556
technology
could bring us back again.

69
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,100
Starfleet found
a stable wormhole

70
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,475
to the Gamma Quadrant.

71
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,477
Maybe they've discovered
one that leads here.

72
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,606
This kind of speculation can be
intriguing, but be careful

73
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,942
about setting yourselves up
to be disappointed.

74
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,070
I'm just happy my folks
know I'm alive.

75
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,530
I imagine there were
quite a few celebrations

76
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,157
when people got the news.

77
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,743
Probably, but I can see

78
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,121
where it might make things
more difficult for some.

79
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,831
I'd guess a lot of people
had given up on us--

80
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,667
done their mourning,
gone on with their lives--

81
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,128
found some kind
of resolution.

82
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,046
Now they get word
that we're alive,

83
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,049
but so far away that we
might as well be dead.

84
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:03,511
Some people might feel that way,
but not my mom and dad.

85
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,140
At the very least, we know
the relay stations extend

86
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,433
almost all the way
to the Alpha Quadrant.

87
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,352
If Starfleet has found a way to
use them to transmit messages,

88
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,647
we'll be able to stay
in constant contact

89
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,773
with people at home.

90
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,191
That has
to be comforting.

91
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,069
Sure it is, but I think
it's more comforting

92
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,571
to think that Starfleet
is going to get us home.

93
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,865
If no one objects,
that's what I'm going to do.

94
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,870
You were supposed to report

95
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,998
to Sick Bay this morning
for your weekly checkup.

96
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,958
Where have you been?

97
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,168
Here, doing my job.

98
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,419
And just what is
this pressing task?

99
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,255
I'm trying to retrieve
more of the message

100
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,299
transmitted
from Starfleet Command.

101
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,301
Hmm. Your devotion
to duty is admirable,

102
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,094
but you must remember
that your implants

103
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,637
have to be
monitored regularly.

104
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,098
I'm fine.
No, you're not.

105
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,474
I'm detecting
reduced levels

106
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,934
of erythrocytes
in your blood.

107
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,811
How long has it been
since you regenerated?

108
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,980
58 hours.
Well, that explains it.

109
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,940
We've discussed
this before, Seven.

110
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,483
You must regenerate
in your alcove

111
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,152
for at least
three hours a day.

112
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,696
I have gone as long as 200 hours
without regenerating.

113
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,363
That was when
you were a Borg.

114
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,201
You seem to forget you're
a good deal more human now.

115
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,328
I assure you,
I have not forgotten.

116
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,453
(<i> console beeping</i> )

117
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,454
Another one.

118
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,706
I beg your pardon?

119
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,334
I've retrieved
another word of text.

120
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,543
That makes six.

121
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,504
Six words in 58 hours?

122
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,298
Wouldn't it be
more efficient just to wait

123
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,050
until we arrive
at the relay station?

124
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,969
This message is important
to the Captain.

125
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,386
I'm aware of that.

126
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,682
In fact, if it weren't
for me, this transmission

127
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,684
wouldn't have been possible
in the first place.

128
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,936
I was the one
who risked my matrix

129
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,730
in order to go
to the Alpha Quadrant.

130
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,857
If we ever get home,

131
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,777
I expect I'll become
quite the hero.

132
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,364
"Emergency Medical
Hologram instrumental

133
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,574
in the return
of<i> Voyager</i> crew."

134
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,492
Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

135
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,370
On the other hand, it
is entirely possible

136
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,829
that your program
will be deleted

137
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,248
and you'll be
upgraded to conform

138
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,999
to the most
recent standards.

139
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,751
Unlikely.

140
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,297
I've accomplished things
no EMH ever has.

141
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,050
In fact, most likely
I'll become

142
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,220
an object of intense
study and discussion--

143
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,263
possibly even veneration.

144
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,389
(<i> rumbling</i> )

145
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,390
What's that?

146
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,891
Report.

147
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,269
We're encountering some kind
of gravimetric forces.

148
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,353
Source?

149
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,564
Looks like it's coming

150
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,691
from the relay station
we're heading for.

151
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,111
That station is still
two light-years away.

152
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,238
How could it project
a gravimetric field this far?

153
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,283
CHAKOTAY:
It'd have to have an incredibly
powerful energy source.

154
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,659
I've compensated
for the disturbance.

155
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,911
We should be all right--

156
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,288
at least until
we get closer.

157
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,956
TUVOK:
I'm detecting a ship, Captain.

158
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,208
800,000 kilometers
off the port bow.

159
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,626
On screen.

160
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,378
TUVOK:
It's adrift.

161
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,547
No propulsion systems,
no weapons, no life support.

162
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,134
KIM:
I'm picking up one
male humanoid aboard.

163
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,509
He's dead.

164
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,765
As soon as we're close enough,
beam the body to Sick Bay.

165
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,559
I want to know how he died.

166
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,400
What's happened to him?

167
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,777
He appears to have suffered
a complete osteotomy.

168
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,321
He's been gutted.

169
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,614
Apparently, some kind of
surgical procedure was used

170
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,283
to remove
the entire skeleton,

171
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,743
as well as the musculature,
the ligaments and tendons,

172
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,953
and the internal organs.

173
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,663
How long ago did this happen?

174
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,956
It's difficult to say.

175
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,000
Somewhere between
a week and a month.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,169
I've seen this before.

177
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,504
The Borg encountered
a small ship of Species 5174.

178
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,840
They were also destroyed
in this fashion.

179
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,675
Did you ever determine
who did it and why?

180
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,010
No, it was irrelevant.

181
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,472
Return the body to his ship.

182
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,223
His people may be able
to retrieve him.

183
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,850
Very well.

184
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,310
When we get closer
to the station,

185
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,937
we can use the data
processors in Astrometrics

186
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,481
to download the message.

187
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,564
Yes, Captain.

188
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,822
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>stardate 51501.4.</i>

189
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,282
<i>After two days at high warp,</i>

190
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,034
<i>we're close enough</i>
<i>to the relay station</i>

191
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,953
<i>to see it on long-range</i>
<i>visual sensors.</i>

192
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,456
PARIS:
Not exactly what I expected.

193
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,499
It looks ancient.

194
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,250
Radiometric decay ratios
indicate

195
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,919
it's at least
100,000 years old.

196
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,421
Scan for life-forms.

197
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,839
Negative, sir.

198
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,466
Looks like there's
nobody home.

199
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,717
Well, that's good news.

200
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,885
(<i> rumbling</i> )

201
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,094
Here we go again.

202
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,138
TUVOK:
The gravimetric field.

203
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,890
KIM:
Commander,
if my sensors

204
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,059
are right, that
station is using

205
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,102
a quantum singularity
as a power source.

206
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,062
A black hole?

207
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,355
It's a tiny
one, probably

208
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,814
about a centimeter
in diameter,

209
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,024
but it's
putting out

210
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,151
almost four terawatts
of energy.

211
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,487
Then someone has managed
to contain a singularity,

212
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,573
construct a space station
around it and tap its power.

213
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,158
That's fascinating.

214
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,535
Can we take this ship
any closer?

215
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,702
I wouldn't
recommend it.

216
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,037
<i>Voyager</i> would take a beating

217
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,205
from the gravimetric eddies.

218
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,498
All right, Tom,
back us off.

219
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,457
Aye, sir.

220
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,417
Bridge to Janeway.

221
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,876
<i>Go ahead.</i>

222
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,462
We're as close as we're
going to be able to get.

223
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,881
Okay. We'll see if we can
download the message from here.

224
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,008
The datastream degraded
during transmission.

225
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,052
Elements have been
dislocated, rearranged.

226
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,471
It's going to require some time
to decompress the message

227
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,181
and rearrange it in
the proper sequence.

228
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,682
Don't worry
about the sequence.

229
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,476
Get it out in bits and pieces
if you have to.

230
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,727
We can put it
together later.

231
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,354
I've accessed
a block of data.

232
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,481
I'm downloading
the text.

233
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,404
"How much we miss you...

234
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,907
"We talk about you often...

235
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:20,078
wondering about your... day."

236
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,456
It sounds awfully personal
from Starfleet Command.

237
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,877
"The children have grown
so much you wouldn't... "

238
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,718
These are letters.

239
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,265
These are letters from home.

240
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,442
You'll be the official
mail carrier, Neelix.

241
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,986
We'll get you the letters as
quickly as we can download them.

242
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,655
A task I'm happy
to perform, Captain.

243
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,533
I can tell you, I've never
seen the crew this excited.

244
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,243
This is as close
as they've come

245
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,162
to their families
in almost four years.

246
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,205
I promise to treat
these like gemstones.

247
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,790
By the time you've
delivered them,

248
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,833
we should have more.

249
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,919
Captain.

250
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,463
I've discovered something odd.

251
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,672
There seems to be more
here than just letters.

252
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,258
What do you mean?

253
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,969
There's a latent datastream
buried under the message.

254
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,347
It's heavily encrypted.
Encrypted?

255
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,806
It appears to contain

256
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,309
a large block of text
and what may be maps.

257
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,144
Can you retrieve any of it?

258
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,521
Not immediately.

259
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,481
When more of the letters
have been cleared out,

260
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,566
I should be able to
access the coded message.

261
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,741
Well... I might just hope
that it contains a plan

262
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,370
for bringing us back
to the Alpha Quadrant.

263
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,747
I'm curious, Seven.

264
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,291
What do you think
about all this?

265
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,126
Messages, the possibility
of getting home?

266
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,254
It lacks any emotional
resonance for me.

267
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,755
I've never even
been to Earth.

268
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,343
You realize you may
have family there.

269
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,805
That had not occurred to me.

270
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,140
You could have cousins,

271
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,433
grandparents...

272
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,355
There might be more emotional
resonance than you think.

273
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,572
(<i> clears throat loudly</i> )

274
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,657
I am happy to announce

275
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,243
that I have the first
letters from home.

276
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,743
Who are they for,
Neelix?

277
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:28,039
Uh, this one is addressed
to Commander Chakotay.

278
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,254
Who's it from, Commander?

279
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,797
An old friend...

280
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,841
the person who recruited
me into the Maquis.

281
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,223
Maybe I'll read this
in private.

282
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,933
Tom, you have the Bridge.

283
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,395
Neelix, wait a minute.

284
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,188
Aren't there any more?

285
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,649
No. No more
for the Bridge crew.

286
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,735
Not yet.

287
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,903
Be patient.

288
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,489
(<i> door chimes</i> )

289
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,116
Come in.

290
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,034
Good news, Mr. Vulcan.

291
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,494
This one's for you.

292
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,828
Thank you, Mr. Neelix.

293
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,289
You can put it
on the desk.

294
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,836
Was there
something more?

295
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,089
Aren't you going
to read it?

296
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,174
Of course.

297
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,010
I-I mean, aren't you
going to read it now?

298
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,764
I'm finishing my weekly
tactical review.

299
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,682
When it's completed
I'll read the message.

300
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,183
You're going to wait

301
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,603
until you've finished
the tactical review?

302
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,563
Do you have any
reason to believe

303
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,524
the content of the message
will change during that time?

304
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,816
Well, that's
not the point.

305
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,193
It's a letter
from your family.

306
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,154
Don't you want to know
what it says?

307
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,239
I fully intend to
find out what it says.

308
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,159
It has some important news.

309
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,746
You mean you've read it?

310
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,415
Well, only the first few lines.

311
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,250
When I was seeing
who it was addressed to,

312
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,835
I... I couldn't help it.

313
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,713
I-I... would you like me
to read it to you?

314
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,215
Very well.

315
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,472
"My husband, we have
been given the news

316
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,807
"that you are alive.

317
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,183
"Your children and I

318
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,477
"have asked the priests
at the Temple of Aymonk

319
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,688
to say prayers
for your safe return."

320
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,689
That's very sweet.

321
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,731
Amonak.

322
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,691
Pardon?

323
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,400
The Temple of Amonak--

324
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,611
one of the most
sacred on Vulcan.

325
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,488
Amonak. Of course.

326
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,947
"The most significant news

327
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,116
"is the fact that

"has gone through

329
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,162
"He mated and has
become a father.

330
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,914
"You are now the grandfather
of a healthy female

331
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,543
who they have named T'Meni,
after your mother."

332
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,919
You're a grandfather!

333
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,296
Isn't that wonderful?

334
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,840
Congratulations!

335
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,633
What should we call you now?

336
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,552
Grandpa? Gramps?

337
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,470
I think Commander
Tuvok will suffice.

338
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,389
Thank you, Mr. Neelix.

339
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,974
I'll read the rest to myself.

340
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,601
Just as long as you
read it right away.

341
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,353
No procrastinating.

342
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,480
Who knows what else
might be in that letter?

343
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,971
KIM:
Is that a letter
to you, Captain?

344
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,475
Yes. Seven just
downloaded it.

345
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,519
I'll be in my ready room.

346
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,771
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,580
Have you gotten a letter yet?

348
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,248
Don't expect one.

349
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,377
Do you remember Sveta?

350
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,339
Of course.

351
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,215
I got one from her.

352
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,259
Why would she
be writing you?

353
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,855
Chakotay, what is it?

354
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,401
Something terrible
has happened.

355
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,696
I read that letter for an hour
before I could accept it.

356
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,948
Now I have to tell
everyone else...

357
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,241
and I'm not sure
how to do it.

358
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,707
It's over, B'Elanna.

359
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,667
There are no more Maquis.

360
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,837
What are you saying?

361
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,963
There are thousands of us.

362
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,506
All wiped out.

363
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,925
It seems the Cardassians
have an ally...

364
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,593
a species from
the Gamma Quadrant

365
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,095
who supplied them
with ships and weapons.

366
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,265
Atara?

367
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,518
Roberto?

368
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,772
Everyone except us is dead?

369
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,025
Just about.

370
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,652
Sveta and a few lucky
ones are in prison.

371
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,113
No...

372
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,156
B'Elanna...

373
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,367
Don't! Don't try
to console me.

374
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,328
I don't want to be comforted.
Those were our friends...

375
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,372
good people willing to put
their lives on the line

376
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,666
for something they believed in
and now you're telling

377
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,460
me that they are gone...
that they are slaughtered.

378
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,963
Those are the risks we all took.
We knew where it could lead.

379
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,882
It's not right
and you know it.

380
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:14,134
I will make someone pay,
I swear I will.

381
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,303
(<i> gasping</i> )

382
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,559
If we ever get back.

383
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,453
Tom... I heard there are

384
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,789
at least 30 more letters
that have been downloaded.

385
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,248
Oh, yeah?

386
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,500
Neelix is supposed to
be on his way here now.

387
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,169
What do you suppose
this is, anyway?

388
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,005
What what is?

389
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,632
This mystery dish.

390
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,801
It tastes vaguely
like chicken,

391
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,386
but it has the consistency
of corn husks.

392
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,888
Is that all you
can think about--

393
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,264
what you're eating?

394
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,642
Well, I don't like guessing

395
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,977
at what I put in my stomach.

396
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,813
Tom... we're getting
letters from home.

397
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,481
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

398
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,441
Not particularly.

399
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,526
I don't believe you.

400
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,320
You know, it's really
not that bad.

401
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,989
Here he comes.

402
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,531
Good news.

403
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,785
Seven has been able
to download some more letters.

404
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,580
This one is for
Susan Nicoletti.

405
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,999
Is she here?
Oh, yes.

406
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,000
Fitzpatrick.

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,001
Right here.

408
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,919
NICOLETTI:
Thank you.

409
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,673
Ah, Kyoto.

410
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,092
Golwat.

411
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,347
Thank you.

412
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,556
Ashmore.

413
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,559
Dorado.
I'm here.

414
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,227
There's not going
to be one for me.

415
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,855
He's not done yet.
Hang on.

416
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,230
And finally...

417
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,859
Parsons.

418
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,571
NEELIX:
I'm sorry if your name

419
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,241
hasn't come up,
but Seven is still working.

420
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,078
Neelix, I thought you
had over 30 letters.

421
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,122
30? Where did
you hear that?

422
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,207
That's what was going around.

423
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,086
Don't pay any attention
to rumors.

424
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,132
Right.

425
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,805
Aren't you going
to eat your lunch?

426
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,973
I'm not hungry.

427
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,978
You shouldn't get
your hopes up, Harry.

428
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,313
No hopes,
no disappointments.

429
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,484
I'm not you.

430
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,240
(<i> door chimes</i> )

431
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,743
Come in.

432
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,536
Captain, I'm beginning
to have trouble

433
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,205
accessing the datastream.

434
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,373
The longer it remains
lodged in the relay station,

435
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,666
the more it degrades.

436
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,168
If we could get near enough,

437
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,628
we could try to stabilize
the containment field,

438
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,548
but I can't risk taking
the ship in any closer.

439
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,799
A shuttle

440
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,551
could withstand
the gravimetric eddies

441
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,719
more easily than<i> Voyager.</i>

442
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,888
I'd like to try it.

443
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,182
I'd want Commander Tuvok
to go with you.

444
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,808
For what reason?

445
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,770
It isn't my custom
to send an away team of one.

446
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,397
As you wish.

447
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,570
(<i> sighs</i> )

448
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,116
Hi.

449
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,492
Hi. I thought Seven
was working in here.

450
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,827
She's gone with Tuvok

451
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,871
to shore up the station's
confinement field.

452
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,790
I've taken over for her.

453
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,418
Disappointed?

454
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,336
Of course not.

455
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,630
Would you stop that?

456
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,423
I've told you,
there's nothing between us.

457
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,300
I know there's
nothing between you.

458
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,885
It's purely
a one-way attraction.

459
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,595
Very funny.

460
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,597
Harry, you might as
well wear a big sign

461
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,349
that says, "I'm in love."
Everyone sees it.

462
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,770
Look, I'll admit
that for a while...

463
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,396
Well, she's a very
attractive woman,

464
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,522
but I've gotten over that.

465
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,524
Okay.

466
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,318
Fine. Believe
whatever you want.

467
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,488
If you didn't come
down here to see her,

468
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,781
why did you?

469
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,449
I wanted to know...

470
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,162
if I'd gotten a letter yet.

471
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,672
Sorry. I haven't
seen anything so far.

472
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,095
Do you think... there's going
to be one for everybody?

473
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,597
I'm sure
that Starfleet contacted

474
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,642
the families and friends
of everyone on this ship.

475
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,477
They know how important
that would be.

476
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,937
I hope so.

477
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,857
Harry... you'll get one.

478
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,026
Try to be patient.

479
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,621
Commander, am I correct
in assuming

480
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,665
that Vulcans are
incapable of lying?

481
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,792
We are capable
of telling lies.

482
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,378
However, I have never found it
prudent or necessary to do so.

483
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,089
You have never lied?

484
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,758
Only under orders from
a superior officer.

485
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,303
Then I must
ask you something.

486
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,721
Is it the Captain's custom

487
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,015
to send at least two people
on an away mission?

488
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,766
It's not only her custom,

489
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,019
it's recommended
Starfleet protocol.

490
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,813
I see.

491
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,150
Is there a purpose
to your question?

492
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,695
I am wondering if the Captain
still doesn't trust me--

493
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,989
if she feels
I require supervision.

494
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,034
I am not certain how
the Captain regards you,

495
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,869
but her decision to
have me accompany you

496
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,620
on this mission
shouldn't be taken

497
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,581
as evidence of any
particular attitude.

498
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,795
I believe we are close enough
to emit a polaron pulse.

499
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,506
Bring the main
deflector on line.

500
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,008
Ready.

501
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,472
The variance
in the containment field

502
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,392
is now at point-29.

503
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,769
That should prevent further
degradation of the signal.

504
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,980
Let me ask you
a question, Seven.

505
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,817
Is the Captain's opinion
important to you?

506
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,945
My understanding
of the hierarchy on<i> Voyager</i>

507
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,238
is that the Captain's opinion

508
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,989
is important to every
member of the crew.

509
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,409
(<i> console beeping</i> )

510
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,576
What's happened?

511
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,827
We've just been scanned

512
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,871
by a subnucleonic beam
of some kind.

513
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,040
The navigational sensors
have been disrupted.

514
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,666
We must get<i> Voyager</i>
to send out

515
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,335
a directional beacon
to guide us back.

516
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,753
Tuvok to<i> Voyager.</i>

517
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,546
<i>Voyager,</i>
please respond.

518
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,715
Commander, we've lost
other systems as well.

519
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,635
We have no communications,
no warp engines...

520
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,387
and no weapons.

521
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,389
I suspect this was
done intentionally

522
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,308
by the ship that's
approaching rapidly

523
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,434
off our port stern.

524
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:54,368
They're at 50,000 kilometers
and closing.

525
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,370
Our shields
are losing integrity.

526
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,998
I'll try to get at least one
phaser array back on line.

527
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,540
Commander, one more hit

528
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,376
and we'll be susceptible
to a hull breach.

529
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,628
That ship is larger than ours.

530
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,422
If we lure it
closer to the station,

531
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,299
it will be far more vulnerable

532
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,301
to the gravitational eddies
than we are.

533
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,057
A tractor beam.

534
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,725
We're being pulled
toward the ship.

535
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,394
I'll try to disrupt it.

536
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,313
Unsuccessful.

537
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,730
Launching a
distress beacon.

538
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,785
Torres to the Bridge.

539
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,287
JANEWAY:
<i>Go ahead.</i>

540
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,331
Captain, could Lieutenant Paris
come down here?

541
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,334
<i>I think I've got something</i>
<i>he'd want to see.</i>

542
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,960
He's on his way.

543
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,674
(<i> door opens</i> )

544
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,717
It's a letter for you.

545
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,177
It's coming through right now.

546
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,512
For me?

547
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,347
It's right here.

548
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,765
(<i> clears throat</i> )

549
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,434
Who's it from?

550
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,519
I can't tell yet.

551
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,064
Maybe it's from
the rehab colony

552
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,483
telling me
I've violated probation.

553
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,069
Why are you
acting like this?

554
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,446
I just want to know
who the letter's from, okay?

555
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,533
We should know in a minute.

556
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,827
I'll be on the Bridge.

557
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,204
What, you're not
going to wait?

558
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,579
I'm on duty.

559
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,499
<i>Voyager</i> is hanging in space.

560
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,958
There's not a lot to do
at the helm.

561
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,378
I just thought
that I should be at my post.

562
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,755
You may be able to fool
someone else with that ploy,

563
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,298
but you're talking
to me, Tom.

564
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,678
Just download the letter, okay?

565
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,931
A little more
has come in.

566
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,016
It's from Starfleet.

567
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:45,645
From... an Admiral Owen.

568
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,855
Do you know him?

569
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,444
Admiral Owen Paris.

570
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,114
That's my father.

571
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,283
That's wonderful.

572
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,910
Yeah, maybe.

573
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

574
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:10,129
I... I don't know
exactly why, but...

575
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,924
the more everybody gets excited
about these letters from home,

576
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,469
the more I don't want
any part of it.

577
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,306
Maybe because...

578
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,644
what I have on<i> Voyager...</i>

579
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,565
is so much better than anything
I ever had back there.

580
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,902
I just don't want
the reminder.

581
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,323
You're not the same person
you were four years ago.

582
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,991
What makes you think he is?

583
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,744
No. You don't know him.

584
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,829
At least give him a chance.

585
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,080
He's obviously reaching out.

586
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,249
When he forms an opinion
about something,

587
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,502
nothing can change his mind.

588
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,837
Fine.

589
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,802
Excuse me if I can't feel
terribly sorry for you.

590
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,931
I learned this morning that
a lot of my friends are dead

591
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,601
and I've gone
from being so angry

592
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,811
that I wanted to kill someone...

593
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,273
to crying for an hour.

594
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,192
And now I'm just trying to...

595
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,777
to accept it and move on.

596
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:20,324
B'Elanna... that's awful.

597
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,785
Oh, I am so sorry.

598
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,955
And here I am
going on about something

599
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,457
that doesn't even matter
anymore.

600
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,501
No, no. I'm sorry.

601
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,919
It obviously does.

602
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,548
You care what he thinks
about you.

603
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,133
Yeah.

604
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:43,972
Yeah, I guess I still do.

605
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,770
I'll let you know when
I get the whole letter.

606
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,072
(<i> door chimes</i> )

607
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,199
Come in.

608
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,368
Looks like Tuvok and Seven
pulled it off.

609
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,537
The containment field
has stabilized quite a bit.

610
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,539
B'Elanna says she's
downloading the letters

611
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,374
much more easily now.
That's good news.

612
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,251
They don't have the shuttle
on sensors yet,

613
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,877
but they should
be back soon.

614
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,795
I've learned a few
interesting things

615
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,715
about that relay station.

616
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,676
It's generating
as much energy

617
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,596
every minute as a typical
star puts out in a year.

618
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,680
What's amazing to me

619
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,724
is that someone
100,000 years ago

620
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,767
was harvesting
microsingularities.

621
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,186
If nobody shows up to protest,

622
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,938
I'd like to stay
here for a while--

623
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,274
try to find the answers
to some of these questions.

624
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,150
This is the kind of
archeological puzzle

625
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,403
that's always fascinated me.

626
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,613
Want a cup?

627
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,197
No, thanks.

628
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,538
You haven't mentioned
your letter.

629
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,830
Who was it from?

630
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,709
It was from Mark...

631
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,295
the man I was engaged to.

632
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,589
He told me about
the litter of puppies

633
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,634
my dog had-- how he
found homes for them,

634
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,178
how devastated he was
when<i> Voyager</i> was lost...

635
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,806
how he held out hopes
we were alive

636
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,558
longer than most people did...

637
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,978
until he realized that he
was clinging to a fantasy.

638
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:16,565
So he began living
his life again--

639
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:21,069
meeting people,
letting go of the past.

640
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,907
About four months ago,

641
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,285
he married a woman
who works with him.

642
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,788
He's very happy.

643
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,292
And how do you feel
about that?

644
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,588
Well, I knew he'd eventually
move on with his life...

645
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,511
but there was such
a finality to that letter.

646
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,804
<i>Kim to the Captain.</i>

647
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,013
<i>Can you come to the Bridge?</i>

648
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,814
What is it?
We picked up

649
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,107
an automated distress signal
from Tuvok's shuttle.

650
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,193
Sensors show there's
no one on board.

651
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,741
(<i> groaning</i> )

652
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,766
Seven.

653
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,771
Seven of Nine.

654
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,147
(<i> groans</i> )

655
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,072
Where are we?

656
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,075
I assume
we're on the alien ship.

657
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,121
This is most uncomfortable.

658
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,919
Have you seen anyone?

659
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,503
No.

660
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,505
If we can reach
one of those blades,

661
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,090
perhaps we can

662
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,884
cut through these bindings.

663
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,056
You were pathetic prey.

664
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,851
Easily taken.

665
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,728
The hunt was not satisfying.

666
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,274
I want information.

667
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:07,068
Why do you violate
our property?

668
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:11,239
I could snap your puny neck
with one twist.

669
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:16,035
Hardly worth taking.

670
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,246
Answer me. Why do you
use our modules?

671
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,748
We're trying to retrieve

672
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,125
important messages
from our home.

673
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,962
Return us to our ship
and we'll be on our way

674
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,546
without trespassing again.

675
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,340
I took you in a fair hunt.

676
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,884
I claim the relics
of the chase.

677
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,982
Are the others on your ship

678
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,359
able to put up more
of a fight than you?

679
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,653
You will find our Captain
a formidable opponent

680
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,113
and our ship heavily armed.

681
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:56,242
Good. Strong prey makes
for a better hunt.

682
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,744
Release us now
and you'll be safe.

683
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,122
Otherwise, we will destroy you.

684
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,582
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

685
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,544
Pitiful relics.

686
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,671
They are the first
of their kind.

687
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,216
I will be envied.
I've located their ship.

688
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,719
It's 4,000 ketrics
from the module.

689
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,637
We'll be there
within the hour.

690
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,931
Go to stalking mode.

691
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,351
Why do you hesitate?

692
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,769
The rest of the group
is on its way.

693
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,147
I wanted to claim
this prey for myself.

694
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,900
We may not be able
to take them alone.

695
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,860
We need the strength
of the others.

696
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,695
I won't share prey
with the others.

697
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:36,658
These two must be
the only relics! Prepare them!

698
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,871
KIM:
Captain.

699
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,915
It's tricky to scan
through the interference,

700
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,750
but I think I'm
detecting a ship.

701
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,334
What kind of ship?

702
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,670
Let me reconfigure
the sensor array.

703
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,756
It's Hirogen,

704
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,799
and Tuvok and Seven
are on it.

705
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,177
Hail them.

706
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,014
On screen.

707
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,558
I'm Captain Janeway
of the starship<i> Voyager.</i>

708
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,852
You have two
of my crew on board.

709
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,438
<i>Disconnect your link</i>

710
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,065
<i>and leave this space.</i>

711
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:10,149
Not without my people.

712
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,027
<i>They are my relics.</i>

713
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,196
I'm prepared to offer you
something for their safe return.

714
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,449
Surely we can come
to an agreement.

715
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,158
<i>If the rest</i>
<i>of my group arrives,</i>

716
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:22,287
<i>you will be taken as well.</i>

717
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,123
<i>I'm giving you a chance to run.</i>

718
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,583
We don't run.

719
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,752
Captain, I've got three
more ships on sensors

720
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,963
coming toward
us at high warp.

721
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,089
<i>Don't be foolish.</i>

722
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,382
<i>Leave now and save yourselves.</i>

723
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,927
Give me my people
and we'll do just that.

724
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,637
<i>They're mine!</i>

725
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,513
Then get ready
for a fight.

726
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,974
Red Alert.

727
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,774
Are they prepared?

728
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,526
Yes. But now is not
the time for it.

729
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,278
We should wait until
the others arrive

730
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,362
and take the ship.

731
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,406
I want to make
the first kill.

732
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,658
You will verify it.

733
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,410
If there is a battle,
we must join it.

734
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,913
The others can wage the battle.

735
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,916
Perhaps you are more interested
in collecting relics.

736
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,044
Perhaps your judgment
is clouded.

737
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,171
Don't question me again.

738
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,214
We do it now.

739
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,634
I suggest you think carefully
about your decision.

740
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:21,554
If you kill us, our Captain will
hunt you down and show no mercy.

741
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,556
I'm not concerned.

742
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,100
Lower the harness.

743
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,939
A long, coiled intestine--

744
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,274
an interesting trophy.

745
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,777
What possible use could you
make of my intestines?

746
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,196
Unusual relics are prized.

747
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,699
Yours will make me
envied by men

748
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,826
and pursued by women.

749
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,537
You are a crude species.

750
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,956
Only your size
makes you formidable.

751
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,670
Your insults are as pitiful
as your efforts to escape.

752
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,424
This one first.

753
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,218
I want the female
to witness

754
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,803
what will happen to her.

755
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,180
Their bone structure

756
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,598
makes cutting
through the back difficult.

757
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,142
This will take time.

758
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,940
Bridge to Torres.
<i>Torres here, Captain.</i>

759
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,108
How much longer?

760
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,609
I'm getting it out
piece by piece.

761
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,944
At least another half hour.

762
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,654
How are you coming?

763
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,865
That ship has some kind
of monotanium armor plating.

764
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,533
It's scattering
the targeting beam.

765
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,702
The other three ships are
within 6,000 kilometers.

766
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,953
PARIS:
Captain,

767
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,580
those ships
have massive weapons.

768
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,331
They've definitely
got us outgunned.

769
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,541
Harry, let me see those ships

770
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,085
in relation
to the relay station.

771
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,753
Yes, ma'am.

772
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,296
Maybe we can use that quantum
singularity to our advantage.

773
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,382
How?
If we can boost the effect

774
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,843
of the singularity--
increase the gravitational pull,

775
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,344
we might be able to stop them.

776
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,764
KIM:
The pull would
increase if we could weaken

777
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,516
the station's containment field.
An antithoron burst might do it.

778
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,852
If we're not careful,
we might be pulled in as well.

779
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,938
Don't worry.
We're going to be ready for it.

780
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:56,024
Harry, create a low-level
warp field around<i> Voyager--</i>

781
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,609
sublight energy level.

782
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,903
That should help counteract
the gravitational pull.

783
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,362
If the field is too strong,

784
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,364
we won't be able to beam
Tuvok and Seven aboard.

785
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,283
Then you'll have to find
the right balance,

786
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,409
won't you, Harry?

787
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,577
Yes, ma'am.

788
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:08,703
On my mark,

789
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,789
direct a level-8
antithoron burst

790
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,540
toward the station.

791
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,043
Have thrusters ready
for full reverse, Mr. Paris.

792
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,461
Understood.

793
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,588
I've established
a low-level warp field, Captain.

794
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:19,965
Antithoron system
is on line.

795
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,424
I'm ready with thrusters.

796
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,508
Do it.

797
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,680
It's working.

798
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,515
Try the transporter lock
again, Harry.

799
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,517
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

800
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,686
Stabilize the ship!

801
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,983
I can't. The gravity well

802
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,025
is pulling us in!

803
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,617
(<i> growls</i> )

804
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,621
That vessel is weakening

805
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,081
the module's
containment field.

806
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,540
Ready weapons.

807
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,792
Signal the others to attack.

808
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,504
Torres to the Bridge.
Janeway here.

809
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,339
The antithoron burst
collapsed the signal.

810
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,800
<i>I've gotten as much of the</i>
<i>message as I'm going to get.</i>

811
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,884
Acknowledged.

812
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,927
Hail those ships.

813
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,220
Channel open.

814
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,972
This is Captain Janeway.

815
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,724
Agree to retreat, and we'll
restore the containment field.

816
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,851
Captain, they're firing!

817
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,605
Their weapons are destabilizing
the containment field!

818
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,774
This is Janeway.
Stop firing.

819
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,277
You're putting yourselves
in grave dan...

820
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,528
The field is going!

821
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,322
The singularity
is about to be exposed!

822
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,746
Captain, the ship
with Tuvok and Seven

823
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,874
is still being pulled in.
Get a tractor beam on it.

824
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,292
I have Tuvok
and Seven targeted,

825
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,918
but if we try to
transport them now,

826
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,004
the gravity well could
scatter their patterns.

827
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,422
The tractor beam is weakening.
We're going to lose them!

828
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,549
Harry, we have to risk it.

829
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,176
Activating the transporter.

830
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,638
Full reverse! Increase
power to the engines!

831
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,723
No response.

832
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,016
Do you have them?

833
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,767
Not yet. Their patterns
are distorting.

834
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,477
Narrow the annular
confinement beam.

835
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,146
Tractor beam's
almost gone, Captain.

836
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,772
We're losing
this tug-of-war.

837
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,192
Reroute all secondary power
to the tractor emitters.

838
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,401
The tractor beam collapsed.

839
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,986
That ship is headed
into the black hole.

840
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,905
KIM:
I'm realigning
the pattern buffer.

841
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,156
I've got one more shot at it.

842
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,582
I got them!
They're in Transporter Room 2.

843
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,918
I need more power!
We're being pulled in!

844
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,211
Transfer all available power

845
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,295
to the engines.

846
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,588
(<i> console beeping</i> )

847
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,714
It's not enough!

848
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:25,715
Shut down life support.

849
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,092
Structural integrity is failing.

850
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,509
The hull is starting
to buckle.

851
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,886
We're going in!

852
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,846
Open the antimatter injectors
to 120 percent.

853
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,556
Captain, that
could breach the core.

854
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,267
So will that black hole.
Now, just do it.

855
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,434
Yes, ma'am.

856
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,774
We're free.

857
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,442
Resume course.

858
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,569
I'll be in Astrometrics.

859
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,157
Captain, look at this.

860
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,326
The energy released
from the singularity

861
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,577
created a massive discharge

862
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,995
along the relay network.

863
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,164
It disabled every one
of the stations.

864
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,166
How much of the message
were you able to get?

865
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,335
I got most of the
encrypted Starfleet text

866
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,920
and a few more
personal letters.

867
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,089
How soon can we see
what Starfleet had to say?

868
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,715
Oh, it'll take
some time to decode.

869
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,968
Harry should
probably work on it.

870
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,721
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

871
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,307
I have a few letters
to deliver.

872
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,349
Neelix can do that.

873
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,809
No need.

874
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,186
Anyway, there's one
that I want to do personally.

875
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,528
Good news, Harry.

876
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,489
I got this
at the last minute.

877
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,452
It's from my folks.

00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,494
Thanks.

879
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,877
I'm sorry, Tom.

880
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,963
I wasn't able to
download yours in time.

881
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,302
Just when I was getting eager
to read it.

882
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,929
You could assume
that he said he loves you...

883
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,974
and that he's proud of you.

884
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,229
I think I will.

00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,448
<i>after their encounter</i>
<i>on the alien ship.</i>

889
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,825
<i>I've been eager to hear</i>
<i>Tuvok's impressions</i>

890
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,869
<i>of the species</i>
<i>who took them hostage.</i>

891
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,662
I learned very
little about them,

892
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,623
but I believe we should consider
them extremely dangerous.

893
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,335
They seem to lack
any moral center.

894
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,794
Do you know why
the relay network

895
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,421
was so important to them?

896
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:32,133
No. I assume they used it
for communications, as we did.

897
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,386
Well, they won't be
using it anymore.

898
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:37,138
They won't be pleased
about that, Captain.

899
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,931
I doubt we've seen
the last of them.

900
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,016
(<i> door chimes</i> )

901
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,059
Come in.

902
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,064
If you'll excuse me.

903
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,606
Commander. 

904
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:51,027
Repair teams have inspected
the ship from stem to stern.

905
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,280
Except for some maintenance
that's needed on the warp coils,

906
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,448
everything seems fine.

907
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,449
I suppose so.

908
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,534
Want some coffee?

909
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,910
Thanks.

910
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,952
Cream and sugar?

911
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,912
Two sugars.

912
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,539
Oh...<i> two</i> sugars?

913
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,457
You know, you drink
too much of that stuff.

914
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,458
Really?

915
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,667
If I'm not mistaken,

916
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,253
that's your third
cup this morning.

917
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,670
Fourth. And on
a day like today,

918
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,256
it won't be my last.

919
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:15,385
Coffee: the finest organic
suspension ever devised.

920
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,886
It's gotten me
through the worst

921
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,096
of the last three years.

922
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,765
I beat the Borg with it.

923
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:25,228
Oh, I'm sure<i> Voyager</i>
will be fine.

924
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:28,940
But I'm worried that the crew
might be a different story.

925
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,109
I think they were
hoping mail call

926
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,528
would become a regular part
of their day.

927
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,613
Neelix is putting together
an impromptu party.

928
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,073
He thought it might
cheer them up.

929
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,366
Good idea.
When will it be?

930
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,034
As soon as he can
get people together.

931
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,286
Leave it to Neelix
to come up

932
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,954
with the right idea
at the right time.

933
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,624
How are<i> you</i> doing?

934
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,126
Me? I'm fine.

935
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,877
You'd say that
if you just had

936
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,130
your legs torn off
by a Trayken beast.

937
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,840
Look what you've been through
in the last few days.

938
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,759
We finally make
a connection with home

939
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,428
and then it's
ripped away from us.

940
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,012
We manage to make
another enemy

941
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,722
who's going to try
and hunt us down

942
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:05,017
and destroy us,
and on top of that...

943
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,103
It's all right.
You can say it.

944
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:10,689
On top of all that,
I got a "Dear John" letter.

945
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,194
It wasn't really a surprise.

946
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,573
I guess I didn't really
expect him to wait for me

947
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,741
considering the circumstances.

948
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,369
But it made me realize
that I was using him

949
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,413
as a safety net, you know--

950
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,249
as a way to avoid becoming
involved with someone else.

951
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,543
You don't have that
safety net anymore.

952
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,337
That's right.

953
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,214
But then again,
my life is far from uneventful

954
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,049
here in the Delta Quadrant.

955
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,177
It's not like I would
have had a chance

956
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,595
to pursue a relationship,

957
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,139
even if I had realized
I was alone.

958
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,890
You're hardly alone.

959
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:49,103
And to my way of thinking,
there's still plenty of time.

960
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,523
Plenty of time.

961
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:54,859
<i>Neelix to the ready room.</i>
<i>The party's about to begin</i>

962
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,612
<i>and there are only</i>
<i>two people missing.</i>

963
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:58,695
We're on our way.

964
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,201
