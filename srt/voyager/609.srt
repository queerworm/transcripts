1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,510
Naomi Wildman, state
your purpose here.

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,303
I was waiting for you.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,638
Kadis-Kot, remember?

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,055
Our weekly game?

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,474
Reschedule for tomorrow.

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,017
I'm working now.

7
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,227
Redecorating isn't work.

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,856
Aesthetics are irrelevant.
I'm modifying the alcove

9
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:25,693
to function as a cortical
processing subunit.

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,028
That was my next guess.

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,323
Then I won't need to
explain its purpose.

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,033
Okay, you win.

13
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,327
What do you do with
the cortical processing, uh...

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,914
Subunit.
On Borg vessels, there's
one in each unimatrix.

15
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,501
It downloads
newly assimilated
data to the drones.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,628
But<i> Voyager</i>
<i>isn't a Borg vessel,</i>

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,755
and you're not
a drone anymore.

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,008
<i>Voyager</i> collects
a great deal of information--

19
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:53,345
sensor scans,
navigational projections,
engineering updates,

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,056
away team reports,
scientific analyses.

21
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,350
The results of our
Kadis-Kot tournament?

22
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,561
That, too.

23
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,855
The crew must read and study
this information--

24
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,899
an inefficient procedure.

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,776
These data nodes are downloading
the information into the alcove.

26
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,362
Which is going to download it
into<i> you.</i>

27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,823
Precisely.

28
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,408
In a matter of hours,
I will assimilate

29
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,159
several months worth of data.

30
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,870
Can I try it sometime?

31
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:21,665
Your physiology is...
different from mine.

32
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,918
Guess I'll stick
to reading my lessons

33
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,253
and listening
to Neelix tell stories.

34
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,838
I will see you tomorrow.

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,423
Can I watch?

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,593
Okay, tomorrow.

37
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,602
COMPUTER:
Warning. Plate is hot.

38
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,312
Now you tell me.

39
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,023
You go for authenticity
and what do you get?

40
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,983
Second-degree burns.

41
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,403
I've been slaving
over that replicator
program for hours.

42
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,655
What was this bizarre
rumor I heard

43
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,867
about half the crew on
Deck 5 getting pregnant?

44
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,620
Oh, that.
The Doctor was running
generational projections

45
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,497
on the Sick Bay computer.

46
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,708
Tom Paris happened
to glance at the monitor

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,626
and jumped to conclusions.

48
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,628
Wasn't long before
Neelix was asking me

49
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,630
if he could turn Cargo Bay 1
into a nursery.

50
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,632
Word travels fast
on this ship, hmm?

51
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,426
Warp 10.

52
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,429
Oh, by the way,
I meant to tell you...

53
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,058
there's a class-K nebula
25 light-years off starboard.
We should take a look.

54
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,228
A major detour
for a minor nebula.

55
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,647
We<i> are</i> explorers,
remember?

56
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,274
Permission granted.

57
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,525
(<i> replicator beeps</i> )

58
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,818
Main course,

59
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,653
a recipe I've never tried.

60
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,240
But we<i> are</i> explorers,
remember?

61
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,660
COMPUTER:
Regeneration cycle complete.

62
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,418
Seven of Nine
to Lieutenant Torres.

63
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,588
Lieutenant Torres, respond.

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,507
TORRES: Good morning, Seven.
This better be important.

65
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,052
I must speak with you at once.

66
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,435
I'm picking up some interesting
graviton fluctuations

67
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,646
about ten
light-years away.

68
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,231
Can you be
more specific?

69
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,150
Not at this
distance. Tom...

70
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,693
alter course.
I want to take
a closer look.

71
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,321
Chakotay had his heart set
on that nebula we're headed for.

72
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,490
He'll have to wait.

73
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:28,162
Captain, I need permission
to shut down the sensor grid.

74
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,498
Seven thinks a couple of insects
are disrupting the power flow.

75
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,459
A mating pair
of photonic fleas,
to be more accurate,

76
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,253
and possibly their offspring.

77
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,214
And how did you arrive
at this theory?

78
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,092
Last night,
I downloaded six months
of ship status reports

79
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,012
into my new cortical subunit
while I was regenerating.

80
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,847
PARIS:
Learn while you sleep.

81
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,765
I tried that once--
gave me a headache.

82
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,267
Go on.

83
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,227
Eight weeks ago,
an away team encountered

84
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,063
a Kartelan freighter carrying
supplies from Sector 492,

85
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,483
<i>a territory that included</i>
<i>a former Talaxian colony.</i>

86
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,696
<i>Mr. Neelix used</i>
<i>the opportunity to acquire</i>
<i>12 kilograms of amber spice--</i>

87
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,489
<i>a delicacy among his people.</i>

88
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,491
What does that have to do
with the sensor grid?

89
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,160
On the same day,

90
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,619
<i>Ensign Kim was</i>
<i>repairing a replicator</i>

91
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,412
<i>in the Mess Hall.</i>

92
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,456
I remember that--
Neelix told me

93
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,374
to stick around
to try something he was cooking.

94
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,294
No doubt made
with the amber spice,

95
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,713
which contained the larvae
of the photonic fleas.

96
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,589
How could you possibly
know that?

97
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,758
Because I also downloaded data

98
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,426
regarding their life cycles.

99
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,637
<i>The larvae flew out</i>
<i>of the spice jar</i>

100
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,723
<i>in search of their</i>
<i>primary source of</i>
<i>nourishment--</i>

101
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,558
<i>plasma particles.</i>

102
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,643
<i>The conduits within</i>
<i>the nearby sensor grid</i>

103
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,104
<i>contain an unlimited supply</i>
<i>of these particles.</i>

104
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,565
<i>Ensign Kim had unwittingly</i>
<i>given the creatures access</i>

105
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,317
<i>by exposing the grid.</i>

106
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,152
The now-mature creatures
periodically

107
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,154
tap into the conduit
for nourishment.

108
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,739
When they do,
the sensor emitters

109
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,574
momentarily
lose their resolution.

110
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,036
A logical, though
highly speculative, analysis.

111
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,692
Let's find a more
suitable home for them.

112
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,078
I'm picking
up graviton
fluctuations.

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,622
Take us out of warp.
On screen.

114
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,337
Anybody want to hazard a guess?

115
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,089
They are hailing us.

116
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,966
On screen.

117
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,594
I recommend maximum shielding.

118
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,431
There are a few technical issues
I haven't worked out yet.

119
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,100
There's a massive graviton surge
coming from that thing.

120
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,851
Shields to full.

121
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,940
Your apparatus appears
to be destabilizing.

122
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,484
If I don't find a way to repair
this power core, they'll be able

123
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,736
to see the explosion
all the way to, uh...

124
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,363
Where did you say you were from?

125
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,282
I didn't...

126
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,617
but we're from
a planet called Earth.

127
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,619
All the way to... Earth.

128
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,704
Can we ask you
what it's supposed to do?

129
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,292
Catapult a vessel across space
in the time it takes to say,

130
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,127
"catapult a vessel
across space."

131
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,130
It'll make warp drive
look like a wooden sled.

132
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,759
Maybe we can help you
with that power core.

133
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,428
Hmm?

134
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,472
The core sends a graviton surge

135
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,056
through the projectors

136
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,017
which locks onto a ship

137
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,270
and sends it hurtling
into null space

138
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,690
to emerge a few hours later,
hundreds, if not thousands

139
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,484
of light-years away.

140
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,153
I'm curious
why you built this catapult.

141
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,990
Simple-- I've been looking
for a way to get home.

142
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,574
We know the feeling.

143
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,827
I'd been exploring
an unstable wormhole.

144
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,456
Before I knew it, I was here
and my home planet was there.

145
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,209
I was facing a journey
of at least ten years.

146
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,337
Instead, I decided
to build a catapult.

147
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,381
Have you tested it yet?

148
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,591
Two weeks ago, I sent a probe
nearly 600 light-years,

149
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,886
but it destabilized
the core.

150
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,888
I've been trying to
fix it ever since.

151
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,307
We can send an engineering team
over to help you.

152
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,060
No, no, it's too dangerous.
I wouldn't send my<i> own</i> crew
in there.

153
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,188
Then we could find
a way to adjust the
core reaction from here.

154
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,689
A few well-timed
graviton pulses

155
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,233
from our deflector dish
might do it.

156
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,984
That's generous,

157
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,153
but I have nothing
to give in return.

158
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,197
We're not asking
for anything in return.

159
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,784
You could use the catapult
after I've made my jump.

160
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,037
It should still
be functional.

161
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,082
A thousand light-years
won't exactly get
you back to Earth...

162
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,792
But it would cut a few
years off our trip.

163
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,045
If you're successful,
and if I'm satisfied

164
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,214
a jump would be safe
for<i> Voyager,</i>

165
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,341
then we'll take you up
on that offer. Thank you.

166
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,552
Let's get started.

167
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,968
(<i> door chimes</i> )

168
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,677
Come in.

169
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,930
Good morning.

170
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,515
Perhaps not.

171
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,435
The alien, Mr. Tash,
is trying to deceive us.

172
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,395
His catapult is the same type
of technology

173
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,980
that was used
to trap<i> Voyager</i>

174
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,149
in the Delta Quadrant
five years ago.

175
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,407
I scanned the
catapult myself.

176
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,201
Sensors didn't pick up
anything unusual.

177
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,079
You spent the night
in your new alcove.

178
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,332
Processing the same information
and cross-referencing it

179
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,626
with<i> Voyager's</i> database.

180
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,087
When the catapult
destabilized yesterday,
astrometric sensors recorded

181
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,840
a momentary burst
of epsilon radiation.

182
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,092
Unusual, but not unheard of.

183
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,846
Epsilon radiation is
one the byproducts
of a tetryon reactor.

184
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,432
According to your own entries
in the database,

185
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,434
your only encounter
with that kind of technology

186
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,270
occurred five years ago
in the Alpha Quadrant.

187
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,231
<i>A coherent tetryon beam</i>
<i>locked onto</i> Voyager,
<i>and you were hit</i>

188
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,817
<i>by a massive</i>
<i>displacement wave,</i>
<i>which pulled you across</i>

189
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,028
<i>70,000 light-years</i>
<i>in a matter of minutes.</i>

190
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,155
<i>The source of</i>
<i>that tetryon beam</i>

191
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,449
<i>was the Caretaker's Array.</i>

192
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,494
Mr. Tash claims that his
catapult will be able to do

193
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,371
something very similar.

194
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,168
He didn't want us
to send over a repair team.

195
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,462
Out of concern
for our safety.

196
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,965
It's obvious
he was trying to hide
his tetryon reactor.

197
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,805
The first time we met
a Caretaker, we were pulled
halfway across the galaxy.

198
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,807
The second time
we were almost killed.

199
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,185
I'm not eager
for a third round.

200
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,523
Is this any way
to treat a colleague?

201
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,568
Not so much as a molecule
of Caretaker DNA.

202
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,818
Thank you, Doctor.

203
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,115
There's a tetryon reactor
powering your catapult.

204
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,243
You didn't want us
to find it, did you?

205
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,456
Unless you answer my questions,
I'll resume course,

206
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,709
and you can ask
somebody else for help.

207
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:35,796
Look, I acquired the tetryon
reactor at great cost.

208
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,756
This territory is
full of species

209
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,594
who would do anything for
such advanced technology,

210
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,303
including steal it.

211
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,306
I apologize for
the deception,

212
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,392
but you do understand.

213
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,313
We made an agreement
to cooperate.

214
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,482
I see no reason
not to continue.

215
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,900
Thank you, Captain.

216
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,278
Keep me informed
on your progress.

217
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,656
That reactor had
to come from somewhere.

218
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,451
I can't just ignore
the possibility of
a Caretaker nearby.

219
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,160
Keep scanning.
See what you can find.

220
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,912
There is another
possibility.

221
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,748
The reactor may have come
from the same Array

222
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,625
that brought<i> Voyager</i>
<i>to the Delta Quadrant.</i>

223
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,419
That's a long shot, Seven.
Maybe not.

224
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,130
Again, according
to your own reports,
you believed the only way

225
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,841
<i>to keep the Array from</i>
<i>falling into the wrong hands</i>
<i>was to destroy it.</i>

226
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,427
<i>It's possible</i>

227
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,345
the destruction
was incomplete.

228
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,223
And one of the reactors
survived?

229
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,851
We scanned for debris.

230
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,147
There was nothing left but some
fused pieces of metal alloy.

231
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,691
I wish to reexamine the sensor
records from that event.

232
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,234
In case we were mistaken.

233
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,444
Yes.

234
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,861
Go right ahead.

235
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,741
Computer,
describe the debris remaining

236
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,451
after the Array was destroyed.

237
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,911
Particulate dust
and metallic fragments

238
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,164
composed of an unknown alloy,

239
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,793
vapor composed of hydrogen,
helium, mercury and argon.

240
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,295
Was there anything left
of the tetryon reactor?

241
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,297
Negative.

242
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,091
Specify the yield
of the tricobalt device.

243
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,552
20,000 teracochranes.

244
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,053
Who programmed the device?

245
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,139
Commander Tuvok.

246
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,016
Display the detonation.

247
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,605
Advance the image
by .01 seconds.

248
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,856
Again.

249
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,862
Isolate grid 3-7 and magnify.

250
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,367
Is that a tractor beam?

251
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,452
Insufficient sensor data.

252
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,496
Identify its source.

253
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,790
Insufficient sensor data.

254
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,001
Identify the isolated section
of the Array.

255
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,295
Secondary power core.

256
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,507
Which contained
a tetryon reactor.

257
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,091
Affirmative.

258
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,767
Commander, I've been
reviewing the data

259
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,102
on the destruction
of the Caretaker's Array.

260
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,938
Unfortunately, the sensor
records are incomplete.

261
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,941
I don't doubt it.
We were being attacked
by the Kazon.

262
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,985
Half the ship's
systems were down.

263
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,863
A single Kazon vessel.

264
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,656
Armed to the teeth.

265
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,991
Commander, you fired
the tricobalt charge

266
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,660
that destroyed the Array.

267
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,787
Correct.
Under the Captain's orders?

268
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,665
Did you also program
the charge?

269
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,124
Yes.

270
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,918
Under the Captain's orders
as well?

271
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,754
Not directly.

272
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,338
I determined the yield.

273
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,090
20,000 teracochranes.

274
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,341
That's correct.

275
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,594
According to sensor estimates

276
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,929
of the Array's hull integrity,
a charge of half that yield

277
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,681
would have been
sufficient.

278
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,683
The Captain wanted nothing left

279
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,518
for the Kazon to use.

280
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,104
I calculated a yield
certain to produce that result.

281
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,481
Something may have
escaped the blast--

282
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,816
one of the tetryon reactors.

283
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,818
But we scanned for debris.

284
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,447
The charge you detonated
tore an opening in subspace.

285
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,990
And that's where
the reactor went?

286
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,367
Yes.

287
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,119
How?

288
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,496
It was pushed there
by a tractor beam.

289
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,333
Do you have evidence
of a tractor beam?

290
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,835
Perhaps.

291
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,755
Speculation is not evidence.

292
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,715
There was no tractor beam,

293
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,509
because there was no ship
in the vicinity to generate one,

294
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,804
unless you can prove otherwise.

295
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,098
Thank you, Commander.

296
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,537
Looking for a midnight snack?

297
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,706
I require information.
I'm attempting to determine

298
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,416
whether the
catapult technology

299
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,376
was derived from
the Caretaker's Array.

300
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,254
So I heard.
A fascinating theory.

301
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,507
It's got my mind spinning.

302
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,216
How long were you
in the vicinity of the Array

303
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,093
before<i> Voyager</i> arrived?

304
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,054
About a year.
Kes was on a nearby planet

305
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,724
and, uh, we were
getting very close.

306
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,560
Did you ever encounter
the Caretaker directly?

307
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,562
No, no, no, no, no, no.

308
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,398
In my opinion, any being
powerful enough to grab ships

309
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,734
from the other side
of the galaxy should be avoided.

310
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,236
According to
<i>Voyager's</i> database,
he claimed

311
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,739
he was searching
for a genetically
compatible mate.

312
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,283
Did you believe
that explanation?

313
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,996
I had no reason to doubt it,
though it did seem
a bit excessive.

314
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,664
I mean, all those ships.

315
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,207
What happened to them?

316
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,083
Well, after he sampled
the crew's DNA,

317
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,712
he sent them back where
they came from, I suppose.

318
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,632
You know, Kes always thought
something more was going on,

319
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,011
but she had
quite an imagination.

320
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,848
Were there any
other ships in the area
after<i> Voyager</i> arrived?

321
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,391
Only the Kazon.

322
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,018
But the Caretaker
could have pulled in

323
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,729
another vessel...
a cloaked ship,
perhaps.

324
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,438
Seven, what are you getting at?

325
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,357
A third ship hidden

326
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,150
from both<i> Voyager</i>
<i>and the Kazon.</i>

327
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,028
What was it doing there?

328
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,364
Preventing the tetryon reactor
from being destroyed.

329
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,283
Kes was right.

330
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,870
Something<i> was</i> going on.

331
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,582
<i>Voyager's</i> sensor logs were
damaged in the Kazon attack.
I can't be certain.

332
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,418
Maybe I can help.

333
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,628
The sensor records
off my ship

334
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,048
weren't damaged.
I can give them to you.

335
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,907
The tetryon reaction is stable.

336
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,868
Graviton field is set
for a 100 light-year jump.

337
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,787
The catapult's locking on
to him.

338
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,498
We're being hailed.
On screen.

339
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,668
I'll contact you the moment
I reenter normal space.

340
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,336
Thank you, Captain.

341
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,089
My pleasure.

342
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,423
Catapult is at full power.

343
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,216
Good-bye to you all.

344
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,972
Final launch sequence
has been initiated.

345
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,444
He's gone.
How long before we can
expect to hear from him?

346
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,363
If his vessel survived,
one or two hours.

347
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,449
Seven of Nine
to Commander Chakotay.

348
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,242
Go ahead.

349
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,954
I require your assistance
in the Astrometrics Lab.

350
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,498
On my way.

351
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,253
Computer,
seal the doors.

352
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,297
Deactivate all sensors
within this room.

353
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,799
Acknowledged.

354
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,843
What's this about?

355
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,053
I believe
<i>Voyager's</i> presence
in the Delta Quadrant

356
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,888
is no accident.
You and the crew

357
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,265
have been stranded here
intentionally.

358
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,267
By whom?

359
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,394
Captain Janeway.

360
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:54,443
The Captain and Tuvok
were involved in
a Federation conspiracy.

361
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,320
They're in collusion
with the Caretaker

362
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,364
and possibly
the Cardassians.

363
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,407
I see.

364
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,869
And the point
of this conspiracy?

365
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,578
I believe
they're attempting to establish

366
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,539
a military presence
in the Delta Quadrant.

367
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,332
That's quite a theory.

368
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,334
Perhaps you haven't heard
of the Jankata Accord.

369
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,128
"No species shall
enter another Quadrant

370
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,213
for the purpose
of territorial expansion."

371
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,299
The Federation signed it,
the Cardassians signed it,

372
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,427
and Captain Janeway would be
the last person to violate it.

373
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,804
Improbable as it may sound,

374
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,222
I've found compelling evidence

375
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,516
to support my theory.

376
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,601
What kind of evidence?

377
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,437
I've analyzed over 30 million
teraquads of data

378
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,315
regarding<i> Voyager's</i>
<i>activities over</i>
<i>the past five years.</i>

379
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,195
It's quite clear
that we've been the victim
of an elaborate deception.

380
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,947
I don't have the benefit
of a cortical processor.

381
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,658
Why don't you give me
the abridged version?

382
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,827
In the months before<i> Voyager's</i>
arrival,

383
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:49,540
Neelix recorded
the appearance of 52 vessels,
including this one.

384
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,459
CHAKOTAY:
A Cardassian warship.

385
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,337
A remarkable
coincidence.

386
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,381
Only days before
<i>Voyager's</i> arrival,

387
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,009
the Cardassians were already
in the Delta Quadrant.

388
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,054
The Caretaker was trying
to find a mate, remember?

389
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,598
He was pulling ships
from all over the galaxy.

390
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,892
I'm familiar
with the Caretaker's actions.

391
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,477
In each instance,
he would examine the crew's DNA

392
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,354
and when he failed
to find a genetic match,

393
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,357
he would release the vessel,
but in this instance,

394
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,610
Neelix's sensors indicated
the ship vanished.

395
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,697
Obviously, it was returned
to the Alpha Quadrant. Why?

396
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,657
You seem to have
all the answers.

397
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,785
I believe the Cardassians
were sent back

398
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,704
to deliver strategic information
regarding the Delta Quadrant.

399
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,415
Conjecture.
Extrapolation.

400
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,126
I can believe the Cardassians

401
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,419
might be involved in this,
but not Starfleet.

402
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,632
There are precedents
for unauthorized missions
of this type, Commander.

403
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,717
According
to the Federation database,

404
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,470
the Maquis were victims
of several of them.

405
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,558
All right,
you've got my attention.

406
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,438
You said that Tuvok and
Captain Janeway were involved.
Tell me how.

407
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,483
At the same time
the Cardassians were meeting
with the Caretaker,

408
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:01,112
your Maquis vessel
was infiltrated
with a Starfleet agent.

409
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,571
Tuvok.

410
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,158
Your navigator.
He guided your ship

411
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,076
to prearranged coordinates
in the Badlands,

412
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,745
where the Caretaker
locked onto you.

413
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,705
Once you were pulled
into the Delta Quadrant,

414
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,415
Tuvok could've
secretly transmitted

415
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,501
final instructions
to the Caretaker.

416
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,962
A short time later,
Captain Janeway
guided<i> Voyager</i>

417
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,674
to the same coordinates
and was also pulled
into the Delta Quadrant.

418
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,760
All of these events took place
within a matter of days.

419
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,512
I find that suspicious.

420
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,849
I'll admit, the timing seems
a little convenient,

421
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,350
but that doesn't mean
there was a master plan.

422
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,896
Why did the Captain
destroy the Array?

423
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,899
So the Kazon couldn't use it
to attack the Ocampa.

424
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,485
That's what she told the crew,
but I believe she intended

425
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,361
to remain
in the Delta Quadrant all along.

426
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,781
If the Array
had remained intact,

427
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,742
you and all the others
would have insisted on using it
to return home.

428
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,619
She was keeping it
from the Kazon.

429
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,289
The Captain ordered
Commander Tuvok

430
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,082
to destroy the Array.

431
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,710
He fired
two tricobalt devices.

432
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,508
Are those weapons
normally carried
on Federation starships?

433
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,720
No.
Yet they were part
of<i> Voyager's</i> arsenal.

434
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,013
Why?

435
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,015
I can't explain that.

436
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,390
I can.

437
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,143
Neither phasers nor torpedoes

438
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,478
are capable
of creating a tear in subspace.

439
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,357
A tricobalt device is.

440
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,609
As Tuvok detonated the device,
a cloaked ship locked on

441
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,611
to one of the Array's
tetryon reactors

442
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,489
and pushed it
through the tear
into subspace,

443
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,325
protecting it
from the blast,

444
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,078
and hiding it from<i> Voyager's</i>
sensors...

445
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,955
but the Captain
and Tuvok knew exactly
where it was going.

446
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,541
Once<i> Voyager</i> left
the area, the reactor
was retrieved

447
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,711
and began a similar journey
carried by a series of vessels,

448
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,006
until it was finally
delivered to Mr. Tash.

449
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,926
Who used it
to build the catapult.

450
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,178
He was waiting here
for<i> Voyager</i>

451
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,389
and for the final phase
of the mission.

452
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,724
Which is<i> what, exactly?</i>

453
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,018
I don't think
Captain Janeway is planning

454
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,520
to use the catapult to get
<i>Voyager</i> closer to home.

455
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,065
I think she's going to use it
to bring in more vessels

456
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,235
from the Alpha Quadrant.
If I'm correct,

457
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,237
this region of space
will soon be occupied

458
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,655
by a Federation-Cardassian
invasion force.

459
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,409
You've uncovered
some interesting facts,

460
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,744
but your interpretation
is farfetched.

461
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,122
These are random incidents.

462
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,624
Granted, some of them
are hard to explain,

463
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,667
but there's
no conspiracy here.

464
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,544
Stardate 51008.

465
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,298
Captain Janeway allows Kes
to leave<i> Voyager.</i>

466
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,508
Neelix told me
that Kes had suspicions
about the Caretaker.

467
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,468
Was the Captain trying
to silence her?

468
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,470
Stardate 51462.

469
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,932
The Doctor's program
is transmitted to
a Starfleet vessel

470
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,934
on the outskirts
of the Alpha Quadrant--

471
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,145
an attempt by the Captain
to contact Earth,

472
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,315
or a secret communiqué
informing Starfleet
of her progress?

473
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,233
Stardate 50984.

474
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,860
Janeway forges an alliance
with the Borg.

475
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,156
Stardate 51762.
A cease-fire with the Hirogen.

476
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,907
Stardate 52861.

477
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,492
A non-aggression pact
with the Terkellian.

478
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,912
She called each incident,
"diplomacy."

479
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,539
I believe she was trying
to establish a tactical
infrastructure

480
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,167
in the Delta Quadrant.

481
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,252
Over the past five years,
Captain Janeway

482
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:06,964
has altered course 263 times
in the name of exploration.

483
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,715
In reality,
she was mapping the region

484
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,426
and collecting
strategic data regarding...

485
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:11,802
I get the point.

486
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,596
You still doubt my suspicions,

487
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,974
but can you be certain
I'm wrong?

488
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,976
<i>Absolutely</i> certain?

489
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,396
No.

490
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,023
Until you are,

491
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,732
you mustn't allow
Captain Janeway

492
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,152
to retain control
of the catapult.

493
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,499
I'm picking up a transmission,
heavily distorted.

494
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,833
He made it.

495
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,335
Can you clear it up?

496
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,963
TASH:
Success, Captain--

497
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,840
5,000 light-years.

498
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,758
Are you all right?

499
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,136
A few systems overloaded--
nothing serious.

500
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,514
I had to readjust my shields
during mid-flight--

501
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,057
almost lost my outer hull.

502
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,226
I'm sending you
the modifications.

503
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,269
My catapult is yours, Captain.

504
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,562
Good luck.

505
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,317
Get that data down to B'Elanna.

506
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,403
Tell her
to enhance our shields.

507
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,406
So we're going ahead
with the jump?

508
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,283
I want to run
a few more tests,
launch some probes,

509
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,036
but if it all checks out,
I see no reason not to.

510
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,372
I've received
the telemetry.

511
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,374
I'll take it
to Engineering.

512
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,299
I want you to add
a .03 variance

513
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,510
to these shield
modifications.

514
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,136
That'll disrupt
the emitters.

515
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,888
And you'll need
another six hours

516
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,015
to get them back
on line, I know.

517
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,808
Have you run this
by the Captain?

518
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,976
No...

519
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,770
and I'm not going to...

520
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,397
not yet.

521
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,072
She's pulling your leg.

522
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,451
It-it's got to be some kind
of Borg practical joke.

523
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,494
(<i> sighs</i> ):
She wasn't joking.

524
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:04,039
A secret mission?
Starfleet in league
with the Caretaker?

525
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:07,960
It's ridiculous.

526
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,046
"Ridiculous"?
Seven has some
compelling evidence.

527
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,549
Well, then,
let's go to the Captain,
get a straight answer.

528
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,552
"Good morning, Kathryn.
All systems
are operational.

529
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,845
"The crew's
in good health.
And by the way,

530
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,807
is it true
you've been lying
to us for five years?"

531
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,351
(<i> sighs</i> )

532
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,357
I'm not prepared
to make that accusation,

533
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,818
but I can't ignore
what I've heard, either.

534
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,783
So, what do you suggest?

535
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,244
I want you to delay
those shield modifications.

536
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,913
That'll give me time
to check Seven's database,

537
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,040
take a look
at the evidence myself.

538
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

539
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,669
The Captain asked me
to work with you on the shields.

540
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,880
That won't be
necessary, Ensign.

541
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,883
Oh, I don't mind.
Oh, you know how eager she is
to make that jump.

542
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,052
Harry, we're fine here.

543
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,639
"Too many cooks," Harry.

544
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,098
You know how it is.

545
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,309
We'll let you know
when we're done.

546
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,810
(<i> sighs</i> )

547
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,818
COMPUTER:
Download complete.

548
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,740
Seven of Nine
to Captain Janeway.

549
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,493
JANEWAY:
Go ahead.

550
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,578
I need to speak with you
in the Astrometrics Lab.

551
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,413
I'm on my way.

552
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,130
Computer, seal the door
and deactivate internal
sensors to this room.

553
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,299
Acknowledged.
Seven?

554
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,510
I believe Chakotay
and other members of your crew

555
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,304
are involved in
a conspiracy to resurrect
the Maquis Rebellion.

556
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,931
Did Chakotay put
you up to this?

557
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,686
<i>Voyager</i> and
the Federation itself
are in grave danger.

558
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,146
Go on.

559
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,023
I've concluded
that Chakotay intends

560
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,692
to use the catapult
to launch attacks

561
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,985
against Cardassian
and Federation starships.

562
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,654
Chakotay gave up
his allegiance

563
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,447
to the Maquis
a long time ago.

564
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,241
What you're saying
makes no sense.

565
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,617
Improbable as it may sound,

566
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,951
I found
compelling evidence

567
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,496
to support my theory.

568
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,873
In the months
before<i> Voyager's</i> arrival,

569
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,625
Neelix recorded
the sudden appearance

570
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,212
of 52 vessels...
including this one.

571
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,132
JANEWAY:
A Cardassian warship.

572
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,552
I've analyzed
the hull geometry
and warp signature.

573
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,178
It was one
of the same ships

574
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,846
that were pursuing Chakotay
and his crew

575
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,557
in the region known
as the Badlands.

576
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,225
It was pulled
into the Delta Quadrant

577
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,018
by the Caretaker
during that engagement.

578
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,104
According
to Federation records,

579
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,566
that same Cardassian warship
was found destroyed
in the Badlands.

580
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,694
The investigation revealed
that it was attacked
by the Maquis.

581
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,696
I believe that,
for some unknown reason,

582
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:43,115
the Caretaker had
sent this ship back
to the Alpha Quadrant,

583
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,158
and that Commander Chakotay
attacked the vessel

584
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,077
before it could reach
its destination.

585
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,037
He downloaded its computer core

586
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,457
and discovered the presence
of the Caretaker's Array.

587
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,209
He realized that
the Array could be used
by the Maquis as a weapon

588
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,420
to launch surprise attacks
against Cardassian

589
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,338
<i>and</i> Starfleet vessels.

590
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,719
Well, I commend you
for your imagination,

591
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,764
but Tuvok was a spy
on Chakotay's ship.

592
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,891
If your theory were true,
he would have known
about it.

593
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,436
He does. Tuvok has
been collaborating

594
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,354
with the Maquis resistance
all along.

595
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,106
That's not possible, Seven.

596
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,525
With Tuvok's assistance,
Chakotay plotted a course

597
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,487
toward the next likely
appearance of the Caretaker's
displacement wave,

598
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,447
offering his vessel as bait.

599
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,407
His ploy almost succeeded,

600
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,660
but the Caretaker was more
powerful than he anticipated.

601
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,869
His crew was taken captive.

602
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,789
A few days later,<i> Voyager</i>
arrived

603
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,791
and facilitated their escape.

604
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,626
Chakotay seized that opportunity

605
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,587
to make one last attempt
to gain control of the Array,

606
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,631
but then you gave the order
to destroy it.

607
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,967
Circumstantial evidence--
not proof.

608
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,595
Who carried out your order
to destroy the Array?

609
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,722
Tuvok.
Using what type of technology?

610
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,517
Tricobalt devices.

611
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,728
He set the yield
to 20,000 teracochranes.

612
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,606
It was enough to tear
an opening in subspace.

613
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,941
A cloaked ship locked on
to one of the reactors,

614
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,195
protecting it from
the blast and hiding it
from<i> Voyager's</i> sensors.

615
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,365
The reactor was retrieved
and carried by a series
of vessels,

616
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,116
until it was delivered
to Mr. Tash,

617
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,909
who was well-compensated
by Chakotay

618
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,578
to build the catapult.

619
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,831
He was waiting here
for<i> Voyager,</i>

620
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,666
so Chakotay could complete
the mission

621
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,168
he was forced to abandon
five years ago.

622
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,840
I'd be willing to consider
this theory of yours...

623
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,260
if I didn't know Chakotay
as well as I do.

624
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,014
There is no one on this ship
I trust more.

625
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:37,020
What you've done here
is build what we call
a house of cards.

626
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,189
Stardate 48658.

627
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,192
Commander Seska is revealed
to be a Cardassian spy.

628
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:46,363
She defects to the Kazon
and impregnates herself
with Chakotay's DNA.

629
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,407
Was he unaware of the procedure,
as he claims,

630
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,368
or were they working together
to create a new Kazon sect

631
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,661
to capture<i> Voyager?</i>

632
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,371
Stardate 49522.

633
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,039
Chakotay recommends
establishing

634
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,916
trade relations
with the Kolhari.

635
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,669
Their technology uses
tetryon power cells.

636
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,671
A simple diplomatic
overture,

637
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,507
or was he seeking a source of
energy for the catapult?

638
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,967
Stardate 49571...

639
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,690
Seven.

640
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,316
Naomi Wildman.

641
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,069
Where are you going?
That's not your concern.

642
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,654
What's wrong?

643
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,492
Your father was Ktarian.
So?

644
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,994
The Ktarians were officially
with the Federation,

645
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,205
but they sympathized
with the Maquis.

646
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,916
What are you talking about?

647
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,376
Who are you working for,
Chakotay or the Captain?

648
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,961
Seven...

649
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,756
Tell them it's too late. Go!

650
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,645
I picked up a power surge
coming from the Cargo Bay.

651
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,105
I detected
the same thing.

652
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,566
You think it's the
enhanced alcove?

653
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,734
Could be.

654
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,444
Let's take a look.

655
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,491
Are phasers standard
equipment on board now?

656
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,159
Must be.

657
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,287
The data buffer's
been activated.

658
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,915
I wanted to make
sure it wasn't
malfunctioning.

659
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,875
Well, you should
be careful.

660
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:25,587
Somebody might think
you were trying to
delete a few files.

661
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,173
Why would they
think that?

662
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:32,427
Some of those files
could contain
sensitive information.

663
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,263
If that's true,
somebody might think

664
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,390
you were trying to do
the same thing.

665
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,143
That catapult out there--

666
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,229
it's a powerful piece
of technology.

667
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:47,400
If the Maquis ever had access
to something like it,

668
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,361
they might
have been successful.

669
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:53,281
And if we had, your mission
to the Delta Quadrant

670
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,993
never would have gotten
off the drawing board.

671
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,995
What are you talking about?

672
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,288
The mission
you've been on for
the last five years.

673
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,458
My only mission is trying
to get<i> Voyager</i> home.

674
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,043
Seven showed me
the sensor records.

675
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,545
I saw
the tractor beam.

676
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,213
She showed me the same thing,

677
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,340
but she implicated you

678
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,843
in some kind of Maquis plot.

679
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,804
(<i> sighs</i> )

680
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,682
Same evidence.

681
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,560
Two different
theories.

682
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,646
It all started
with those damn photonic fleas.

683
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,106
She was downloading
<i>Voyager's</i> database...

684
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,483
KIM:
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

685
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,068
Go ahead, Harry.

686
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,862
I just picked up
an unauthorized launch

687
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,196
of the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

688
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,698
Seven's at the helm.

689
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,783
Set a pursuit course.
Acknowledged.

690
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,785
Chakotay to the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Sick Bay here.

691
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:42,288
Get down to Cargo Bay 2.
Run a diagnostic
on Seven's alcove.

692
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,665
On my way.

693
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,250
I'm glad we got
that settled.

694
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,085
Likewise.
Chakotay...

695
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,838
let's keep this one
out of our logs, huh?

696
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,214
Gladly.

697
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,150
She's altering course,
heading for the catapult.

698
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,653
Maintain pursuit.
Open a channel.

699
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,113
No response.

700
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,782
Try to beam her out.

701
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,784
She's done something to
alter her bio-signature.

702
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,285
I can't get a lock.

703
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,662
Target her propulsion
and weapons.

704
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,414
Fire.

705
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,422
Our targeting scanners
are out of alignment.

706
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,883
She must have done it
before she took off.

707
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,176
She's charging weapons.
Keep trying.

708
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,262
Doctor to Captain Janeway.
Report.

709
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,933
Seven downloaded too much data
into her cortical implant.

710
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:46,061
She's trying to make sense
of more information
than she can process.

711
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:49,522
Understood. Beam me
onto the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

712
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,150
I'm going with you.
No. I have a better chance

713
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,902
of getting through
to her alone.

714
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,195
This isn't part of
your mission, is it?

715
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,948
Is it part of yours?

716
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,283
Good luck.

717
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,576
Energize.

718
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,501
Captain.

719
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,297
You came here
hoping to stop me.

720
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,174
You'll fail.

721
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,635
Turn this ship around.
That's an order.

722
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:22,639
Your orders are irrelevant.
I'm no longer under
your command.

723
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,599
You deceived me.

724
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,852
There is no
conspiracy.

725
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,521
There is no
Maquis rebellion.

726
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,524
The Federation isn't
planning to invade
the Delta Quadrant.

727
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,695
I realize that, because
I finally uncovered
your true objective.

728
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,196
And what's that?

729
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,365
Me.

730
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,284
Stardate 32611.

731
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,244
The Federation
sends my parents

732
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,122
<i>to study the Borg</i>
<i>collective.</i>

733
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,999
<i>They know my family</i>
<i>will be assimilated.</i>

734
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,876
<i>That was their intention.</i>

735
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,544
Stardate 48317.

736
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,420
<i>Voyager</i> is sent
to the Delta Quadrant

737
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,215
with orders to retrieve me.
When they reach Borg space,

738
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,259
<i>Captain Janeway negotiates</i>
<i>an alliance with</i>
<i>the collective</i>

739
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,889
in exchange for information
regarding Species 8472.

740
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,641
They agree to give her
Seven of Nine.

741
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,102
Stardate 51030.

742
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,354
Janeway extracts
the implants from my body

743
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,981
<i>to remove</i>
<i>any knowledge I have</i>

744
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,524
<i>of her agreement</i>
<i>with the Borg.</i>

745
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,275
Stardate 53329.

746
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,071
Captain Janeway finalizes plans
to use the catapult

747
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,322
to deliver Seven of Nine
to the Alpha Quadrant,

748
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,076
where Starfleet will dissect
and analyze the drone

749
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,661
to gather tactical data
to fight the Borg.

750
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,455
I won't allow you
to complete your mission.

751
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:34,252
If necessary,
I'll destroy the catapult,
and myself.

752
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,091
You're right, Seven.

753
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,718
There<i> is</i> a
conspiracy here,

754
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,679
but I believe it's
a conspiracy of one.

755
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,975
I've got a theory
of my own.

756
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,145
Your modified alcove

757
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,689
threw your synaptic
patterns into chaos,

758
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,984
and your mind
can't make sense
of all the information,

759
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,486
so you're generating
theory after theory

760
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,156
in an attempt to bring
order to that chaos.

761
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,367
Your reasoning is flawed.
My alcove is functioning
perfectly.

762
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,994
What about you?

763
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,955
You're not a drone anymore.

764
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,497
You can't always predict

765
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,542
how Borg technology
will affect you.

766
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,253
You should be in Sick Bay,

767
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,755
not behind that
force field.

768
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,839
Let me help you.

769
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,674
No.

770
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,636
I don't believe you.
Of course you don't.

771
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,765
Anything I say gets woven into
your paranoid conspiracies,

772
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,767
but you should believe me,
Seven,

773
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,394
because I've never lied to you.

774
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,313
And I'm not lying to you now.

775
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,984
You have to put
your doubts aside

776
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,443
and trust me.

777
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,698
Stardate 51030.

778
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,701
Seven of Nine is severed
from the hive mind.

779
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,329
The Captain tells
her not to resist,

780
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,415
that she'll learn
to accept her humanity.

781
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,375
Seven complies

782
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,879
and slowly begins
to embrace her individuality.

783
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,591
Does she regret
that decision?

784
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:07,179
Stardate 51652.

785
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,016
The Captain encourages Seven
to develop her social skills.

786
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,769
Seven insists
it's a waste of time,

787
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,688
but after further requests,
she pursues it

788
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:21,067
and begins to develop her
first human friendships.

789
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,862
Did Janeway lead her astray?

790
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,700
Stardate 52840.

791
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,745
The Captain orders Seven
to study her parents' journals.

792
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,497
Seven claims
they're irrelevant,

793
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,333
but eventually
she reads them

794
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,044
and rediscovers part
of her own past.

795
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,796
Stardate 52841.

796
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,383
For the first time,

797
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,680
Seven tells the Captain...
"thank you."

798
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:59,022
It was Stardate 52842...

799
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,109
0600 hours in the Mess Hall.

800
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,946
We had just finished breakfast.

801
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,990
My mistake.

802
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,202
Stardate today.

803
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,121
Janeway beams aboard
the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

804
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,792
She reminds Seven of the bond
that's grown between them.

805
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,670
Seven lowers
the force field

806
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,714
and she decides
to come home.

807
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,134
All I'm asking

808
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,179
is that you trust me again.

809
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,282
<i>Delta Flyer</i>
<i>to Voyager.</i>

810
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,242
Two to beam out.

811
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,289
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

812
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,791
<i>After further testing,</i>
<i>we activated the catapult</i>

813
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,877
<i>and were hurtled across</i>
<i>30 sectors of space.</i>

814
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,381
<i>In less than an hour,</i>
<i>we cut three years</i>
<i>off our journey.</i>

815
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:09,759
<i>I'm happy to say the Doctor</i>
<i>has repaired Seven of Nine's</i>
<i>cortical processor,</i>

816
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,095
<i>and she's returned to duty.</i>

817
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:16,224
Guess who assimilated
three books and ten
reports in two days?

818
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,434
Naomi Wildman.

819
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,185
That's correct.

820
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,605
Are you taking your
new alcove apart?

821
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,317
Yes.
Why?

822
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,569
My attempt to download<i> Voyager's</i>
database failed.

823
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,280
Maybe you can fix it.

824
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,826
The alcove functioned
within expected parameters.

825
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,455
Unfortunately, I did not.

826
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,209
Three books
and ten reports
is impressive,

827
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,129
but quantity is less
relevant than quality.

828
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,465
You must be able
to interpret the data

829
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,758
and enjoy the process.

830
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,845
Regardless,
you require activities

831
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,473
other than assimilating
books and reports.

832
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,558
A game of Kadis-Kot,
for example.

833
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,935
When?

834
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,312
Go to the Mess Hall

835
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,688
and set up the board.

836
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,690
I'll join you when I'm finished.

837
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,781
I heard the strangest
rumor today.

838
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,327
Apparently, the Captain
and First Officer

839
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,371
almost came to blows.

840
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,080
Mutiny?

841
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,749
First Officer
walked the plank.

842
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,460
So I heard.

843
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,215
I don't believe
a word of it.

844
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,590
Me, neither.

845
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,304
Seven was
malfunctioning.

846
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,390
We don't have that excuse.

847
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,725
You're right.

848
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:44,229
We've been through too much
to stop trusting each other.

849
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,859
You didn't poison
the coffee, did you?

850
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,487
Not any more than I usually do.
