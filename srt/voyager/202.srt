00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:07,090
CHAKOTAY:
<i>First officer's personal log,</i>
<i>stardate 49005.3.</i>

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,593
<i>The captain has granted me</i>
<i>the use of a shuttlecraft</i>

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,553
<i>so that I may</i>
<i>perform the</i> Pakra--

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,014
<i>a solitary ritual</i>
<i>commemorating the anniversary</i>

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,432
<i>of my father's death.</i>

6
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,047
<i>A-koo-chee-moya.</i>

7
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:53,679
I pray on this day of memories
to speak to my father--

8
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,100
the one whom the wind
called Kolopak.

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,689
Though I am far from his bones,
perhaps there is a spirit

10
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,275
in these unnamed skies
who will find him

11
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,444
and honor him with my song.

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,289
<i>A-koo-chee-moya.</i>

13
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,543
There. You see?

14
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,170
We should teach
them the price

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,215
of displaying their
markings in our space.

16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,550
I'll go.

17
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,176
Let Kar do it this time.

18
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,887
He's not ready.
He thinks he is.

19
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,638
He's been demanding
a chance for weeks

20
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,139
to earn his name.

21
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,017
Do you really believe
he could do this?

22
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,394
Can you honestly say
you knew you were ready

23
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,064
for your first mission,
Haliz?

24
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:48,609
Tell him. Tell him
today's the day

25
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,945
he will finally
be called Ogla.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,460
( phasers blasting )

27
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,048
COMPUTER:
<i>The shuttlecraft</i>
<i>has sustained phaser fire.</i>

28
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,466
<i>Minor damage to aft shields.</i>

29
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,926
Source?

30
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>A Kazon spacecraft,</i>
<i>closing at 195, mark 6.</i>

31
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,902
Computer, open a channel
to the Kazon vessel.

32
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,737
This is Commander Chakotay

33
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,239
of the Federation
starship<i> Voyager.</i>

34
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,699
Why have you fired on me?

35
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,368
<i>You are in Kazon-Ogla space,</i>
<i>Federation.</i>

36
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,246
I wasn't aware of that.
I have no hostile intentions.

37
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,790
Power down your weapons
and I'll leave.

38
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,127
<i>No one who violates</i>
<i>Ogla space leaves.</i>

39
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,838
Look, son, my starship is only
a few light years away.

40
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,132
<i>I am not your son,</i>
<i>Federation.</i>

41
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,425
<i>I am your executioner.</i>

42
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,345
( phasers blasting )

43
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,371
Chakotay to Kazon vessel.

44
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,831
Listen carefully.

45
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,708
I do not want a fight.

46
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,254
Stand down, or I'll be
forced to return fire.

47
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,923
( phasers blasting )

48
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,862
Chakotay to Kazon vessel.

49
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,656
I have established

50
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,699
a direct weapons lock
on your engine core.

51
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,243
This is my final warning.

52
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,746
If you don't stand down,
I will destroy your ship.

53
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,419
All right.

54
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,255
If that's the way
you want to play it.

55
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,807
Chakotay to Kazon vessel.

56
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,225
Do you read me?

57
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,351
Computer,
are there any life signs

58
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,854
inside the Kazon vessel?

59
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,897
<i>Affirmative. One life sign.</i>

60
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,775
Kazon ship,
your engine core is critical.

61
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,028
You have less than 30 seconds to
evacuate.

62
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,737
Do you read me?

63
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,074
If you have an escape pod,
you must eject now.

64
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,205
Computer, establish
a transporter lock

65
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,914
on the life-form.

66
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,125
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>Targeting scanners.</i>

67
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,336
Prepare to beam him aboard.

68
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,129
<i>Scanners locked.</i>

69
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,463
Energize.

70
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,353
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

71
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,442
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

72
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,278
Computer, damage report.

73
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,156
<i>Long-range communications,</i>
<i>lateral sensor array</i>

74
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,408
<i>and aft shields are off-line.</i>

75
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,744
Great!

76
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,081
Welcome aboard.

77
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,511
It's not that I feel

78
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,180
that i'm not
making contributions

79
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,849
as chef and morale officer.

80
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,769
You're making significant
contributions, Neelix.

81
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,230
Well, if you insist, but...

82
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,773
I can't imagine how
Lieutenant Ayala

83
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,316
would be handling
the separation

84
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,360
from his children
without you.

85
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,280
He misses his boys terribly.

86
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,156
I wish I could do more for him.

87
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,449
And your meals

88
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,825
are getting to be...

89
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,369
yes?

90
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,372
Almost certainly...

91
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,207
a highlight of every day.

92
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,085
Oh, Captain!

93
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,254
You always know
how to touch one's heart.

94
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,214
Thank you.

95
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,882
When I signed on

96
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,467
I promised you that...

97
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,223
I promised you
that I would stand by your side

98
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,892
through every danger
this quadrant has to offer--

99
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,560
as guide,
as strategist

100
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,271
as explorer,
as adventurer...

101
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,814
Yes?

102
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,320
I feel...

103
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,863
under-utilized.

104
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,408
I can swashbuckle
with the best of them.

105
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,784
You weren't invited

106
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,287
to the holodeck defense
simulations, were you?

107
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,746
No!

108
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,790
TUVOK:
Captain, you are needed
on the bridge.

109
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,584
On my way. I'll see to it
you're invited next time.

110
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,463
And now, Mr. Neelix, please--
join me on the bridge.

111
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,674
Yes, sir...
ma'am... captain.

112
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
We are ready to depart.

113
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,305
However, Commander Chakotay
has still not returned.

114
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,555
Have you tried
hailing him?

115
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,516
On all frequencies,
no response.

116
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,352
When was the last time
we heard from him?

117
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,020
More than six hours ago.

118
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,235
Well, according to
his flight plan

119
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,403
he's not far.

120
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,030
We'll just have
to go get him.

121
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,199
I want all away teams
back on board now.

122
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,533
Mr. Paris,
plot a course

123
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,327
for Chakotay's
last known coordinates.

124
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,661
Aye, captain.

125
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,919
( grunting )

126
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,219
What am I doing here?

127
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,973
You're welcome.
What?

128
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,183
It's a human expression.

129
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,976
You thank me for
saving your life

130
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,769
I say, "you're welcome."

131
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,813
( yelling )

132
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,735
I accept your surrender.

133
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,988
Look! I promise you,
as soon

134
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,407
as we get back to<i> Voyager</i>

135
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,534
we'll find a Kazon ship
and hand you over them.

136
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,248
You should have let me die.

137
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,250
I'm not in the habit
of killing children.

138
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,712
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning. Alien vessel</i>
<i>approaching at 022 mark 8.</i>

139
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,633
What's your name, son?

140
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,927
What?

141
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,554
Your name?

142
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,431
Why do you want
to know my name?

143
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,558
I want to let them know
you're on board.

144
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,107
I'm called Kar.

145
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,234
Computer open
a channel.

146
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,657
Kazon vessel, I have a young man
on board you might know.

147
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,035
He goes by the name of Kar.

148
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,205
I'd say
he's about 13.

149
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,790
I'd like to arrange
for his transfer

150
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,834
before I return to my ship.

151
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,670
Computer, confirm
channel is open.

152
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,633
<i>Confirmed.</i>
<i>Transmission has been received.</i>

153
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,969
Talk to them.
Tell them you're okay.

154
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:43,810
<i>Warning. Kazon vessel</i>
<i>has engaged a tractor beam.</i>

155
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,270
Full reverse.

156
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,813
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

157
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,984
<i>Tractor force exceeds</i>
<i>available engine power.</i>

158
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,612
They're pulling us in.

159
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,904
Kill me.

160
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,076
Please!

161
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,166
Why are you so eager
for me to kill you?

162
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,922
Because there are worse things
than being killed by your enemy.

163
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,730
CHAKOTAY:
Look, if you check your
long-range sensors.

164
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,941
You'll find a big ship
out there.

165
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,821
It's called<i> Voyager,</i> and by now,
it's on its way to find me.

166
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,157
Kar. I told Razik
you weren't ready.

167
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,159
I have a fair idea
of why I'm here

168
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,785
but why are they
doing this to you?

169
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,703
I was ready, Haliz.

170
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,081
Ready to kill or die.

171
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,916
I felt the flames
touch my skin.

172
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,127
Go back in, Kar.

173
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,220
It was this fool.

174
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,431
This... Federation,
who doesn't even have

175
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,141
the courage to kill
his enemies.

176
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,018
He pulled me out

177
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,978
with that transporter
we've heard about.

178
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,363
Like the Nistrim
and Relora before you...

179
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,491
you come into our space,
showing off your uniforms

180
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,662
and displaying the markings
of your Federation

181
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,205
with no respect

182
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:31,334
as if you own
this part of space.

183
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,960
But it belongs to us!

184
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,177
I tried to kill him Haliz!

185
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,429
( grunts )

186
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,433
( weapon cocking )

187
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,226
I want to see Razik.

188
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,897
Tell Razik
I demand to see him.

189
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,235
Who's Razik?

190
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,115
You tell this Razik

191
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,326
that Federation Commander
Chakotay demands to see him.

192
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,704
What are you doing?

193
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,331
Razik is obviously your leader.

194
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,459
I'm hoping if he's strong
enough to be in command

195
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,045
he's wise enough
to listen to reason.

196
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,340
( laughing )

197
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,925
You see this?

198
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,511
This is debris
from a Nistrim frigate.

199
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,139
The man you are demanding
to see destroyed it

200
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,683
killing more than 100
in a single shot.

201
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,603
Before that, his
name was only Ra.

202
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,897
Now he is called Jal Razik.

203
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,817
And this tunic belonged
to a Relora warrior.

204
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,320
He was killed
by the bare hands

205
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,615
of another Ogla,
called only Hali.

206
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,367
Now that man is
called Jal Haliz

207
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,620
one of our
greatest fighters.

208
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,954
And this bracelet belonged

209
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,999
to the man
who killed my brother.

210
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,377
My brother, Jal Kinell...

211
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,881
who earned his Ogla name
by dying bravely in battle

212
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:05,428
but I... I will never earn
my name in life or in death

213
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,097
and I have you
to thank for that.

214
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,943
We're approaching Chakotay's
last known coordinates, captain.

215
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,321
All stop.
Full sensor scan, Mr. Kim.

216
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,283
I'm picking up
floating debris

217
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,369
composed of
duranium, magnesite

218
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,620
and electroceramics.

219
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,956
Also heavy traces
of carbon residue.

220
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,500
Bridge to
engineering.

221
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,669
Prepare to receive debris
samples for analysis.

222
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,421
TORRES:
<i>Aye, captain.</i>

223
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,756
Transport complete.

224
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,676
Captain, I am detecting

225
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,969
an ion trail leading away
from this location.

226
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,429
Chakotay's shuttle?

227
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,807
The signature of the radiation
is not consistent

228
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,933
with Federation
propulsion systems.

229
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,186
PARIS:
So what are we saying here?

230
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,980
That someone blew up Chakotay's
shuttle and then took off?

231
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,358
That's speculation, Mr. Paris

232
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,235
but that trail's
the only clue we have

233
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,112
to Chakotay's
whereabouts.

234
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,365
Laying in a course.
Engage.

235
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,131
Hello, Kar.

236
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,974
I never thought
I would see you like this.

237
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,228
It was not my fault.
It was his technology.

238
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,231
Don't make excuses, Kar.

239
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,650
An Ogla has no room
for excuses.

240
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,488
No. No excuses.

241
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,490
I forgive you.

242
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,158
Know that in your heart.

243
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,455
No, please...

244
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,710
( anguished moan )

245
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,467
RAZIK:
You will eat
at my right hand tonight.

246
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,347
Why did you save him?

247
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,476
It's a very ineffective
way of waging war.

248
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,269
I'm not at war with you.

249
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,147
I wish I could
say the same.

250
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,107
We're not familiar
with this part of space.

251
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:27,194
If I'd seen a map identifying
this as Kazon-Ogla territory

252
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,155
I wouldn't have been
anywhere near it.

253
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:34,118
Unfortunately our territorial
claims change every day.

254
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:38,164
Maps do not
serve us well.

255
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,667
You did him a great disservice,
you know.

256
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,251
I guess if he
had killed me

257
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,338
my uniform would have made
you all a fine trophy.

258
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,591
Your uniform may yet
decorate our wall.

259
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,384
You may not think

260
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,472
you're at war with us,
Federation Commander Chakotay

261
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,933
but everything you are
is a threat to us.

262
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,392
The Kazon fought long and hard

263
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,771
for their independence
from uniforms like yours.

264
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,107
Uniforms, maybe,
but not like mine.

265
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:10,697
Your uniforms, your laws,
your technology.

266
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,573
You are not welcome here.

267
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,913
Get him something to eat.

268
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,040
The execution is tonight.

269
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,976
JANEWAY:
Well?

270
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,144
Most of the debris
we've examined

271
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,146
is composed of
a polyduranide alloy

272
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,940
which isn't used
in the construction

273
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,525
of Federation spacecraft.

274
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,152
So it wasn't Chakotay's
shuttle that was destroyed.

275
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,905
This ship was Kazon.

276
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,622
You get them
involved young, Haliz.

277
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,916
As soon as
they're old enough

278
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,834
to protect their
younger siblings.

279
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,552
So they brought you here
to see your first human.

280
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,096
Take a good look--

281
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,265
you won't see
any hate in my eyes.

282
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,727
I'm a gentle man
from a gentle people

283
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,978
who wish you no harm.

284
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,563
RAZIK:
That's enough!

285
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,941
I know you'd like them
to hate me, Razik, but I want

286
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,984
their first impression
of humans to be a good one.

287
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,111
You've been brought here
to learn what it means

288
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,907
to be a Kazon male.

289
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,533
You all know Kar.

290
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,493
You've learned
to fight together

291
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,703
haven't you?

292
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,080
Kar was sent
to kill this man

293
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,958
to earn his Ogla name

294
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,002
but Kar failed
and will not earn his name

295
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,130
even in death.

296
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,299
Who would be willing
to kill the human?

297
00:18:55,175 --> 00:19:00,514
So much for first impressions,
Federation.

298
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,100
I'm proud of you.

299
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,644
Each will get
your chance someday.

300
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,522
But that's not what
we're here for today.

301
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:14,988
We are here to learn
the price of failure in battle.

302
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,906
Take it.

303
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,741
What for?

304
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,244
So you can kill Kar as you
should have done in battle.

305
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,748
You want me to kill a child
in front of other children.

306
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,792
What would it accomplish?

307
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,462
It will teach these little boys
an important lesson.

308
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,799
And after you do that,
you'll be free to go.

309
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,011
You may think
I want your friend Kar to die

310
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,887
but you'd be wrong.

311
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,850
I've seen too many Ogla die
at the hands of our enemies.

312
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,392
That is why
you must learn there are

313
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,104
no second chances in battle.

314
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,774
That is why Kar must die.

315
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,988
If I refuse?

316
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,095
( weapons cocking )

317
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,058
I'll be needing
my shuttle back.

318
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,684
Do you really think
you can escape us

319
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,310
in the little vessel of yours?

320
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,937
That's a chance
I'm willing to take.

321
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,814
What about you?

322
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,649
Let the coward run.

323
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,526
Prepare his shuttle.

324
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,410
Want to come?

325
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,162
There doesn't seem
to be much of a future

326
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,454
for you here.

327
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,831
He'd rather die than run

328
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:52,210
like a Calogan dog with you,
Federation.

329
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,761
If I stay here,
I'll die without a name

330
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,889
and Razik taught me only cowards
die without a name.

331
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,600
You won't find your name running
after the Federation, Kar.

332
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,145
Maybe not, but that's a chance
I'm willing to take.

333
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,236
I'll show you how to disable
the weapons system.

334
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,079
Will Razik
be all right?

335
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,414
Don't worry.
He's only stunned.

336
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,166
( weapons blasting )

337
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,542
Didn't take them long

338
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,294
to get those weapons
back on line, did it?

339
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,879
Computer,
prepare to go to warp.

340
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,924
No. Their ship is much
clumsier at lower speeds.

341
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,968
We should try
to outmaneuver them.

342
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,261
You're the boss.

343
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,307
Initiate evasive pattern
theta two. Full impulse.

344
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,017
I can give you
the shield frequencies

345
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,227
of their ship.

346
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,812
We can hit them
back easily.

347
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,189
It may mean something to you
to die a violent death

348
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,398
but I'd like to get out of this

349
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,900
without killing
or being killed.

350
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,069
You'd rather die in your
sleep a wrinkled old man?

351
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,361
Sounds about right.

352
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,658
Computer, damage report.

353
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,078
<i>Aft shields at 63%.</i>

354
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,579
We're not going
to make it like this.

355
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,499
Computer, scan for
an M-Class atmosphere.

356
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,837
<i>There is an M-Class moon</i>
<i>at bearing 108, mark 18.</i>

357
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,339
Distance 1.9 million kilometers.

358
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,175
That's Tarok.

359
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,760
Where the Ogla conduct
training exercises.

360
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,847
Anybody training
there now?

361
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,184
Computer, lay in a course
to the moon.

362
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,144
Evasive pattern omega one.

363
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,561
Maximum impulse.

364
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,740
<i>Warning: aft shields</i>
<i>have been penetrated.</i>

365
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,076
Computer, prepare
for long-range transport.

366
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,744
Two to beam to the surface.

367
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,079
<i>Transport is not recommended.</i>

368
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,414
<i>The moon is out</i>
<i>of safety range.</i>

369
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,598
TUVOK:
Captain, the ion trail
is beginning to dissipate.

370
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,309
All stop.

371
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,810
KIM:
I'm picking up debris again.

372
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:19,148
More duranium, magnesite,
carbon residue...

373
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,567
it's the remnants
of another ship.

374
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,777
Bridge to engineering.

375
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,446
Lieutenant Torres, prepare to
receive another debris sample.

376
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,698
TORRES:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

377
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,616
KIM:
Transport underway.

378
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,244
[TRANSPORTERS SOUNDING]

379
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,454
Torres to bridge.

380
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,123
Sample received.

381
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,792
JANEWAY:
<i>Let me know when you've</i>
<i>got something, B'Elanna.</i>

382
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,587
I've got something right now.

383
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:45,216
<i>It's a piece</i>
<i>of Chakotay's shuttle.</i>

384
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,842
( sighs )

385
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,226
( groaning )

386
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,941
Kar...

387
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,276
It worked?

388
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,365
The computer said the transport
wasn't recommended.

389
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:13,786
Didn't say
it was impossible.

390
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,537
With any luck

391
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,707
Razik will think we
didn't survive the explosion

392
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,920
then maybe you'll get your
name for dying in battle.

393
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,047
In battle?!

394
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,300
That wasn't a battle!

395
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,676
We didn't even
shoot back.

396
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,971
And now I'm stranded here.

397
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,349
With you.

398
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,477
Yes, you're stranded
here with me

399
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,355
and I'm stranded here with you

400
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,690
because for some reason
that escapes me at the moment

401
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,651
I keep saving your life.

402
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,779
Now if you want to
hate me for that, fine.

403
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,073
But I'd really appreciate it
if you kept it to yourself.

404
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,699
You...
To yourself!

405
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,748
First thing we've got
to do is find some shelter

406
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,583
and get out of this heat.

407
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,876
Any suggestions?

408
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,885
I think we're
finally beginning

409
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,220
to understand each other.

410
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,727
You don't know
what you're doing.

411
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,062
What did I just say?

412
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,109
Get down.

413
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,948
What the hell was that?

414
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,532
A proton beam.

415
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,372
They're hidden
everywhere

416
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,665
along with biomagnetic traps
and disrupter snares.

417
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,958
Charming.

418
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,293
I told you.

419
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,586
The Ogla train
on this moon.

420
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,506
I was here myself
last year...

421
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,798
with Razik.

422
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,467
So I guess you know
your way around.

423
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,760
I know that you're
in my territory

424
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,805
and if you want to live to
become that wrinkled old man

425
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,434
you' going to have
to do what<i> I</i> say.

426
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,270
Well, it looks like
you just saved my life.

427
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,064
Twice more and we'll be even.

428
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,609
<i>I've finished analyzing</i>
<i>the shuttle debris</i>

429
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,279
<i>and I found no evidence</i>
<i>of human remains.</i>

430
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,324
Then it's possible Chakotay
wasn't killed in the explosion.

431
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,742
<i>That is correct.</i>

432
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,702
That's the first good news
I've heard all day.

433
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,163
Thank you, doctor.<i> </i>
<i>My pleasure.</i>

434
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,124
<i>Now, would you mind having</i>
<i>someone transport this junk</i>

435
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,503
<i>to the cargo bay.</i>

436
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,671
<i>It's cluttering up my lab.</i>

437
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,465
JANEWAY:
Of course, doctor.

438
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,093
All right then. If commander
Chakotay wasn't in the shuttle,

439
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,428
where is he?

440
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,054
From the dispersal
pattern of the debris

441
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,223
we've been able to extrapolate
Chakotay's course

442
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,891
prior to the explosion.

443
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,101
It appears
he was heading

444
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,894
for an M-Class moon
in this system.

445
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,771
And we found a resual
energy displacement

446
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,273
within the debris field

447
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,275
that isn't consistent
with the explosion itself.

448
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,402
You think he transported
to that moon.

449
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:52,903
We tried to scan
the surface

450
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,114
but there is intense
radiothermic interference.

451
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,823
Radiothermic?

452
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,493
It appears to be coming from
subterranean energy sources--

453
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,703
several carefully hidden
weapons systems--

454
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,082
phaser banks, force fields,
proton dischargers.

455
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,917
KES:
Kazon.

456
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,129
When they captured me I saw how
they concealed their weaponry.

457
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,299
I believe you call them
"booby traps."

458
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,469
then this moon is some kind
of Kazon fortification.

459
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,221
Or it may simply be
a training site.

460
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,390
For the Kazon,
live ammunition

461
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,726
is a very effective
teaching tool.

462
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,770
In the absence
of evidence to the contrary

463
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,815
I choose to believe
Chakotay made it to that moon.

464
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,442
Mr. Kim,
see if you can determine

465
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,651
the most probable location
he would've beamed to.

466
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,322
Lieutenant, you and I
will lead the away team.

467
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,157
As you wish, captain,
but I must point out

468
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,908
that due to radiothermic
interference,

469
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,910
we will not be communicate
able to with the ship.

470
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,703
I'm already working
on a dampening field

471
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,122
to cut through
the interference

472
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,249
but it'll take
several hours, at least.

473
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,251
I don't want to wait
that long, but keep trying.

474
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,545
Neelix, Kes, you are
our two Kazon experts.

475
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,130
Kes, you'll come
with Tuvok and me.

476
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,174
Neelix, you said
you wanted more to do.

477
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,842
Well, now's your chance.

478
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,511
I want you on the bridge
with Mr. Paris

479
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,180
in case we run into
any Kazon ships.

480
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,473
Don't worry, captain.

481
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,681
You can count on me

482
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:07,894
to keep those
nefarious Kazon at bay.

483
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,229
Dismissed.

484
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,932
What are you doing?

485
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,435
I'm setting my tricorder
to emit a homing signal.

486
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,687
What for?

487
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:50,896
So when my people show up

488
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,481
they'll know where
to look for me.

489
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,857
They won't come.

490
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,234
They'll think
you're dead.

491
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,277
They're very persistent.

492
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,363
I'm betting
they haven't given up on me.

493
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,240
Maybe I should kill you

494
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,118
and steal your technology
and deliver it to my people.

495
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,705
Then they'd have
to give me my name.

496
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,373
You just won't give up,
will you?

497
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,920
You won't stop me from earning
my name, Federation.

498
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,171
Not Federation.

499
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,257
Chakotay.

500
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,592
That's<i> my</i> name.

501
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,884
( tricorder beeping )

502
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:25,305
Did you have to earn it?

503
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,140
No. Not exactly.

504
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,604
Then your name means nothing.

505
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,897
My name was a gift...

506
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,441
from my tribe.

507
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:40,571
I cherish it
every day of my life

508
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:44,908
just as I cherish
the Federation uniform.

509
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,953
I should respect you
because you wear that uniform.

510
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,914
Your name,
my uniform--

511
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,124
not much difference.

512
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,667
We both have
to earn them.

513
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,340
What did you have to do
to earn your uniform?

514
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,760
Study.

515
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,554
Years of study.

516
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:10,809
Learning about science
and ships and navigation.

517
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,479
I suppose they don't expect you
to prove your battle skills.

518
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:18,150
No. They prepared us to
defend ourselves in battle.

519
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,444
They prepared
us very well

520
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,322
and we had to pass
many difficult tests

521
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,783
before we were given the
right to wear the uniform.

522
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,660
You're saying that my
name and your uniform

523
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,079
mean the same thing,
but you're wrong.

524
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,498
Why?

525
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,750
What's so different
about us?

526
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,876
Aside from the fact that
I keep saving your life

527
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,463
and you keep threatening
to kill me?

528
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,047
I must protect
my territory.

529
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,591
Territory is power.

530
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,384
Let me tell
you something.

531
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:49,931
I have no interest in your
territory or anybody else's.

532
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:55,895
My people taught me
a man does not own land.

533
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,731
He doesn't own anything

534
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,276
but the courage and
loyalty in his heart.

535
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:05,989
That's where my
power comes from.

536
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,534
I think we both could use
some sleep, don't you?

537
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,666
( soft beeping )

538
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,414
( beeping )

539
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,999
I've got a Kazon
raider approaching

540
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,001
at bearing 288 mark 9.

541
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,336
On screen.

542
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,880
Open a channel.

543
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,177
I'm lieutenant Tom Paris
of the starship<i> Voyager.</i>

544
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,722
<i>Jal Razik, first</i> Maje
<i>of the Kazon-Ogla.</i>

545
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,474
<i>I will speak to your captain.</i>

546
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:41,227
I'm in command right now,
so you can speak to me.

547
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,483
<i>You are trespassing</i>
<i>in Ogla space.</i>

548
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,611
<i>Why do you orbit our moon?</i>

549
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,279
Just stopped to make
a few repairs.

550
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,739
We'll be on our way in no time.

551
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,282
<i>That is a lie.</i>

552
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,036
<i>You are looking for</i>
<i>your Commander Chakotay.</i>

553
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,413
Now, how would
you know about that?

554
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:06,378
<i>Quite simply</i>
<i>we killed him.</i>

555
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,129
Under what circumstances?

556
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,381
<i>He kidnapped a young man.</i>

557
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,841
<i>During his escape</i>

558
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,218
<i>it became necessary</i>
<i>to destroy his ship.</i>

559
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,261
<i>No doubt you've</i>
<i>found the remains.</i>

560
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,598
<i>So I suggest you depart</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

561
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,933
Thanks for the advice.

562
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,227
NEELIX:
What a most
unusual offer.

563
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,938
A Kazon-Ogla<i> Maje</i>

564
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:29,275
allowing a trespasser
to leave his space unharmed.

565
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,486
What would the other Kazon
say about

566
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,573
this new merciful attitude
of the Ogla?

567
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,282
<i>Don't tempt me, Talaxian.</i>

568
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,492
I would just as soon open fire.

569
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,785
NEELIX:
Would you?

570
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,829
Neelix...

571
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,249
No, I don't think so.

572
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,586
That would attract
every rival Kazon sect

573
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,923
to your secret training base,
wouldn't it?

574
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,384
Now, I know
your ships,<i> Maje.</i>

575
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:58,764
I even sold a few plaxan sensors
to the Ogla a few years back.

576
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,265
I have no doubt
that you read

577
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,101
the same life signs
on that moon that we have.

578
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,063
<i>Perhaps one of those life signs</i>
<i>belongs to your captain.</i>

579
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,147
<i>If you've detected</i>
<i>the extensive weaponry</i>

580
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,233
<i>deployed on the moon,</i>
<i>know this:</i>

581
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,903
With one remote command,
<i>I can cause that weaponry</i>

582
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,196
to self-destruct,
<i>destroying the surface</i>

583
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,116
<i>of the moon</i>
<i>and everyone on it.</i>

584
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,535
Neither of us wants that, do we?

585
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,204
Think of the cost of replacing
all those weapons.

586
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,999
Awfully hard to come by
in this region.

587
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,877
And it would make you
so vulnerable to your enemies.

588
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,046
PARIS:
We'll leave
as soon as we've retrieved

589
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,714
our crewmen-- all of them

590
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,801
including Chakotay,
if he's alive.

591
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,385
And if one of your people
is with him

592
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,929
he'll be returned to you.

593
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,142
KIM:
They're moving
into a lower orbit

594
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,478
looks like they're intending to
enter the atmosphere.

595
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,314
I need communication with
the surface, B'Elanna and soon.

596
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,734
I still haven't been able to get
the dampening field working.

597
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,403
I can't even give you
an estimate.

598
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,947
Should we take<i> Voyager</i> down?

599
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,740
I've already run
a soil analysis.

600
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,867
The surface won't support
a landing.

601
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,911
Then I guess the captain's
going to be greeted

602
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,288
by some unexpected visitors.

603
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,290
At least
we bought her some time.

604
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,516
Good morning.

605
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,767
How did you sleep?

606
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,060
Fine.

607
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,812
Really?

608
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,314
You seemed a little
restless to me.

609
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,566
What do you mean?

610
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,611
All that skulking around
throwing things.

611
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,988
You were awake?

612
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,572
You think I'm going
to get much sleep

613
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,284
around an Ogla warrior who's
threatened to kill me?

614
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:47,080
Why didn't you
go through with it?

615
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,373
I am a coward.

616
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,416
I don't believe that.

617
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,585
I don't believe you do, either.

618
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:56,089
I think maybe you're beginning
to realize I'm not your enemy

619
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,424
and only a fool
would kill a friend.

620
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,137
If you are my friend...
then you're my only one.

621
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,102
What happens to me now?
Where do I go?

622
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,312
Would any other Kazon sect
accept you?

623
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,273
I would be a<i> goven,</i> 
an outcast.

624
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:18,070
Each Kazon sect I meet
would cut one digit off

625
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,446
and send me away.

626
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,074
How many Kazon sects
are there?

627
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,867
It changes every day.

628
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,745
Yesterday there were 18.

629
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,080
I guess you could
come with us.

630
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,665
To do what?
Dress in a uniform?

631
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,291
You wouldn't have
to wear a uniform.

632
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,960
And the closer you'd get
to your home

633
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,628
the farther I would be
from mine.

634
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,593
If only you had killed me.

635
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,228
Captain, four life-forms
approaching.

636
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,520
40 meters.

637
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,272
They appear to be Kazon.

638
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,446
Please, put your weapons away.
We've come to help you.

639
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,322
Help us? With what?

640
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,200
We made contact
with your ship

641
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,744
and learned of the plight of
your missing crewman.

642
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,872
We've come to offer our
assistance in finding him.

643
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,916
That's very kind of you.

644
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,626
You're walking
on dangerous ground.

645
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,711
There are concealed
weapons everywhere.

646
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,172
Come. We will lead
you through them.

647
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,260
Very well.

648
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,480
Tell me about
the other uniforms--

649
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,899
the ones the
Kazons fought.

650
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,859
The trabe.

651
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,987
The Kazon
shared their homeworld

652
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,863
if you can call it sharing.

653
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,825
They had everything;
We had nothing--

654
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,953
until we took it from them
in the revolt 26 years ago.

655
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,704
( tricorder beeps )

656
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,873
What is it?

657
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,750
People coming this way.

658
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,294
Humans and Kazon.

659
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,712
What are we going to do?

660
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,714
There's only one way back
to the Ogla for you

661
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:05,343
and that's if you
earn your name.

662
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,679
So I guess that's what
you'll have to do.

663
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,222
But how?

664
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,891
You're going to
have to kill me.

665
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,651
The signal seems to be coming
from some caves

666
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,111
approximately 40 meters ahead.

667
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,822
Your technology
continues to amaze us.

668
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,949
It would have taken us
weeks to track them.

669
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,618
After this is over,
we have to discuss an alliance.

670
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,954
JANEWAY:
I would welcome
your friendship,<i> Maje.</i>

671
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,747
Captain Janeway, I'm reading

672
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,958
elevated radiothermic
levels here.

673
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,960
The Ocampa female is correct.

674
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,753
This is a particularly
dangerous place.

675
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,797
We lose many trainees here.

676
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,050
Perhaps you would prefer
if we preeded alone.

677
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,592
They can't be far now.

678
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,845
Thanks, but I think
we'll stick together.

679
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,222
PARIS:
Voyager<i> to away team.</i>

680
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,723
We're here, Mr. Paris.

681
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,100
We finally broke through
the interference, captain.

682
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,643
Are you all right?

683
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,354
<i>We had a run-in...</i>

684
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:00,648
Everything is fine. We have
the assistance of the Ogla.

685
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,026
That's what I was going
to tell you to expect.

686
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,610
Can you lock on
to Commander Chakotay?

687
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,987
<i>Stand by.</i>

688
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,741
<i>Voyager</i> to Chakotay,
do you read?

689
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,576
CHAKOTAY:
<i>I'm fine, Paris.</i>

690
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,953
Stand by for us
to beam you out of there.

691
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,122
<i>Belay that,</i> Voyager.<i> Stand by.</i>

692
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,498
According to my readings

693
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,167
the away team's
only 50 meters away.

694
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,710
<i>Right, but...</i>

695
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,421
and alert sick bay
for a code white resuscitation.

696
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,049
Did you say "code white"?

697
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,259
<i>Correct.</i>

698
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,801
I don't have time
to explain now.

699
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:32,305
<i>Chakotay out.</i>

700
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,849
It'll be alright.
Our technology can revive me

701
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,684
even if I'm brain-dead
for two minutes.

702
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,270
Why are you doing this?

703
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,398
Like you said it's my fault
you don't have your name.

704
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,275
I can't leave you
behind like this.

705
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,613
<i>Chakotay to away team.</i>

706
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,198
Good to hear your
voice, commander.

707
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,325
<i>Captain, proceed with caution.</i>

708
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,702
<i>I have been taken prisoner</i>
<i>by a young Kazon.</i>

709
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,079
<i>He's threaning to kill me.</i>

710
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,376
This way.

711
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,668
It's safer.

712
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,920
I would beg to differ.

713
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,422
Based on these readings

714
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:08,549
that way would seem
the logical choice.

715
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,051
I must apologize
for my comrade.

716
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,928
I believe he's trying
to mislead you.

717
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,897
So your technology
is not always an ally.

718
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,483
Sometimes it
betrays you. Pity.

719
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,485
I'm afraid
you would not score well

720
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,237
on our training exercises.

721
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,496
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>

722
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,666
KES:
Captain, that panel
is a micro-generator.

723
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,960
JANEWAY:
You're right. If we
can get a narrow beam

724
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,503
through the field,
we can disable it.

725
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,213
We could try remodulating
the phasers

726
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,631
to a higher-
frequency output.

727
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,924
Make it fast.

728
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,684
I've been waiting
for you, Razik.

729
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,814
RAZIK:
So, the Federation commander
is your prisoner.

730
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,191
I only came with him

731
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,734
so I could have another
chance to kill him.

732
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,945
So you could earn your name.

733
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,698
That's what
I've been hoping for, Razik.

734
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,616
But you taught me well.

735
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,826
I know what you're going to say.

736
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:20,121
You've said it
so many times before.

737
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,957
In battle there are
no second chances.

738
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,840
But you are not my enemy.

739
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,217
He is.

740
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,634
(<i> groans</i> )

741
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:39,265
My name is Jal Karden,
Kazon-Ogla.

742
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,982
You are first<i> Maje</i>
now, Haliz.

743
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,692
My life is yours.

744
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:59,118
Kill me if you wish

745
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,329
or let me live and I will
follow you into battle

746
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,955
whenever you command.

747
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,216
Jal Karden.

748
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,012
Kazon-Ogla.

749
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,063
The Federation
does not belong here.

750
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,732
If we meet again,
I will not hesitate to kill you.

751
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:32,735
I understand.

752
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,578
Janeway to<i> Voyager.</i>

753
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,162
Five to beam up.

754
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,903
<i>A-koo-chee-moya.</i>

755
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:21,700
I pray on this day of memories
to speak to my father

756
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,954
the one whom the wind
called Kolopak.

757
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:28,833
Father, if you can hear me
among these unnamed stars

758
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,127
I ask you to continue
to watch over me

759
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,254
as you've always done.

760
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:38,593
<i>I ask you also to watch over</i>
<i>a boy called Karden</i>

761
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:42,096
who has a difficult path
to travel.

762
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,556
<i>A-koo-chee-moya.</i>
