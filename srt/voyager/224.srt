JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49655.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,175
<i>Our sensors have located</i>
<i>a variety of flower</i>

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,635
<i>which may prove to be</i>

4
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,470
<i>a valuable</i>
<i>nutritional supplement.</i>

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,974
<i>I've sent Mr. Neelix and</i>
<i>Mr. Tuvok to collect samples.</i>

6
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:16,725
(<i> inhaling deeply</i> )

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,101
Whoa!

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,228
Smell that air, Mr. Vulcan!

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,106
Look at that sky!

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,025
Oh, it's an exhilarating day,
isn't it?

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,529
As you well know by now,
Mr. Neelix,

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,739
I do not experience
exhilaration.

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,117
Oh, let's not quibble
about semantics.

14
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,745
A breeze is blowing,
the sun is shining.

15
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,539
It's beautiful.

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,667
The weather is certainly
adequate for our purposes.

17
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,127
Adequate?

18
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,171
You know something?

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,965
You're acting

20
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,175
more "Tuvokian"
than usual this morning.

21
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,427
I am who I am,
Mr. Neelix.

22
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,805
It is impossible for me to be
more or less like myself.

23
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,017
There you go with
the semantics again.

24
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,686
But you know what
I'm talking about.

25
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,188
I'm afraid I don't.

26
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,524
Well, then, I'll
explain it to you.

27
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,360
You're a nature lover,
aren't you?

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,487
I appreciate nature, yes.

29
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,990
It's one of the things that
you and I have in common.

30
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,950
And here we are,
on a perfect day,

31
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,995
foraging for an exceptionally
lovely variety of orchid--

32
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,706
your favorite flower--
and all you can say

33
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,792
about the experience
is that it's adequate.

34
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,795
I just... I don't see why
you're not having fun.

35
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,463
We are not here
to have fun.

36
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,591
We are here
to collect samples.

37
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,467
Why? Is there
some regulation

38
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,094
that says we can't do
both at the same time?

39
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,680
I know.

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,807
Why don't, why don't
we sing a song

41
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,559
while we toil, hm?

42
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,310
It'll cheer you up.

43
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,896
I've been studying Vulcan music.

44
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:47,441
Uh... do you know
that lovely tune that starts:

45
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,445
♪ O starless night ♪

46
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,031
♪ Of boundless black... ♪

47
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,910
That "lovely tune"
is a traditional funeral dirge.

48
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,954
I know,

49
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:03,206
but it was the most cheerful
song I could find

50
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,625
in the Vulcan
database.

51
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,961
Come on, Tuvok,
join me.

52
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,254
♪ O starless night ♪

53
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,506

(<i> chuckling</i> )

55
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,176
Mr. Neelix...

56
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,845
Yes?

57
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,305
Do you think
you could possibly behave

58
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,391
a little less...
like yourself?

59
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,851
(<i> sighs</i> )

60
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,730
Are Neelix and Tuvok
back from the surface?

61
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,941
Not yet. We're having some
trouble with the transporter.

62
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,651
TORRES:
Captain...

63
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,903
there's a minor glitch in
the molecular imaging scanners.

64
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,571
Ensign Kim should have it up
and running

65
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,698
in a few minutes.

66
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,997
Try narrowing
the annular confinement beam.

67
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,165
(<i> console beeping</i> )

68
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,500
How's that?

69
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,335
Let's try it again.

70
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,920
Kim to away team.

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,546
Sorry for the delay.

72
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,631
We're ready
to bring you back.

73
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,966
TUVOK:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

74
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,804
Energize.

75
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,433
There's something
wrong, sir.

76
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,393
I'm only getting
one pattern.

77
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,646
Tuvok or Neelix?

78
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,397
I don't think
it's either of them.

79
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,441
Abort.

80
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,985
It's too late.

81
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:32,295
[♪♪♪]

82
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,149
Kim to Security.

83
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,733
Intruder alert,
Transporter Room 1.

84
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,986
Identify yourself.

85
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,737
I'm Lieutenant Tuvok.

86
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,617
And I'm Neelix.

87
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,953
Sir, according to
the bio-scanners, he's right.

88
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,664
Somehow their patterns
have merged.

89
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,422
I think the logical thing
is for me to go to Sick Bay.

90
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,388
And you recognize
all of us?

91
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,556
Of course.

92
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:53,187
Doctor, Captain Janeway,
Ensign Kim...

93
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,939
Kes.

94
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,691
DOCTOR:
My scans indicate

95
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:02,029
that all biological matter
was merged on a molecular level.

96
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,362
Proteins, enzymes,

97
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,324
DNA sequences.

98
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,533
The man you see
before you

99
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,327
is literally a
fusion of two men.

100
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,954
But he's surprisingly healthy,
considering the circumstances.

101
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,789
All vital signs are stable.

102
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,624
What's the last
thing you remember?

103
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,880
I... we... that is to say,
Tuvok and Neelix,

104
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,174
we had just finished
gathering the samples.

105
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,551
We were beaming back
to the ship.

106
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,969
The next thing I knew,

107
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,471
I was standing
on the transporter pad

108
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,472
as you see me now.

109
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,974
DOCTOR:
I'm also picking up

110
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,060
traces
of a third genetic pattern.

111
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,686
It appears
to be plant-based.

112
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,604
TUVIX:
The orchids.

113
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,859
We had collected several dozen
samples of orchids.

114
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,444
They were in our sample
containers when we beamed up.

115
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,823
Well, they're part
of<i> your</i> genetic structure now.

116
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,075
But they
don't appear

117
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,450
to be affecting
your biochemistry.

118
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,161
Torres said you were
having trouble with

119
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,746
the molecular imaging scanners.

120
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,955
That's right.

121
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,832
Maybe this alien plant life 

122
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,543
affected
the scanners in some way.

123
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,338
Possibly. I'll know more
after we've run a diagnostic

124
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,757
on the biofilters
and transporter logs.

125
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,883
Get on it.

126
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,431
In the meantime, I'll send
an away team in a shuttlecraft

127
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,935
to collect fresh samples
of the orchid for further study.

128
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,563
Doctor, let me know as soon
as you have something more.

129
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,815
Yes, Captain.

130
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,030
Kes, take our patient
to the Science Lab

131
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,824
and perform a full
bio-spectral analysis.

132
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,952
I'll start examining
the genetic data.

133
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,888
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

134
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,604
This situation must be
very difficult for you, Kes.

135
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,815
Perhaps it would be easier

136
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,900
if someone else
administered these tests.

137
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,155
Thank you for your concern,
but I'll be fine.

138
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,530
This scan is very delicate,

139
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,783
so try to remain still
for the next 20 minutes.

140
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,701
I'll do my best.

141
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,829
Don't worry.
We're going to figure it out.

142
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,956
Oh, I'm not worried.

143
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,874
I couldn't be in better hands.

144
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,543
This crew, you're
consummate professionals.

145
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,962
You're my friends.

146
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,214
My family.

147
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,427
So worrying would be illogical,
don't you think?

148
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,096
Would you mind if I
asked you some questions

149
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,514
about what
you're going through?

150
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,807
Not at all.

151
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,102
Well, do you feel
as if you're thinking

152
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,520
with two minds--

153
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,105
two separate minds?

154
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,733
Are Neelix and Tuvok
inside of you, talking to me,

155
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,694
talking to each other?

156
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,780
If you mean am I suffering
from some form

157
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,367
of multiple personality
disorder, I don't think so.

158
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,411
I do have the memories
of both men,

159
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,663
but I seem to have
a single consciousness.

160
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,793
You must find me
very odd, Kes.

161
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,670
No, of course not.
Try to keep still.

162
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,842
So... what should
I call you?

163
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,969
Ah, a name.

164
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,679
I hadn't thought of that.

165
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,639
What an intriguing question.

166
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,641
I can see why the Doctor

167
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,436
is finding it
so difficult to choose one.

168
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,980
A name can have
a significant effect

169
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,525
upon a person's
sense of identity.

170
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,819
I've got it.

171
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,112
What?

172
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,824
Why don't you call me...

173
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,201
Neevok.

174
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,870
Wait.

175
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,333
This is better.

176
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,835
How about Tuvix?

177
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,338
Tuvix it is.

178
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,426
I'm so glad you're here to help
me through this, sweeting.

179
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,970
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,265
It was instinct.

181
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,895
Why don't we finish the scan.

182
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,156
DOCTOR:
<i>Chief Medical Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

183
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,659
<i>Extensive microcellular scans</i>
<i>on the merged humanoid</i>

184
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,162
<i>have, thus far, yielded</i>
<i>no clues to either a cause</i>

185
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,374
<i>or a method of separation.</i>

186
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,501
Ah, Captain, so good
of you to come.

187
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,627
How are you feeling?

188
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,795
I feel well.

189
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,839
You might even say...

190
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,049
exhilarated.

191
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,717
I'm glad to hear it.

192
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,677
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

193
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,012
In the past 24 hours,

194
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,140
I've undergone
rigorous diagnostic testing,

195
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,475
submitted to an extensive

196
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,892
psychological profile

197
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,353
and I've been
poked and prodded

198
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,064
in organs that I
didn't even know I had.

199
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,941
While all this testing

200
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,069
may no doubt
be necessary...

201
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,822
frankly, I'm restless.

202
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,491
To tell you the truth,

203
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,618
we could use a little help
in the Mess Hall.

204
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,828
And I'd be glad
to give you a hand.

205
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,122
But...

206
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,706
after careful consideration,

207
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,502
I've decided that the most
sensible thing for me to do

208
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,587
is to resume
the tactical post.

209
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,796
Tactical?

210
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,632
Remember, Captain,

211
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,134
I do possess Tuvok's
knowledge and expertise,

212
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,927
and while I have no doubt

213
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,640
that the crew misses
Neelix's cooking,

214
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,185
you need your most
experienced Tactical Officer.

215
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,187
That's me.

216
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,482
If I may, Captain.
Mr. Tuvix...

217
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,983
Tuvix?

218
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,319
Apparently, that's what
he likes to be called.

219
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,238
Mr. Tuvix is, indeed,
in perfect health.

220
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,948
And since I've collected
all the data I need,

221
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,075
there's no reason I can't
continue my investigation

222
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,036
without him
for the time being.

223
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,871
And, according to my tests,
he's quite correct

224
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,790
when he says that he possesses
Tuvok's knowledge and expertise.

225
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,584
He also possesses

226
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,045
Tuvok's irritating sense
of intellectual superiority

227
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:56,424
and Neelix's
annoying ebullience.

228
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,009
I would be very grateful to you

229
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,220
if you would assign him
some duty.

230
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,722
Any duty...

231
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,393
somewhere else.

232
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,357
Well... Mr. Tuvix...

233
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,193
I'm not ready to assign you
to the Bridge just yet,

234
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,362
but why don't you
join the senior staff

235
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,572
for our noon briefing,

236
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,781
and we'll see
how it goes from there.

237
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,826
Captain, has anyone
ever told you

238
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,455
that you are as fair-minded
as you are lovely?

239
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,290
As a matter of fact,

240
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,377
Neelix has told me
that occasionally.

241
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,547
And if you really do
possess his memories...

242
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:39,300
you'd know that flattery
will get you nowhere.

243
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,389
The transporter
was functioning normally.

244
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,974
Biofilters, pattern buffers,
everything checked out.

245
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,268
What about the problem

246
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,353
with the molecular
imaging scanners?

247
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,938
According to
the transporter logs,

248
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,898
they were optimal at
the time of transport.

249
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,443
It was a perfectly routine
beam-out sequence.

250
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,902
No anomalies,

251
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,238
no power overloads,
no malfunctions.

252
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,240
Our scans of the planet's
surface and atmosphere

253
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,659
don't show anything
out of the ordinary.

254
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,993
CHAKOTAY:
There's no evidence

255
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,912
of any type
of alien interference.

256
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,788
Frankly, Captain,
we're at a loss.

257
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,374
And the orchids, Kes?

258
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,001
Have you found anything
unusual about them?

259
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,879
Commander Chakotay brought back
a few samples on the shuttle

260
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,673
and I ran
a biochemical analysis.

261
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,051
They contain the same elements
as many plants: chloroplasts,

262
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,679
lysosomal enzymes,
cytoplasmic proteins,

263
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,598
but there's
nothing unusual.

264
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,558
There's never been an accident
like this recorded

265
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,769
in the entire history
of transporter technology.

266
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,605
I'm not willing to accept it
as a random malfunction.

267
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,023
Captain, I recommend we program
a holodeck simulation,

268
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,525
try recreating the accident.

269
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,611
Sex.

270
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,363
I beg your pardon?

271
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,324
What I mean to say is--

272
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,160
and I apologize
for cutting you off, Commander--

273
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,621
I think we're
on the wrong track.

274
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:53,792
Kes... you said that the flowers
you examined

275
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,543
contained lysosomal enzymes.

276
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,877
That's right.

277
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,130
According to Tuvok's
botanical research,

278
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,174
the presence
of lysosomal enzymes

279
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,511
could be evidence
of symbiogenesis.

280
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,095
Symbiogenesis?

281
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,514
JANEWAY:
Symbiogenesis is a rare

282
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,974
reproductive process.

283
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,143
Instead of pollination
or mating,

284
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,146
symbiogenetic organisms merge
with a second species.

285
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,315
Andorian amoebae,
for instance--

286
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:21,235
they're able to merge with
other single-celled organisms

287
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,571
to form a third
unique species.

288
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,781
A hybrid.

289
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,199
Like you.

290
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,493
Exactly.

291
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,077
It's an interesting idea,

292
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,831
but we're talking about
microcellular organisms here.

293
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,124
I've never heard
of symbiogenesis occurring

294
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,251
in a species as complex
as a humanoid.

295
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,546
Actually, Captain,
when you think about it,

296
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,422
Neelix and Tuvok
were broken down

297
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,385
to a microcellular level
during transport-- DNA,

298
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,263
protein, all in a state
of molecular flux.

299
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:53,142
And if the enzymes that
cause symbiogenesis

300
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,602
interacted with their DNA

301
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,103
while they were in
the matter stream,

302
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,773
it might've caused
their patterns to merge.

303
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,483
Like an Andorian amoeba.

304
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,986
Just like that,
Tuvix is born.

305
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,324
It's the best theory
I've heard so far.

306
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,076
It's the<i> only</i> theory
I've heard so far.

307
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,036
And it's worth investigating.

308
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,747
Mr. Paris, take a shuttle
to the planet

309
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,456
and collect additional
flower specimens.

310
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,418
Yes, ma'am, but I'd recommend
waiting until morning.

311
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,086
The weather on the planet
can get

312
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,421
pretty nasty
at night.

313
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,381
Very well.
You'll depart at 600 hours.

314
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,514
Good work, Mr. Tuvix.

315
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,655
Kes.

316
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,616
Oh, hello.

317
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,743
Hello.

318
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,454
Do you need something?

319
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,664
Actually, I was wondering

320
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,250
if you'd like
to join me for dinner.

321
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,377
Well, I, uh...

322
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,378
You've already eaten?

323
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,130
Well, no.

324
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,131
You're not hungry?

325
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,173
Actually...

326
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,175
If memory serves me,

327
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,303
Wednesday's the day

328
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,639
that Neelix always cooked
Trellan crepes--

329
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,891
your favorite meal?

330
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,016
That's right.

331
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,269
Well, why break
with tradition

332
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,188
just because of a little
transporter accident?

333
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,149
(<i> laughs</i> )

334
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,402
Somebody's eggs are burning!

335
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,403
WOMAN:
Those are mine.

336
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,905
Can you flip them for me?

337
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,448
I can't find a spatula.

338
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,117
WOMAN:
Just... try
tossing them.

339
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,702
Why don't you
have a seat?

340
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,788
I'll be with you
in a minute.

341
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,749
Do you mind telling me
what's going on here, crewman?

342
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,793
We're making dinner.

343
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,755
I see.

344
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,715
All right, everybody out!

345
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,883
On whose authority?

346
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,260
Chief of Security
or Head Chef--

347
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,428
take your pick.
Out, out, out!

348
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,513
(<i> Tuvix clapping</i> )

349
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,555
TUVIX:
Come, come.

350
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,641
Out!

351
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,940
(<i> laughing</i> )

352
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,071
So you really enjoyed
the crepes?

353
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,657
Oh, they were
absolutely delicious.

354
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,825
Don't you think Neelix

355
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,326
always made them
a little too spicy?

356
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,077
These were a little
different than usual.

357
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,204
Did you change the recipe?

358
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,664
Only slightly.

359
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,833
I thought more moderate
seasoning would allow

360
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,877
the flavor of the mushrooms
to come through.

361
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,252
I loved the mushrooms.

362
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,546
I'm glad.

363
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,839
I can't believe

364
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,590
how disorganized
this galley was.

365
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,843
It's a wonder Neelix
ever found anything.

366
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,970
He says he has a system.

367
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,389
But I guess you
already know that.

368
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,059
I admire your strength, Kes.

369
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,895
Why do you say that?

370
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,479
I know I'm not Neelix,

371
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,857
but I can posit
with complete certainty

372
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,026
that if the situation
were reversed--

373
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,696
if suddenly he found himself
without you in his life--

374
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,032
he'd be absolutely lost.

375
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,622
I have to go.

376
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,833
Thanks again for dinner.

377
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,056
Good morning, Captain.
Commander.

378
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,766
You're here bright and early,
Lieutenant.

379
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,475
Actually, I've been here
since 0400 hours.

380
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,228
I wanted to work on that
proximity detector glitch

381
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,772
in the security subroutine.

382
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,940
And how's it going?

383
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,816
I managed to correct it.

384
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,484
Tuvok said it could
take up to ten days

385
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,278
to check out all
the possible problems.

386
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,529
How'd you fix
it so fast?

387
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,614
I had a hunch.

388
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,656
"A hunch"?

389
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,157
That's correct.

390
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,576
You'll have a report
on your desk

391
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,244
first thing
this afternoon.

392
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,579
<i>Kim to Mr. Tuvix.</i>

393
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,496
Tuvix here.

394
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,206
<i>We're just about ready</i>

395
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,417
<i>to start the transporter tests</i>
<i>if you'd like to join us.</i>

396
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,543
I'm on my way.

397
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,586
Excuse me, Captain.

398
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,052
Well, he's certainly
fitting in, isn't he?

399
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,845
There's an old axiom:

400
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,556
"The whole is never greater
than the sum of its parts."

401
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,643
I think Tuvix might be
disproving that notion.

402
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,447
Give me the flowers
from the airponics bay.

403
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,491
Here you go.

404
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,868
One prize-winning
chrysanthemum...

405
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,999
one garden-variety
clematis...

406
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,087
and last but not least...

407
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,719
one symbiogenetic
alien orchid.

408
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,976
I never thought
that botanical science class

409
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,019
would come in so handy.

410
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,027
Torres to Transporter Room 1.

411
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,028
We're ready down here.

412
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,529
Acknowledged.

413
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,448
Energizing.

414
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,589
We've made over 100 attempts
to reverse the symbiogenesis

415
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,550
using the medical
transporter,

416
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,469
and each time, this has been
the unfortunate result--

417
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,680
complete
cellular collapse.

418
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,932
The genetic codes
of the chrysanthemum

419
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,893
and the clematis
are so scrambled

420
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,519
that the targeting
scanners

421
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,563
can't recognize
the original patterns.

422
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,191
I suppose it would be
like trying to extract

423
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,775
the flour, eggs
and water

424
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,485
after you'd baked
the cake.

425
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,571
Obviously, in the
case of Mr. Tuvix,

426
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,574
we're dealing with a much more
complex organism than a flower.

427
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,909
In effect, we're talking

428
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,869
about recreating
two humanoid life-forms

429
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,163
without so much
as a single discrete strand

430
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,581
of DNA to start with.

431
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,042
Are you saying I'm going
to be this way forever?

432
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,753
I am an incredibly
skilled doctor

433
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,713
and I will continue
to pursue

434
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,716
a safe and effective
treatment until I find one...

435
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,300
but I won't lie to you.

436
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,802
I'm not optimistic.

437
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,721
It could take months,
even years,

438
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,098
to find a solution.

439
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,183
And we must face
the possibility

440
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,726
that this condition is simply...

441
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,895
untreatable.

442
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,646
I feel as though

443
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,565
I've lost two patients.

444
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,649
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,073
I'll inform the rest
of the crew.

446
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,927
(<i> door chimes</i> )

447
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,095
Come in.

448
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,141
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

449
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,725
It's all right.

450
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,479
Um, please...

451
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,981
sit down.

452
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,650
Ocampan prayer tapers.

453
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,110
For Tuvok and Neelix?

454
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,155
It's funny...

455
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,157
if something happened to Tuvok,

456
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,741
if Neelix were here,

457
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,161
he'd be the first person
to comfort me.

458
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,496
And if I lost Neelix...

459
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,790
Tuvok would be
the first person

460
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,625
to guide me spiritually.

461
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,838
Now I don't have either of them.

462
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,423
You have me, Kes.

463
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,177
Thank you.

464
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,469
But...

465
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,430
I remind you
of what you've lost.

466
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,183
It's not your fault.

467
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:35,188
I know, and I'm trying
to accept who I am now.

468
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,605
Captain Janeway tells me

469
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,066
there's a place
for me on this ship...

470
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:43,112
but I can't help feeling like...

471
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,656
like some sort of impostor.

472
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,534
Maybe we can help
each other get through this.

473
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,536
That's what
I've been hoping.

474
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,334
I know this is going to sound
very strange to you...

475
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,711
perhaps even illogical...

476
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:03,632
since, in a way, we've only
known each other a few days.

477
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,635
But I want you to know...

478
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,428
I love you, Kes.

479
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,806
But I hardly know you.

480
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,645
A-And besides, what about...

481
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,523
what about Tuvok's wife,
for one thing?

482
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,234
He was completely
devoted to her.

483
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,568
What happens
when<i> Voyager</i>

484
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,903
gets back home?

485
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,529
Are you just going
to forget her?

486
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,781
I could never forget T'Pel.

487
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,117
I carry Tuvok's love
for her inside me

488
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,162
and I would never ask you
to forget Neelix.

489
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,539
How can you talk this way?

490
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,041
Because

491
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:42,255
I carry Neelix's love for you
inside me, as well,

492
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,090
and I always will.

493
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,925
You heard
the Doctor.

494
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,509
It could be years

495
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,263
before he finds a way to bring
Tuvok and Neelix back--

496
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,514
if ever.

497
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:56,727
For you,
that might be a lifetime.

498
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,441
Please go.

499
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,069
I'm sorry.

500
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:09,156
I should've controlled
my emotions.

501
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,410
All I really came to say

502
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,412
is that I'll be here for you

503
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,163
if you need me.

504
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,149
(<i> door chimes</i> )

505
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,778
Kes.
Captain.

506
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,780
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have bothered you this late.

507
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,365
I'll, uh, talk to you
tomorrow.

508
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,742
Actually, I was having
trouble sleeping.

509
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,286
I could use some company.

510
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,039
Would you like
some hot tea?

511
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,458
Please, sit down.

512
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,796
I was just looking over
some old letters Tuvok sent me

513
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,424
when he was temporarily
assigned to Jupiter Station.

514
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,301
Most people would say

515
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:15,264
his writing is cold,
analytical, detached, but...

516
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,267
I've always found it to be...

517
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,144
concise, efficient...

518
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,898
...thoughtful.

519
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:29,862
I hear his voice
when I read the words.

520
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,822
And Neelix...

521
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,160
I'd become
so fond of him, Kes.

522
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,954
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

523
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,332
I wanted to talk
to you about Tuvix.

524
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,376
He came to see me
this afternoon.

525
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,584
Oh?

526
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:48,588
He said... he said
that he loves me.

527
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,678
I suppose I can see
how that's possible,

528
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,222
given the circumstances.

529
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,391
I wasn't sure what to say.

530
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,226
At first I was angry,

531
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,937
but I know how he's
trying to comfort me

532
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,399
and I know that he
feels alone, too.

533
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:10,236
To tell the truth,
he's a wonderful person.

534
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,072
Do you have feelings
for him, too, Kes?

535
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,281
No, I don't.

536
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,326
I mean, how could I?

537
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,912
I still love Neelix...

538
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,664
and I'm not ready
to give up on him,

539
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,791
no matter what the Doctor says.

540
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:29,922
I know how you feel.

541
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,340
You're experiencing

542
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,217
what people on this crew
have been going through

543
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,886
since we first got stranded
in this Quadrant.

544
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,805
Do we accept

545
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,351
that we're separated
from our loved ones forever?

546
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,977
Or do we hold on to the hope

547
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,855
that, someday,
we'll be with them again?

548
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,817
What do you do, Captain?

549
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,322
Oh... I struggle with it
every day.

550
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,866
Sometimes, I'm full
of hope and optimism.

551
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,828
Other times...

552
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,622
(<i> clears throat</i> )

553
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,959
I dream about being with Mark...

554
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,338
...and it's so real.

555
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,971
Then, when I wake up
and realize it's just a dream,

556
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,889
I'm terribly discouraged.

557
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,560
In those moments,

558
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,981
it's impossible to deny
just how far away he really is.

559
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,191
And, uh...

560
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,575
I know that, someday,

561
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:44,955
I may have to accept that he's
not part of my life anymore.

562
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,874
So, are you saying
that I should just accept

563
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,668
that Neelix isn't a part
of my life anymore?

564
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,631
I would never tell you
or anyone else

565
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,215
to give up hope, Kes.

566
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,886
I think the best thing
you can do now...

567
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,348
is give yourself time.

568
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,976
Thank you, Captain.

569
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,483
I'll go now and
let you sleep.

570
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,322
My door is always
open to you, Kes.

571
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,468
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49678.4.</i>

572
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,387
<i>It's been two weeks</i>

573
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,348
<i>since the transporter accident</i>
<i>that created Mr. Tuvix</i>

574
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,392
<i>and, while it's still</i>
<i>not entirely clear</i>

575
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,976
<i>that he's with us permanently,</i>

576
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,313
<i>he's certainly been doing</i>
<i>his best to settle in.</i>

577
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,233
<i>The crew seems to be growing</i>
<i>accustomed to his presence,</i>

578
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,735
<i>and he's proving to be</i>
<i>a very able Tactical Officer</i>

579
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,987
<i>who isn't afraid</i>
<i>to express his opinions.</i>

580
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,989
<i>While he's forging</i>
<i>relationships</i>

581
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,991
<i>with many of the officers,</i>

582
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,412
<i>he seems to be keeping a</i>
<i>respectful distance from Kes,</i>

583
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,581
<i>allowing her to adjust</i>
<i>to the circumstances</i>

584
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,624
<i>on her own terms.</i>

585
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,502
<i>As for my relationship</i>
<i>with Tuvix,</i>

586
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,254
<i>I've found him</i>
<i>to be an able advisor,</i>

587
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,215
<i>who skillfully uses humor</i>
<i>to make his points.</i>

588
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:22,094
<i>And although I feel</i>
<i>a bit guilty saying it,</i>

589
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,680
<i>his cooking is better</i>
<i>than Neelix's.</i>

590
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,557
<i>My taste buds</i>
<i>are definitely happy</i>

591
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,016
<i>to have him around.</i>

592
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,979
(<i> playing medium tempo melody)</i>

593
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,081
DOCTOR:
<i>Sick Bay to Ensign Kim.</i>

594
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,709
<i>Please turn to your emergency</i>
<i>medical holographic channel.</i>

595
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,176
How can I help you, Doc?

596
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,637
<i>Suppose I found</i>
<i>a radioisotope</i>

597
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,013
<i>that could selectively</i>
<i>attach itself</i>

598
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,641
<i>to specific</i>
<i>DNA sequences.</i>

599
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,643
<i>Could the surgical transporters</i>
<i>be reprogrammed</i>

600
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,686
<i>to lock on to those</i>
<i>enhanced sequences</i>

601
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,606
<i>and separate them</i>
<i>from the remaining DNA?</i>

602
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,024
Well, I think so,

603
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,527
but we'd have to modify
the molecular imaging scanners,

604
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,030
and find a way to compensate for
the higher levels of radiation.

605
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,073
<i>Thank you, Ensign.</i>

606
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,866
Wait a second.

607
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,536
What's going on?

608
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,413
<i>It's pure speculation</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

609
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,624
<i>I'll let you know</i>
<i>when I've learned more.</i>

610
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:36,042
This is about Tuvix, isn't it?

611
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,169
I'm on my way.

612
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,974
Eight ball, corner pocket.

613
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,027
That's game again, Commander.

614
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,404
We've created a monster.

615
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,323
Best out of five?

616
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,658
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

617
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,338
Would you mind if we finished
this later, Commander?

618
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,506
Not at all.

619
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,097
Hi.

620
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,140
Hi.

621
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,518
(<i> clears throat</i> )

622
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,523
How have you been?

623
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,067
Good days and bad days.

624
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,068
You?

625
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,944
Me, too.

626
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,113
Listen, I'm sorry I've been
so distant lately.

627
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,868
Kes, you don't owe
me an explanation.

628
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,871
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

629
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,209
And I'm hoping
that we can be friends.

630
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,633
I would like that very much.

631
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,635
And I'd like our
friendship to grow.

632
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,178
You would?

633
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,847
Yes.

634
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,682
But it's going to take time.

635
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,396
I'm not going anywhere.

636
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,692
<i>Doctor to Lieutenant Tuvix.</i>

637
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,446
Tuvix here.

638
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,656
<i>Please report</i>
<i>to Sick Bay immediately.</i>

639
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,120
DOCTOR:
Until late
in the 21st century,

640
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,122
physicians administered
barium to patients

641
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,916
with certain
gastrointestinal disorders.

642
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,793
The radioactive properties
of the barium

643
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,586
made the lining
of the intestines visible,

644
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,213
with a primitive imaging
technology called X rays.

645
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,717
Instead of barium, we've
come up with a radioisotope

646
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,093
that attaches itself

647
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,887
to the DNA of one
of the merged species,

648
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,097
but not the other.

649
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,475
Then we simply beam out
the selected DNA,

650
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,936
and segregate
the two merged species.

651
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,399
You see these?

652
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,318
They used to be
a single merged flower.

653
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,403
And you can use
this same process?

654
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,863
It will require

655
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,865
a more detailed reprogramming
of the transporter,

656
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,660
but, yes, I believe
we can restore

657
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,537
Mr. Tuvok
and Mr. Neelix.

658
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,456
That's wonderful.

659
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,666
Isn't that wonderful?

660
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,376
I assure you,
Mr. Tuvix,

661
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,670
there's nothing
to worry about.

662
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,630
We've accounted
for every variable.

663
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,008
Except one.

664
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,679
I don't want to die.

665
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,024
It's funny...

666
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,068
if we'd had the ability
to separate Tuvok and Neelix

667
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,321
the moment Tuvix came aboard...

668
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,865
I wouldn't have hesitated.

669
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,449
Of course not.

670
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,993
But now...

671
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,119
in the past few weeks...

672
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,165
he's begun to make a life
for himself on this ship.

673
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,917
He's taken on
responsibilities...

674
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,210
made friends...

675
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,213
I count myself
as one of them.

676
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,174
So, at what point did
he become an individual

677
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,510
and not a transporter
accident?

678
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,387
(<i> door chimes</i> )

679
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,264
(<i> sighs</i> )

680
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,307
Come in.

681
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,978
You wanted to see me, Captain?

682
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,773
Yes, Mr. Tuvix.

683
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,400
Please, sit down.

684
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,822
I feel as though

685
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,867
I've been dragged in front
of the Numirian Inquisition.

686
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,494
Will you excuse us, Commander?

687
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,332
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

688
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,043
We've just
been discussing

689
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,586
the unfortunate...

690
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:51,715
predicament
that we're all facing,

691
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,218
and I thought it was important
to get your perspective

692
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,554
before making a decision.

693
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:01,266
Are you suggesting that this
is your decision to make?

694
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,852
I am the Captain of this ship.

695
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,854
Begging your pardon, Captain,

696
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,439
it's my life.

697
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,190
Isn't it my decision?

698
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,318
Aren't there two other lives
to consider here?

699
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,613
What about Tuvok and Neelix--

700
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,283
two voices that we
can't hear right now?

701
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,661
As Captain,
I must be their voice,

702
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,414
and I believe
they would want to live.

703
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,458
But they<i> are</i> living, in a way.

704
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,709
Inside me.

705
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,169
It's not the same.

706
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,464
And I think you'd agree with me.

707
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,843
They have families.

708
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,177
Friends.

709
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,097
People who love them

710
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,808
and miss them
and want them back,

711
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,309
just as I do.

712
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,688
But restoring their lives
means sacrificing mine.

713
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,982
Captain...

714
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,276
what you're considering
is an execution.

715
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,194
An<i> execution--</i>

716
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,156
like they used to do
to murderers centuries ago--

717
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,617
and I've committed
no crime at all.

718
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,578
Aren't you arguing
for an execution, too--

719
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,538
of Tuvok and Neelix?

720
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,374
I'm here-- alive.

721
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,336
Unfortunate as it may be,
they're gone.

722
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,797
And I have an opportunity
to bring them back.

723
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:18,217
Don't you think that I care
about Tuvok and Neelix?

724
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,928
Of course I do!

725
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,472
Without them,
I wouldn't exist.

726
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,266
In a way, I think of them
as my parents.

727
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,686
I feel like
I know them intimately.

728
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,938
Then you know Tuvok was a man

729
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,025
who would gladly give
his life to save another.

730
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:36,277
And I believe the same
was true of Neelix.

731
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,489
You're right, Captain.

732
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,869
That<i> is</i> the Starfleet way.

733
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,706
And I know there'll
be some people

734
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,541
who will call me a coward

735
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,918
because I didn't
sacrifice myself

736
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,336
willingly.

737
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,671
Believe me,

738
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,756
I've thought of that.

739
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,009
But I have the will to live

740
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,760
of two men.

741
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,806
Look at me, Captain.

742
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,143
When I'm happy, I laugh.

743
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,811
When I'm sad, I cry.

744
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,396
When I stub my toe,

745
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,524
I yell out in pain.

746
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,985
I'm flesh and blood.

747
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:21,698
And I... have the right
to live!

748
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,218
Kes...

749
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,346
I need your help.

750
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,473
I've just come
from the Captain,

751
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,893
and she's thinking
about forcing me

752
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,311
to go through
with the separation.

753
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,525
If anybody can make
a difference, Kes, it's you.

754
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,444
She'll listen to you.

755
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,738
We've helped each other
through this,

756
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:07,244
and I know that you care
about what happens to me.

757
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,204
Please.

758
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,706
Kes, you may be my only hope.

759
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,381
(<i> door chimes</i> )

760
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,050
Come in.

761
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,012
Captain...

762
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,182
Tuvix has asked me
to speak to you on his behalf.

763
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,563
But I can't.

764
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,690
He shouldn't have put you
in the middle of this.

765
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,567
But I<i> am</i> in the middle.

766
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,403
I have been since
the moment of the accident.

767
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:47,033
I don't know how to say good-bye
to Neelix and Tuvok.

768
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,747
I know this sounds horrible...

769
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,625
and I feel so guilty
for saying it...

770
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,089
and Tuvix doesn't
deserve to die...

771
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,802
but I want Neelix back.

772
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,972
(<i> sobbing</i> )

773
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,486
You're excused, Ensign.

774
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,953
Mr. Paris,
what is our present speed?

775
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,455
Warp 6.5.

776
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:38,626
I'd like to conduct a field test
of the aft sensor array.

777
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,795
Please, slow to impulse.

778
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,007
Commander?

779
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:47,052
Until the Captain
makes a decision,

780
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,096
Mr. Tuvix is still
the Tactical Officer.

781
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,041
Mr. Tuvix?

782
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,586
I'd like to speak
to you alone.

783
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,047
Can I assume that you've
come to a decision, Captain?

784
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,592
I have.

785
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,386
I think we all
should hear

786
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,137
what you have
to say!

787
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,891
Please come with
me, Mr. Tuvix.

788
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,144
No.

789
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:43,108
I'm ordering you
to come with me.

790
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,322
Security to the Bridge.

791
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,200
Commander, are you going
to stand by and do nothing

792
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,993
while she commits murder?!

793
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,746
Wha..?

794
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,997
Mr. Ayala!

795
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,418
Yes...

796
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:03,586
Lieutenant Paris...

797
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,837
you...

798
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,261
Doesn't anyone see
that this is wrong?!

799
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,181
(<i> door opens</i> )

800
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,028
(<i> panting</i> )

801
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,950
JANEWAY:
Let him go.

802
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,457
Each of you

803
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:43,501
is going to have
to live with this...

804
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,672
and I'm sorry for that.

805
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,759
For you are all good...
good people.

806
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,054
My colleagues.

807
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,517
My friends.

808
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,316
I forgive you.

809
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,122
Commander Chakotay,

810
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:24,083
advise the Doctor
we're on our way to Sick Bay.

811
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,880
Deck 5.

812
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,275
I'm sorry, Captain,

813
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,237
but I cannot perform
the surgical separation.

814
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,989
I am a physician,

815
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,242
and a physician
must do no harm.

816
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,285
I will not take
Mr. Tuvix' life

817
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,745
against his will.

818
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,664
Very well, Doctor.

819
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,666
Please step aside.

820
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,595
I assume this is
the radioisotope.

821
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,434
Please sit down
on this bio-bed.

822
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,384
Locking surgical
targeting scanners

823
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,512
onto the isotope probe.

824
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,599
Initiating
separation sequence.

825
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,067
Energizing.

826
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,335
Neelix!

827
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,462
Hello, sweeting!

828
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,048
Greetings,
Captain.

829
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,676
Mr. Tuvok...

830
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,304
Mr. Neelix...

831
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,306
it's good to have you back.
