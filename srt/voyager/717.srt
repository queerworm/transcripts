<i>[narrator]</i>
<i>Last time on</i> Star Trek Voyager...

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,590
I believe we know each other.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,676
You're Tuvok, right?
We met last week at the shift briefing.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,638
Before that.
Before we were working here.

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,097
Oh, I don't think so.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,518
A romantic relationship is really
out of the question for me right now,

7
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,061
-and when you started asking...
-How about a friend?

8
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,145
What?

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,064
Could you use a friend?

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,983
It's nice to be in a place where
different species get along so well.

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,610
Oh, so you admit
we're getting along?

12
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,946
-[Kim]<i> Kim to Chakotay.</i>
-[Chakotay]<i> Go ahead.</i>

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,364
I've found them, Commander.

14
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,282
-Let go of me!
-I'm not going to hurt you.

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,617
[grunting]

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,701
[screams]

17
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,120
No! No!

18
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,457
Harry, I need
an emergency transport now!

19
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,130
No, leave me alone!

20
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,258
We're friends.
We're trying to help you.

21
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,634
No, don't touch me!

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,512
I don't believe you are
who you think you are!

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,473
[Tuvok] We don't belong here.

24
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,100
This isn't right!

25
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,685
We don't belong here!

26
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,728
[narrator]<i> And now the conclusion.</i>

27
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,488
-[man] Wait here.
-Yes, sir.

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,268
He's deactivated a safety field.

29
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,523
-[beeping]
-Alert Emergency Medical.

30
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,567
He may have tried to ju...
[grunting]

31
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,954
[groans]

32
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,514
I can't penetrate their shields.

33
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,893
Maybe we don't have to.

34
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,604
The Battle of Vorkado.

35
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,481
It's in my tactical database.

36
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,067
A Romulan captain
disabled two attacking vessels

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,944
by creating a photonic shock wave
between the ships.

38
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,112
How'd he do that?

39
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,781
Watch and learn.

40
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,457
I don't think they'll be
bothering us again.

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,959
Good work.
Let's go back for Chakotay.

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,421
Five more ships
on an intercept course.

43
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,840
What's your tactical database
telling you now?

44
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,303
Transporters are damaged.
Shields are failing.

45
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,888
We have to retreat,
come up with a new plan.

46
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,473
Agreed.

47
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,809
[indistinct chatter]

48
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,207
Listen, I'm sorry about my friend.

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,210
-Excuse me?
-Jaffen.

50
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,131
He wasn't very nice
when I invited you to join us.

51
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,468
Are you all right?

52
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,221
I'm just a little tired.

53
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,431
First day on a new job.

54
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,558
I know how that can be.

55
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,310
Well, I just wanted to let you know
you're more than welcome to sit with us.

56
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,105
Actually, I was thinking
about going home.

57
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,817
Well, if you change your mind,
we're celebrating.

58
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,652
What's the occasion?

59
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,738
I've decided
to move in with Jaffen.

60
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,324
Congratulations.

61
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,027
Look among the patrons.

62
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,418
Yerid, Criminal Investigations.

63
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,337
[scoffs]
We run an honest business.

64
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,548
I'm looking for two people
who disappeared

65
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,093
after leaving here earlier this evening.
One was a young pregnant woman...

66
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,261
B'Elanna?

67
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,512
You know her?

68
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,057
Oh, I knew I should have
walked her to the Transport.

69
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,685
Why, did you think someone
might try to hurt her?

70
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,645
The city is supposed
to be safe.

71
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,356
The person with her
was described as short

72
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,525
with mottled skin,
facial hair...

73
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,652
Sounds like someone
who was in here earlier,

74
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,196
-a worker from the plant.
-Do you know his name?

75
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,615
Uh...

76
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,201
Neelix, I think.

77
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,162
Did you see him talking to anyone else
while he was here?

78
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,999
He had a friend.
Uh, Amal something.

79
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,376
-Can you describe him?
-Oh, I don't have to.

80
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,586
He's sitting right over...

81
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,346
[Doctor]<i> ECH Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54622.4.</i>

82
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,974
<i>I've found an ingenious place</i>
<i>to hide while we make repairs--</i>

83
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,395
<i>a moon with a paramagnetic core</i>
<i>that masks our energy signature.</i>

84
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,189
<i>I've turned my attention</i>
<i>to Lieutenant Torres,</i>

85
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,734
<i>whose treatment</i>
<i>will also require ingenuity.</i>

86
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,863
The scan on the left was performed
during B'Elanna's last physical.

87
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,157
The one on the right,
just a few minutes ago.

88
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,370
The memory centers of her brain
have been radically altered.

89
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,538
People from our crew
seemed to remember

90
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,540
parts of their real lives,

91
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,126
but they got a lot
of the details wrong.

92
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,630
Tom knew his name,
that he was from Earth,

93
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,092
but he said space travel
made him sick.

94
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,095
Whoever did this
is very sophisticated,

95
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,264
capable of selectively
manipulating memory engrams.

96
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,892
Some have been suppressed,
some altered,

97
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,686
others left intact.

98
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,229
Can you undo the damage?

99
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,066
I believe so,
but it'll take some time.

100
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,443
I wish I could help.

101
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,945
Maybe you can.

102
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,863
She'll require several treatments.

103
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,075
In between, you could expose her
to familiar sights and surroundings.

104
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,618
Say no more.

105
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,122
I'll take her on a whirlwind tour
of her own life.

106
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,331
Don't rush things.

107
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,710
This is going to be
very traumatic for her.

108
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,424
[man] Acute anxiety, depression...

109
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,427
When I interviewed him, he insisted
that he's not who he's supposed to be

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,264
that we've... "stolen his katra,"
whatever that is.

111
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,766
Conclusions?

112
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,978
Tri-lobe regression complex?
Polar-affective disorder?

113
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,440
Neuropsychiatry isn't
a guessing game, Dr. Ravoc.

114
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,900
Dysphoria Syndrome.

115
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,154
You have been studying my research.

116
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,281
According to your work,
the condition is very rare.

117
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,743
It is.
I've treated this man before.

118
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,328
Apparently,
he's suffered a relapse.

119
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,164
Recommended treatment?

120
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,292
Engramatic resequencing
is typically indicated.

121
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,543
You seem skeptical.

122
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,713
Resequencing is a radical procedure.

123
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,300
If he had a malignant tumor,
would you be afraid to cut it out?

124
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,510
No.

125
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,890
This syndrome is just as insidious.
It requires aggressive treatment.

126
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,974
Get started.

127
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,278
Please... help me.

128
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,825
That's what we're here to do.

129
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,054
I want to know the status
of Employee 8583.

130
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,099
Maybe it's different
where you come from,

131
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,518
but here it's polite
to say "Good morning."

132
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,144
Good morning.

133
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,903
8583, the man who was removed
by Security yesterday.

134
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,488
He's been hospitalized.

135
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,909
Is there any reason to believe
that his condition might be contagious?

136
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,078
He came in contact
with other workers.

137
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,080
Some of them
have expressed concern.

138
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,915
Well, tell them not to worry.

139
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,543
Excuse me.
Am I intruding?

140
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,002
What can we do for you?

141
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,673
I'm investigating the disappearance
of two of your employees.

142
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,968
-Who?
-Their names are Neelix and Torres.

143
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,262
Both of them failed
to report for work today.

144
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,639
What about this man?

145
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,854
Employee 9363. He didn't report
for his shift either.

146
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,023
I'd like to see
his personnel file,

147
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,235
and I'll need to interview anyone
who may know where he is.

148
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,736
Why are you looking for him?

149
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,780
I believe he's responsible
for the disappearance

150
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,448
of the other two.

151
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,745
You've only been here three weeks.

152
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,040
-Where did you get all these things?
-I'm a collector.

153
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,337
You collect spent plasma relays?

154
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:15,008
I like to think of it
as a decorative object.

155
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,848
You know...

156
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,311
I think this would
look better over there.

157
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,730
You're not going to start telling me
how to dress, are you?

158
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,065
-[chuckles]
-Where are you going?

159
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,234
To get the rest of my things.

160
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,236
There's more?

161
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,389
Lights.

162
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,407
What do you want?

163
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,993
You told me you were moving out.

164
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,757
I needed a place to hide.

165
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,221
Jaffen knows where I am.
He'll come looking for me.

166
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,057
I'm hoping you won't tell him I'm here.

167
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,061
They say you had something to do

168
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,855
with the disappearance
of a woman at the plant.

169
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,528
I did.
Her name's B'Elanna.

170
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,947
She was brought to this planet
against her will.

171
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,200
Something was done to her
so she'd forget her real life.

172
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,953
And what,
you helped her get home?

173
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,162
That's right.

174
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,917
There are other people in this city
who I'm also trying to help.

175
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,546
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

176
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,047
You have to trust me.

177
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,425
You're pointing a weapon at me.

178
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,438
Go ahead. Report me.

179
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,481
But if you do,

180
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,859
a lot of innocent people
are going to suffer.

181
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,697
All I'm asking for is a place to stay
until my friends come back for me.

182
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,290
We're going to have to do
something about that arm.

183
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,922
[Torres] The waiter...
from the tavern.

184
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,717
Lieutenant Tom Paris,
our pilot,

185
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,844
and B'Elanna Torres,
our Chief Engineer.

186
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,222
That picture was taken
on your honeymoon.

187
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,850
It isn't possible.

188
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,728
How else would we have it?

189
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,863
It's an antique television.

190
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,032
You gave it to Tom as a present.

191
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,870
-He watches cartoons.
-Yes.

192
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,874
How do I know that?

193
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,001
Because you're starting to remember.

194
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,106
I wondered why he was
so protective of me.

195
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,903
I'll be outside if you need me.

196
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,391
Your shift ended three hours ago.

197
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:38,312
My friend Jaffen,
Employee 1326-- he cut himself.

198
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,773
Removing property from these premises
is not permitted.

199
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,277
I know, but he's just too stubborn
to go to the hospital.

200
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,989
I promise I'll have it back
first thing in the morning.

201
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,491
Be sure that you do.

202
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,635
Display the personnel file

You need a doctor.

It'll have to wait
till I'm back on<i> Voyager.</i>

217
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,812
<i>Voyager?</i>

218
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,106
My ship.

219
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,983
You live onboard?

220
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,279
For almost seven years.

221
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,740
Don't you ever want
to stay in one place?

222
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,165
You seem happy here.

223
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,459
I've got a good job.

224
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,711
Ever consider doing something
more challenging?

225
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,506
My job's challenging enough.

226
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,218
You monitor reactor coils, right?

227
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,762
You're obviously
a very capable woman.

228
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,806
You could probably run
that power plant.

229
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,517
Why would I want
all that responsibility?

230
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,477
[com chirps]

231
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,728
What's that?

232
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,731
My people are trying
to contact me.

233
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,442
Chakotay here.

234
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,361
[Kim]<i> Are you okay, Commander?</i>

235
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,655
For the time being.
Can you get me out of here?

236
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,823
<i>No, sir.</i>

237
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,575
We're eight light-years away.

238
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,494
[Chakotay]<i> How are you transmitting</i>
<i>a signal that far?</i>

239
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,288
We're using a triaxilating frequency

240
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,540
on a covariant subspace band.

241
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,208
<i>It was B'Elanna's idea.</i>

242
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,503
I take it she's feeling better.

243
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,463
<i>She's responded well to treatment.</i>

244
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,591
<i>Have you located anyone else</i>
<i>from the crew?</i>

245
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,886
As a matter of fact, I'm sitting
with Captain Janeway right now.

246
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,890
<i>-How is she?</i>
-A little suspicious,

247
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,101
just like B'Elanna was at first.

248
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,937
How soon can you get back
into transporter range?

249
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,897
We'll need a couple more days
to finish repairs.

250
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,399
What about the shield grid?

251
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,067
<i>I have an idea</i>
<i>how to shut it down.</i>

252
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,988
Until I get back to you,
let's maintain com silence,

253
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,032
just in case we're being monitored.

254
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,451
<i>Understood.</i>
<i>Good luck, Commander.</i>

255
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,412
Why did you call me "Captain"?

256
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,874
Because that's who you are.

257
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,792
That's absurd.

258
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,462
So what are you saying?

259
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,256
That I was brought here by force, too?
That my memories were manipulated?

260
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,718
-I know it sounds strange, but...
-Helping you was a mistake.

261
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,096
Listen to me.

262
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,600
There are more than a hundred
members of<i> Voyager's</i> crew

263
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,102
working at that power plant--
your crew.

264
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,606
And when our ship gets here,
I'll be able to prove it to you.

265
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,441
Look...

266
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,654
I don't want to force you to do
anything you don't want to,

267
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,572
but don't you at least want
to know the truth?

268
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,158
Let me prove who I am.

269
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,369
Hand me that dermal regenerator.

270
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,226
We're the same race.

271
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,857
We're more than that.

272
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,484
We're friends.

273
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,118
Am I hearing you correctly?

274
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,328
You're actually helping this man?

275
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,668
He abducted one of the workers.

276
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,628
She's a member of his crew.

277
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,423
Right, and you're the Captain.

278
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,093
Don't you see?
He's trying to convince you

279
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,555
that you'll have a better life
if you go with him.

280
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,557
Do you want to go with him?

281
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,934
No.

282
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:31,063
Then why are you risking
everything we have?

283
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,154
-[door opens]
-I was starting to think...

284
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,406
Stay where you are.

285
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,700
[shouts]

286
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,252
[Chakotay] I don't know them.

287
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,379
I think you do,

288
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,424
and I think you were involved
in their disappearance.

289
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,717
[sighs]

290
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,511
I'm not the man you're looking for.

291
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,139
Yes, the witness' description
doesn't fit you exactly,

292
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,099
but I'm sure that'll be explained
once the doctor here

293
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,436
finds evidence of dermal regeneration.

294
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,814
What is it?

295
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,777
Some kind of...
communications device

296
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,779
implanted under his skin.

297
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,322
Remove it.

298
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:28,120
Listen to me.
You and I have something in common.

299
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,830
Oh?

300
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,208
We're both investigating disappearances.

301
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,794
If you answer my questions,
I'll answer yours.

302
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,716
I have an order to transfer
this patient to Division 6.

303
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,176
Division 6?

304
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,385
Neuropathology.

305
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,304
We have reason to believe
that he's mentally ill.

306
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,307
He's lying. How could they know that?
They've never examined me.

307
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,851
-I'll come with you.
-I'm sorry, sir,

308
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,895
but my orders are to bring him
for immediate treatment.

309
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,897
This man is a suspect
in a serious crime.

310
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,398
I'm not letting him
out of my sight.

311
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,359
If you check the order,
you'll see it's been approved

312
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,653
by the Director of Investigations.

313
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,409
My real name is Chakotay.

314
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm an officer aboard
the Federation Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

315
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,789
Members of my crew were abducted,

316
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,083
and their memories were altered,
and they were put to work here.

317
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,501
I can give you names,
descriptions!

318
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,211
[shouting] Listen to me!

319
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,507
Ah...

320
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,927
[chuckles]

321
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,846
Smells good.

322
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,348
Pancakes with maple syrup
are your favorite breakfast.

323
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,812
You know, sometimes food
is like time travel.

324
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,648
You inhale an aroma,
take a bite of something,

325
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,651
and suddenly, bam, you're back
at the moment you first tasted it.

326
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,446
They're good.

327
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,490
I'm not experiencing time travel.

328
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,826
What are you reading?

329
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,120
Personal logs.

330
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,330
Do you remember
recording any of them?

331
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,624
Oh, they're not mine,
they're Tom's.

332
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,169
Those are supposed
to be private.

333
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,547
Well, he is my husband.

334
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,258
What do they say?

335
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,594
They're private.

336
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,973
But the way he describes me...

337
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,308
He loves you.

338
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,852
I guess so.

339
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,563
How do you feel?

340
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,318
It's still a little foggy.

341
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,155
That fog should lift as soon as
the Doctor finishes your treatments.

342
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,531
Yeah...

343
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,619
but what about the guy
who recorded these logs?

344
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,079
I've been analyzing our scans

345
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,457
of the Quarren patrol ships
that attacked us,

346
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,627
and I think I've devised a way
of evading their sensors.

347
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,171
You do have a knack
for tactical planning.

348
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,633
Hmm. That's something I've been meaning
to discuss with you.

349
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,510
Once we've succeeded in this mission,
and I'm certain we will,

350
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,889
I'd like you to help me program
a new medical hologram.

351
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,225
You don't like the idea
of going back to your old job

352
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,685
now that you've had a taste
of command.

353
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,436
I'm a skilled officer.

354
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,565
No offense, Doc, but that skill
was programmed into you.

355
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,108
-Yes, but...
-I'm sure once you're back

356
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,444
to your old self, you'll be happy
being a full-time doctor again.

357
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,821
[beeping]

358
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,868
Commander Chakotay's hailing us.

359
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,205
We're receiving you, sir.
Go ahead.

360
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,082
<i>I'm having trouble</i>
<i>with my transceiver.</i>

361
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,417
<i>This may be the last chance</i>
<i>we have to talk.</i>

362
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,585
What's your status?

363
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,672
I'm almost ready
to shut down the shield grid.

364
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,174
I'm sending you
encrypted instructions.

365
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,802
They'll tell you where
and when to enter orbit.

366
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,138
-[Kim]<i> We have it, Commander.</i>
-Chakotay out.

367
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,809
Well, now you know
where to find<i> Voyager...</i>

368
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,812
I'll have three ships with me.
They won't escape again.

369
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,481
If you'd done your job the first time,
we wouldn't have a problem now.

370
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,115
Don't you have patients to attend to?

371
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,908
Uh, yes, sir.

372
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,451
I've been thinking.

373
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,036
This is the second person
we've admitted

374
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,456
with Dysphoria Syndrome in two days,
and they both work at the power plant.

375
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,627
Maybe we should issue a health alert,
examine the rest of the workers.

376
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,295
Do you think I'm incompetent?

377
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,047
Sir?

378
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,969
This man is in charge of personnel
at the power facility.

379
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,221
I've informed him of the situation.

380
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,223
We're already taking steps
to ensure the safety

381
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,434
of all of our employees.

382
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,645
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

383
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,189
No need to apologize, Doctor.

384
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,109
Your concern for your patients
is admirable,

385
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,863
but don't worry. This man is already
responding to treatment.

386
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,157
I expect a full recovery.

387
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,247
Why would this Tuvok be collecting
information about his coworkers?

388
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,751
I don't know, but the name on one
of those files is B'Elanna Torres.

389
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,087
They both began working
at the plant on the same day,

390
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:51,133
along with 136 others,
including myself.

391
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,677
What's unusual about that?

392
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,930
More than 100 skilled employees,
most of them the same species,

393
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,141
acquired in a single day...

394
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,893
during a labor shortage?

395
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,062
You'll also note
that every one of them

396
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,856
was processed with the Central Hospital
when they arrived.

397
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,025
It's routine for new workers
to be examined.

398
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,069
Yes, by Quarantine Control.

399
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,529
But everyone on this list--
all of them--

400
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,948
were processed through Division 6.

401
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,951
You came through Neuropathology?

402
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,703
That's what the records indicate,

403
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,747
but I don't remember being there.

404
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,376
[sighs]
What do you expect me to do?

405
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,170
You can start
by interviewing Mr. Tuvok.

406
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,881
-You'll find him at the hospital.
-Why is he there?

407
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,927
He became emotionally unstable.

408
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,347
Even if I wanted to help you,
I couldn't.

409
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,765
Why not?

410
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,477
The Director of Investigations
relieved me of duty this morning.

411
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,648
Yerid, I thought that was you.

412
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,316
Have you found out anything
about B'Elanna?

413
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,608
He can't assist you.

414
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,362
He's been relieved of duty.

415
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,738
Oh.

416
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,032
This man's also in Tuvok's file.

417
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,034
What file?

418
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,329
Why don't you tell him?

419
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,705
Tell me what?

420
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,334
I can't go back to the hospital
and start asking questions.

421
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,086
I'd be reported.

422
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,714
Maybe I can help.

423
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,510
Recently, I've been...

424
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,013
I'm a doctor.
You can trust me.

425
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,643
I've been experiencing...

426
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,813
some disturbing thoughts.

427
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,565
I don't believe
it's anything serious,

428
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,275
but I would like
to speak with someone.

429
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,069
Well, you've come to the right place.

430
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:43,453
Guest Labor Code Green,
Employee 8586.

431
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,584
Hansen, Annika.

432
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,752
You've been a patient here before.

433
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,754
Yes, when I first arrived.

434
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,508
You were treated for
Dysphoria Syndrome.

435
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,303
I don't recall that.

436
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,305
These disturbing thoughts you mentioned--

437
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,974
would you characterize them
as hallucinations?

438
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,851
What's the cause of this syndrome?

439
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,103
We're conducting studies
to determine that.

440
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,897
Fortunately, we have one
of the foremost experts

441
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,315
on the condition working here.

442
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,900
I'd like to speak with this expert.

443
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,943
-Well, Dr. Kadan's very busy.
-So am I.

444
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,945
Perhaps I should return
when he's free.

445
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,573
Uh, wait here. I'll find him.

446
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,837
[door chimes]

447
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,339
-[door opens]
-[Jaffen] Yes?

448
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,342
My name is Yerid.
I'm from Criminal Investigations.

449
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,801
[Jaffen] How can I help you?

450
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,179
Kathryn Janeway?

451
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,889
Yes?

452
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,771
Do you know this man?

453
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,693
No.

454
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,111
I thought maybe you'd met him.

455
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,613
Why?

456
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,490
He was found
in your former living quarters,

457
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,160
in possession of a dermal regenerator
that you removed from the plant.

458
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,495
I was the one who helped him.

459
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,955
Jaffen...

460
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,590
[sighs]
He said he was from a starship,

461
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,551
and that members of his crew
had been abducted.

462
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,428
He was obviously lying.

463
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,472
I want to know everything he told you.

464
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,729
-How could she just walk out?
-She was a voluntary patient.

465
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,023
There was no reason
for Security to stop her.

466
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,568
She accessed 64 restricted files,

467
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,655
all of them for people diagnosed
with Dysphoria Syndrome.

468
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,949
According to the records,

469
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,368
those patients were
all admitted on the same day,

470
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,746
and you're listed as
the attending physician in every case.

471
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,416
Oh, yes, I remember.
Quite an outbreak.

472
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,251
You've never mentioned it.

473
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,420
Well, I'm sorry if I haven't kept you

474
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,047
properly informed about my patients.

475
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,925
Every one of them was discharged
to the Main Power Authority.

476
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,553
That supervisor you were talking to--
that's where he worked.

477
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,430
I explained that to you.

478
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:10,017
I was informing him
about a potential health threat.

479
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,188
That plant worker,
Amal Kotay--

480
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,274
he claimed that his friends
had been abducted

481
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,235
and put to work after having
their memories altered.

482
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,279
What are you implying?

483
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,991
You're making false diagnoses,

484
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,703
selectively changing
what people remember

485
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,955
and then sending them
to work at the power plant.

486
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,667
Very good, Doctor.

487
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,461
Why?

488
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,505
A physician with more experience

489
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,717
would be able to see this
in the larger context.

490
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,346
The true public health threat
is the labor shortage,

491
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,766
and the only cure is to find
more skilled workers.

492
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,977
We're doctors.
We're not supposed to harm patients.

493
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,897
We're helping them to lead
productive, happy lives.

494
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,274
By altering their memories?

495
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,902
The treatment I provide
improves their lives

496
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,779
and makes them better workers.

497
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,531
In turn, our economy benefits.

498
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,537
You're profiting from this,
aren't you?

499
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:17,042
Doesn't a physician deserve
to be compensated for his services?

500
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,169
I'll report you.

501
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,670
To whom?

502
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,465
My research is funded
by the Ministry of Health.

503
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,760
Well, Criminal Investigations, then.

504
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,180
As you may recall,

505
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,600
the Director of Investigations
was the one who ordered

506
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,938
Amal Kotay be placed under my care.

507
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,650
Does everyone know about this?

508
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,612
Not everyone.
Just a few trusted associates.

509
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,035
The question is...
are you going to be one of them?

510
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,457
[Officer] She's considered dangerous.

511
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,543
She's never been in here.

512
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,710
You're sure?

513
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,130
[laughs]
I don't think I'd forget that face.

514
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,800
If you do see her,
report it immediately.

515
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,802
She needs to be hospitalized.

516
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,807
[door opens, closes]

517
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,642
It's safe now.

518
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,189
Thank you.

519
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:25,819
Well, if you really want to thank me,
you can tell me what's going on.

520
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,156
It appears this Chakotay
was telling the truth.

521
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:32,117
So, uh, every worker at the plant
had their memories altered?

522
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,869
I don't believe it's every worker.

523
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,163
Your name didn't appear
in Dr. Kadan's patient files,

524
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,706
but mine did.

525
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,124
So did yours.

526
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,334
We should report this
to the authorities.

527
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,546
I'll need more evidence
before I start making accusations.

528
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,133
Chakotay said he had proof
of my real identity...

529
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,677
aboard a ship called<i> Voyager.</i>

530
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,929
How can we locate it?

531
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,182
When his crew contacted him,

532
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,809
they were using...

533
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:03,356
a triaxilating frequency
on a covariant subspace band.

534
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,067
There's a subspace transponder
at the power plant.

535
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,575
I'm going back to the plant
to try to contact this ship.

536
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,369
I understand if you don't want
to be involved.

537
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,080
I've been involved
from the moment I met you.

538
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,251
If I were to return to the hospital
in your custody,

539
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,213
it would give us an opportunity
to help Chakotay and Tuvok.

540
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,718
I had to sedate her.
She wouldn't come voluntarily.

541
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,721
Her condition's obviously worsened.

542
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,223
I'll treat her.

543
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,975
There are some other patients
I'd like to interview.

544
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,856
These people can't be disturbed.

545
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,657
I suggest you comply.

546
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,414
[door opens]

547
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,959
Be careful.

548
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,437
-We're being hailed.
-[Doctor] On screen.

549
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,441
Starship Voyager...

550
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,985
Captain?

551
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,280
<i>Why don't you just call me Kathryn?</i>

552
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,783
Yes, ma'am.
Where's Commander Chakotay?

553
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,451
<i>Hospitalized.</i>

554
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,704
He told me you had proof...

555
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,082
of who some of us really are.

556
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,709
<i>We do.</i>

557
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,503
You're the woman who was abducted.

558
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,964
<i>Chakotay was supposed</i>
<i>to deactivate the shield grid,</i>

559
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,758
<i>so we could transport you</i>
<i>and the others to safety.</i>

560
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,760
<i>If you could find a way</i>
<i>to shut down main power,</i>

561
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,554
<i>the shield grid will go down, too.</i>

562
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,139
<i>Will you help us?</i>

563
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,767
[rumbling]

564
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,894
We're under attack.
Three ships.

565
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,819
<i>Please, shut down the shield--</i>

566
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,487
[beeping]

567
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,498
Jaffen?

568
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,171
Stop!

569
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,771
[alarm blaring]

570
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,148
Don't move!

572
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,657

[grunting]

574
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,419
I hope you didn't think
I abandoned you.

575
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,754
Never occurred to me.

576
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,465
We need to shut down
the main generators.

577
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,513
So much for evading their sensors.

578
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,766
The only way they could've found us
is if they knew exactly where to look.

579
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,604
Transporters are off-line.

580
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,693
-[woman] Evacuate.
-[man] My port is shut down.

581
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,280
We'll never get to
the generator controls.

582
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,411
-Maybe we don't have to.
-What are you doing?

583
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,288
If I can make the computer think
the core is going to overload,

584
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,582
the main power should
automatically shut down.

585
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,626
[beeping]

586
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,475
Ask them to give us some privacy.

587
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,310
You're dismissed.

588
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,395
[footsteps retreating]

589
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,565
Disconnect them.

590
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,280
Dr. Ravoc?

591
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,074
Why is this man here?

592
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,910
Dysphoria Syndrome.

593
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,495
[clicking]

594
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,709
We're losing shields.

595
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,086
Any advice from your tactical database?

596
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,671
Nothing relevant.

597
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,965
How many escape pods
do we have left?

598
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,842
Five.

599
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,385
Stand by to eject three of them.

600
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,679
I don't think abandoning ship
is the answer.

601
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,556
Neither do I.
Can you create a dampening field

602
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,475
around the briefing room
that'll mask our life signs?

603
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,226
I believe so. Why?

604
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,936
Watch and learn.

605
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,822
<i>Your crew's abandoned you again.</i>

606
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,991
<i>I suggest you surrender your vessel.</i>

607
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,369
You should realize by now that
I'm not programmed to do that.

608
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,421
Bravo, Ensign.

609
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,757
B'Elanna, I need those transporters.

610
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,635
You better hurry up.

611
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,222
Come on... do it.

612
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,474

[man] We've got to go!

616
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,201
Their shield grid's failing.

617
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,370
B'Elanna?

618
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,914

<i>and thanks to my experience</i>
<i>with Lieutenant Torres,</i>

622

<i>their treatment</i>

<i>While they're recovering,</i>

624
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,694
<i>I still have a few command duties</i>
<i>left to perform.</i>

625
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,112
If it weren't for your efforts,

626
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,823
this whole conspiracy might
never have been uncovered.

627
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,075
What'll happen to the workers?

628
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,911
Well, we've identified several thousand
of Dr. Kadan's patients.

629
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,289
Once they're treated,
they'll be repatriated.

630
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,291
We appreciate everything you've done.

631
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,959

What's that for?

639
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,963
For taking care of me,

640
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,424
even when you didn't know
who I was.

641
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,347
Ow!

642
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,723
What was that for?

643
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,934
Flirting with your customers.

644
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,354
I was a victim of mind control.

645
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,357
Mm-hmm.

646
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,247
I can see why
you'd rather live here.

647
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,667
I'd offer you a position.

648
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,711
I could always use
another skilled engineer.

649
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,506
But as the Captain...

650
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,052
it wouldn't really be
appropriate for me to...

651
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,388
Fraternize with a member
of your crew.

652
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,559
Well, at least my memories
weren't tampered with.

653
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,395
According to the medical reports,

654
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,439
I really did come to Quarra
looking for a better life,

655
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,359
and now that I've been promoted,
I guess I've succeeded.

656
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,361
Promotion?

657
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,990
They had to replace
our shift supervisor.

658
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,910
Something about
acquiring workers illegally.

659
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,163
Congratulations.
You deserve it.

660
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,417
I thought you might
like these back...

661
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,670
to remind you
of our time together.

662
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:50,091
I won't need souvenirs
to remember you.

663
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,742

00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,511
Ready to go?

It may not have been real,
Chakotay,

666
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,933
but it felt like home.

667
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,270
If you hadn't come after me,

668
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,440
I never would've known
that I had another life.

669
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,859
Are you sorry I showed up?

670
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,614
Not for a second.

671
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,827
Resume course, Mr. Paris.

672
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,496
[Paris] Aye, sir.
