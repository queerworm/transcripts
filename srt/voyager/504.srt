Welcome to Earth.

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,398
I am Admiral Bullock and I will
be your commanding officer

4
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,024
for the next six months.

5
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,778
Questions, comments--
bring them to me.

6
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,199
Problems--
talk to Lieutenant Kinis.

Larson...

8
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,077
you're assigned
to the Federation Counsel

9
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,538
Deputy Liaison Officer.

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,333
Young and Reiskin, report
to Orbital Flight Control.

11
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,169
You'll be monitoring incoming
vessels from the Bolian sector.

12
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,213
Report back
to your commanding officer

13
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,047
as soon as you've completed
your assignments.

I can save you
some time there, son.

They're bamboo.

19
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,777
I know that.

20
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,530
Unfortunately, my tricorder
is reading them as maple trees.

21
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,657
I think the isodyne relays
must be malfunctioning.

22
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,993
Well, why don't you pay
a visit to Logistical Support?

23
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,786
Maybe they'll issue
you a new one.

24
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,996
Good idea.

25
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,330
I'm going
that way myself.

26
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,623
Mind some company?

27
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,791
Not at all.

28
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,626
So, what's your
assignment here?

29

I haven't received
my orders yet.

31
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,797
I just arrived.

32
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,007
From where?

33
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,009
A three-year tour
on the<i> Intrepid.</i>

34
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,677
Is that a fact?

35
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,221
I thought the<i> Intrepid</i> was
patrolling the Neutral Zone.

36
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,266
It is. I caught a transport
vessel at Deep Space 7.

37
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,021
Got tired of wrestling
with the Romulans?

38
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,148
Let's just say
it's good to be back.

39
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,358
What about yourself?

40
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,652
How long have you been
posted here, Mister...?

41
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,822
Boothby. Boothby
is the name.

42
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,323
Boothby, I've heard of you.

43
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,783
I should hope so.

44
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,494
I've been tending these
grounds for 54 years.

45
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,705
Give or take
a few months.

46
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,165
And beautiful
grounds they are.

47
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,834
Mm-hmm.

48
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,044
Logistical Support.

49
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,879
Straight through
the main complex,

50
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,214
second door
on your right.

51
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,049
Thank you.

52
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,800
Commander.

53
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,844
Logistics is a secure area.

54
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,179
They won't let you in

55

holo-imaging device.

56
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,058
Fresh from
the Neutral Zone...

57
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,685
You're not a Romulan
double agent are you, son?

58
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,063
Actually, I was just
recording a few images

59
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,647
for my friends back home.

60
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,357
Would you mind
posing for a shot?

61
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,651
Me? You want a picture of me?

62
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,113
The one and only Boothby.
My friends would be impressed.

63
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:42,282
Well, when you
put it that way.

64
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,784
Cadet!

65
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,202
Take our picture,
will you?

66
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,540
Don't cut off our heads.

67
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,091
I expect a copy of that,
young man.

You're in my seat.

And you're reading my book.

74
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,750
You want my drink, too?

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,003
Depends. What is it?

76
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,923
Klingon martini-- vermouth,
gin, with a dash of bloodwine.

77
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,302
Bloodwine-- never
touch the stuff.

78
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,637
What do you like?

79
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,473

Nice tattoo.

83
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,271
I bet there's a story behind it.

Thanks anyway.

You first.
Where are you from?

Everywhere. My parents
were starship officers.

I'd seen half the Quadrant.

Reverted?

Not yet.

Ensign O'Halloran, this is
his third time this week.

106

Oh, I can keep my human form.

It's the little things
that bother me.

111
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,800
Little things?

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,010
Breathing oxygen,

113
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,428

00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,101

I know what you mean.

117
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,978
That's why I started
reading their books.

For some reason,
it helps me relax.

119
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,609
But we shouldn't be
talking about this.

Be human. Remember?

How could I forget?

122
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,492
So, had a chance
to take a look around?

123
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,203
Not yet.

124
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,205
Headquarters has
a lot more to offer

125
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,374
than conference rooms
and consoles...

126
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,833
if you have the right guide.

127
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,835
Is that an invitation?

128
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,380
I get off duty at 1900 hours.

I'm afraid not.

137
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,895
What about tonight?

138
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,188
Do we have a date?

139
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,481
1900 hours--

140
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,732
meet you right here.

141
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,609
I'll do my best.

142

00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,410
Relax, Tuvok. I plan
on standing her up.

145
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,536
We agreed to limit our
investigation to surveillance.

146
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,746
It was worth the risk.

147
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,457
She talked
about training.

148
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,418
These are some kind of aliens
learning to pose as humans.

149
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,627
For what purpose?

150
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,963
I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

151
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,467

to ask you to come with me.

Why?

from Admiral Bullock.

Listen, Ensign, we're late for a
meeting with Starfleet Command.

162
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,868
The debriefing will
have to wait.

163
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,828
I'm sorry, Commander.

164
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,623

165
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,958

to report this incident.

00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,466
Who are you?

185
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,967
Gentry, David.

186
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,344
Rank: Ensign.

187
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:58,181
Starfleet service number
9-9-beta-3-2-7-8.

188
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,807
Planet of origin: Earth.

189
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,144
We're not interested in your
knowledge of human culture.

190
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,564
We're not part of
your re-creation.

191
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,399
I'm Captain Janeway

192
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,068
of the Federation Starship
<i>Voyager.</i>

193
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,486
<i>I'm</i> from Earth.

194
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,280
You're not.

195
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,740
Gentry, David.

196
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,242
Rank: Ensign.

197
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,493
Starfleet Service Number

198
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,995
9-9-beta-3-2-7-8.

199
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,539
Doctor.

200
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,499
What are you doing?

201
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,167
I need a sample
of your DNA.

202
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,335
Why?

203
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,296
Since you won't
tell us who you are,

204
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,506
we have no choice but
to find out for ourselves.

205
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,840
You won't be harmed.

206
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,759
Gentry to Headquarters.
Security alert!

207
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,219
We've disabled
your combadge.

208
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,138
No!

209
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,348
Don't touch me.

210
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,975
Disease!

211
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,518
Humans!

212
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,812
( whining snarl )

213
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,649
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

214
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,154
It appears he's released

215
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,615
a cellular toxin
into his bloodstream.

216
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,074
He's dead.

217
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,166
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

218
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,751
<i>Until we know</i>
<i>exactly what's going on,</i>

219
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,088
<i>I'm keeping</i> Voyager<i> concealed</i>
<i>behind a class-3 moon.</i>

220
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,091
CHAKOTAY:
Federation Council,
Astrophysics,

221
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,926
Starfleet Medical Complex.

222
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,387
They even re-created
the officers' club--

223
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,888
the Quantum Cafe.

224
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,224
Computer, return
to time index 4228.

225
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,270
That's Boothby.
SEVEN: Captain?

226
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,315
The head groundskeeper
at Starfleet Academy.

227
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,690
When I was a cadet,

228
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,818
he used to give me fresh
roses for my quarters.

229
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,069
It's safe
to assume

230
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,988
this individual
is not Boothby.

231
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,906
Whoever they are,
they've gathered

232
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,659
incredibly accurate
information

233
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,327
about Starfleet
Headquarters.

234
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,996
Perhaps they had access
to a Federation database.

235
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,123
Or they've been
to San Francisco.

236
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,125
The habitat's
population consists

237
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,794
of humans, Vulcans,
Bolians, Ferengi...

238
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,547
All Alpha Quadrant
species.

239
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,881
What do we know

240
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,883
about this artificial
environment, Seven?

241
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,385
I've used the tricorder data

242
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,969
holo-images and
astrometric scans

243
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,972
to extrapolate a cross-section
of the interior.

244
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,350
I believe they used
a combination

245
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,311
of holographic projection
and particle synthesis.

246
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,646
Power source?

247
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,980
There are 13

248
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,731
thermionic generators
beneath the city.

249
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,568
I can't identify
the energy signatures.

250
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,069
The habitat's
heavily fortified.

251
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,112
They are well prepared
to defend against an attack.

252
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,031
DOCTOR:<i> Sickbay to Captain.</i> 
Go ahead.

253
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,866
<i>I've completed</i>
<i>my postmortem analysis.</i>

254
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,284
<i>You'd better get down here.</i>

255
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,953
On my way.
If this<i> is</i> a training ground,

256
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,916
it could mean they're planning
an invasion of the Federation.

257
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,876
We should prepare for the worst.

258
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,465
See if you can find a way
to penetrate their defenses.

259
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,886
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

260
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,180
DOCTOR:
He may look human,
he may sound human,

261
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,932
he may even smell human,

262
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,559
but there's no question--
he's alien.

263
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,436
Was he genetically
altered?

264
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,479
On a highly
sophisticated level.

265
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,481
If it weren't
for microcellular scans,

266
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,108
I wouldn't be able
to distinguish him

267
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,984
from the genuine article.

268
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,613
I've managed to isolate
the alien DNA.

269
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,116
Fortunately, most of his cells
are still chemically active.

270
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,744
If I use
a cytokinetic injection,

271
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,663
I should be able to trigger
a genetic reversion.

272
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,707
Do it.

273
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,260
( rippling )

274
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,305
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

275
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,908
Talk about a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

276
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,619
Species 8472.

277
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,412
The question is:

278
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:53,082
Why are they training
to pose as human beings?

279
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,334
Back in
the 20th century,

280
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,586
the Soviets used
to build American towns

281
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,921
to train their agents to
infiltrate the United States.

282
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,049
Species 8472 could be doing
the same thing.

283
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,259
They're going

284
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,969
to infiltrate
the Alpha Quadrant.

285
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,262
Maybe they already have.

286
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,515
Tom's right. How
else could they

287
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,725
have gathered their
information about us?

288
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,268
Perhaps they acquired it
from the Borg.

289
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,729
It doesn't matter
how they got their data.

290
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,731
We need to find out
what they intend to do with it.

291
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,359
If our previous experience
is any indication,

292
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,695
they will try
to destroy Earth.

293
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,613
A logical assumption.

294
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,991
They did threaten to purge
our galaxy of all life.

295
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,327
Tuvok, keep working on a way

296
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,538
to target
their habitat's power source.

297
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,374
We're going to need nanoprobe
warheads and plenty of them.

298
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,625
Seven, see to it.

299
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,544
Yes, Captain.

300
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,629
In the meantime, I've
got a date to keep.

301
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,131
I made contact
with one of them--

302
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,842
Commander Valerie Archer.

303
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,260
Maybe I can capitalize
on the relationship,

304
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,471
get a better idea
of what they're planning.

305
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,349
Tom, Harry, take him back
in the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

306
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,519
Keep a constant transporter
lock on him.

307
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,857
If Species 8472 attacks Earth...

308
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,860
the Federation won't have
any defenses against them,

309
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,611
and I don't need to remind you

310
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,364
that we have no way
to warn Starfleet Command.

311
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,242
<i>Voyager</i> may be the last defense

312
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,536
against an all-out invasion
of Earth.

313
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:15,623
(<i> suspenseful theme swells</i> )

314
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,214
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

315
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,508
Last minute preparations?

316
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,343
Just planning
my big night out.

317
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,887
I can recommend
a nice Japanese

318
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,971
replimat on
the Embarcadero.

319
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,349
I was never very good
with chopsticks.

320
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,851
Starfleet Headquarters.

321
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,227
Brings back memories

322
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,396
even if it is
just a re-creation.

323
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,481
I remember my
last visit there.

324
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,275
I was given my
general orders

325
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,151
for<i> Voyager's</i>
first mission--

326
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,196
proceed to the Badlands,
and find the Maquis.

327
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,699
The orders
that brought us together.

328
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,200
What about you?

329
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,703
When was the last time
you were at Headquarters?

330
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,329
Before today?

331
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,665
March 3, 2368--

332
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,417
the day I resigned
my commission.

333
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,336
I can still remember
the look on the Admiral's face.

334
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,588
Which one?

335
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,964
Namimby.

336
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,049
He taught at the
Academy, didn't he?

337
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,217
That's right.

338
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,720
Interspecies ethics,
wasn't it?

339
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,097
Tactical analysis.

340
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,557
Of course.

341
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,769
( sighs )

342
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,854
Kathryn, you think
I might be one of them.

343
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,147
You're testing me.

344
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,526
You and Tuvok were
in the alien habitat

345
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,945
for nearly three hours.

346
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,071
Anything could have
happened down there.

347
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,365
True.

348
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,992
Why don't you have Tuvok
meet us in Sickbay?

349
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,286
The doctor can perform
a microcellular analysis.

350
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,289
Tuvok's already there.

351
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,209
You could've just asked me
to report to Sickbay.

352
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,878
Given Ensign
Gentry's reaction,

353
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,674
I thought I'd be
a little more tactful.

354
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,761
You're not taking any
chances, are you?

355
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,179
Don't feel singled out.

356
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,264
I've asked the doctor
to examine the entire crew.

357
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,516
There's no telling
how 8472

358
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,476
got their information
about Starfleet--

359
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,854
from the Borg, Earth.

360
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,815
For all we know, there's

That's a relief.
And Tuvok?

Well, two down,

00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,665
You'd better get going.

Right.

I've enhanced this tricorder

with a transoptic
datalink.

376
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,558
It should help you access
some of their systems.

Type-1 phaser, modified
to fire Borg nanoprobes.

378
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,729
Right.

379
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,231
Do you always arm yourself
before a first date?

380
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,317
You've never had a date
with Species 8472.

381
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,571
Personally, I don't go out
with girls from other galaxies.

382
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,113
You're a true
explorer, Chakotay.

383
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,365
Is she cute?

384
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,283
In her human form, anyway.

385
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,870
I've always wondered what it
would be like to date an alien.

386
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,079
I'll take notes.

DOCTOR:
Feisty little fellows.

392

You've increased their cellular
motility by over 200 percent.

393
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,887
I thought
it would be prudent

394
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,263
to maximize
their efficiency.

395
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,432
Seven, the last time
we used nanoprobes,

396
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,893
we sent 8472 scurrying
back to fluidic space.

397
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,937
You can't get more
efficient than that.

398

The species
is highly adaptive.

It's been over a year
since our first encounter.

400
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,359
They may have developed
a defense

401
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,778
against our technology.

402
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,613
There's one way to find out.

403
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,865
We can test the nanoprobes
on our corpse.

404
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,825
You'll find the body
in Morgue Chamber 3.

405
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,660
Beam it to the surgical bay.

406
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,537
The creature's only been dead
for a few hours.

407
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,790
There should still be plenty
of cellular activity.

408
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,250
Initiate a bio-scan,
full spectrum.

409
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,502
Don't worry.

410
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,712
It's an autonomic reflex.

411
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,213
The creature
still has residual

00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,466
bio-electric activity
in its nervous system.

413
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,968
Something's wrong.

414
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,095
The nanoprobes should
have taken effect by now.

00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,387
Hmm.

What is it?

417
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,100
The creature's nucleotides
are still intact.

418
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,268
It looks like your concerns
were warranted.

419
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,728
We'll have to inform
the Captain.

I don't mind

00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,862
I'm still holding out

425
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,572
for a diplomatic
solution.

426
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,157
Improbable.

427
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,035
Species 8472 will not
respond to diplomacy.

428
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,621
Funny. We used to say the
same thing about the Borg. Ha.

429
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,790
My point is,
anything's possible

430
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,667
if you keep an open mind.

431
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,835
Optimism, Seven.

432
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,711
Try to look on
the bright side.

433
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,254
It is difficult
to be optimistic

434
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,840
when we are preparing
for battle.

435
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,341
Have you ever
heard the phrase

00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,926
"the best defense
is a good offense"?

437
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,095
No.
Throughout human history,

438
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,180
weapons of mass destruction
were often designed

439
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,057
in the hopes that
they'd never be used.

440
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,225
And yet, in Earth's
third world war,

441
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,104
nuclear weapons accounted
for 600 million casualties.

442
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,731
Were<i> they</i> looking
on the bright side?

443

She's not easily impressed.

I didn't think
you were her type.

It was only trying to get

00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,388
At times, I've actually enjoyed
being in this form.

541
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,638
You must think I'm crazy.

542
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,848
Not at all.

543
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,351
I wonder what they think
about us?

544
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,602
Hard to say.

545
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,187
I'll tell you
what I think.

546
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,897
They despise us.

547
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,607
They'll attack any species

548
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,194
that's not a part
of their Federation. Mmm.

549
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,737
Speaking of being
in human form,

550
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:10,074
I could use
an isomorphic injection.

551
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,367
You need one?

552
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,035
I'm fine.

553
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,745
Make yourself at home.

554
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,754
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

555
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,626
Commander.

556
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,132
How do you like the view?

557
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,137
Lovely.

558
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,431
Looks like a full moon.

559
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,351
You can see the entire bay
on a night like this.

560
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,060
I should have brought
my holo-imager.

561
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,146
You make
a pretty picture.

562
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,652
Mm, feel that?

563
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,863
Salinated oxygen molecules

564
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,367
stimulating the epidermal
neural receptors.

565
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,077
Non-fluidic space
has its charms.

566
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,996
No argument there.

567
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,498
Planet Earth.

568
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,042
The simulation will be
real soon enough.

569
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,835
How soon do you think?

570
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,379
Weeks, days.

571
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,673
As soon as they think
we're ready.

572
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,467
Can I be honest with you?

573
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,344
Please.

574
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,060
I'm starting to wonder if
all this is worth the effort.

575
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,978
What do you mean?

576
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,563
This simulation,
our mission--

577
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,692
are we certain
the humans pose a threat?

578
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,736
They were allies
with the Borg.

579
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,238
They invaded our realm.

580
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,447
That was one incident.

581
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,615
Doesn't mean
the entire Federation

582
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,909
is planning a war against us.

583
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,785
We can't trust them.

584
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,787
We have to prepare
for the worst.

585
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,081
I'm not so sure.

586
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,584
I think you've been
human a little too long.

587
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,505
Before you know it,

588
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,340
I'll be sending my résumé
to the real Starfleet.

589
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,803
Ha. "Alien from distant
galaxy seeks employment.

590

591
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,395
Well, it's getting late.

592
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,645
I'd better go.

593
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,897
Already?

594
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,149
I have a tactical report

595
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,277
to finish before morning.

596
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,661
Aren't we forgetting
something?

597
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,164
I'm no expert at
human dating rituals,

598
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,833
but I think it's customary
to kiss good night.

599
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,085
( slight chuckle )

600
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,711
You've never
done this before.

601
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,963
Actually...

602
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,630
Me, neither.

603
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,218
Just...think of it as
part of our training.

604
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,471

609
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,360
I analyzed his DNA.

610
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,569
Your suspicions were correct.

611
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,321
<i>How much does he know?</i>

612
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,572
It's difficult to say.

613
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,823
He'll have to be interrogated.

614
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,534
<i>Where is he?</i>

615
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,494
By now, he should be
in the main quad.

616
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,454
I recommend we go to daylight.

617
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,080
He'll be easier to track.

618

Yes, come in.

The Borg modifications
are complete.

627
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,845
Nineteen standard photon
torpedoes and three class-10s

628
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,847
armed with high-yield
warheads.

629
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,349
More.

630
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,602
We've depleted our supply
of nanoprobes.

631
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,395
Replicate a new supply.

632
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,979
That is not possible.

633
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,274
Have the doctor extract them
from your bloodstream,

634
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,526
grow them in a petri dish,
whatever it takes.

635
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,486
If we do engage 8472,

636
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,697
I don't intend to run out
of firepower mid-battle.

637
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,657
You of all people
should understand that.

638
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,784
They killed what--
four million drones?

639
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,537
Directive 010:

640
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,123
"Before engaging
alien species in battle,

641
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,459
any and all attempts
to make first contact

642
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,169
and achieve nonmilitary
resolution must be made."

643
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,506
In this case, we made first
contact over a year ago,

644
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,717
and we barely got
out of it alive.

645
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,136
It seems to me
a battle is inevitable.

646
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,221
Maybe even war.

647
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,558
So why can't I get that
directive out of my mind?

648
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,145
This species intends
to purge our galaxy of all life.

649

Aged 200 years.

Been saving it
for a special occasion.

673
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:07,449
And I'd say this
is special enough, mm-hmm.

Species 8472.

00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,098
Origin: Fluidic space.

681
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,434
Well, now that we've
been formally introduced,

682
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,436
how many ships?

00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,355
Cat got your tongue?

684
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,981
I asked you a question.

685
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,235
How many vessels do you
have in the Delta Quadrant?

686
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,362
One.

687
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,156
How did you find us?

688
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,449
We detected what looked like

689
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,451
a Federation subspace
transmission.

690
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,662
It took us weeks
to track it here.

691
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,038
We wanted this simulation

692
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,082
to be accurate
to the last detail.

693
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,835
We obviously went
a little too far.

694
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,755
Now that you know
about our re-creation,

695
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,758
you've no doubt alerted
the Federation.

Your fleet will
be on its way.

697
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,261
You've got it wrong.

00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,263
We're not planning a war
against you.

699
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,139
Is that why you were here
to spy on us--

700
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,349

advantage of it.

extraction.

00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,094
I have a visual.

720
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,889
We're being scanned.

721
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,599
Let them take a look.

722
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,351
SEVEN:
The<i> Delta Flyer</i> is
heading up from the habitat.

723
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,938
Open a channel.
Tom? Status.

724
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,231
<i>They've taken a couple</i>
<i>of potshots at us, Captain.</i>

725
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,609
<i>We've lost our shields.</i>
<i>Mind if we join you?</i>

726
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,444
You're clear to dock.
Shuttle Bay 2.

727
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,654
Any word from Chakotay?

728
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,530
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

729
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,824
Bring us within range.

730
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,450
Target their weapons array.

731
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,619
Captain, we should target
their power systems as well.

732
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,746
No, I don't wanna risk shutting
down their life support.

733
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,289
If we can end this
without casualties,

734
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,791
so much the better.

735
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,709
This species does not
deserve our compassion.

736
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,670
You picked a lousy time
for an ethical debate.

737
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,380
The weapons array<i> now.</i>

738
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,632
We're entering range.

739
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,342
3,800 kilometers.

740
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,593
3,500.

741
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,220
3,200.

742
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,516
CHAKOTAY:
Valerie.

743
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,100
That's not my name.

744
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,477
Then what is it?

745
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,441
You're afraid of us,
aren't you?

746
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,776
You think we're violent.

747
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,862
That we're planning
to destroy your species.

748
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,155
But none
of that's true.

749
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,411
If you would
take the time

750
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,832
to speak to us directly,
we could prove it to you.

751
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,674
"There are no secrets except the
secrets that keep themselves."

752
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,969
Shaw.

753
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,637
George Bernard Shaw.

754
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:19,474
I saw a copy of his collected
works on your bookshelf.

755
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,644
He had a complex mind...
for a human.

756
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,312
And he had a point.

757
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,524
As long as we keep spying
on each other,

758
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,942
making assumptions,

759
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,277
we probably will go to war.

760
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,908
( alarm blaring )

761
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,200
<i>Voyager.</i>

762
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,412
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

763
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,876
They're charging weapons.

764
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,126
Do the same.

765
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,087
We're being hailed.

766
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,798
Mr. Boothby.

767
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,258
<i>Captain Janeway.</i>

768
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,886
Good to see you
after all these years.

769
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,596
Enjoying
the Delta Quadrant?

770
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,057
<i>Don't get sassy with me,</i>
<i>young lady.</i>

771
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,308
<i>This re-creation</i>
<i>may be Starfleet,</i>

772
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:05,311
<i>but our weapons are</i>
<i>far more sophisticated.</i>

773
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,607
<i>I can destroy your vessel</i>
<i>with a single command.</i>

774
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,983
<i>Run along, now.</i>

775
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,610
I'm not going anywhere.

776
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,904
Not until you return
my First Officer

777
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,073
and give me a damn
good explanation

778
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,076
for what you're doing
in our galaxy.

779
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,745
I've targeted your re-creation

780
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,872
with Borg nanoprobes.

781
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,416
And we're willing to use them
if you force us to.

782
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,418
<i>Don't try to rattle my cage.</i>

783
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,837
<i>I'll disable your tactical</i>
<i>systems before you--</i>

784
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,923
The last time
our species engaged in battle,

785
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,424
you suffered heavy casualties.

786
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,343
Are you willing to take
that chance again?

787
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,639
An armed conflict

788
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,059
isn't going to solve
our problems.

789
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,686
We could go on making threats.

790
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,354
Spying on each other.

791
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:52,191
Risking a war
between our species.

792
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,277
Or we could try
a more direct approach.

793
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,696
<i>What do you have in mind?</i>

794
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,491
How about a class reunion?

795
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,750
<i>Targ</i> manure!

796
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,418
United Federation of Planets...

797
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,295
tolerance for all species...

798
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,255
the Prime
Directive...

799
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,424
<i>targ</i> manure,
every word of it.

800
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,886
Your metaphor is colorful,
but inaccurate.

801
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,096
Vulcan logic...

802
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,056
add that
to the list.

803
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,100
Obviously, you've studied
a Starfleet database.

804
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,145
You must've learned something
about our history.

805
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,188
We adhere to
our directives.

806
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,398
High-minded ideals
are one thing,

807
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,234
but your actions tell
a very different story.

808
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,904
You infiltrated
our re-creation,

809
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,948
captured and killed
one of our people.

810
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,950
I told you he
took his own life.

811
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,745
You created biological weapons
to infect our species.

812
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,497
You are allies with the Borg.

813
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,832
No.

814
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,667
There's a drone sitting
at this very table.

815
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:54,171
Look at her-- all gussied up
to look like a human being.

816
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,631
I am no longer part
of the Collective.

817
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,967
Once a Borg, always a Borg.

818
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,511
Seven of Nine is
a member of this crew.

819
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,221
The Borg are irrelevant.

820
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,973
It's the humans
that pose a threat.

821
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,516
They think
the Federation

822
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,143
is a hostile
invasion force

823
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,978
out to destroy
their species.

824
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,563
I see.

825
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,108
So you're planning a preemptive
strike against Earth.

826
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,317
Maybe I am.

827
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,444
You realize
I can't let that happen.

828
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,780
Go ahead.
Fire your damn nanoprobes,

829
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,700
blow our re-creation
to high heavens.

830
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,910
There are a dozen more

831
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,786
scattered throughout
the Quadrant.

832
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,872
You'll never find them all.

833
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,248
What if I told you

834
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,168
that Starfleet
isn't planning an invasion,

835
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,461
that no one on Earth
has even heard of you?

836
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,130
I'd say you're lying.

837
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,383
Have another look at that
Federation database of yours.

838
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,468
You'll see there's no mention
of your realm.

839
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,803
BULLOCK:
Immaterial.

840
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,597
Any information
regarding our species

841
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,224
has no doubt been classified

842
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,683
by Starfleet
Intelligence.

843
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,310
Good point.
You know, we could

844
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,271
keep this paranoid
debate going all day.

845
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,898
You have
no reason to trust us,

846
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,816
and we have no
reason to trust you.

847
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,861
Hear, hear. I knew this reunion
would be a fiasco.

848
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,113
Admiral...

849
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,405
JANEWAY:
Seven...

850
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,907
disarm the warheads.

851
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,117
Captain?

852
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,659
Do it.

853
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,960
What are you trying
to prove, young lady?

854
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,254
One of us has to take
our finger off the trigger.

855
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,546
It might as well be me.

856
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,761
Their weapons
are off-line.

857
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,264
It's a trick.
Our defenses are down.

858
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,890
What will you do now?

859
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,560
Blow<i> Voyager</i> to high heavens
or do we keep talking?

860
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,730
Humans...you've got
a flair for the dramatic,

861
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,190
I'll give you that.

862
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,608
You want to keep talking?

863
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:42,612
Fine by me, but no more
beating around the bush.

864
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,239
Now what do you want from us?

865
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,907
The truth, Captain.

866
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,494
<i>Voyager</i> is alone
in the Delta Quadrant.

867
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,664
We haven't been in contact
with Earth for over four years.

868
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,874
Explain why
you attacked our realm,

869
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,127
hand in hand with the Borg.

870
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,795
At the time, we didn't realize

871
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,214
the Borg had started
the war against you.

872
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,883
We forged a temporary
alliance with them

873
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,844
because we thought
you were the threat.

874
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,554
"Your galaxy will be purged."

875
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,140
Sound familiar?

876
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,933
We were only trying
to defend ourselves.

877
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:15,436
If that's true,
why are you still in our galaxy?

878
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,023
Your conflict with the Borg
ended over a year ago.

879
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:22,152
Why re-create Starfleet,
masquerade as humans?

880
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,113
It looks to me like you're
the ones planning an invasion.

881
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,364
The truth.

882
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,657
Don't answer her.

883
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,201
She's manipulating us.

884
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,410
If you won't answer,
I will.

885
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,745
Commander!

886
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,580
Our mission is to
infiltrate your homeworld,

887
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,748
to place operatives

888
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,292
in the highest
levels of Starfleet,

889
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,626
monitor
your military

890
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,045
installations.

891
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:43,131
It's a reconnaissance mission,
nothing more.

892
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,632
We should listen to her,
Captain.

893
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,468
They're being driven by fear
just like we are...

894
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,304
unless everything
you said on our date

895
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,139
was just part of an act.
It wasn't.

896
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,557
Enough!

897
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,018
We must not negotiate
with these creatures.

898
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,269
Sit down, Admiral.

899
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,520
Sir?

900
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,105
I said sit down,

901
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,815
or I'll knock you
right on your human butt.

902
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,985
You've been seduced by them,
both of you.

903
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,946
I've had a chance
to see through human eyes,

904
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,365
and I'm beginning to wonder,

905
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,201
are they really so violent?

906
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,618
What if we're wrong?

907
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,662
We can't risk trusting them.

908
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,664
You'd rather risk another war?

909
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,834
Keep talking, son.

910
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,211
Archer's right.

911
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,754
We've got to set aside

912
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,006
our preconceptions
about each other.

913
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,758
Granted, our species didn't meet

of circumstances,

915
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:31,221
but maybe we can
make first contact again.

916
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,722
Maybe this time,
we'll get it right.

917

You believe in
this fellow?

918
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,936
Yes.

919
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,355
There would have to
be a few ground rules.

Name them.

921
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,151
First off, I want to take a look
at that nanoprobe technology.

922
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,527
It scares the hell out of me.

923
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,446
All right...

924
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,783
but I'll need some tactical
information in return--

925
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,785
your genetic alteration
techniques for a start.

926
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,162
I'm sure
something can be arranged.

927
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,538
You on board, Admiral?

928
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,293

Perhaps.

Have a little

940
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,241
It's difficult
to have faith in an idea

941
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,951
which may prove
tactically unsound.

942
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,411
Tactically unsound?
Perhaps.

943

It could also be
