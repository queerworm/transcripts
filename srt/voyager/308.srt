00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,130
MAN:
<i>There was another</i>
<i>anti-war demonstration</i> 

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,174
<i>at the UC-Santa Cruz campus</i>
<i>last night.</i>

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,717
<i>Tear gas was used</i>

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,595
<i>to disperse the crowd</i>
<i>of 3,000 angry students.</i>

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:15,182
<i>The temperature right now in</i>
<i>downtown Barstow is 75 degrees.</i>

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,185
(<i> rock music playing</i> )

7
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,820
(<i> static interference</i> )

8
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,369
(<i> hissing</i> )

9
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,271
Far out.

10
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,011
(<i> door beeping</i> )

11
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,386
Come in.

12
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,098
Sorry, Tuvok.

13
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,808
I was just practicing
my serve.

14
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,851
Your "serve?"

15
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,268
Tennis.

16
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,896
After 19 years, I've decided
to take it up again.

17
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,439
I'm a little rusty.

18
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,650
I played in a novice tournament
on the holodeck.

19
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,862
I lost my first match
in straight sets.

20
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,405
Perhaps if you maintained
eye contact with the ball

21
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,366
at the apex of its trajectory

22
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,784
your serve would be
more effective.

23
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,995
You play tennis?

24
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,621
Simple physics, captain.

25
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,873
Not as simple as
when I played

26
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,332
on the high school
tennis team.

27
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,334
What can I do
for you, Tuvok?

28
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,378
I've completed my monthly
security evaluation.

29
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,005
All systems and crew are...

30
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:38,468
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Red alert.</i>
<i>Captain Janeway to the bridge.</i>

31
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,678
Report.

32
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,262
CHAKOTAY:
Some sort
of spatial rift.

33
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,639
It opened right
in front of us.

34
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,016
Analysis.

35
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,560
It's a distortion
in the space-time continuum.

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,436
But it's got
a graviton matrix.

37
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,355
It's being artificially
generated.

38
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,356
CHAKOTAY:
By whom?

39
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,441
Sensors can't
get inside.

40
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,903
The distortion field's
fluctuating.

41
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,362
Something's coming out.

42
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,033
TUVOK:
It appears to be
a small ship--

43
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,659
approximately six meters
in length.

44
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,744
Magnify.

45
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,624
Sensors are reading
one occupant-- human.

46
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,960
He is holding position
at the perimeter of the rift.

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,504
There's a subspace signature
emanating from the ship.

48
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,719
Captain...

49
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,388
it's Federation.

50
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,057
Hail them.

51
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,266
No response.

52
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,268
They appear
to be charging weapons.

53
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,771
Shields up.
Hail them again.

54
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,071
Shields are down.

55
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,530
Get us out of here.

56
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,074
Helm control is off-line.

57
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,451
He's firing some kind of
subatomic disruptor.

58
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,619
Return fire.

59
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,289
Full phasers.
No effect.

60
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,666
<i>Voyager's</i> molecular
structure is coming apart!

61
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,294
Tuvok, divert all available
power to the deflector.

62
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,337
Send out a high-energy
polaron pulse.

63
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,257
It might help to disrupt
his weapon.

64
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,634
Emitting deflector pulse...
now.

65
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,805
It's working.

66
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,347
We are being hailed.

67
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,016
On screen.

68
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,310
<i>Starship</i> Voyager,
<i>I'm Captain Braxton</i>

69
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,104
<i>of the Federation</i>
<i>timeship Aeon.</i>

70
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,605
<i>I've come from</i>
<i>29th century Earth,</i>

71
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,274
<i>500 years into your future.</i>

72
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,234
<i>Please disengage</i>
<i>your deflector pulse.</i>

73
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,069
<i>Why are you firing</i>
<i>at us?</i>

74
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,571
<i>Your vessel is responsible</i>
<i>for a disaster in my century--</i>

75
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,240
<i>a temporal explosion</i>
<i>that will destroy</i>

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,866
<i>all of Earth's solar system.</i>

77
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,994
<i>I've come back in time</i>
<i>to prevent that occurrence.</i>

78
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,453
<i>My mission is your destruction.</i>

79
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,455
<i>You must not resist.</i>

80
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,666
I'm going to need more
information before I allow...

81
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,085
<i>Debris from your secondary hull</i>
<i>was found in the explosion.</i>

82
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,086
Captain, I simply--

83
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,171
<i>No time!</i>

84
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,759
He's remodulating
the subatomic disruptor.

85
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,678
Our deflector is losing power.

86
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,971
It won't hold
much longer.

87
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,514
Captain, if he's telling
the truth...

88
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,057
I won't sacrifice
this ship and crew

89
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,642
based on a ten second
conversation.

90
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,312
I need proof.

91
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,063
It doesn't look like
we're going to get it.

92
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,398
Adjust our deflector to match
the frequency of his weapon.

93
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,819
Try to overload his emitter.

94
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,612
It seems
to be working.

95
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,573
His weapon is off-line and
his ship has been damaged.

96
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,534
The rift is destabilizing

97
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,952
and he's being pulled
back inside.

98
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,120
Reestablish helm control.

99
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,913
PARIS:
I'm trying, Captain,

100
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,373
but we seem to be caught in some
kind of graviton distortion.

101
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,001
We're being pulled in, too.

102
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,311
Status.

103
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,646
Primary systems
are coming back on-line.

104
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,649
The weapons grid and power
array took heavy damage.

105
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,442
The temporal rift is closed.

106
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,777
Where are we?

107
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,660
Home.

108
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,040
We just cut across
half the galaxy.

109
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,668
The rift must have
originated here.

110
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,503
Hail Starfleet command.

111
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,674
No response
on standard frequencies.

112
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,218
Curious.

113
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,636
I am picking up a multitude
of narrow band E.M. signals.

114
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,971
Let's hear.

115
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,723
(<i> voices speaking</i>
<i>simultaneously</i> )

116
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,892
WOMAN:
<i>...with no commercial</i>
<i>interruption.</i>

117
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,019
MAN:
<i>...leave a message at the beep,</i>

118
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,562
MAN 2:
<i>Robertson takes a hard left--</i>

119
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,565
MAN 3:
<i>...Colts at</i>
<i>the 35 yard line--</i>

120
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,443
MAN 4:
<i>Breaker, breaker,</i>
<i>this is Charlie--</i>

121
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,737
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

122
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,326
The question isn't
where we are.

123
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,328
It's when we are.

124
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,455
Mr. Kim?

125
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,377
According
to astrometric readings...

126
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,629
the year is 1996.

127
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,674
The late 20th century.

128
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,677
PARIS:
Captain, they had surveillance
satellites during this time.

129
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,554
Maintain a high orbit.

130
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,057
And modulate the shields
to scatter their radar.

131
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,558
We don't want
to alarm the natives.

132
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,352
What about
the timeship?

133
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,603
Is it here too?

134
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,730
There's no sign
of the vessel in orbit.

135
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,690
Scanning the planet's surface.

136
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,360
I am picking up low-frequency
subspace readings

137
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,487
emanating from
the northern hemisphere.

138
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,281
Subspace technology
shouldn't exist

139
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,740
for another
100 years or so.

140
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,784
Could be our friend
from the 29th century.

141
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,120
Localize it.

142
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,330
North American continent.

143
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,373
Pacific coast.

144
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,834
The City of Los Angeles.

145
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,299
We've got to go down there.

146
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,718
If it is Captain Braxton,
he's the key to all this

147
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,138
and at the moment,
his ship is the only way we have

148
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,514
of getting back
to our own century.

149
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,226
Chakotay, Tuvok, Paris,
you're with me.

150
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,979
Mr. Kim, you have the bridge.

151
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,563
Yes, Ma'am.

152
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,858
As I recall, Tom, you're
something of an aficionado

153
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,151
on 20th century America.

154
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,610
That's right.

155
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,904
What will we need to pass
as locals in this era?

156
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,531
Simple. Nice clothes,
fast car

157
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,492
and lots of money.

158
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,539
Hey, buddy,
look what you did.

159
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,833
Aww yeah!

160
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,710
Hey, come on.
Sorry, man.

161
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,480
We could have worn
our Starfleet uniforms.

162
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,315
I doubt if anyone
would have noticed.

163
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,159
JANEWAY:
The subspace readings
are coming from within

164
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,078
a hundred meter radius
of our position

165
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,829
but I can't
pinpoint the source.

166
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,040
I find it hard to believe
a ship from the 29th century

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,167
could've landed on this beach
without being noticed.

168
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,710
We have no idea
what kind of technology

169
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,961
they might have
in the future.

170
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,171
Maybe it's cloaked.

171
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,339
Let's spread out.

172
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,340
Tuvok, Paris

173
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,674
go check the shoreline.

174
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,427
Chakotay and I
will search the boardwalk.

175
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,345
Aye, captain.

176
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,264
Well, Kathryn,
you got us home.

177
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,100
Right place...
wrong time.

178
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,769
But it is good to be
back, nevertheless.

179
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,563
Maybe I should look up
a few ancestors.

180
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,982
As I recall, one of them
was a school teacher in Arizona.

181
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,568
I don't know what
my relatives were doing

182
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,570

She does have your legs.

187

Have you ever been to Southern
California, Chakotay?

188
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,413
No.

189
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,040
After the Hermosa Quake
of 2047

190
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,834
this entire region sank
under 200 meters of water

191
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,462
it became one

193
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,423

marine species.

194
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,929
Some... interesting species
in this century.

195
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,355
Subspace readings
are weaker here.

196
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,065
Let's head up
to the boardwalk.

197
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,029
Ah...the sun feels great.

198
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,990

199
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,408

200
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,577
Lighten up, Tuvok.

201
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,703
This was a great
time and place,

202
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,414

to see it firsthand.

203
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,957
Come on, take off
your shirt.

204
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,460

No, thank you.

00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,686
So much for the timeship.

211
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,648
There's no doubt
about it.

212
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,108
The subspace readings

00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,769
It's crap.

216
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,063
The component density is too low

217
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,648
the voltage variance
is out of spec,

218
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,108
and I don't even like the color.

219
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,068
But, mister...
we've got less than six months

And with a chip like
this driving it

222
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,618
we'll have to change
the name to "Edsel."

223

Go home, Jim.

Lose some sleep over this.

241
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,284
I'm one of the astronomers
at the SETI lab you're funding.

242
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,578
We met at the Griffith

Yes, yes. What is it?

00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,540
Okay. Well, it was
my understanding

245
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,334
you wanted to be notified
immediately

246
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,127
if I ever picked up
a gamma emission

247
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,546
that matched the frequency
profile you gave me.

248
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,840
Well... I did.

249
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,842
So... I am.

250
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,346
Are you certain?

251
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,056
Positive. I tracked
the emission, and guess what.

252
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,350
The source is in orbit.

253
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,310
It is right above us.

254
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,978
When did it show up?

255
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,523
Uh... according to the raw data

there's something up there.

261
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,450
We have got to tell somebody
about this.

262
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,827
We've got to call NASA!

263
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,622
Rain, that's a little premature,
don't you think?

264
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,040
This could be a close encounter

265
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,209
but then again,
could be a flock of geese.

266
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,378
Hmm... geese
don't park themselves

267
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,840

Let's send a message up there,
see if there's a response.

269
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,638
No, no. We don't know
what we've found

to risk embarrassing myself

collect more data

273

than ten kilometers.

Captain,
what's happened to you?

356
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,707
The last time
we saw you...

357
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,751
I was a younger man,
confident in my mission!

358
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,086
But you wouldn't listen to me.
No.

359
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,712
You were too concerned
with yourselves.

360
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,172
You were trying
to destroy us.

361
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,341
I was trying to save
billions of lives--

362
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,802
to stop a chain of reaction
that started with<i> Voyager.</i>

363
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,013
It's too late now.

364
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,056
All things are set in motion.

365
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,975
The temporal explosion
will occur.

366
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,310
The end is coming!
The future's end!

367
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,895
Captain, how long
have you been here--

368
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,229
in the 20th century?

369
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,272
Oh, too long.

370
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,316
30 years too long.

371
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,401
And yet we just
arrived. Why?

372
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,612
Pure chance.

373
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,698
When you knocked
my navigation system off course.

374
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,409
There's no telling
where we would have ended up.

375
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,452
Who's been here?

376
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,871
Who took my pencils?

377
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:09,208
Oh! Always
something missing.

378
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,252
People always trying
to steal things.

379
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,754
Greedy people!

380
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,715
Post-industrial barbarians!

381
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,217
JANEWAY:
Captain,
we want to help you

382
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,761
but you've got to give us
more information.

383
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,848
You said that<i> Voyager</i>
<i>causes the explosion.</i>

384
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,183
Yes.

385
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,060
No...

386
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,770
and yes.

387
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,605
That's a paradox, my dear.

388
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,483
"A" leads to "B"
leads to "C" leads to "A".

389
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,155
Juvenile minds.

390
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:43,242
Oh, how can I
make you understand, huh?

391
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,705
A... There's an explosion
in the 29th century.

392
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,124
Debris from<i> Voyager's</i> hull
is found in evidence.

393
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:54,170
I go back in time
to destroy you.

394
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,799
B... You try to stop me,
disabling my weapon

395
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,803
which causes me to crash land
back here in the 20th century.

396
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,726
C... Someone in this century

397
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,562
steals my timeship
and launches it.

398
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,481
They go into the future
and once there

399
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,859
they make one critical mistake

400
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,988
which causes
a temporal explosion

401
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:25,284
that takes us
all the way back to "A."

402
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,411
There's an explosion
in the 29th century.

403
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,497
The cycle of causality
is complete.

404
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,708
How do you know all this?

405
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,044
What evidence do you have
that it will be your timeship

406
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,296
that causes
the disaster?

407
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,633
I've spent 30 years
answering that very question.

408
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,226
Ah, yes. When the explosion
first happened,

409
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,478
my sensors recorded
a whole variety

410
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,940
of chronometric data.

411
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,484
The pulses were highly chaotic.

412
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,987
At first, I thought it was
a warp-core implosion,

413
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,239
but then I found debris
from<i> Voyager,</i>

414
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,366
and my theory seemed to be
confirmed. It was you.

415
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,162
But then someone here
stole my timeship.

416
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,872
Then it started to dawn on me.

417
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,126
If someone were to fly
my timeship into the future

418
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,586
without recalibrating
the temporal matrix

419
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,797
then that could cause
the kind of explosion

420
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,924
that I witnessed
in the 29th century.

421
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,718
So it really wasn't
<i>Voyager</i> after all.

422
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,305
No. No, no, I reconstructed

423
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:30,599
all the chronometric data
as best I could remember it

424
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,601
and it proved
that I was right.

425
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,729
My ship causes the catastrophe.

426
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,441
Which raises the question
who has your timeship?

427
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,737
Starling.

428
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,200
Henry Starling, C.E.O.
Chronowerx Industries.

429
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,620
Philanthropist, entrepreneur,
outstanding citizen. Ha!

430
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,332
Before I crashed
in the year 1967

431
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,043
I made an emergency
beam-out, but<i> he</i>

432
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,418
found my ship
before I did

433
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,920
in some remote
mountain range.

434
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,048
I've been following
this corrupt

435
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,925
little man ever since
tracking his movements

436
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,760
but he's become
too powerful.

437
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,264
I can't get close to him.

438
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,350
Of course,
you can't accomplish anything

439
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,934
in this wretched century.

440
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,394
Nobody here listens.

441
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,646
Do you know that once

442
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,607
they put me
in a mental institution

443
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,569
and filled me
with primitive pharmaceuticals?!

444
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,113
Maybe we can help you find
Starling and your ship

445
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,531
and get us back
to where we belong.

446
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,033
No, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

447
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,492
Why not?

448
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,246
Haven't you been listening?
"A" leads to "B"--

449
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,788
Leads to "C".
Yes we heard you.

450
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,623
Why shouldn't we try
to stop Starling?

451
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:40,086
Because somehow you're
involved in the disaster.

452
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,462
That's why I found debris
from<i> Voyager's</i> hull

453
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,257
at the explosion.

454
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:47,134
<i>You</i> will be destroyed as well.

455
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,635
Now that we know
what's going to happen

456
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,012
maybe we
can figure out...

457
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,311
POLICEMAN:
Hey, captain.

458
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,812
How you doing?

459
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,189
I understand
you been putting

460
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,899
these signs up
around the city again.

461
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,109
No. No, no, no.

462
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,236
Not me. I...
I would never do that.

463
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,321
Why don't you walk over here
and we can talk about it?

464
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,655
You stay right where you are.

465
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,699
You quasi-Cardassian
totalitarian!

466
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,034
No need to get upset.

467
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,660
We just want to talk
to you about the signs.

468
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,453
Now, there've been
a few people complaining.

469
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,999
Captain... tell
them I'm not crazy.

470
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,753
Tell them
I'm from the future.

471
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,422
They came from the
future, too, you know.

472
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:25,631
Okay.

473
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,759
Yeah, they came
in on a starship.

474
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,052
All right.

475
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,974
Traitors!

476
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,061
This is 247 Baker

477
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,188
in foot pursuit
of a 51-50 suspect.

478
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,856
We'll have to worry
about him later.

479
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,525
Right now,
we've got to find Starling.

480
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,200
We're not quite at
the little green men stage yet,

481
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,411
but believe me,
you'll be the first to know.

482
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,037
What I think we have here

483
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,290
is an overenthusiastic
young lady.

484
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,251
I'm afraid she's exaggerating.
We don't have anything.

485
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,379
Not yet.
Thank<i> you,</i> professor.

486
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,550
You know what
that little brat did?

487
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,929
She e-mailed a friend
of hers at J.P.L.

488
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,349
Who called his professor
at Cal Tech.

489
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,017
She's a security risk.

490
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,894
Go to Griffith, get the data,
get rid of her.

491
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,271
Yes, sir.

492
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,730
Dunbar.

493
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,025
If it's true--
if they're here--

494
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,360
it's only
a matter of time

495
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,819
before they find me.

496
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,530
There's no telling what
capabilities they'll have.

497
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,074
You may have
to use the weapon.

498
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,409
I understand.

499
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,354
TUVOK:
Perhaps we should find
a more secluded parking place.

500
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,523
This is, after all,
a stolen vehicle.

501
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,401
PARIS:
Nobody's around, Tuvok.
We're fine.

502
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:12,029
A taxicab would have been less
worrisome and more ethical.

503
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,780
PARIS:
We haven't stolen anything.

504
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,657
We borrowed a car, and we'll
return it to the dealership

505
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,243
as soon as we're done.

506
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,328
TUVOK:
I was referring to
the ethics of time travel.

507
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,415
PARIS:
Somehow, I doubt
that taking a test drive

508
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,291
is going to alter
the course of the universe.

509
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,242
Over here.

510
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,286
These are
radio wave readouts.

511
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,001
Looks like radio
telescope transmissions.

512
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,169
Pretty basic.

513
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,837
Lieutenant, you
are being careless.

514
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,381
Tuvok...

515
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,049
I will not lighten up on
this matter.

516
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,676
Thus far, I have tolerated
your impulsive methods.

517
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,138
At times, they do
work to our advantage

518
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,099
but discretion
is also a virtue.

519
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,269
We must leave things
exactly as they were.

520
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,983
(<i> sighs</i> )

521
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,692
They've found us,
all right.

522
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:36,113
The orbital schematic
matches<i> Voyager's</i> position.

523
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,198
According to this data,
they are tracking

524
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,741
the warp emissions
from our engines.

525
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,868
Nobody in this century

526
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,329
even knows
what warp emissions are.

527
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,164
Nevertheless,
it appears

528
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,541
they've configured their
telescope to scan for them.

529
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,876
Excuse me.

530
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,753
"do not enter",
"employees only"--

531
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,088
the sign on the door?

532
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,548
Uh, I'm sorry.

533
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,342
I think
we're a little lost.

534
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,135
We were on the museum tour,
and we took a wrong turn

535
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,845
at the Saturn exhibit.

536
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,474
Perhaps you could tell us
how to get back to the lobby.

537
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,392
Go back down the hall,
take a left at Mars

538
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,602
right at Halley's comet

539
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,228
and then just keep going
straight ahead

540
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,481
past the soda machine, okay?

541
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,320
This lab is, uh...

542
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,571
pretty groovy.

543
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,199
Groovy...

544
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,367
What do you do here?

545
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,327
We watch the skies.

546
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,495
For what?

547
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,580
Signs of extraterrestrial life.

548
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,081
Nice meeting you.

549
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,506
My name is Tom Paris,
by the way.

550
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:38,050
Rain Robinson.

551
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,260
Your curves don't
look so great.

552
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,595
Excuse me?

553
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,931
This is a Fourier
spectral analysis?

554
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,184
That's exactly
what it is.

555
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,395
You know, you might get
better resolution

556
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,481
if you adjust
your amplitude parameters.

557
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,358
You're probably right.

558
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,069
Or you might try using
a theta-band filter.

559
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,405
You know a lot
for someone

560
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,658
who can't find his way
past Saturn.

561
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,201
I majored in
astrophysics.

562
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,202
Where?

563
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,745
Starfleet academy.

564
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,039
Never heard of it.

565
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,874
Uh, east coast school.

566
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,337
<i>Orgy of the Walking Dead?!</i>

567
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,922
That's a classic!

568
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:20,718
Did you see the sequel, uh...
<i>Bride of the Corpse?</i>

569
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:21,719
Let me guess.

570
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,221
You minored
in "B" movies.

571
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,681
Something like that.

572
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,182
Pardon me, Tom.

573
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,350
We should be going.

574
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,060
Our friends
are waiting for us.

575
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,147
Yeah, right.

576
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,693
Got to go.

577
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,446
Hey.

578
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,199
Uh...

579
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,035
I do the planetarium show
Tuesday nights

580
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,371
so, uh...
you guys should come by

581
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,874
check it out bring your
friends...

582
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,086
"the best stars in Hollywood
are right above us."

583
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,797
Yeah, great...

584
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,718
but, I think we're
busy on Tuesday.

585
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,927
Thanks anyway.

586
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,684
No problem.

587
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,192
Whoa.

588
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,494
I downloaded all of her data
into the tricorder.

589
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,370
And disrupted her
data storage device.

590
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,998
Good. I hope she doesn't get
in any trouble.

591
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,334
It will simply look like
a computer malfunction.

592
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,627
It's a shame though.

593
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,337
She was about to make
the biggest discovery

594
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,463
in human history.

595
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,880
It could have changed
her career.

596
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,132
And ended ours.

597
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,842
I am curious,
Lieutenant.

598
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,552
What does it mean--
"groovy"?

599
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,387
Hey, hey, you guys!

600
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,431
Red alert!

601
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,308
Hey!

602
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,060
Hey!
Just wait a minute.

603
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,729
What the hell
did you do to my computer?

604
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,063
It is screwed up.

605
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,607
The hard drive
is wiped.

606
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,442
Look, I don't have time
to explain.

607
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,986
Who are you people, and what is
that thing in your pants?

608
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,655
I beg your pardon?

609
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,865
ROBINSON:
That little gadget 
you put in your pocket.

610
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,325
What is it,
a demagnetizer?

611
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,785
Get down!

612
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,875
What the hell?!
Do you have a car?

613
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,252
Yeah, over there.
We will need to use it.

614
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,189
Here!

615
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,450
KIM:
<i>Operation officer's log</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

616
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,411
<i>We've been on full sensor alert</i>
<i>looking for signs</i>

617
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,580
<i>that anyone else</i>
<i>has detected</i> Voyager.

618
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,332
<i>As a precaution,</i>
<i>I've also asked Neelix and Kes</i>

619
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,418
<i>to monitor all media</i>
<i>broadcasts.</i>

620
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,838
We've set up a
computer algorithm

621
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,256
to search for key
words and phrases--

622
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,007
anything that might
indicate<i> Voyager.</i>

623
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,509
Anything so far?

624
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,887
Not yet. Although
we have come across

625
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:14,057
some very intriguing
televised broadcasts.

626
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,684
Take a look at this.

627
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:19,104
It's a form of entertainment
called a soap opera.

628
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:23,149
The exploration of human
relationships is fascinating.

629
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,612
Hmm. I can't imagine
just watching the story

630
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,238
and not being
a part of it.

631
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,949
That's because you've been
spoiled by the holodeck.

632
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,367
There's something
to be said

633
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,160
for noninteractive stories
like this--

634
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,913
being swept away
in the narrative.

635
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:39,708
Oh, I can't wait to see
if Blaine's twin brother

636
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,795
is the father
of Jessica's baby.

637
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,046
Good work.
Keep me informed

638
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,423
and don't get
too swept away.

639
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,841
Uh, I shall.

640
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,593
WOMAN:
<i>Nobody will know</i>
<i>the difference.</i>

641
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,052
BLAINE:
<i>I'll know, Sharon.</i>

642
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,471
<i>He's my brother.</i>
<i>How can I face him</i>

643
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,056
<i>knowing that our son</i>
<i>is his son?</i>

644
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,727
WOMAN:
<i>All you need to know Jack,</i>
<i>is that I love you.</i>

645
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:28,966
So far, so good.

646
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,050
We haven't set off
any alarms.

647
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,616
Our Mr. Starling has built
quite a corporate empire.

648
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,494
Looks like he's got
wealth, celebrity...

649
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,746
and an ego to match.

650
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,726
I see you never
learned to type.

651
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,978
Turn-of-the-millennium
technology

652
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,646
wasn't a required course
at the academy.

653
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,982
This is like stone knives
and bearskins.

654
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,525
CHAKOTAY:
Well, this isn't.

655
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,318
I'm detecting
a force field.

656
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,738
I can't scan
beyond this wall.

657
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,740
I don't see an access port
or a control panel.

658
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,158
Maybe we can find something
in his computer.

659
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,164
He's got a massive
database here,

660
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,291
but it's protected by
an encryption sequence.

661
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,502
I'm going to try
interfacing my tricorder.

662
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,218
Looks like a series
of pictographs.

663
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,970
They must have used symbols

664
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,472
to represent the different
functions of the computer.

665
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:03,226
Let's see what Henry's
been up to all these years.

666
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,149
The transtaters
were disrupted

667
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,359
by that energy weapon.

668
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,111
Our communicators
are useless.

669
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,989
That means we
can't call the...

670
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,449
our friends.

671
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,867
What do we do now?

672
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,869
You're going to take
a right at the next light

673
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,579
and a left
at the taco stand

674
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,456
'cause you're taking me home

675
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,666
and you're not keeping
the van.

676
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,835
I am afraid that is not
possible, Miss Robinson.

677
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,921
Your life
may be in danger.

678
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,214
I'm going to pop this hatch
and I'm going to start screaming

679
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,008
until you tell me
what's going on.

680
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,384
Who are you?

681
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,177
What is that thing in orbit?

682
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,471
Why did that guy try to kill us?

683
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,557
PARIS:
I told you we're
secret agents.

684
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,267
I'm opening the hatch.

685
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,771
Look, we saved your life.

686
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,355
Isn't it obvious
we're on your side?

687
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,357
I'm standing up.

688
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,985
I'm taking a deep breath.

689
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:55,361
Rain you are not
going to scream!

690
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,780
I know you're frightened

691
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,531
and you've seen
some pretty strange things

692
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,575
but you have to trust me.

693
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,119
We're not going
to hurt you

694
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,121
and I will explain everything.

695
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,164
It's either that, or take your
chances with the guy who tried

696
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,624
to vaporize you!

697
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,841
The U.F.O.--
what is it?

698
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,803
It's a Soviet
spy satellite.

699
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,596
Part of a massive
K.G.B. operation.

700
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,056
We're trying
to stop it.

701
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:27,352
Soviet? The U.S.S.R.
broke up five years ago.

702
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,563
The K.G.B. doesn't even
exist anymore.

703
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,025
That's what they'd
like you to think.

704
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,485
Perhaps we've told her
enough for now.

705
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:39,322
What about you, Agent Tuvok?
What's up with those ears?

706
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,908
Thought I didn't notice?
I did.

707
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,244
What about your weapons?
What are they--lasers?

708
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,123
I'm sorry.
That information is classified,

709
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:52,085
and as for my ears,
they are a family trait.

710
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,004
He's very sensitive
about them.

711
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,714
Whatever.

712
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:01,469
We must find a way
to contact our... friends.

713
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,515
JANEWAY:
Incredible.

714
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,350
Starling's computer
designs were inspired

715
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,519
by technology
from the timeship.

716
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:16,359
He introduced the very first
isograted circuit in 1969

717
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,403
two years after Braxton's
ship crash-landed.

718
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,696
And every few years

719
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,280
there's been
an equally revolutionary

720
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,490
advance in computers

721
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,367
all from
Chronowerx Industries

722
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,245
all based on Starling's
crude understanding

723
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,915
of 29th century technology.

724
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,333
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking, Chakotay?

725
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,793
I wish I weren't.

726
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,587
The computer age of
the late 20th century...

727
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,880
shouldn't have happened.

728
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,674
But it did, and it's
part of our history

729
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,886
all because of
that timeship.

730
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,262
Look at this.

731
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,848
Gantry, power conduits,
telemetry consoles.

732
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,808
This looks like a design
for a launching bay.

733
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,852
Braxton was right. The ship's
going to be launched.

734
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,187
We've got to send these
schematics

735
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,188
to<i> Voyager</i> for analysis.

736
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,397
Janeway to<i> Voyager.</i>

737
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,523
<i>Kim here, Captain.</i>

738
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,109
We're in Starling's office.

739
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,194
I want you to establish
a com-link with my tricorder

740
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,404
and try to upload his
computer database.

741
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,240
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>
<i>We'll need a few minutes</i>

742
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,450
<i>to reconfigure</i>
<i>to their binary system.</i>

743
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,826
Acknowledged.

744
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,078
Let's see if we can find out

745
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:11,039
where the location
of that launch pad is.

746
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,916
You're really getting
the hang of this.

747
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,417
I'm a quick study.

748
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,129
You know, Captain, in a way,
Braxton was right.

749
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:20,298
If we hadn't fought him when
he tried to destroy<i> Voyager,</i>

750
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,967
he wouldn't have been
pulled back in time,

751
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,219
his ship wouldn't have
crash-landed on Earth,

752
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,720
and none of this
would have happened.

753
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,973
Time travel. Since
my first day in the job

754
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,390
as a Starfleet captain,

755
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,809
I swore I'd never
let myself get caught in

756
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,978
one of these
Godforsaken paradoxes.

757
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,896
The future is the past,
the past is the future.

758
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,564
It all gives me
a headache.

759
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,192
Hold on...this looks promising.

760
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,153
Try "timeship
security portal."

761
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,738
Maybe it's linked to some sort
of surveillance system.

762
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,283
An image of the launch bay
would give us a clue

763
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,659
to its location.

764
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,636
I see you've made yourself
at home.

765
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,638
Welcome to the 20th century.

766
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,981
I know who you are.

767
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,774
You're from the future.

768
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,110
I knew you'd come
back one day.

769
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,196
I detected your
vessel in orbit

770
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,531
and Mr. Dunbar
here had a run-in

771
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,783
with your friends.

772
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,203
You're here to
take the timeship.

773
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:34,039
Mr. Starling

774
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,124
you're about to cause
a terrible disaster

775
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,835
that will affect
the 29th century

776
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,838
an explosion that will cost
billions of lives.

777
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,591
We're here to stop you
from doing that.

778
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,719
What are you
talking about?

779
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,429
If you launch that ship
and travel to the future

780
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,807
it will destroy
Earth's solar system.

781
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,310
How do you know this?

782
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,688
Well, let's just say we talked
to the ship's previous owner.

783
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,857
He told us that
if its temporal matrix

784
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,360
isn't precisely calibrated

785
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,945
you'll trigger
a temporal explosion.

786
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,113
That ship shouldn't be here.

787
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,407
It belongs
to another century.

788
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,408
We have to take it back.

789
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,369
(<i> beeping</i> )

790
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,205
What's that?
It's a communication device.

791
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,789
Someone's trying
to contact me.

792
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,416
(<i> beeping</i> )

793
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,500
Answer it.

794
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,754
Janeway here.

795
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,547
Captain, we've established
the com-link.

796
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,007
Ready to upload on your signal.

797
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,425
<i>Do it.</i>

798
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,388
STARLING:
My database.

799
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,472
Stop, or I'll kill
your captain.

800
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,849
Who is this?

801
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,726
You've got five seconds.

802
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,145
Break the link.
Done.

803
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,689
What's
our transporter status?

804
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,858
The main pattern buffers
are still off-line.

805
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,278
We can try an emergency
transport from a lower orbit.

806
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,321
That's exactly
what the captain

807
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,240
ordered us not to do.
We'd be risking detection.

808
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,742
Harry, we can't worry about that
now. Their lives are in danger.

809
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,327
And if somebody
sees a starship

810
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,204
flying through the clouds?

811
00:40:56,204 --> 00:41:02,961
The captain put you in charge.
It is your decision.

812
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,796
Helm, get a fix
on Chakotay and the Captain.

813
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,006
B'elanna, stand by
emergency transporters.

814
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,718
Get ready to beam them
directly to the bridge.

815
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,803
Take us down.

816
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,894
You've taken over 3,000
gigabytes of information

817
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,397
including my launch plan

818
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,024
but that's not going
to be a problem, Captain.

819
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,736
I'll make a few changes
to my travel itinerary.

820
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,363
You're not going
to stop me.

821
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,490
If you don't
give us that ship

822
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,160
we'll take it by force.

823
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,414
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm holding the gun.

824
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,999
Not for long.

825
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,917
I've got a starship in orbit

826
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,295
that could vaporize
this entire building

827
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,880
in the blink of an eye.

828
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,424
And you along with it.

829
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,927
If necessary.

830
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,306
Captain, you've got
some cojones.

831
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,685
Kill them!

832
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,769
Damn.

833
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,819
Maintain present altitude. Keep
us within transporter range.

834
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,154
Chakotay, see if you can disable

835
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,697
the force field
around that timeship.

836
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,449
B'elanna, prepare to lock on
to the timeship

837
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,075
and beam it to cargo bay two.

838
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,495
Ensign Kim, you have
an impeccable sense of timing.

839
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:23,541
Not bad for your first day
in the big chair.

840
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,959
The force field's down.

841
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,338
Sir! The timeship!

842
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,676
They're trying
to teleport the ship.

843
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,555
The matter stream
is remodulating.

844
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,265
He's disrupting
transport.

845
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,062
Yes.

846
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,730
(<i> typing quickly</i> )

847
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,524
Captain,
I don't understand how,

848
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:50,651
but he's using our
transporter beam as a downlink.

849
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,529
He's accessing
our main computer.

850
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,155
(<i> laughing</i> )

851
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,283
(<i> typing furiously</i> )

852
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,411
Every time I try
to disable his downlink,

853
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,079
he comes up with
a new command override.

854
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,998
Starling is using 29th-century
technology against us.

855
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,544
We may not be able to
keep up with him.

856
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,921
Inertial dampers
are off-line.

857
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,756
He's gotten into
our propulsion systems.

858
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,762
Disengage transporters.

859
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:22,058
Destabilizing matter stream.
Transporters off-line.

860
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,102
We've terminated
the downlink, Captain,

861
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,896
but he got at least 20%
of our main computer data files.

862
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,856
Get us back into orbit,
and I want a full damage--

863
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,860
<i>Captain Janeway,</i>
<i>Henry Starling here.</i>

864
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,279
This is Janeway.

865
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:37,198
<i>U.S.S.</i> Voyager--
Intrepid class.

866
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,993
Much bigger than I expected...
and much less advanced.

867
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,912
<i>Says here your ship</i>
<i>was launched</i>

868
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:47,500
in the year... 2371?
You're from the 24th century?

869
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,876
And here all this time,

870
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,753
I thought
you were from the 29th.

871
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,756
Looks like I have
the home-field advantage.

872
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:57,427
Ooh, what's this?

873
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,554
<i>Oh, now this is interesting.</i>

874
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,389
Damage reports
are coming in.

875
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,808
Some minor power fluctuations
in the impulse drive

876
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,810
and a few
burned-out circuits

877
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,853
in the main computer core.
Nothing we can't handle.

878
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,147
KES:
<i>Sick bay to bridge.</i>

879
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,357
<i>Captain,</i>
<i>I can't find the doctor.</i>

880
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,609
Is his program off-line?

881
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:16,488
<i>No. His program is gone.</i>

882
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:19,657
Where am I?

883
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,992
Who are you?

884
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,661
Welcome.

885
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,079
Captain, this is Neelix.

886
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,165
There's something
on the television

887
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,541
I think you should see.

888
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,127
<i>It's a current-events program.</i>

889
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,254
I asked Neelix
to monitor Earth broadcasts.

890
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,340
I'm transferring it
to the main viewer.

891
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,883
MALE NEWSCASTER:
<i>Incredible footage</i>
<i>was caught just an hour ago</i>

892
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,012
<i>by a man using his camcorder</i>
<i>to tape a backyard barbeque.</i>

893
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,306
<i>The massive,</i>
<i>unidentifiable object</i>

894
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,433
<i>does not appear to be</i>
<i>a meteorite, weather balloon,</i>

895
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,561
<i>or satellite, and one</i>
<i>aviation expert we've spoken to</i>

896
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,563
<i>has stated that</i>
<i>it's definitely not</i>

897
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,149
<i>any kind of U.S. aircraft</i>
<i>currently in use.</i>

898
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,193
<i>We're awaiting investigation</i>
<i>by local authorites,</i>

899
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,445
<i>and we'll keep you updated</i>
<i>as news develops</i>

900
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,738
<i>on this incredible story.</i>
