NARRATOR:
<i>Last time,</i> 
<i>on</i> Star Trek: Voyager...

2
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,012
CHAKOTAY:
Looks like this
entire part of space

3
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,222
has changed somehow.

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,266
We should dismantle
this weapon

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,935
and rejoin our people.

6
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,228
No, not until
every colony...

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,480
every individual...

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,691
every blade of
grass is restored.

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,151
It appears that someone...

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,946
or something
has altered history.

11
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,248
Captain, that energy beam,

12
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,668
it's pushing<i> Voyager</i> out
of the space-time continuum.

13
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,962
He's trying to erase us
from history.

14
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,176
I promised myself that I
would never give this order,

15
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,846
that I would never break up
this family,

16
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,430
but asking you to stay...

17
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,143
would be asking you to die.

18
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,149
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,698
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51425.4.</i>

20
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,991
<i>Our condition has left us</i>

21
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,117
<i>vulnerable to spatial</i>
<i>anomalies,</i>

22
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,914
<i>and to any alien species</i>
<i>eager for a piece of hardware.</i>

23
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>We've taken refuge</i>
<i>in a class-9 nebula.</i>

24
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,045
( alarm beeping )

25
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,425
( beeps denial )

26
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,927
Oh, come on!

27
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,221
Don't do this to me now.

28
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,015
Emergency force fields 
are holding.

29
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,767
How the hell did all
this gas get inside?

30
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,477
KIM:
Looks like a malfunction
in the ventilation system.

31
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,823
Okay, I'm going to try

32
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,451
reversing the osmotic pressure
on this deck.

33
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,244
Oh!
Whoa!

34
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,206
The gas corroded
the circuit relays.

35
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,792
Let's bypass.

36
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,168
( coughing )

37
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,297
We've got three
minutes of air left.

38
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,132
How long can you
hold your breath?

39
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,219
( coughing )

40
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,098
Ensign Kim found time
to be treated, so can you.

41
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,265
How is Harry?

42
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,767
He'll be fine,
but I'm surprised

43
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,060
he didn't asphyxiate.

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,895
I told you eight
minutes on that deck,

45
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,188
not eight and a half, not
nine, and certainly not 12.

46
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,024
Would you rather have
an indoor nebula?

47
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,484
If we didn't stop it
then and there,

48
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,277
it would have flooded
another two decks.

49
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,988
B'Elanna, engines?
Not yet, Captain.

50
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,823
One of the warp nacelles
is still off-line.

51
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,198
The other one's
a lost cause.

52
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,034
Route all available power
to the good one.

53
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,619
( coughing )

54
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,955
The alveoli in your lungs
have been chemically burned.

55
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,124
I want you off your feet
for the next 48 hours.

56
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,875
Impossible. I've got
too much work to do.

57
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,752
There are seven other
crew members on board.

58
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,337
You're the Captain.
Delegate.

59
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,713
Inject me with trioxin.

60
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,590
That should help me
breathe a little easier.

61
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,300
B'Elanna, stand by
for the transfer.

62
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,510
Right.

63
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,303
Trioxin is used
in emergency situations

64
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,638
as a stopgap measure.

65
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,473
Your lungs have suffered
serious damage.

66
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,017
They need to be
treated properly.

67
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,143
Doctor's orders.

68
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,645
Captain's orders,
trioxin, now.

69
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,229
Aye, aye.

70
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,564
It's your body.

71
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,816
Who am I to judge?

72
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,442
I'm only the Chief
Medical Officer.

73
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,652
What do I know?

74
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,987
Thank you.

75
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,242
Now, where were we?

76
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,245
( coughing violently )

77
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,231
( door opens )

78
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,540
( door opens )

79
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,584
Well...

80
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,086
you look rested.

81
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,713
Where's my crewmate?

82
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,382
He should have been here by now.

83
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,468
No doubt he's making
himself difficult.

84
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:48,140
I've never seen such
an intransigent young man.

85
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,933
You've had us in isolation
for two months.

86
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,643
We've been scanned,
poked and prodded.

87
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,313
How do you
expect us to act?

88
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,274
With some degree
of dignity and restraint.

89
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,484
Your crewmate has none.

90
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,153
What do you want from us?

91
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,239
At the moment...

92
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,033
information.

93
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,160
Anything for such
a charming host.

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,328
Are you all right?

95
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,578
The galley
has prepared

96
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,206
a selection
of unique delicacies.

97
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,291
You won't find them
anywhere else in the galaxy.

98
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,252
Please, join me.

99
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,303
Malkothian spirits,

100
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,846
an extremely rare vintage.

101
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,139
The only bottle

102
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,389
known to exist.

103
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,475
Your Captain
said that...

104
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,853
your vessel is trying
to reach home.

105
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,772
I hadn't realized
how far your home was.

106
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,651
You're an anomalous component,

107
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,196
alone, disconnected,

108
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,572
impossible to predict.

109
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,203
You have no idea how you've
complicated my mission.

110
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,788
Glad to hear it.

111
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,583
When I first encountered
your vessel,

112
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,044
it was badly damaged,
barely functioning.

113
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,256
What if I told you,
that in the blink of an eye,

114
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:06,093
I could restore<i> Voyager</i>
to its former condition?

115
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,678
That you and I
would never have met?

116
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,222
That you might
even find yourself

117
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,599
closer to the Alpha Quadrant?

118
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,435
By using the weapon on this ship
to alter history.

119
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,145
Yes.

120
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,107
I can control
the destiny of a...

121
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,235
single molecule
or an entire civilization.

122
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,527
How's the wine?

123
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,738
Excellent.

124
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,283
This bottle is
the only component left

125
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,618
of the once powerful
Malkoth race.

126
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,620
Everything else about them,

127
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,705
cities, culture,
the very species itself,

128
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,207
never existed...

129
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,750
because of me.

130
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,795
Every dish you see here

131
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,547
comes from
a civilization that...

132
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,133
has been erased from time.

133
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,135
Mr. Paris,

134
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,719
you're devouring
the last remnants

135
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,097
of the Alsuran Empire.

136
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,807
I have collected artifacts
from...

137
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,686
hundreds of worlds.

138
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,855
This vessel is
more than a weapon.

139
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,859
It's a museum of lost histories.

140
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,908
You two gentlemen almost became
artifacts yourselves.

141
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,703
But I've decided to...

142
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,372
spare your vessel.

143
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,706
Why?

144
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,625
Call it an act
of compassion.

145
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,419
You're trying to reach home.

146
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,795
In a way, so am I.

147
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,758
We can work together
to achieve both our goals.

148
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,136
What do you propose?

149
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,430
In order to make
the calculations required

150
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,889
to restore<i> Voyager,</i>

151
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,933
I need to know
about some of your experiences

152
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,185
in this Quadrant.

153
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,769
What species
you interacted with,

154
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,648
how other components were
affected by your presence...

155
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,900
You can't find her,
can you?

156
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,902
I think Captain Janeway
has been eluding you

157
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,154
for the past two months.

158
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,364
Otherwise, you

159
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,367
would've destroyed
<i>Voyager</i> by now.

160
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,785
I'm offering you
a way out of this situation.

161
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,122
You accept my offer...

162
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,958
or when I do find<i> Voyager,</i>
I will destroy it.

163
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,003
And how many civilizations
will you have to erase

164
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,796
to send us merrily
on our way?

165
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,131
No, thanks.

166
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,050
We don't want that kind
of blood on our hands.

167
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,759
Tom, hold on.

168
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,472
You said you
could control

169
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,265
the destiny of a
single molecule.

170
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,976
If you made a precise
enough calculation,

171
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,355
could you restore<i> Voyager</i>
without harming anyone?

172
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,482
It is possible...

173
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,108
but it's extremely difficult.

174
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,110
That's why I need
your cooperation.

175
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,653
( scoffs )

176
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,739
I'd rather spend a year
in solitary confinement

177
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,948
than listen to any of this.

178
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,158
Tom, have a seat.

179
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,993
Chakotay,
we can't trust him.

180
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,120
You're correct.

181
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,165
Given the circumstances,
there is no reason to trust me,

182
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,917
but trust isn't necessary.

183
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,544
We need each other.

184
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,713
( beeping )

185
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,132
Obrist...

186
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,386
show our guest
to his new quarters.

187
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,803
I'll do everything
in my power

188
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,638
to make you comfortable
here, Mr. Paris.

189
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,100
All I ask in return...

190
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,394
is that you keep an open mind.

191
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,990
I was very impressed
with your question.

192
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,785
You seem to understand
the subtleties of time.

193
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,790
Professor Vassbinder
might've disagreed with you.

194
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,000
I failed his course
in temporal mechanics.

195
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,297
Beyond study
and instrumentation,

196
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,672
there is instinct.

197
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:38,054
Not everyone has the ability
to truly perceive time...

198
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,100
its colors, its moods.

199
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,854
Perhaps you do.

200
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,275
I'm certainly willing
to give it a try.

201
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,237
TORRES:
To distant friends.

202
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,530
NEELIX:
To friends.

203
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,365
JANEWAY: Hear, hear.
KIM: Cheers.

204
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,169
Well?

205
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,090
Interesting.

206
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,843
Not bad.

207
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,219
Not bad at all.

208
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,763
What...is it exactly?

209
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,975
I call it
"the elixir of endurance."

210
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,977
It's loaded with amino acids,
carbohydrates,

211
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,812
all the nutrients
necessary for the crew

212
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,814
to withstand these
stressful conditions.

213
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,065
Ration cubes.

214
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,861
Well, yes, yes, but
this time, pureed,

215
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,070
and mixed with water,

216
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,989
and enhanced
with Talaxian spices.

217
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,366
It is offensive.

218
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,741
( chuckles )

219
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,577
Fortunately,
taste is irrelevant.

220
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,663
Well, it's been a few days

221
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,705
since we've gathered
in one place.

222
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,416
Now's a good time to catch up.

223
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,626
How are the repairs proceeding?

224
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,252
DOCTOR:
I'm happy to report

225
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,255
that I've repaired the optronic
error in my program.

226
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,841
And the power grid?

227
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,177
We're operating
at 32 percent efficiency.

228
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,846
I think I can bring it up to 50,
but I'll need a few more days.

229
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,348
Warp drive?

230
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm still having trouble
with the starboard nacelle.

231
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,352
How long?

232
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,854
Three weeks, minimum.

233
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,816
( sighs )

234
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,694
I thought this nebula
would be a safe haven

235
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,070
until we finished repairs,

236
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,239
but it's turning
into a permanent residence.

237
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,116
We've got to get back
into open space,

238
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,493
find allies,

239
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,827
put together
a fighting force

240
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,954
to take on Annorax.

241
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,709
We're leaving

242
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,711
this damn cloud
first thing tomorrow morning.

243
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,003
SEVEN:
Captain,

244
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,214
you are in error.

245
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,549
Really?

246
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,967
At the moment,
this vessel is defenseless.

247
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,386
We should remain here

248
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,388
until we are functioning
at our peak efficiency.

249
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,391
I appreciate your opinion,
Seven, but I disagree.

250
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,061
We leave tomorrow,
0800 hours.

251
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,066
It is inappropriate to
contradict the Captain

252
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,359
in front of the crew.

253
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,776
That was not
my intention.

254
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,196
I simply pointed out
that her decision was wrong.

255
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,448
In your view.

256
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,741
And yours.

257
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,701
I know you well enough
to say that.

258
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,119
Then you should also know

259
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,204
that my trust
in Captain Janeway is absolute.

260
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,499
The decision you or I
might have made is irrelevant.

261
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,294
As a Borg, I submitted
to a single authority,

262
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,545
the collective.

263
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,004
Over the past several months,

264
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,214
I've been encouraged

265
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,716
to think and act
as an individual.

266
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,259
It is difficult

267
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,637
to know
when to restrain myself.

268
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,179
Remember this guideline,

269
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,181
The Captain is always right.

270
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,059
Even when you know
her logic is flawed?

271
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,146
Perhaps.

272
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,700
CHAKOTAY:
Component 37329, a rogue comet.

273
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,201
About eight months ago,

274
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,827
<i>Voyager</i> made
a course correction

275
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,037
to avoid the comet.

276
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,332
According to
my calculations,

277
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,793
it led to our
entering Krenim space.

278
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,672
Your solution, then, would be to
erase that comet from history.

279
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,173
Exactly.

280
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,049
<i>Voyager</i> would have
stayed on its course,

281
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,427
and bypassed Krenim
space altogether.

282
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,764
Sounds simple enough.
Conduct a simulation.

283
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,433
Temporal incursion
in progress.

284
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,320
What happened?

285
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,364
Had you actually
eradicated that comet,

286
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,783
all life within
50 light-years

287
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,493
would never
have existed.

288
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,745
Congratulations.

289
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,415
You almost wiped out...
8,000 civilizations.

290
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,670
I didn't consider

291
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,963
the entire history
of the comet.

292
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,466
Four billion years ago,

293
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,803
fragments from that comet
impacted a planet.

294
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,763
Hydrocarbons
from those fragments

295
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,889
gave rise to

296
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,307
several species
of plant life,

297
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,517
which in turn,

298
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,060
sustained more
complex organisms.

299
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,022
Ultimately, several
space-faring civilizations

300
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,275
evolved and colonized
the entire sector.

301
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,694
By erasing the comet,

302
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,321
I altered all evolution
in this region.

303
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,409
Past, present and future...

304
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,078
they exist as one.

305
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,414
They breathe together.

306
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,294
You're not the only person
to make this mistake.

307
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,552
When I first constructed
this weapon ship,

308
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,638
I turned it against
our greatest enemy,

309
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,014
the Rilnar.

310
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,770
The result
was miraculous.

311
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,898
With the Rilnar
gone from history,

312
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,943
my people, in an instant,
became powerful again,

313
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,279
but there were problems.

314
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,700
A rare disease broke out
among our colonies.

315
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,494
Within a year,
50 million were dead.

316
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,830
I had failed to realize
that the Rilnar

317
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,291
had introduced
a crucial antibody

318
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,376
into the Krenim genome...

319
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,171
and my weapon
had eliminated

320
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,340
that antibody as well.

321
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,550
And you've been trying

322
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,051
to undo that damage
ever since,

323
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,263
but each time you
pull out a new thread,

324
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,390
another one
begins to unravel.

325
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,769
You can't imagine the burden
of memory that I carry,

326
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,229
thousands of worlds,

327
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,356
billions of lives,

328
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,776
gone, brought back,

329
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,736
gone again.

330
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,864
I try to rationalize the loss.

331
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,492
They're not
really being destroyed,

332
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,243
because they never existed.

333
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,414
Sometimes I can...

334
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,792
almost convince myself.

335
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,085
You've been at this
for 200 years, Annorax.

336
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,087
What makes you think
you're ever going to succeed?

337
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,215
What makes you think<i> Voyager</i>
will ever reach Earth?

338
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,178
The odds against you
are astronomical.

339
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,055
Yet, you keep trying.

340
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,226
You're right, but we
don't destroy everything

341
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,770
that stands in our way.

342
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,523
You can help me to
change that, Chakotay.

343
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,527
Together, we'll restore
the Krenim and<i> Voyager,</i>

344
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,779
and we'll undo the
damage that I've caused.

345
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,949
I've still got a lot to learn.

346
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,659
Come.

347
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,203
It's time I show you
the heart of this vessel,

348
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,538
the temporal core.

349
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:32,010
( slow theme playing )

350
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,427
JANEWAY:
Engines?

351
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,679
I'm doing my best!

352
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,305
Captain, with
the deflector down,

353
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,515
those micro-meteoroids

354
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,892
are beginning to
erode the hull.

355
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,727
Emergency power
to the deflector.

356
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:41,936
None available.

357
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,689
( thumps and bangs on hull )

358
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,607
I'll be in Deflector Control.

359
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,401
TUVOK:
Captain, that
entire section

360
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,028
has been designated
hazard-level 4.

361
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,613
I know.

362
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:04,250
( suspenseful theme plays )

363
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,170
( screams )

364
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,049
Oh, why do I get the feeling
you're testing me,<i> Voyager?</i>

365
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,300
Bridge, there's a fire
in Deflector Control.

366
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,635
Any luck with the engines?

367
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,345
The warp core's still off-line.

368
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,306
Micro-meteoroid density
is increasing.

369
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,021
<i>The nacelle pylon</i>
<i>is buckling.</i>

370
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,695
Bridge, I'm going in.

371
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,280
Stand by
to engage the deflector.

372
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,824
Tell the Doctor I'll be coming
back with severe burns.

373
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,076
Captain...

374
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,410
Do it.

375
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,247
Be kind.

376
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,588
( rumbling )

377
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,715
The Captain's accessed
manual control.

378
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,717
She's stabilizing
the particle emitters.

379
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,969
( beeping )

380
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,219
She's got it.

381
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,471
Deflector's on line.

382
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,348
Activating deflector field.

383
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,350
Bridge to Janeway.

384
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,939
Captain,
please respond.

385
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,350
( moaning )

386
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,862
What's my condition?

387
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,738
You suffered
third-degree burns

388
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,033
to approximately
60 percent of your body.

389
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,909
I've healed most of them,

390
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,577
but without a
dermal regenerator,

391
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,997
I couldn't repair all
the damage to your skin.

392
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,792
You've been left with scars
on your face and arms.

393
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,546
( sighs )

394
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,715
I'll consider
them mementos.

395
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,299
Not so fast.

396
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,801
You're spending
the next few days

397
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,094
here with me.

398
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,345
What for?

399
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,555
Observation.

400
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,223
Is there something else
wrong with me?

401
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,516
Not physically.

402
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,767
What are you suggesting?

403
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,853
Traumatic stress syndrome.

404
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,898
Symptoms, irritability,
sleeplessness,

405
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,941
obsessional thoughts,
reckless behavior...

406
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,360
all of which you've demonstrated
over the last few weeks.

407
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,906
My only obsession is with
saving my ship, my people.

408
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,699
If I've been taking
some reckless chances

409
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,951
in order to do that, it's
hardly a medical condition.

410
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,079
I'm not going to stand
here while you rationalize

411
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,371
yet another brush with death.

412
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,789
You don't have to.

413
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,917
As Chief Medical Officer,
I have the authority to

414
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,168
relieve you of your command.

415
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,419
You're not going to do that.

416
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,921
If, in my medical opinion,

417
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,798
your judgment has been
impaired, I can and I will.

418
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,427
Try it and I'll shut
down your program.

419
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,262
That threat in itself

420
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,681
is evidence of your
unstable condition.

421
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,103
I am sorry, Doctor.

422
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,688
I've been operating
on instinct for so long,

423
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,690
I did not think
before I spoke.

424
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,443
I have no intention
of deactivating you,

425
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,029
but I won't stay
in this Mess Hall.

426
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,280
Is that final?
Final.

427
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,865
Then you leave me
no choice.

428
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,701
Captain Kathryn Janeway,

429
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,121
under Starfleet Medical
Regulation 121, Section A,

430
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,539
I, the Chief Medical Officer,
do hereby relieve you

431
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,417
of your active command,
effective immediately.

432
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,920
Have a seat.

433
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,132
How do you plan to implement
this protocol, Doctor?

434
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,259
Mr. Tuvok doesn't have

435
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,802
a security team,

436
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,470
both the brigs
have been destroyed,

437
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,430
and with the internal
force fields off-line,

438
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,474
you'll have a hell of a time
keeping me confined.

439
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,559
You'd better
grab a phaser,

440
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,394
because before
I give up command,

441
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,063
you'll have to shoot me.

442
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,986
You realize this incident will
be noted in my official logs.

443
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,114
By refusing my orders, you risk
a general court martial.

444
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,491
Compared to what I've been
through the past few months,

445
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,453
a court martial would be
a small price to pay.

446
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,457
If we make it back home...

447
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,501
I'll be happy to face the music.

448
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,600
Another ruptured
EPS conduit.

449
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,810
Thirty two so far...

450
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,812
33, 34, 35...

451
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,981
And that fluidic converter
needs to be purged.

452
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,565
Right.

453
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,943
The gravitational plating
in this room has buckled.

454
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,155
Chakotay's quarters.

455
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,998
( tricorder beeping softly )

456
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,972
( beeping intensifies )

457
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,443
You disobeyed orders.

458
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,737
Captain?

459
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,408
Chakotay gave this
to me five months ago,

460
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,578
a birthday gift.

461
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,498
I ordered him to--

462
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,513
What do you think?
Handsome.

463
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,975
Come on.

464
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,070
Astounding.

465
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,947
Not really.

466
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,740
I get lucky
now and again.

467
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,576
Uh, your end game
sequence, it, uh...

468
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,620
it was the same one
favored by my brother.

469
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,124
To quote a long lost
friend of mine,

470
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,457
"It seemed logical."

471
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,298
Now what?

472
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,678
I used to honor
the day of his birth.

473
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,930
Who?

474
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,141
My brother.

475
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,146
And my parents,
my closest friends.

476
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,189
Every year, at first.

477
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,191
Then one day,
I realized,

478
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,777
a century had passed...

479
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,863
and for years, I had been
celebrating birthdays...

480
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,327
for the dead.

481
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,288
Mmm.

482
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,957
Or for people
who never even existed.

483
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,004
I'm sorry.

484
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,720
You can put that
thing down, Chakotay.

485
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,473
No need to strain
your eyes anymore.

486
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,682
I've got a plan.

487
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,891
Let's hear it.

488
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,517
This ship's
temporal core

489
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,812
keeps the vessel out of phase
with normal space-time,

490
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,357
but its shields
are incredibly weak.

491
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:27,193
You take that core off-line,
and a photon grenade

492
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,902
could penetrate
the hull.

493
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,446
How do you know all this?

494
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:34,325
I've been spending time
with our friend Obrist,

495
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,702
who seems more than willing
to share information.

496
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,912
And that's not all.

497
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,248
Does the name Captain Bligh
mean anything to you?

498
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,293
This is not a happy crew.

499
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,045
They've been at this
for 200 years now.

500
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,338
They're tired of it, Chakotay.

501
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,630
They want it to end.

502
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,303
Good work, Tom,

503
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,013
but I'm not quite ready
to start a mutiny.

504
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,431
Keep gathering
information.

505
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,974
Lie low.

506
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,476
I'm starting
to make progress

507
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,977
on the temporal
calculations.

508
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,896
With a little
time and luck,

509
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,232
I think we can get the
Krenim back on their feet,

510
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,526
and<i> Voyager</i> back to
the Alpha Quadrant.

511
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,903
You're starting to sound
like Annorax,

512
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,071
always one more calculation.

513
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,613
This time it's going
to be perfect.

514
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,865
This can work.

515
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,325
If you'd take time to listen,

516
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,452
you'd understand what Annorax
is trying to do.

517
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,914
What? Wipe out civilizations
to help his own race?

518
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,125
I understand perfectly.
It's more complicated than that.

519
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,880
Annorax is an
enlightened man,

520
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,965
misguided, but I think
he wants this to end

521
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,342
as much as anyone.

522
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,929
I guess I don't have
the instinct for time,

523
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,015
or whatever it is Captain Nemo
out there calls it.

524
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,683
Chakotay, he's been
flattering you

525
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,809
and it's gone to your head.

526
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,395
You're out of line,
Lieutenant.

527
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,231
( sighs )

528
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,358
Maybe I shouldn't
start a mutiny,

529
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,817
but I might be able
to get Obrist

530
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,694
to help us send a message
to Captain Janeway.

531
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,989
Not yet, if you get caught,
we lose everything.

532
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,241
I can get us out of this.

533
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,243
Not if I can get us
out of here first.

534
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,079
You're not doing anything
against Annorax.

535
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,705
That's an order.

536
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,499
( scoffs )

537
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,708
What are you going to do,

538
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,252
take away
my holodeck privileges?

539
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,297
Either we maintain
our command structure,

540
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,798
or else
we settle our differences

541
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,133
the old-fashioned way.

542
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,596
( alarm blaring )

543
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:19,930
What's happening?

544
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,807
We're preparing for
a temporal incursion.

545
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,016
What incursion?

546
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,268
You didn't
say anything...

547
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,727
I had an inspiration
last night.

548
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,979
By my calculations,

549
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,814
the eradication of
the Ram Izad species

550
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,024
will result
in a 52 percent restoration

551
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,485
of the Krenim timeline.

552
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,694
I thought we were working
to avoid more destruction.

553
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,738
When time offers you
an opportunity,

554
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,365
you don't ignore it.

555
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,700
We're within range
of their homeworld.

556
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,537
Take us into orbit.

557
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,955
Full power
to the weapon.

558
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,999
Prepare for
total erasure.

559
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,377
Is this what you call
enlightened?

560
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,045
Targeting the focal point.

561
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,340
Locked.

562
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,216
Please, this isn't necessary.

563
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,675
We'll find another way.

564
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,644
Fire.

565
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,276
Trace elements?

566
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,736
Diminishing.

567
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,572
Counter-indications.

568
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,199
None so far.

569
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,617
Scan the continuum.

570
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,619
Bring me the results
once they're complete.

571
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,911
Yes, sir.

572
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,455
I'll be in my chambers.

573
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,463
Have you seen enough
yet, Chakotay?

574
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,924
If you don't do something
about this maniac, I will.

575
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,439
You didn't need to
fire on that planet.

576
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,485
I'm altering history
on a massive scale.

577
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,946
The destinies of countless
star systems are in my hands.

578
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,824
The fate of one species
is insignificant.

579
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,910
You're trying
to rationalize genocide.

580
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,828
One species is significant.

581
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,455
A single life is significant.

582
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,922
It seemed so...

583
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,717
easy the first time.

584
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:25,097
In the blink of an eye,
I had changed history itself,

585
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,182
allowed my people
to thrive again.

586
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,688
But when I changed history
a second time...

587
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,857
I lost more
than you can imagine.

588
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,610
The colony on Kyana Prime.

589
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,821
How could you know that?

590
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,451
I've been studying
your previous incursions.

591
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,412
No matter how close you get
to restoring the timeline,

592
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,872
one component
is always missing...

593
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,332
Kyana Prime.

594
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,670
Who was on that colony?

595
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,838
Who did you lose?

596
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,258
My wife...

597
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,718
and with her, my future.

598
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,221
My children,
grandchildren,

599
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,307
all erased because of me.

600
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,604
This is all
I have left of her.

601
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,482
So many years
I worked through the night

602
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,191
while she was sleeping.

603
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,153
How could I have known I was...

604
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,531
calculating her fate?

605
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,619
I can't stop
until I've restored Kyana Prime,

606
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,704
and forced time
to give me back my wife.

607
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,456
Maybe it isn't possible.

608
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:36,585
When I tell you
that time has moods...

609
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,212
a disposition to be intuited...

610
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,631
I'm not speaking metaphorically.

611
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,341
What do you mean?

612
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,468
Anger is one of its moods,

613
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,513
anger and the desire for...

614
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,724
retribution, vengeance.

615
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:55,479
Time itself has tried
to punish me for my arrogance.

616
00:30:55,479 --> 00:31:00,066
It has kept me from my wife,
denied me my future.

617
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,654
Sir, we've achieved
a 52 percent restoration.

618
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,823
Kyana Prime?

619
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,575
Negative, sir.

620
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,413
Resume scanning
the continuum.

621
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,790
OBRIST:
Yes, sir.

622
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,044
( door closes )

623
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,963
( clears throat ):
I've, uh...

624
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,551
I've studied your
calculations, Chakotay.

625
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:29,471
They're promising...

626
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,764
premature.

627
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,642
We'll keep working on them.

628
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,770
In the meantime,
my mission must continue.

629
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,271
You don't
have the right--

630
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,648
To fight for what is mine?

631
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,401
That's not for you to decide.

632
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,071
Only time can pronounce
judgment against me.

633
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,578
( sighs )

634
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,663
If that little display
doesn't convince you,

635
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,873
I don't know what will.

636
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,123
He's insane.

637
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,375
No, he's not.

638
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,752
Wounded maybe,

639
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,254
even tortured,
but I can still reach him...

640
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,505
convince him to stop.

641
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,257
Not from what you've told me.

642
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:09,803
This guy thinks that time has
a personal grudge against him.

643
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,513
That's called paranoia,
Chakotay,

644
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,765
with a hint of megalomania.

645
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,516
You don't know
what he's been through.

646
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,561
He's lost his family.

647
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,812
Okay, that's a terrible thing,

648
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,064
but so has everyone else
on this ship,

649
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,733
and frankly, so have we!

650
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,154
What kind of progress
have you made?

651
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,242
Obrist is coming around...

652
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,993
and I think we can trust him.

653
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,289
He says he'll give me access
to their communications array.

654
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,665
I can send a message to<i> Voyager</i>

655
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,375
from the comfort
of my own quarters.

656
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,795
And the temporal core?

657
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,463
That's going to be
a little trickier.

658
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,215
With Obrist's help, I'm
pretty sure I can disable it,

659
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,928
but not without setting off
every alarm on this ship.

660
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,554
We're only going
to have one chance.

661
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,764
It'll require precise timing.

662
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,223
You and me
working from within...

663
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,558
And Captain
Janeway

664
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,435
attacking from<i> Voyager.</i>

665
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:03,440
That is...
if the Captain's still alive.

666
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,775
She's alive.

667
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:09,947
Send the message.

668
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,197
Transmit our coordinates.

669
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,449
Done.

670
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,576
And...

671
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,953
give Kathryn my best.

672
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,256
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i> 
<i>Stardate 51682.2.</i>

673
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,383
<i>I've forged a coalition</i>
<i>with the Nihydron,</i>

674
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,093
<i>and the Mawasi.</i>

675
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,721
<i>Together, we're preparing</i>
<i>to attack the weapon ship.</i>

676
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,890
I've analyzed
every carrier frequency

677
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,391
of their transmission.

678
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,604
It contains a classified
Starfleet ID code

679
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,941
that could only have
come from Tom Paris.

680
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,901
It's real.

681
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,319
The coordinates he sent

682
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,530
should lead us directly
to the weapon ship.

683
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,781
Location?

684
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,701
Approximately
50 light-years from here.

685
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,829
Our new allies are
assembling reinforcements.

686
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,040
Once we're in range,
Tom says he'll try

687
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,167
to take the weapon ship
temporal core off-line.

688
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,585
When that happens,

689
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,671
they'll be vulnerable
to conventional weapons.

690
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,090
Tom will then transmit
the exact location of the core.

691
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,885
Our job will be
to disable the ship,

692
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,093
and get our people out.

693
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,345
Is everyone clear?

694
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,180
KIM: Yes, ma'am.
TORRES: Aye, Captain.

695
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,641
B'Elanna, Harry,

696
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,601
I want you to beam over
to the Nihydron vessel.

697
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,353
Work with
their engineers.

698
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,022
The entire fleet
needs to be equipped

699
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,231
with temporal shielding.

700
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,524
Aye, Captain.

701
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,318
Tuvok, Neelix, Seven,

702
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,904
you'll be working
on the Mawasi ship.

703
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,321
NEELIX:
Yes, Captain.

704
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,992
Doctor, once the attack begins,

705
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,119
your skills
will no doubt be required.

706
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,371
Join Tuvok's team.

707
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,956
What about yourself?

708
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,333
I'll be piloting<i> Voyager,</i>
coordinating the attack.

709
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,168
TORRES:
Captain,

710
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,462
there's barely enough
of this ship left to get there,

711
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,881
much less wage a war.

712
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,174
There's fight
in<i> Voyager</i> yet.

713
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,427
It's still got
temporal shields...

714
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,762
six photon torpedoes.

715
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,555
It'll hold together.

716
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,474
Besides, you know the adage,

717
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,269
Captain goes down
with the ship, right?

718
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,771
You have your orders.

719
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,856
Dismissed.

720
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,664
Tuvok, I can hear
your objections already.

721
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,124
I am not leaving.

722
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,710
Given<i> Voyager's</i>
damaged state,

723
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,712
the probability
of your surviving

724
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,798
an armed conflict is marginal.

725
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,382
Oh, I know the odds,

726
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,384
but I have to stay.

727
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,930
<i>Voyager's</i> done
too much for us.

728
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,433
Curious.

729
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,393
I have never understood
the human compulsion

730
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,647
to emotionally bond
with inanimate objects.

731
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,940
This vessel

732
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,441
has done nothing.

733
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,443
It is an assemblage

734
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,822
of bulkheads, conduits,
tritanium...

735
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,490
nothing more.

736
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,033
Oh, you're wrong.

737
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,788
It's much more than that.

738
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,290
This ship has been our home.

739
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,959
It's kept us together.

740
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,419
It's been part of our family.

741
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,131
As illogical as
this might sound...

742
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,299
I feel as close
to<i> Voyager</i>

743
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,802
as I do to any other
member of my crew.

744
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,470
It's carried us, Tuvok...

745
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,974
even nurtured us...

746
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,935
and right now, it
needs one of us.

747
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,939
I respect your decision.

748
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,904
Live long and prosper, Captain.

749
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,537
Same to you...

750
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,957
old friend.

751
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,441
<i>Voyager</i> to Mawasi vessel.

752
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,943
TUVOK:
<i>Go ahead, Captain.</i>

753
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,820
I'm picking up the weapon ship,
dead ahead.

754
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,280
<i>Confirmed.</i>

755
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,365
Temporal shields status.

756
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,910
<i>All vessels are bringing them</i>
<i>on line.</i>

757
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,835
This is Captain Janeway
to the fleet.

758
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,463
Plot an intercept course
to the weapon ship.

759
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,718
Sir, six vessels are
approaching our position.

760
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,137
Identify.

761
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,555
Three Nihydron warships,
two Mawasi cruisers...

762
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,183
and<i> Voyager.</i>

763
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,727
We're outside space-time,
impervious to their weapons.

764
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,020
Let them come.

765
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,357
I know Captain Janeway.
She wouldn't be attacking

766
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,110
unless she knew she
could do some damage.

767
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,444
( controls beeping softly )

768
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,240
( console beeps )

769
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,617
Good work, Obrist.

770
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,706
If she's given the other
ships temporal shielding,

771
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,917
they've undoubtedly
informed their homeworlds.

772
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,795
They'll be able to protect their
planets against your weapon.

773
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,924
Bring the weapon to full power.

774
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,760
Stand by
for multiple incursions.

775
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,973
We'll have to disable
their temporal shields first.

776
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,642
Make the necessary calculations.

777
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,270
TUVOK:
<i>All vessels report ready.</i>

778
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,772
Let's see if Tom
has done his part.

779
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,192
Janeway to the fleet.

780
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,819
Attack pattern omega.

781
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,196
Engage.

782
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,619
Condition?

783
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,997
No damage.

784
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,498
Temporal core is stable.

785
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,791
Return fire.

786
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,632
TUVOK:
<i>Captain,</i>

787
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,468
<i>two Nihydron vessels</i>
<i>have been destroyed.</i>

788
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,722
Janeway to the fleet.

789
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,516
Evasive pattern delta.
We're going to have to wait.

790
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,143
Come on, Tom.
Come on.

791
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,771
Target the other vessels.

792
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,447
Obrist...
I said target the vessels.

793
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,786
( equipment powering down )

794
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,955
( alarm blaring )

795
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,166
You're deactivating
the temporal core.

796
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,044
I'm sorry, sir.

797
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,379
It's over.

798
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,178
Get back to your stations.

799
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,055
You will not disobey me.

800
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,559
We're phasing back
into normal space-time.

801
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,437
Reconfigure
to conventional weapons.

802
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,398
( console beeping )

803
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:45,151
TUVOK:
<i>Captain, Chakotay and Paris</i>
<i>were beamed aboard our vessel.</i>

804
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,113
Everything's going as planned.

805
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,655
Tom sent me the coordinates

806
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,657
of their temporal core
before he left.

807
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:55,578
I'm transmitting them
to you now.

808
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,165
KRENIM:
Conventional weapons are on line
and fully charged, sir.

809
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,666
Fire at will!

810
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,864
( cries out )

811
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,166
( groans )

812
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,760
KRENIM:
Sir, weapons are back
to full capacity.

813
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,220
Target<i> Voyager.</i>

814
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,056
Put Janeway out of her misery.

815
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,976
TUVOK:
<i>All our ships have</i>
<i>been disabled, Captain.</i>

816
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,686
<i>Do you have weapons?</i>

817
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,730
Negative.
Torpedo launchers are down.

818
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,899
I'm setting a collision course.

819
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,653
Janeway to the fleet.

820
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,031
Take your temporal shields
off-line.

821
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,824
TUVOK:
<i>Captain, we won't be protected.</i>

822
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,701
Exactly.

823
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,370
If that ship is destroyed,

824
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,080
all of history
might be restored,

825
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,708
and this is one year
I'd like to forget.

826
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,465
Time's...up.

827
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,443
The core is
destabilizing.

828
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,278
It's going to cause
a temporal incursion

829
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,571
within the ship.

830
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,932
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51252.3.</i>

831
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,934
<i>The past couple of weeks</i>
<i>have been uneventful,</i>

832
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,561
<i>but we've made</i>
<i>excellent progress</i>

833
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,938
<i>on the new Astrometrics Lab.</i>

834
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,523
When can you
bring it on line?

835
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,066
SEVEN:
We just did.

836
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,650
KIM:
In fact, we're
in the process

837
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,361
of charting a
new course home.

838
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,405
JANEWAY:
I'd say this is cause
for celebration.

839
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,032
TUVOK:
A vessel is approaching
off the port bow, Captain.

840
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,492
On screen.

841
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,994
They're hailing us.

842
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,621
JANEWAY:
Open a channel.

843
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:48,876
<i>You've entered Krenim space.</i>
<i>State your identity.</i>

844
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,170
Captain Janeway
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

845
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,256
We're just passing through,
trying to get home.

846
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,549
<i>This region is in dispute.</i>

847
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,093
<i>I suggest</i>
<i>you avoid our territory.</i>

848
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,761
Thanks for the warning.

849
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,763
<i>Good journey.</i>

850
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,434
Tom, plot a course
around Krenim space.

851
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,643
Aye, sir.

852
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,353
CHAKOTAY:
So what do you think?

853
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,730
How about a ground-breaking
ceremony for our new lab?

854
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,190
Sounds great.

855
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,568
I think I'll replicate
a bottle of Saint Emilion

856
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,069
for the occasion,

857
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:19,365
2370, I hear that
was a good year.

858
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,746
Good morning.

859
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,042
Good morning.

860
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,007
Join me
for breakfast?

861
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,550
In a little while.

862
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,220
I still have a...
few more calculations.

863
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,763
There are always

864
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,682
"a few more calculations."

865
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,435
It's a beautiful day.

866
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,812
Spend it with me.

867
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,527
I suppose I can
make the time.

868
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:13,710
( theme music plays )
