00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,844
KIM:
When the captain told us
to start collecting deuterium,

2
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,429
Seven suggested modifications
to the Bussard collectors.

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,056
Problem is, I didn't realize
the extent of the modifications

4
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,558
until after we'd
begun the sweep,

5
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,602
not that there was
anything wrong with them.

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:19,895
In fact, efficiency is up 23%.

7
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,396
In a nutshell, Harry.

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,815
The collectors
are almost full,

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,274
but I can't tell
exactly how full

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,319
until I realign my sensors
with Seven's.

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,904
Why didn't you
just say so?

12
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,239
Next time, work closer
with her from the start.

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,658
(<i> sighs</i> )

14
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,243
Closer. Right.

15
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,999
So, you're going to realign
your sensors with Seven's.

16
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,750
Sounds like fun.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,126
Very funny.

18
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,753
(<i> rumbling</i> )

19
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,381
What was that?

20
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,758
Are you getting feedback
from Seven's modifications?

21
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,802
Negative.

22
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,387
Report.

23
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,139
I am picking up proton surges
just outside the ship.

24
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,599
The first was
off the port beam

25
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,601
and the second two were
off the starboard bow.

26
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,520
On screen.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,523
There's nothing out there.

28
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,817
Whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

29
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,485
Red alert.
Janeway to Astrometrics.

30
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,278
SEVEN:
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

31
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:15,116
Use the Astrometrics sensors
to scan for the disturbance.

32
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,202
I'm detecting
close-range weapons fire.

33
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>Source?</i>

34
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,458
Proton surges suggest two
cloaked ships engaged in battle.

35
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,084
KIM:
With us caught
in the middle.

36
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,712
Evasive maneuvers.
PARIS: Aye, Sir.

37
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,213
There's a massive
power surge--

38
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,882
like one of the
ships is exploding.

39
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,599
Captain, there is one life sign
aboard that vessel.

40
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,395
It is no longer on our sensors.

41
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,564
We're being hailed--
audio only.

42
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,024
Let's hear it.

43
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,735
WOMAN:
<i>Chakotay, please,</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

44
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,858
WOMAN:
<i>Chakotay, are you reading me?</i>
<i>Please answer.</i>

45
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,736
This is Commander Chakotay.

46
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,320
Who are you?

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,655
<i>Please, anyone on</i> Voyager,

48
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:03,326
<i>if you can hear me,</i>
<i>I need help.</i>

49
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,204
There has been
an explosion on the vessel.

50
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,705
The hull is
destabilizing.

51
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,956
Life support
is off-line.

52
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,583
Beam her directly
to sickbay.

53
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,669
Targeting her
coordinates.

54
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,590
I've lost her.
Trying again.

55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,883
I don't understand.

56
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,760
I get a clear lock;
Then it drops out.

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,261
If we can get
an away team over there

58
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,304
we could stabilize her ship
and tractor it in.

59
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,890
Do it.

60
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,642
Tom, Tuvok, let's find out
what's going on.

61
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,788
TUVOK:
Environmental systems
are not functioning.

62
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,250
Oxygen levels are
dangerously low.

63
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,044
CHAKOTAY:
Tom... try to get
life support on-line.

64
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,796
No life signs.

65
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,924
See if you can
stabilize the hull.

66
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,300
I'll look for the pilot.

67
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,388
Hello?

68
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,933
(<i> woman groans</i> )

69
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,601
Can you hear me?

70
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,937
WOMAN:
Chakotay, is it you?

71
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,986
Yes.

72
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,155
I'm going to get
this bulkhead off you.

73
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,906
But the beam will fall.

74
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,455
I'm going to pry the bulkhead
off you.

75
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,712
When I say "now," get ready
to roll out of there

76
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,298
like your life
depended on it.

77
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,257
All right.

78
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,340
Ready?

79
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,593
Yes.

80
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,678
Now!

81
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,897
I knew you'd come.

82
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,982
Do I know you?

83
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,778
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

84
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,905
Two to beam directly
to sickbay.

85
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,050
How is she?

86
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,843
I'm not certain.

87
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,180
When I scan her, the readings
won't stay in the database.

88
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,265
Luckily, I'm a master
of visual diagnosis.

89
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,143
She has a minor concussion
and a compound tibular fracture.

90
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,520
Nothing life-threatening.
I can repair the damage.

91
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,772
Did you find out
how she knows you?

92
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,942
Not yet.

93
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,944
(<i> groans weakly</i> )

94
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:47,448
I can't.

95
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,867
She's coming around.

96
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,624
Don't be frightened.

97
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,834
You're quite safe here.

98
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:10,138
Captain... please...
I need asylum.

99
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,973
You must let me stay
on your ship,

100
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,474
and we've got
to get away from here.

101
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,768
They'll be coming
after me.

102
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,019
Slow down a minute.

103
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,897
I have a few questions first.

104
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,191
Who are you?

105
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,193
And how do you know
my first officer?

106
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,320
It's a complicated story.

107
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,116
I'm not...

108
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,159
I'm not sure...

109
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,954
quite how to begin.

110
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,416
But if you don't give me asylum,
they're going to track me down

111
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,500
and they're going
to take me back.

112
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,503
And I don't want to go.

113
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:46,049
We won't turn you over to anyone
without knowing the whole story.

114
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,886
Thank you.

115
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,722
Chakotay...

116
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,891
I want you
to stay with her.

117
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,976
She seems to trust you.

118
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,227
Maybe you'll be
able to find out

119
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,229
what this
is all about.

120
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,189
I hope so.

121
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,357
Keep me informed.

122
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,614
Once I've repaired
the fracture,

123
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,450
she'll need
some bed rest.

124
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,328
Will you stay with me?

125
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,080
Of course.

126
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,374
Then I'll be fine.

127
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,875
DOCTOR:
There.

128
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,836
That should do it.

129
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,587
I'd ask you to monitor
her vital signs,

130
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,173
but since
they aren't registering

131
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,507
I suppose there's no point.

132
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,139
Well... I have several days
worth of inoculation records

133
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,266
to get to catalog.
I suppose I'll get to it.

134
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,773
Is he gone?

135
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,275
Yes.

136
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,777
Then we're alone.

137
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,656
In a manner of speaking.

138
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,034
Can you start clearing up
a few things now?

139
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,245
I'll try.

140
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,333
It's complicated.

141
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,837
You see, we've met before.

142
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,089
If that were true,
I'm sure I'd remember.

143
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,300
No, you wouldn't.

144
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,637
You couldn't.

145
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,849
You see,
the memories of my people

146
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,811
can't be held in the minds
of other races.

147
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,021
When we encounter others

148
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,148
which we do...

149
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,401
infrequently

150
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,862
they remember us
for a few hours...

151
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,782
but then the memories fade away.

152
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,911
We're completely forgotten
by the next day.

153
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,206
Is this done through technology?
Telepathy?

154
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,666
It's a factor of our biology.

155
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:48,004
You see, our bodies produce
a sort of pheromone

156
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,466
which blocks the long-term
memory engrams of others.

157
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,676
Is that why the tricorder
can't scan you?

158
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,012
Why we couldn't get
a transporter lock?

159
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,349
We're impervious
to those sort of devices.

160
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,226
Your ships are cloaked as well.

161
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,020
When you live a covert existence

162
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,107
you develop technology
to enhance it.

163
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,237
But you say we've met before.

164
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,948
About a month ago.

165
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,783
I spent several weeks here.

166
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,787
Several weeks...

167
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,081
you and I worked
closely together.

168
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,000
You helped me
a great deal.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,045
Then I left...

170
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,883
knowing that you would forget
everything about me.

171
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,343
Then why did you come back?

172
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,430
Why the battle?
Why ask us for asylum?

173
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,099
I know you want everything
in a nutshell.

174
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,101
That's the way you work.

175
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,270
But I have to tell you
the whole story

176
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,938
before it will
make sense.

177
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,774
Fine. I'm listening.

178
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,652
I came back...

179
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,407
because I fell in love with you.

180
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,087
She comes from Ramura.

181
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,755
It's a closed society

182
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,882
that won't tolerate
anybody trying to leave.

183
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,051
Apparently, she was
disenchanted with that,

184
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,428
and wanted out.

185
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,054
They're trying
to bring her back.

186
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,056
That's why she's asking
for asylum.

187
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,724
But you say
that she claims

188
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,977
she was on<i> Voyager</i>
before this<i> .</i>

189
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,854
About a month ago.

190
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,481
She says she's a "tracer"--

191
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,483
a kind of bounty hunter
who tracks down people

192
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,610
who try to leave their world.

193
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,987
She found a runaway
hiding on<i> Voyager.</i>

194
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,032
She was here,
but nobody remembers it?

195
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,659
That's what she says,

196
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,869
but I think we have to find
a way to verify her story.

197
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,371
I was looking
at her ship.

198
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,789
It uses a sophisticated
polarization technique

199
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,709
that causes our sensor scans
to pass right through it.

200
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,837
She could have been shadowing us
for quite a while.

201
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,922
And learned enough about
us to convince us she's

202
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,965
been here before.

203
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,008
But why?

204
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,553
Why go to that trouble?

205
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,847
What about the battle with
that other cloaked ship?

206
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,723
She put herself in danger,

207
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,309
when it would have
been a lot easier

208
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,810
simply to ask for asylum.

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,936
I agree...

210
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,480
but I think
we have to make sure

211
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,731
she doesn't have
some hidden agenda.

212
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,734
If she was here, there should
be some evidence of it.

213
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,530
She said a computer
virus was planted

214
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,948
to wipe all references
to her being here

215
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,825
but I have to believe
we can at least turn up

216
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,077
some evidence of tampering.

217
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,329
Harry, Tuvok, Tom

218
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,122
do the same
with her ship.

219
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,709
See if the navigational logs
support what she's saying.

220
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:31,876
Gentlemen.

221
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,591
I agree we should
take precautions

222
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,884
but you seem very
suspicious of her.

223
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,136
I want to make sure
we're not being manipulated.

224
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,306
I agree. If we grant her asylum

225
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,350
we'll be in the position
of having to protect her.

226
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,143
If we're going
to commit to that,

227
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,146
we should certainly find out
if she's telling the truth.

228
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,940
I'd appreciate
your thoughts on that.

229
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,108
Aye, Captain.

230
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,697
I have successfully downloaded

231
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,532
the navigational
logs from your vessel.

232
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,325
Good. Now, compare them
with your own logs

233
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,993
over the last
two months.

234
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,538
Display<i> Voyager's</i> route
toward the alpha quadrant.

235
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,752
Now overlay my route.

236
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,378
There, you see?

237
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,714
Our ships traveled together
for at least two weeks.

238
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,967
You could have falsified
your navigational logs.

239
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,928
There is no proof that
you ever came aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

240
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,930
That's what I always liked
about you two--

241
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,643
such unyielding logic,
such refreshing skepticism.

242
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,311
Run a diagnostic on my logs.

243
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,020
You'll find
they haven't been altered.

244
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,648
(<i> door opening</i> )

245
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,982
How's it going?

246
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,858
TUVOK:
Her story seems
to be legitimate,

247
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,527
but there are
further steps to take.

248
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,945
Then take them.

249
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,030
I thought you might like
to get something to eat--

250
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,325
unless your memories
of our mess hall aren't good.

251
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,577
As a matter of fact, I was
quite fond of Neelix's food.

252
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,704
Now, that's something
that's hard to believe.

253
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,877
Commander Chakotay's
face became flushed

254
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,878
as he spoke with her.

255
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,589
What does that signify?

256
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,258
I'd rather not engage
in speculation.

257
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,302
It is a dangerous pastime.

258
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,644
I think our guest
will enjoy this, Commander.

259
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:16,022
Uh, fried soy meal,
buttered carrots

260
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,732
and a delightful
almond pudding.

261
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:22,069
Sounds wonderful.
Very nice. Thanks, Neelix.

262
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,698
You were very diplomatic.

263
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,366
Why do you say that?

264
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,160
You hate carrots,
fried food upsets your stomach,

265
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,164
and you refuse to eat pudding
because you think it's slimy.

266
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,958
Right?

267
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,627
I'm curious.

268
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,920
When you were here before,
you said we worked together,

269
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,549
but you also said you were here
to retrieve a runaway.

270
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,592
How was I involved?

271
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,802
Aren't you more curious

272
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,220
to hear about
how we fell in love?

273
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,390
"We"? You said you
were in love with me.

274
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,891
You didn't say I
felt the same way.

275
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,393
If you hadn't returned
the feelings

276
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,977
do you really think
I would have taken

277
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,813
such a terrible risk
to get back to you?

278
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,069
Let's take it
one step at a time.

279
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,738
How did you get on our ship?

280
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,281
That was easy. The hard part
was looking for the runaway

281
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,783
without anyone finding me.

282
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,661
I managed two days on the ship
before I triggered

283
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,705
an intruder alert
and lost my cloak.

284
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,373
And then what happened?

285
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,375
And then I met you.

286
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,275
Wrong direction.

287
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,193
I don't want to hurt you.

288
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,945
Put your weapon down.

289
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,072
On my ship,
I give the orders.

290
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,616
Put yours down.

291
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,076
I don't mean you any harm.

292
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,994
You have a stowaway
on board.

293
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,372
I'll retrieve him,
and we'll be on our way.

294
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,874
That's not the way
we do things here.

295
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,210
Chakotay to Tuvok,
I'm in cargo bay two.

296
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,962
I have our intruder.

297
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,339
<i>Understood, Commander.</i>

298
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,842
You're about to find
yourself outnumbered.

299
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,343
If you want
to give me your weapon

300
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,639
and explain what's going on,
I'll listen.

301
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,860
I felt an attraction right away

302
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,695
but I couldn't afford
to get distracted.

303
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,989
I had work to do.

304
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,408
And I didn't know
if you felt it, too.

305
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,162
What happened next?

306
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,038
You took me to Captain Janeway.

307
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,333
I explained the situation.

308
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,209
She didn't like the idea
of a stowaway

309
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,253
on her ship,
so she told you and Tuvok

310
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,964
to work with me
to flush him out.

311
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,508
And did we?

312
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,468
You keep trying
to jump to the end.

313
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,929
You're skipping
all the parts about us.

314
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,181
And you keep trying
to talk about your feelings.

315
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,641
I'd rather you
stick to the events,

316
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,601
not the emotions
surrounding them.

317
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,020
Why?

318
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,939
Does it make you uncomfortable?

319
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,359
I don't want to play this game.

320
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,110
I've been assigned
to talk to you<i> --</i>

321
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,864
to figure out whether or not
you're telling the truth.

322
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,116
Even if you are,
I have no memory of meeting you

323
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,077
and I certainly have no memory
of feeling anything for you.

324
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,746
You might remember
a relationship

325
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,082
between us,
but as far as I'm concerned,

326
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,586
it didn't exist.

327
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,880
I see.

328
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,931
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,810
I just want to make
it clear how I feel.

330
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,271
Of course.

331
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,982
Is there anything
I can do for you?

332
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,153
Can I have your pudding?

333
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,197
(<i> laughing</i> )

334
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,701
Gladly.

335
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,286
Then you're forgiven.

336
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,621
JANEWAY:
<i>Chakotay and Kellin,</i>

337
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,206
<i>report to the Bridge</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

338
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,625
It's the tracers.
They've found me.

339
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,554
We don't detect any ships.
I'm assuming these are

340
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,014
your people in cloaked vessels.

341
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,641
They've come
to take me back.

342
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,601
Harry, hail them.

343
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,643
They won't answer.

344
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,937
KIM:
She's right, captain.

345
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,731
No response.

346
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,691
Their weapons are going
through our shields

347
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,734
as if they weren't there.

348
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,360
Match shields to the frequency

349
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,528
of their
particle beams.

350
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,615
No effect.

351
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,951
Shield strength down to 29%.

352
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,911
They'll keep firing
until you surrender

353
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,705
or until I contact them
and agree to come back.

354
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,248
Do you still want to stay?

355
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,666
Yes.

356
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,294
All right.
Tom, get us out of here.

357
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,546
That last volley
damaged our propulsion systems.

358
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,381
We have thrusters only.

359
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,300
Captain, if you'll
let me have access

360
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,760
to your sensor systems

361
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,178
I can modify them
to detect the ships.

362
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,681
Do it.

363
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,391
This is the moment,
Chakotay.

364
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,018
Either we give her up
or we fire back.

365
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,061
Which one is it?

366
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,441
Fire.

367
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,276
I think you might be able
to detect them now

368
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,527
but only for
a minute or two.

369
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,779
Harry.

370
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,489
Affirmative.
Two heavily armed ships

371
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,698
off the port bow.

372
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,199
Can we get them on screen?

373
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,702
That's the best I can do.

374
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,125
JANEWAY:
Tuvok,

375
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,501
target their weapons systems.

376
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,211
Firing.

377
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,178
JANEWAY:
Well done.

378
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,097
Stand down red alert.

379
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,058
Well, it seems we've
granted you asylum.

380
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,685
Now you'll have to
give some thought

381
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,645
to what you want to do.

382
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,481
I'd prefer to remain on board.

383
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,691
Consider that carefully.

384
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,359
We're heading
for the alpha quadrant.

385
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,402
Before long, we will be
so far from your world,

386
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,654
that if you change your mind,

387
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,156
you wouldn't be able
to get back.

388
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,283
I won't change my mind,
but I must warn you--

389
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,619
the tracers won't give up
that easily.

390
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,454
Your ship is still at risk.

391
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,165
Nothing we haven't
faced before.

392
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,709
KELLIN:
I was only able to make
a temporary modification

393
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,210
to your sensors.

394
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,420
If you'd let me access
your Astrometric processors

395
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,631
I could make
that modification permanent.

396
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,257
You'll need a command
officer with you

397
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,426
to override
the security lockouts.

398
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,803
I can do that, Captain.

399
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,972
Go ahead.

400
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,934
Tom, coordinate
with Engineering

401
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,936
to get the propulsion systems
back on-line.

402
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,188
I'm on it, Captain.

403
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,325
We'll have to climb
up to deck ten.

404
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,120
Is something wrong?

405
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,793
I can't relax
until we're far enough away

406
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,214
that they realize
they can't get me back...

407
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,800
and to my knowledge,
that's never happened before.

408
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,469
There's always
a first time.

409
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,555
I have a high
security clearance.

410
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,224
They'll be afraid
I'm going to do

411
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,101
exactly what I'm about to do--

412
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,269
show<i> you</i> how to detect them.

413
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,773
Look at it this way.

414
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,109
If they do figure out
we can spot them,

415
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,777
they might realize they
aren't going

416
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,820
to be able to take you back.

417
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,785
You're such a kind person.

418
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,578
It's what
I remembered most.

419
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:35,419
It's what made me
turn around and come back.

420
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,838
And sometime...

421
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,800
you might be interested in...

422
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,219
hearing about
our last night together.

423
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,939
Evening, Commander.

424
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,983
Craving
a late-night snack?

425
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,152
No. Something
to help me sleep.

426
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,238
Got any ideas?

427
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,950
I know humans think
warm milk will do it.

428
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,660
Frankly, I find it repulsive.

429
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,120
I agree.

430
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,497
What's available
in the tea area?

431
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,208
Herbal is best.

432
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,544
I have several
Terran varieties, uh...

433
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,006
as well as some
more exotic blends.

434
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,883
Just mix me up whatever
you think is the most relaxing.

435
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,680
Problems?

436
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,226
Forgive me.
I wasn't trying to pry.

437
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,477
I know that.

438
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,189
I'm just not sure
how to answer you.

439
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,816
How's our guest
adapting to life on<i> Voyager?</i>

440
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,484
Quite well, I think.

441
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,986
She must be happy
to be here.

442
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,946
I'm sure she is.

443
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,910
Forgive me, Commander...

444
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,624
but sometimes it's best
to be straightforward.

445
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,085
It's obvious
how she feels about you--

446
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,086
to me, at least.

447
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,547
I see how she looks at you.

448
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:07,720
Might that be the source
of your consternation?

449
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,805
She says she, or rather, we,

450
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,183
fell in love when
she was here before.

451
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,767
Since I can't
remember any of that

452
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,020
I don't know if it's true

453
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,897
but somehow,
it's hard to believe.

454
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,815
Why is that?

455
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,816
I don't know.

456
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,735
It just doesn't seem like me.

457
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm still suspicious of her.

458
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,906
I don't know
if she's using me in some way

459
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,491
just for her own purposes.

460
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,994
You don't trust her.

461
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,621
Not really.

462
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,214
May I suggest...

463
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,175
that maybe it's yourself
you don't trust,

464
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,469
your own feelings
that you're afraid of.

465
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,889
Sweet dreams.

466
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,484
(<i> door chimes</i> )

467
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,414
I couldn't sleep.

468
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,665
I need to talk to you.

469
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,750
May I come in?

470
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,968
I was just wondering if you
still had doubts about me,

471
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,804
or if you believe what
I told you about us.

472
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,724
Your story seems
to have been verified.

473
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,102
I believe
you're telling the truth.

474
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,021
And the rest of it?

475
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,065
What about us?

476
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,409
I'm not one to hold back
as you may have noticed,

477
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,244
so I'll get to the point.

478
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,124
I came here because of you.

479
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,169
I knew you wouldn't
remember me,

480
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,420
but I was sure
we could regain

481
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,923
the feelings
we had before.

482
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,217
They were there...

483
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:14,221
and they were real...

484
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,890
but now I'm not so sure.

485
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:22,146
My being here puts
this ship at risk.

486
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,982
It's better for everyone
if I go back to Ramura.

487
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:31,489
So please be honest.

488
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:34,658
If you feel nothing for me...

489
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,952
just tell me...

490
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,704
and I'll leave.

491
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,503
Don't go.

492
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,683
(<i> both laughing</i> )

00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,394
It's called "ice cream"?

494
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,936
I'm surprised
you didn't have any

495
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,771
the last time you were here.

496
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:08,150
I could eat
this every day.

497
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,151
Then, you should.

498
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,861
(<i> chuckling</i> )

499
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,282
<i>Voyager's</i> a very...

500
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,575
powerful ship.

501
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,204
And very fast.

502
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,081
We've met people
with ships that are faster

503
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,623
and more powerful

504
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,667
but<i> Voyager's</i> always
managed to be a match

505
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,710
for the best of them.

506
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,259
Ramuran vessels are fast.

507
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,596
They could stay up
with this ship.

508
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,016
Kellin...

509
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,768
we'll keep you safe.

510
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,186
That's a promise.

511
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,064
A tracer never goes
home empty-handed.

512
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,567
The disgrace
would be too great.

513
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,984
When I was here before

514
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,362
I'd been tracking that
man for almost a year.

515
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,488
But you know all the tricks.

516
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,906
You can use them
against anyone

517
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,824
who tries to come after you.

518
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,207
You said
you were going to tell me

519
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,127
about our last night together.

520
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,169
Let me show you.

521
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,926
You were sitting here
in this chair...

522
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,555
and I...

523
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,224
was here.

524
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,185
And we were drinking
something with bubbles.

525
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,020
Champagne?

526
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,149
Yes. I wanted to celebrate.

527
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,734
I'd caught my runaway that day
with your help.

528
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,320
How was that?

529
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,364
You came up with the idea
of using a magneton sweep

530
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,241
to disrupt his
polarization cloak.

531
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:44,455
We knew he'd be watching me
closely so... we tricked him.

532
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,545
I'm sorry you didn't get
your fugitive.

533
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,172
He must have jumped
to another ship

534
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,091
while<i> Voyager</i> was in
orbit of Mikah last week.

535
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,759
I'll find him eventually.

00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,845
If you think we can be
of any more help, let me know.

00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,305
Thank you, Commander.

538
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,306
This is my problem.

539
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,641
I'll handle it from now on.

540
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:11,023
Just beam me back to my ship
and I'll backtrack to Mikah.

541
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,276
Goodbye and thank you again.

542
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,611
Ready to energize.

543
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,457
Hello, Resket.
You were a real challenge.

544
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,460
CHAKOTAY:
I haven't had the chance
to welcome you to<i> Voyager.</i>

545
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,047
Too bad you'll be
leaving so soon.

546
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,714
We put him in the brig.

547
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,592
Once I used
the neurolytic emitter on him,

548
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,802
he was only too happy
to be going home again.

549
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,388
"Neurolytic emitter"?

550
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,014
We use it on runaways.

551
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,685
It wipes their memories
of the outside world.

552
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,521
So we were celebrating?

553
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,399
You'd become much more than
a friend to me, but I knew

554
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,818
I had to go home, and you'd
forget about me within hours.

555
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,820
So I took the initiative.

556
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,156
More than usual?

557
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:05,118
Oh, yes.

558
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,120
I moved closer to you...

559
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:13,001
I thanked you profusely
for all your help,

560
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,337
told you that I couldn't
have done it without you...

561
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,555
and I touched you.

562
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:28,141
I told you I...
I cared very much for you...

563
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,354
and that I wanted something
to remember you by.

564
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,775
And then I did this...

565
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,884
That's when I knew
you felt the same way.

566
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,681
But it didn't matter
because I still had to go.

567
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,935
But now you don't.

568
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,828
If Kellin's going
to be with us

569
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,705
the Captain wants her
to serve a function--

570
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,206
to contribute in some way.

571
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,750
A reasonable expectation.

572
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,627
What are her skills?

573
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:39,797
Basically, she was a security
operative for her people.

574
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,465
She's a trained expert
in weaponry,

575
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,925
surveillance, fighting skills.

576
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,803
Any idea
where she might fit in?

577
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:49,055
Mr. Neelix could use
an assistant in the mess hall.

578
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,226
Tuvok, that was a joke.

579
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,395
Don't deny it--
you were trying to be funny.

580
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,939
If you choose to interpret
my remark as humorous,

581
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,358
that is your decision.

582
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,734
I do and it was.

583
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,528
It's perfectly logical.

584
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,197
All the qualities you mentioned
would help in defending Neelix

585
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,948
against the periodic
wrath of the crew.

586
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,492
(<i> laughs</i> )

587
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,661
Maybe so. But don't you
think she'd be better off,

588
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,663
as a member
of your security detail?

589
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,665
Perhaps. I'll assign
her to a team

590
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,333
and let her
observe for a week.

591
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,585
At the end of that time
I'll evaluate her situation.

592
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,170
Good enough.

593
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,089
Commander, I've been giving
some thought to the fact

594
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,634
that the Ramuran ships
might be in pursuit

595
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,926
and could attack us again.

596
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,928
I've given that
some thought myself.

597
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,096
Their proton weapons were

598
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,641
particularly effective
against us.

599
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,185
If Kellin would work
with Seven and Ensign Kim,

600
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,937
perhaps we could devise
a strategy to defend ourselves.

601
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,857
I'm sure she'd be happy
to do that.

602
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,818
Have her report
to Astrometrics at 1300 hours.

603
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,871
I've downloaded data
from our tactical logs.

604
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,622
You can access it
from this console.

605
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,961
Our weapons are
proton-based particle beams

606
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,881
very tightly focused.

607
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,383
It's like being hit with
thousands of needles.

608
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,843
They can penetrate
any shield

609
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,011
even if the modulations
are changed.

610
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,304
Very clever.

611
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,682
No defense has ever
stopped these weapons.

612
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,434
Then maybe we're
about to make history.

613
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,143
You've found a way
to counteract them?

614
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,520
I think so.

615
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,439
The trick is to scatter
those beams a little,

616
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,233
make it harder for them
to penetrate the shields.

617
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,736
I think we could do that
by tying the baryon sensors

618
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,946
into deflector control.
Here's what I have in mind.

619
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,490
Why don't you look this over
and let me know what you think?

620
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,033
I'll do it right away.

621
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,036
By the way, I hear Chakotay
recommended you to Tuvok

622
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,038
to serve on a security detail.

623
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,998
I want to help out
in some way.

624
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,834
A word of advice.
Volunteer for beta squad.

625
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:41,877
They're the best team.

626
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,044
You'll learn a lot from them.

627
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,212
I will. Thank you.

628
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,844
When you mentioned
Commander Chakotay's name

629
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,011
she flushed.

630
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,681
He did the same
when he saw her.

631
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,767
What are you saying?

632
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,852
I suspect the commander
and Kellin are engaged

633
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,479
in a courtship ritual.

634
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,148
It seems an unnecessary
and complicated precursor

635
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,608
to the act of procreation.

636
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,943
(<i> chuckles</i> )

637
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,445
I know you think so,
but trust me, 

638
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,697
some people
need those rituals.

639
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,283
Explain.

640
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,578
It's...it's usually
considered a good idea

641
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,497
if two people get to know
each other a little

642
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,208
before they become... intimate.

643
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,293
Why is that?

644
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,964
Because it's more comfortable.

645
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:30,049
Uh, you spend some time
together, you laugh, you talk.

646
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,803
And that makes it easier to...

647
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,346
to get closer.

648
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,223
But the end result is the same,
is it not?

649
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,934
Well, I guess so.

650
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,312
Then I fail to see what is
accomplished by all the talk.

651
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,815
Seven, if you don't get it,
then I can't explain it to you.

652
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,107
Obviously.

653
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,824
I should have known.
They must have gotten somebody

654
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:36,992
on board during the battle.

655
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,451
You're jumping
to conclusions.

656
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,580
No. There's a tracer.
He's here, he's come for me.

657
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,040
That broken vase
was a warning.

658
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,499
We'll protect you.

659
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,292
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

660
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,169
It's too late.
No!

661
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,713
We can use
the same magneton sweep

662
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,130
we used to flush out Resket.

663
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,132
We'll find this one
and send him on his way.

664
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,509
(<i> energy crackling</i> )

665
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,762
I'm afraid
I can't let that happen.

666
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:57,888
Curneth, don't.

667
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,056
Chakotay to Security.

668
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,933
Intruder alert,
my quarters.

669
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:04,686
Please, I beg you,
don't do this.

670
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,188
You know better
than to ask that, Kellin.

671
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,815
No!

672
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,109
CHAKOTAY:
Drop it! Drop it!

673
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,528
You're too late.

674
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,363
She's already
beginning to forget

675
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,074
everything that's happened here.

676
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,327
(<i> gasping lightly</i> )

677
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,732
The doctor says
there's nothing he can do.

678
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,318
Your recent memories
have already begun to fade.

679
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,612
Don't let this happen,
please.

680
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,322
Don't let this happen.

681
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,492
Do you have any idea
how we can reverse the effect?

682
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,748
Promise me...

683
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,584
if I forget why I'm here,

684
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,212
if I forget you...

685
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,507
do what I did...

686
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:20,303
and you'll tell me
all about us...

687
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,849
and you'll help me to remember.

688
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:28,103
I will, but I'm going
to try to do more than that.

689
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,662
Can the effects
of the neurolytic emitter

690
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,080
be reversed?

691
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,165
Reversed?

692
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,625
I have no idea.

693
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,211
As far as I know,
no one's ever tried.

694
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,838
Then I'll be the first.

695
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,173
Tell me how the emitter works,

696
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,591
how it affects
the memory centers.

697
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,136
You sound desperate,
Commander.

698
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,722
Does Kellin mean
that much to you?

699
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,850
What you're doing is wrong;
She wants to stay here.

700
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,560
This is futile.

701
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,312
Even if I knew
how the emitter works

702
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,647
I wouldn't tell you.

703
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,662
You have no right
to do this.

704
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,414
I have every right.

705
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,334
The laws on our world
are very specific about that.

706
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,878
No one may leave.

707
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,005
No one may reveal
anything about us

708
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,590
to the outside world.

709
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,467
Kellin has violated
both of those edicts.

710
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,386
Returning her will
serve as a deterrent

711
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,056
to others who might
think of leaving.

712
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,433
Did it ever occur to you

713
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,393
that the fact that
so many people want to leave

714
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,645
might mean there's something
wrong with your society?

715
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,315
We have a strong
and cohesive society

716
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,318
because of our efforts
to keep it that way.

717
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,529
A few runaways among millions

718
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,948
hardly indicates a problem.

719
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:06,492
If there are so few...

720
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,870
why not let them go?

721
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:13,125
That would suggest that
we don't care about them.

722
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,710
What a terrible message.

723
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,630
You may have wiped her memory,
but Kellin's not going back.

724
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,259
Maybe we should wait
and see if that's what happens.

725
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:25,678
She made it clear to me
that she wants to stay here.

726
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,264
So maybe you
should start practicing

727
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,224
what you're going
to tell your superiors.

728
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,656
(<i> sighs</i> )

729
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,700
Yes?

730
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,539
(<i> door opening</i> )

731
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,500
The doctor told me
he'd released you.

732
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,793
How are you feeling?

733
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,504
I'm fine.

734
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,922
Do I know you?

735
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,509
Yes.

736
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,344
At least, you did.

737
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,890
You'll have to forgive me,

738
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,143
but I don't remember
how I got here

739
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,353
or anything else
that's happened

740
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,729
in at least
the past few weeks.

741
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,064
I know.

742
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,734
I hope I wasn't
throwing things

743
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,111
in a fit of rage.

744
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,696
No.

745
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,741
I assume a tracer
is here to take me back.

746
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,327
That's right.

747
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,620
But...

748
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,502
what I'm going to say
will sound strange,

749
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,385
but it's what you
asked me to do

750
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,928
before you lost
your memories.

751
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,056
You came here
about a month ago

752
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,598
looking for a runaway.

753
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:57,145
After you left with him,
you decided to come back.

754
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,147
But if I finished
my assignment,

755
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,398
why would I come back here?

756
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,691
Because...

757
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,653
you'd fallen
in love with me.

758
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,911
Forgive me.
You're certainly attractive,

759
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,913
but what you're telling me

760
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,622
seems very unlikely.

761
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,001
But it's what happened.

762
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,879
We started to
work together...

763
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,632
and I began to realize
how unique you are.

764
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:30,595
Before long, I couldn't
get you out of my mind.

765
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:34,140
Are you saying that you fell
in love with me as well?

766
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,684
Yes.

767
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,021
And then we realized
the tracer was on board.

768
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,357
After he used
the emitter on you,

769
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,442
you made me promise
to tell you all of this

770
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,444
so you would know what
happened between us.

771
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,366
This is a little unsettling.

772
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,287
What is it
you want from me?

773
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,749
Kellin,

774
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,252
don't go back
with the tracer.

775
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:05,713
Stay here for a while,
at least for a few days.

776
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:10,593
We can get to know
each other again.

777
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,097
I honestly can't imagine
what would be served by that.

778
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,390
I have to go home.

779
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,559
If you stayed...

780
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,396
you might change
your mind.

781
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,772
Then that's
all the more reason

782
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,608
that I should leave now.

783
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,820
I've violated one
of our most important edicts...

784
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,074
and I wouldn't want
to make that mistake again.

785
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,539
I wish...

786
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,465
I wish we had met
under different circumstances.

787
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,365
(<i> sighs</i> )

788
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,991
Your ship's ready.

789
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,951
Thank you, Commander.

790
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,828
I've implanted
a computer virus

791
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,039
to eliminate any reference
to our being here.

792
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,248
By tomorrow afternoon

793
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,875
you'll have forgotten
everything.

794
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,503
It will be as though
we never existed.

795
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:27,962
It's better that way.

796
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,964
You're such a kind person.

797
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,635
I won't forget that.

798
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,179
I wish you both the best.

799
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,035
Energize.

800
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:14,259
<i>First officer's personal log,</i>
<i>stardate 51813.4.</i>

801
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,928
<i>Maybe it would be best,</i>
<i>as the tracer said,</i>

802
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:20,181
<i>to forget about Kellin</i>
<i>and the time she spent here</i>

803
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,766
<i>but I don't want to do that.</i>

804
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,436
<i>I want to remember.</i>

805
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,354
More coffee, Commander?

806
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,564
No, thanks.

807
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,731
I'm almost done.

808
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,985
Mmm.
Strange to see you using

809
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,905
those ancient
writing implements.

810
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,990
Ah, it's the only way
I could get a permanent record

811
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,785
of what's happened
in the last few days.

812
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,037
I want to get it down
before I forget it all.

813
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,624
I'm sorry things
didn't work out for you.

814
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,836
(<i> sighs</i> )

815
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,672
I've been trying
to make sense of it.

816
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,966
I fell in love with her twice.

817
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,135
I thought she could do the same.

818
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,721
We were the same two people
on the same ship.

819
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,099
Why didn't it happen again?

820
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,602
I keep going over and over
our last conversation,

821
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,061
trying to think if there was

822
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:12,233
something I could have said,
could have done...

823
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,734
but nothing comes to mind.

824
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,321
Commander, I don't think
you can analyze love.

825
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,700
It's the greatest mystery
of all.

826
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,120
No one knows why it happens
or doesn't.

827
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,956
Love is a chance combination
of elements.

828
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:30,168
Any one thing might be enough
to keep it from igniting.

829
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,045
A mood, a glance...

830
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,339
a remark.

831
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,427
And if we could define love...

832
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,429
predict it...

833
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,182
it would probably lose
its power.

834
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,227
I'll let you finish.

835
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,107
Good night.
