1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,838
(<i> engine rumbling,</i>
<i>horn honking</i> )

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,172
Get out of the way!

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,466
(<i> horn honking</i> )

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,968
Oh.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,302
Whoa. Easy, now.

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,220
Whoo.

7
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,931
(<i> horn honking</i> )

8
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,557
(<i> sheep bleating</i> )

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,809
Hey, watch out!

10
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,686
Come on. Come on.

11
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,395
Sorry.

12
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,064
Tommy, me boy...

13
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,779
Did you hurt yourself,
Tommy-Boy?

14
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,489
(<i> grunts</i> )

15
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,491
I think I zigged when
I should have zagged.

16
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,160
Well, maybe you ought
to stick to a horse
and carriage.

17
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,120
Still, she's a beauty.

18
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,499
The world must
be treating you well
to afford such a thing.

19
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,041
(<i> chuckles</i> )

20
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,919
Just dipping into
my inheritance.

21
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,254
Oh, come into some money,
did you?

22
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,840
So who's passed on?

23
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,926
Um, my grandfather
on my mother's side.

24
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,637
An aristocrat,
God rest his soul.

25
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,848
Sounds like he was a fine man.

26
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,599
I'd drink a toast to him,

27
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,935
if I had a shilling
to me name.

28
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,478
(<i> laughs</i> )

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,189
Here. It's on me.

30
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,317
It'll take three pints
to do a proper job, Tommy-Boy.

31
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,362
And this isn't
even enough for two.

32
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,280
There. That's
all I've got.

33
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,034
You're a generous man.
Care to join me
at Sullivan's?

34
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,787
Ah, I wish I could,
but I'm on my way
to Castle O'Dell.

35
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,581
Night's coming.

36
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,083
And they say
when the sun goes down,

37
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:27,629
the queen of the faerie folk
reclaims the castle.

38
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,130
Ah.

39
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,632
I'll give her
your regards.

40
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,593
Don't say
I didn't warn ya.

41
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,556
Computer,

42
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,018
replace
damaged tire.

43
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,607
Saints preserve us.

44
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,638
I thought I would die
from the shock of it.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,264
Now, Seamus, you're
not a great one

46
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,850
for telling things
the way they were.

47
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,685
I'll admit I've been known

48
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,645
to add a little color
to stories from time to time

49
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,940
to liven things up,
but with God as my witness

50
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,027
I saw Tom Paris using
unnatural powers

51
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,487
to fix that
wheel of his.

52
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,782
Tommy-Boy practicing
unholy magic?

53
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,077
Next thing you'll
be telling me is

54
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,037
you want to pay
for your own drinks.

55
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,790
Make fun if you like,
but he was heading

56
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,961
up to Castle O'Dell
only an hour before dark.

57
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,047
Oh, leave it
alone, Seamus.

58
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,340
Can't one day go by
without you making
an ass of yourself?

59
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,885
Mm.
But that Tom Paris
is an odd one.

60
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,637
Coming and going
through town as if
he built the place.

61
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,099
That's right,
and where does he go?

62
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,352
Oh, he's a shifty one,
and for that matter,
so are his friends.

63
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,939
If you're talking
about Katie O'Clare,
you better watch your mouth.

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,149
Oh. Well, you know what
they say, Sullivan--

65
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,068
birds of a feather...

66
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,822
They also say superstition
is the religion of fools.

67
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,034
Kilmanin, 1846.

68
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,410
What?

69
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,537
Old Patsy
down in County Meath

70
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,664
spoke of a band
of spirit folk

71
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,500
who came
to Kilmanin in '46.

72
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,044
Kilmanin?

73
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,213
Did you ever hear
of it, Doc?

74
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,881
No, this is the first.

75
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,759
Ah, but you won't
find it on any map.

76
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,139
Not anymore.

77
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,141
It was a town
not much different
than Fair Haven.

78
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,477
That is, until this group
of strangers arrived.

79
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,897
The townsfolk welcomed them
with open arms.

80
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,819
After all, a stranger
is just a friend
you haven't met yet.

81
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,989
But they regretted their
hospitality soon enough.

82
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,907
The cows stopped
giving milk.

83
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,910
The potatoes grew
rotten in the ground.

84
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,745
Then people started
to go missing.

85
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,206
Oh, go on.
It's true.

86
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,749
What happened
to them?

87
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,334
They were taken...

88
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,670
(<i> whispers</i> ):
to the otherworld.

89
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,672
SEAMUS:
When winter came

90
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:44,385
and the nights grew longer,
the entire town vanished,

91
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,221
every post,
every nail--

92
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:51,726
poof-- into thin air,
never to be seen again.

93
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:56,106
Are you suggesting
that Fair Haven's going
to go the way of Kilmanin

94
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,192
just because we have
a few new folks in town?

95
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,321
I'm suggesting you keep an eye
on Tom Paris and his cohorts.

96
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,865
Not to mention
that lady friend of yours.

97
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,617
So Katie's some kind of
goblin now, is that it?

98
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,453
She's certainly cast
a spell on you.

99
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,580
Well, if you ask me...

100
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,874
(<i> throat clearing</i>
<i>and shushing)</i>

101
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,459
Katie!
Am I interrupting?

102
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,878
Aw, just some nonsense.

103
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,671
Seamus is up
to his old tricks again.

104
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,548
Good day to you, Katie.
Oh, it's good to see you.

105
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,842
What'll it be?
The usual, please.

106
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,136
Well, one cup of tea
coming right up.

107
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,637
Did you snatch
any children

108
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,181
on the way
into town, Katie?

109
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,682
JANEWAY:
What?

110
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,684
Never mind.

111
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,353
I missed your smile.

112
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,979
What have you been
doing with yourself?

113
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,647
Nothing terribly exciting.

114
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,816
Just helping my aunt
and uncle out on the farm.

115
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,069
They're not as spry
as they used to be.

116
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,862
Although, they've got
a goat that could argue

117
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,031
Mossie Donegan's talking pig
under the table.

118
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,491
You'll have to
bring him into the bar
the next time you're up.

119
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,868
We'll arrange a debate.

120
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,828
I'll see that I do.

121
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,289
I hear they opened
a nickelodeon in Dooleen.

122
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,333
I thought it might be nice
to go to a show.

123
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,085
I've got to
tend the bar.

124
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,920
I wish you'd let me
know you were coming.

125
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,546
I would've made
arrangements.
That's all right.

126
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,173
We can go
some other time.

127
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,799
No, I mean, you've
already made the trip.

128
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,718
It'd be a shame if
you have to leave.

129
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,388
Well, I could be
convinced to stay

130
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,266
if you'd be up
for a game of... rings.

131
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,017
(<i> laughs</i> )

132
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,727
Let's go.

133
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,360
Computer, one dozen
Broadway lilies.

134
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,368
Something tells me
that's not lunch.

135
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,452
Already ate.

136
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,745
Ah. Who are they for?

137
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,330
A friend.

138
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,292
Oh, and this friend
wouldn't happen to be

139
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,501
a lovely Irish lass,
now, would she?

140
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,045
Aren't you due
on the Bridge?

141
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,964
Ah, you better watch
yourself, Harry.

142
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,425
These country girls aren't
as simple as you think.

143
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,928
Maggie O'Halloran
could be a little more
than you can handle.

144
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,306
I heard about your
little traffic accident.

145
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,016
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
That was a clutch
malfunction.

146
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,435
It wasn't my fault.

147
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,145
If you ask me,
that whole program

148
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,188
is an accident
waiting to happen.

149
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,607
You have been running
Fair Haven around the clock.

150
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,693
Just yesterday,
I had to replace
three holo-emitters.

151
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,779
I ran a full diagnostic
this morning.

152
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,114
Everything is fine.

153
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,032
Whatever you say.

154
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,077
But when your quaint,
little seaside town

155
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,998
starts to depolarize,
don't come running to me.

156
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,418
If you'll excuse me,
I'm late for a moonlight stroll.

157
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,128
Are you sure you
don't need a chaperon?

158
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,587
(<i> laughs</i> )

159
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,131
Not with your driving record.

160
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,175
(<i> chuckles</i> )

161
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,052
I think I know just
what'll make his date

162
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,055
just a<i> little</i>
<i>more interesting.</i>

163
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:38,726
Just don't blow out
any more holo-emitters.

164
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,249
What are we doing
out here, Seamus,

165
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,543
skulking about in the
dark, spying on folks?

166
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,961
What's the
matter, Milo?

167
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,254
You got a case
of the willies?

168
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,922
Well, what if
you're right?

169
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,008
What if this Tom Paris
is some kind of demon?

170
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,386
If we're caught, he'll
cast a spell on us.

171
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,513
Then stop your squawking
or he'll catch us for sure.

172
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,306
Come on, man.
He's getting away.

173
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,640
Ah.

174
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,479
A captain is only as good
as his crew.

175
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,064
It must be lonely
out there on the sea

176
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,525
with only the
stars to guide you.

177
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,361
Sometimes,
during the night watch,

178
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,654
with the timbers creaking,
and the dark water

179
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,032
stretching out as far
as the eye can see,

180
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,535
you can believe you're
the only man in the world.

181
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,913
Maybe you should think
about settling
down on dry land.

182
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,581
Well, believe me, I do.

183
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,333
As often
as I think of you.

184
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,335
MAGGIE:
Can I ask you
something, Harry?

185
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,669
KIM:
Of course.

186
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,672
Would you like
to hold my hand?

187
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,550
If you promise
to hold mine back.

188
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,051
(<i> groans</i> )

189
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,683
Look. He's got some sort
of contraption in his hand.

190
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,228
Ooh, maybe we're going
about this the wrong way.

191
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,313
We should go down
to St. Mary's

192
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,190
and tell Father Mulligan
the whole story.

193
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,443
He's not going to listen
to talk of the supernatural.

194
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,319
Aw, if you fill
his collection box,

195
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,737
he'll listen
to anything.

196
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,239
That's true.

197
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,408
I thought you were
promised to Ray Ewan.

198
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,118
Not anymore.
Ah.

199
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,827
Can I ask you
something else, Harry?

200
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,121
Please.

201
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,663
Would you like
to kiss me?

202
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,332
Is that a trick question?

203
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,669
(<i> gasps</i> )
(<i> moos</i> )

204
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,090
Holy Mother of God!

205
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,259
(<i> laughs</i> )

206
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,344
Tom!

207
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,013
(<i> Tom laughing</i> )

208
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,433
KIM:
Don't you have
anything better to do?

209
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,603
PARIS:
Oh, boy.
She really turned on you.

210
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,187
KIM:
Ha-ha, very funny.

211
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,688
I could have
been trampled.

212
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,191
Relax. The holodeck
safeties are on.

213
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,652
There's nothing
to worry about.
Poor Maggie.

214
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,904
All right, all right.
You've had your fun.
Now change her back.

215
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,490
Chakotay to Paris and Kim.

216
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,740
Report to the Bridge.

217
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,200
On our way.

218
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,577
(<i> laughs</i> )

219
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,869
What about Maggie?

220
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,997
She'll be fine.
Let her graze.

221
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,666
Did you hear that?
Ah!

222
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,506
CONGREGATION:
Amen.

223
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,132
DOCTOR:
Please be seated.

224
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,934
I recently heard a tale
of two farmers,

225
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,062
who shall remain nameless
for the sake of this sermon.

226
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,566
It seems one broke
the other's plow
and refused to replace it.

227
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,986
His comeuppance was served
to him not by the hand of God

228
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,696
but by the other farmer,
in the form

229
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,325
of a clogged irrigation ditch.

230
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:45,038
Now, do you think
their disagreement
stopped there?

231
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,747
Of course not.

232
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,626
They go on...

233
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,337
just as the heathen did of old.

234
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,298
After all, one spiteful act
deserves another, right?

235
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,467
(<i> murmuring agreement</i> )
Wrong!

236
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,928
What these sinners
have forgotten

237
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,223
is that they are neighbors.

238
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,517
He's in love with the sound
of his own voice.

239
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,477
DOCTOR:
Whether we are man or woman,

240
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,187
parent or child...

241
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,523
flesh and blood
or photons and force fields...

242
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,442
(<i> murmuring</i> )
It has been said...

243
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,821
On the other hand,
perhaps he's been nipping
at the sacramental wine.

244
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,617
And, as such,
our community is everything.

245
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,704
It is our world,
and we are a part of it

246
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:29,624
just as a branch
is part of a tree.

247
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,921
Do you see... branches
tearing leaves off one another?

248
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,215
No!
Do you see

249
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,842
roots hoarding water
from the trunk?

250
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,136
No!
Do you see...?

251
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,180
(<i> cow moos</i> )
SEAMUS:
Easy, Maggie.

252
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,349
Whoa.

253
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,475
(<i> murmuring</i> )

254
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,809
Oh. Easy now.

255
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,311
(<i> moos, bell clanking</i> )

256
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,770
Did you make a wrong turn

257
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,232
on your way
to the milking shed?

258
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,401
Oh, nothing like that
at all, Father.

259
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,445
Something terrible's
happened.

260
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,904
DOCTOR:
What now?

261
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,323
This was
Maggie O'Halloran.

262
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,910
The spirits
have turned her
into a cow.

263
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,372
Maggie O'Halloran's
been eaten by a cow?

264
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,249
Did you see these spirits?

265
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,584
That we did--

266
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,211
Tom Paris
and Harry Kim.

267
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,004
(<i> sighs, cow moos</i> )

268
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,299
I hate to disappoint you,
but it sounds as though

269
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,301
you've been the victim
of a practical joke.

270
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,720
Tom Paris is a known prankster.

271
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,389
(<i> voice shaking</i> ):
Oh... it was unholy magic,
I tell you.

272
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,683
Aye, aye.
We saw it
with our own eyes.

273
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,521
When did this alleged
transformation take place?

274
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,023
Last night.
Well, then,
that settles it.

275
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,318
This couldn't possibly be
Maggie O'Halloran.

276
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,819
I saw Maggie this morning
on my way into church.

277
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,947
She was at her cart
tending her flowers.

278
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,240
She's probably there now.

279
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,408
(<i> cow moos loudly</i> )

280
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,951
Well, I... I think

281
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,411
that's enough excitement
for one morning.

282
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,579
This mass is over.

283
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,289
Go in peace.

284
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,166
Um... leave the cow.

285
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,709
Oh...

286
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,336
All right, Father.

287
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,712
Excuse us, Maggie.

288
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,297
Take care,
Maggie.

289
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,470
Whoa.

290
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,684
Maggie...

291
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,352
Well, good morning, boys.

292
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,103
Is everything all right?

293
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,690
Y-you're looking a little
out of sorts this morning.

294
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,276
Yes. Well, I must admit
I'm not quite myself today.

295
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,488
Oh?
Well, this is going
to sound very odd,

296
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,616
but I feel like I just woke up
from the strangest dream,

297
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,618
and I don't remember going
to sleep.

298
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,870
You're right, that
does sound odd.

299
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,499
Do you remember anything
about last night?

300
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,376
Well, I was out
with Harry Kim.

301
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,294
He chatted me up
at The Ox and Lamb,

302
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,630
and we were off on a
walk before I knew it.

303
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,215
What did you do on your walk?

304
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,800
We talked.

305
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,926
What kind of a girl
do you think I am?

306
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,888
Now, Maggie,
we weren't implying anything.

307
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,473
No!
Do you recall

308
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,393
anything else
about the evening?

309
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,855
Ah, did anything out of the, um,
ordinary happen?

310
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,398
Anything at all?

311
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,483
I don't remember.

312
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,737
Well, tell us
about the dream, then.

313
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,988
Oh, it was
most unpleasant.

314
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,574
I was walking
around town

315
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,784
with nothing but a
bell around my neck.

316
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,661
Well, somehow, I
wound up in church.

317
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,038
Everyone was staring
at me.

318
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,498
You were there,
Seamus...

319
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,000
And you,
too, Milo.

320
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,086
The next thing I knew,
I was tending my flowers

321
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,423
just as you
boys walked up.

322
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,634
Well, that's
quite a story, Maggie.

323
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,636
Can we get a quick one?

324
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,680
Maybe just a wee taste.

325
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,394
So, I said to young Harry,

326
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,021
"I'm not one for rainy days
and gray skies."

327
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,232
As soon as the words were
out of my mouth,

328
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,818
he called up the spirits
to do his bidding.

329
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,987
A second later,
there wasn't a cloud in the sky.

330
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,198
I was up near Ballahick farm
with little Mary.

331
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,117
She was playing
near the well.

332
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,411
Somehow, she lost her footing
and fell in.

333
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,830
I was so frightened.
I didn't know what to do.

334
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,583
So, I ran to the Colbys'
to get some help...

335
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,627
but... when
we returned,

336
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,670
there was Mary
in the meadow,

337
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,005
talking with
Katie O'Clare.

338
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,717
There wasn't a
scratch on her.

339
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,720
Katie said
I must've been mistaken
when I saw her fall.

340
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,722
There was
no mistake.

341
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,725
WOMAN:
I saw something
strange, too.

342
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,518
Well, I hesitated
to say anything

343
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,479
for fear
you'd think me mad.

344
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,231
But after listening
to your stories today,

345
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,776
I feel you've a right
to know.

346
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,236
Well? Speak up.

347
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,240
Last Sunday,
after his sermon,

348
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:36,036
I saw Father Mulligan
vanish into thin air.

349
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,331
(<i> sighs</i> ):
He's one of them,
right enough.

350
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,083
Father Mulligan, Tommy-Boy,
Katie and the rest--

351
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,919
they're spirit folk.

352
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,880
What about that Neelix fellow
who runs The Ox and Lamb?

353
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,883
Well, if he doesn't
look like a leprechaun,
I don't know who does.

354
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,178
They're all probably
up at Castle O'Dell,
conspiring against us.

355
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,848
Now...
that's enough.

356
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,809
I can't deny there's been
some unusual goings-on.

357
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,770
But what are you proposing--
that we run Katie
and her friends out of town?

358
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,856
Or maybe we should line them up
in front of a firing squad--

359
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,440
is<i> that</i> what
you want?

360
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,651
These people
have been
our neighbors.

361
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,361
We've become friends.

362
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,070
Let's not forget that.

363
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,448
Well, we can't just
sit here and do nothing

364
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,909
while they take
over Fair Haven.

365
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,077
I'm not saying we do nothing...

366
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,790
but let's go about this
like civilized people.

367
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,416
What do you suggest--

368
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,920
we sit them down
and discuss it over tea?

369
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,105
You're looking lovelier
than ever, Katie.

370
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,357
Thank you.

371
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,946
Open it.

372
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,913
<i>"The Faerie Queene</i>
<i>by Edmund Spenser."</i>

373
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,664
Thank you, Michael.

374
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,583
It's the longest poem
in the English language,

375
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,669
and the first to use
a nine-line stanza.

376
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,422
I'll start
reading it tonight.
I love epic poetry.

377
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,383
Really?
I didn't know that.

378
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,510
(<i> sighs</i> )

379
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,931
It seems as if there's
a lot of things
I don't know about you.

380
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,433
I thought you'd
want to know

381
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,769
there's been some talk
about you and your friends.

382
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,439
Strange things have been
happening around town.

383
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,733
Folk are saying you're to blame.

384
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,360
What kind of strange things?

385
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,030
People using unholy magic...

386
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,407
vanishing into thin air...

387
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,284
changing the weather.

388
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,869
By any chance,

389
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,746
would all of this
have anything to do

390
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,873
with your reading suggestion?

391
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,249
As a matter of fact.

392
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,918
Don't tell me.

393
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,587
They say
<i>I'm</i> the "Faerie Queene."

394
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,633
Frankly, they could tell me
you're the devil himself,
and I wouldn't care.

395
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,552
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
I'll try not to
take that personally.

396
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,555
The sad truth of
the matter is...

397
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,100
<i>I</i> don't know
who you are.

398
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,477
What do you mean?

399
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,271
You've been lying to me, Katie.

400
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,189
I've been doing
some checking

401
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,358
with friends of mine
in County Clare.

402
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,611
Seems nobody's heard
of you there.

403
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,488
It's a big county.

404
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,657
And I've got a lot of friends.

405
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,494
You've been evasive
from the day we met.

406
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,663
I was a fool not to see it.

407
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,125
Where do you go
when you leave here?

408
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,419
There've been times I wanted
to talk to you--

409
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,547
tell you about my day,
about a book I'd read...

410
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,299
just to say
hello...

411
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,844
but I can't,

412
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,971
because I don't know
where to find you.

413
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,725
What are you hiding, Katie?

414
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,396
I'll admit I have misled you
about some things,

415
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,899
but never
about anything important.

416
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,277
And I wasn't lying
when I said I care about you.

417
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,905
I wish I could believe that.

418
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,782
You can.

419
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,868
I didn't want to deceive you...

420
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,164
but under the circumstances,
I had no choice.

421
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,166
What circumstances?

422
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,667
Michael...

423
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,586
there are things about me

424
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,048
you may not be able
to understand.

425
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,757
Try me.

426
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,470
Who are you, Katie?

427
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,389
Where are you
really from?

428
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,100
The truth.

429
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,863
Computer, end program.

430
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,914
How did he know?
Those are questions

431
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,874
no holodeck character
should be asking.

432
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,751
What exactly did you
do to that program?

433
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,212
Well, I, I just added a few
bells and whistles

434
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,463
to make the characters
more realistic.
Nothing too fancy.

435
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,008
Well, something's
gone wrong. The people
of Fair Haven

436
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,011
aren't simple country
folk anymore. Report.

437
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,055
It looks like we've
worn out our welcome.

438
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,723
It's the first time
we've tried running

439
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,100
a holodeck program
nonstop.

440
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,601
We're lucky it lasted
this long.

441
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,019
There are damaged
subroutines

442
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,562
in all of the
character files.

443
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,232
So much for my
open door policy.

444
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,818
Shut it down and repair
the damaged systems.

445
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,949
As I recall,
everything was fine

446
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,534
until someone started
turning people into cows.

447
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,411
(<i> chuckles</i> )

448
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,124
Computer, display Fair Haven
character Michael Sullivan.

449
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,834
Tom.

450
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,297
Where am I?
Where's Katie?

451
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,758
He shouldn't be aware
that he's in the lab.

452
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,468
I've isolated
the damaged subroutines.

453
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,178
I said where the hell am I?!

454
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,388
I-it's all right, Michael.
Take it easy.

455
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,933
What is this place?
Try to relax.

456
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,936
If someone doesn't tell me
where I am, I'm going
to start busting heads.

457
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,729
His perceptual filters
are malfunctioning.

458
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,648
What are you saying?
What's a perceptual filter?

459
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,734
I-it's o... it's okay.
We're trying to help you.

460
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,360
There.

461
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,487
Look at these.

462
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,780
Those are the algorithms

463
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,531
designed to keep
him oblivious

464
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,492
to anything outside
the program's parameters.

465
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,701
They're off-line.

466
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,287
Give me a minute.

467
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,664
That should do it.

468
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,791
How are you
feeling, Michael?

469
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,336
Never better.

470
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,840
Harry, Liam's been looking
for you.

471
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,341
You're the only man
in four counties

472
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,759
to beat him at
arm wrestling.

473
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,261
He wants a rematch.

474
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,595
Tell him he's got one.

475
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,972
I'll do that.

476
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,265
(<i> chuckles</i> )

477
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,391
That was easy enough.

478
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,477
Yeah. Unfortunately,
it looks like all
the other characters

479
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,146
have the same malfunction.

480
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,814
Don't tell me we're going
to have to go through

481
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,732
every one of them?

482
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,609
If we reactivate
the program,

483
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,903
use the primary
control port
in Sullivan's pub,

484
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,072
we could reset all
the perceptual filters

485
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,657
with a single
command sequence.

486
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,035
Ah. I guess we'll be
seeing you later.

487
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,995
Looking forward to it.

488
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,332
Computer, resume
Fair Haven program
in Holodeck 1,

489
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,375
and transfer
Michael Sullivan
back to his bar.

490
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,893
Danny!
Danny, come here.

491
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,312
Fetch Doc Fitzgerald.

492
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,813
Tell him to meet me
in the church.

493
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,481
Go on, hurry, lad.

494
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,529
We thought we'd reset
his perceptual filters,

495
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,990
until we took a closer look
at his subroutines.

496
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,909
Turns out he was just
playing along.

497
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,953
Ha. Never underestimate
an Irish hologram.

498
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,664
We'll have to
reprogram Michael
when we do the others.

499
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:39,043
Let's just hope he
didn't share the experience
with too many others.

500
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,755
Got it. These
resequenced algorithms
should do the trick.

501
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,131
Good luck.

502
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,012
What the hell
was I thinking?

503
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,805
A minor malfunction.

504
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,432
Well, that's the problem.

505
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,643
I've got a boyfriend
who malfunctions.

506
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,730
Tom and Harry'll fix him.
And if they can't?

507
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,733
One piece of advice
you've always given me--

508
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,235
tell the truth.

509
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,862
Hate to break the news
to you, Michael,

510
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,614
but I'm a starship Captain,

511
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,617
and you're a 300 deciwatt
holodeck program.

512
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,327
I couldn't do it.

513
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,497
In that case...
you'll have to get creative.

514
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,086
I'm not a
superstitious man, Doc,

515
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,130
but I've been seeing things
I can't explain.

516
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,048
You're not the only one.

517
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,427
At first I thought we had
an epidemic on our hands.

518
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,845
But this is no fever.
No, it's not.

519
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,847
Last night, I was
talking to Katie,
and the next thing I knew,

520
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,142
I was being spirited away
to God knows where.

521
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,935
They took you? Where?

522
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,354
Maybe it was the otherworld.
I don't know.

523
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,815
Tom Paris was there.
Young Harry, too.

524
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,109
What did they
want with you?
I'm not sure.

525
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,736
They were talking about me
like I wasn't there.

526
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,030
Saying things
about Fair Haven--

527
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,158
that we knew too much
about them.

528
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,243
Oh, Lord.
And that's not all.

529
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,330
They were saying something
about coming to the pub tonight

530
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,623
to change the town somehow.

531
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,958
What does that mean?

532
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,751
I'm damned if I know.

533
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,878
How did you get away?

534
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,548
With all the talk
about us knowing
too much about them,

535
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,509
I figured that if I pretended
nothing was out of the ordinary,

536
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,262
they might let me go.

537
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,182
And sure enough, that's
exactly what they did.

538
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,560
I wonder if this is how
things started in Kilmanin

539
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,480
back in '46.

540
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,857
I'm not sure what
they have in mind.

541
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,775
But we'd better
be prepared.

542
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,333
We're in luck.

543
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,001
Nobody's home.

544
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,855
SEAMUS:
If we're going to fight them,

545
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,233
we've got to use
the right ammunition.

546
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,069
Biddy Ramsey gave me this
before she passed on.

547
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,864
She knew a thing or two
about fairy magic
and how to fight it.

548
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,409
Everything she learned,
she learned from this book.

549
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,494
I doubt if it says anything
about using rifles.

550
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,705
You'd be surprised
how many things
a bullet will stop.

551
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,707
I don't like this one bit.

552
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,583
Guns, Seamus.

553
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,295
Under normal circumstances,
I'd agree with you, Michael...

554
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,672
but these aren't
normal circumstances.

555
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,758
Maybe you'd still like us
to be acting civilized.

556
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,343
Where did that
get you before?

557
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,345
A ticket to the
otherworld, that's what.

558
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:39,056
Now, we don't know
what the spirit folk
have in store for us.

559
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,309
That's just it.
We don't know much
about anything, do we?

560
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,729
And we've got Milo here
acting like a holy war
has been declared.

561
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,567
Relax, Sullivan.
The rifles are only
a last resort.

562
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:53,195
Besides,
we've got incantations,

563
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:57,074
which are more lethal
to spirit folk than any
weapons forged by man.

564
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,494
That's how we're going
to force them back
into their realm.

565
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,413
And we've got red twine

566
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,290
to stop them from
changing shape.

567
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,375
And don't forget about
the ash berries.

568
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,377
Ash berries, right.

569
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,922
That's how you keep them
from using their powers
against you.

570
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,967
They've been walking
amongst us for weeks now,

571
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,885
pretending to be
our friends.

572
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:22,141
Lying to us, making mischief.
What's next?

573
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,850
Yeah!
What is next, Seamus?

574
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,395
I for one am not going
to stand by

575
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:29,022
and let them run roughshod
over our town.

576
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,608
(<i> shouting agreement</i> )

577
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,234
We can't rest

578
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,694
until we've driven
every one of them out.

579
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,780
(<i> all agreeing</i> )

580
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,825
They're here!
Tom Paris and Harry Kim--

581
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,910
they're in Sullivan's right now!

582
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,370
Who's with me?

583
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,331
Come on.

584
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,131
(<i> door opens</i> )

585
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,924
(<i> shouting</i> )

586
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,635
There they are!

587
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,930
Seamus, let us explain.

588
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,307
You're making
a mistake.

589
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,017
The only mistake
we made

590
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,102
was letting you
into Fair Haven.

591
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,937
What's that?
Shoot it.

592
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,190
No, wait, wait. That's
a delicate piece of...

593
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,399
...technology.

594
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,443
Warning. Holodeck controls

595
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,069
and safety protocols are
off-line.

596
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,695
A voice from
the otherworld.

597
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,240
Emergency overrides
are malfunctioning.

598
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,662
Computer, freeze program!

599
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,830
62 percent compliance.

600
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,875
They're getting away!
After them!

601
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,670
(<i> angry shouting</i> )

602
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,091
PARIS:
Computer, exit.

603
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,282
Gunfire?
Two shots directly
at the primary controls.

604
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,118
We can't deactivate
the program or get
the safeties back on line.

605
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,786
Where are Tom
and Harry now?

606
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,247
St. Mary's.

607
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,831
Looks like some
of your parishioners

608
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,500
are holding them captive.

609
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,627
We can't blame them
for being frightened.

610
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,879
They must think we're
some kind of sorcerers.

611
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,048
Well, we could use
a little magic right now,

612
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,133
because that's about
the only way we're going
to get our people back.

613
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,928
Transporters?
Too many stray photons.
We can't get a lock.

614
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,138
We should enter
the holodeck
with a security team

615
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,806
and take them by force.

616
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,642
Need I remind you
that the holo-characters

617
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,395
have weapons as well.
We'd be risking armed conflict.

618
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,272
Well, then let's
just pull the plug.

619
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,691
Cut power to
the holo-grid.

620
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,402
That would purge the
program from our database.

621
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,612
Exactly.

622
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,946
But we'd lose
Fair Haven

623
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,615
and all its people.

624
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,491
They're not people.
They're holograms.

625
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,493
And they weren't
programmed to
be violent.

626
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,579
I don't believe
they'd harm anyone.

627
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,038
You can't be certain.

628
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,665
Well, I am certain.

629
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,751
And I'd like to find
a less drastic solution.

630
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,252
With all due
respect, Captain,

631
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,045
Michael can be
reprogrammed--

632
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,005
Tom and Harry can't.

633
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,966
One problem at a time,
B'Elanna.

634
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,842
The people of Fair Haven
may not be real,

635
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,762
but our feelings
toward them are.

636
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,513
I won't destroy
these relationships

637
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,223
if we can find
another way.

638
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,017
Now, if we could attach
transport enhancers

639
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,936
onto Tom and Harry,
would that be enough

640
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,563
to cut through
the interference?

641
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,315
I believe so.
Good.

642
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,318
Then, we just need to get
someone close to them.

643
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,194
Doctor.

644
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,989
A few words of inspiration
should get me within reach.

645
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,158
I suggest you use
your mobile emitter.

646
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,577
It'll isolate you
from the malfunctions.

647
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,245
Good idea.

648
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,830
Stand by to cut power
to the holo-grid,

649
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,373
in case things
get out of hand.

650
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,375
TORRES:
Aye, Captain.
In the meantime,

651
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,961
I believe your flock
needs tending.

652
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,049
SEAMUS:
<i>Ex labis caelstium sanctorum</i>

653
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:48,722
<i>super ad aures atorum</i>
<i>larvarum mentientium.</i>

654
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,184
From the lips
of the heavenly saints above

655
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,437
to the ears of the dark
and lying spirits--

656
00:30:55,479 --> 00:31:01,026
may your spectral forms
be cast back to the otherworld!

657
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,033
Back to the otherworld!

658
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,660
(<i> sighs</i> )

659
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:13,079
There must be some trick
to these incantations.

660
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,582
What do you make
of this, Seamus?

661
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,212
We should just
tell them the truth.

662
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,297
Oh, good idea, Harry.
Do you want to tell them

663
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,132
they're only holograms,
or should I?

664
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,219
I see you left your box
of charms at Sullivan's.

665
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,304
I believe this is
the talisman

666
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,056
you used
on Maggie.

667
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,892
Maybe we should turn
them into cows.

668
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,187
No, no, there's been
a misunderstanding.

669
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,857
We are not spirit folk.

670
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,318
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
I think we've heard enough
of your lies, Tommy-Boy.

671
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,572
I say we tie them up
to the lamppost in the square

672
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,491
and show them how spirit folk
were dealt with
in the olden days.

673
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,702
(<i> crowd agrees</i> )
Leave them alone.

674
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,788
It's bad enough
you've got them trussed up
like Christmas turkeys.

675
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,498
There's no need
for foolish threats!

676
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,458
You'd better watch
whose side you're on.

677
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,711
You're not above
suspicion yourself.

678
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,171
Oh, so we're going to start
turning on one another
now, is that it?

679
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,465
We are if you're choosing
them over your own people.

680
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,925
Sinners!

681
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,846
Sinners, all of you.

682
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:14,892
You have the audacity
to turn a house of worship
into a prison?

683
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,895
This is where we gather
to pledge our love

684
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,523
for our fellow man--
not condemnation.

685
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,609
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

686
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,403
Quite a rousing
sermon, Father,

687
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,281
but I'm afraid you're
not going to find
too many takers tonight.

688
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,658
Not after your
little vanishing act.

689
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,744
It seems Grace Declan
saw you disappear

690
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,328
into thin air
on Sunday.

691
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,832
Aye. I'd say that sounds
a wee bit unholy.

692
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,959
You're in league
with them, aren't you?

693
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,669
Tie him up
with the others.

694
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,797
Listen to yourselves.
You're letting confusion

695
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,632
and fear get the best of you.

696
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,302
Doctor to Janeway.
What's this?

697
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,721
Fire and brimstone
don't seem to be working.

698
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,056
Look here, Seamus!

699
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,392
Another talisman.

700
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,102
Quick, get it
off of him!

701
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,608
Beam him out of there.

702
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,486
His program's been
disengaged from
the mobile emitter.

703
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,280
And what were you planning
on doing with these?

704
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,991
Those are the devices
that will allow us to leave.

705
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:16,035
Just put them on our coats
and we'll be on our way.

706
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,037
You'd like us to believe
that, wouldn't you?

707
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,124
Something
tells me these are
spirit charms.

708
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,544
We pin them on you
and God knows what
powers you'll have.

709
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,589
This is no charm.
It's some kind of a machine.

710
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,801
Oh, it doesn't matter.
They won't be telling us
the truth about any of it.

711
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,303
Oh, they'll tell us
the truth, all right.

712
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,972
There's more than one way

713
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,474
to pluck the wings
off a pixie.

714
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,058
We'll induce a trance.

715
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,311
Give me Billy
Ramsey's spoon.

716
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,149
Keep your eyes

717
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,318
on the silverware, Father.

718
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,403
(<i> sighs</i> )

719
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,823
I hope you know
this is blasphemous.

720
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,868
Oh, this is ridiculous.

721
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,496
I can't be hypnotized.

722
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,080
(<i> sighs</i> )

723
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,754
I can't isolate
the Doctor's program.

724
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,924
He's been integrated
into the Fair Haven matrix.

725
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,342
He's vulnerable.

726
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,678
Tell us the words.

727
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,016
How do we banish the spirit folk
to the otherworld?

728
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,894
There is no otherworld.

729
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,271
Only<i> Voyager.</i>
<i>"Voyager"?</i>

730
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,483
Federation Starship,
Intrepid-class,

731
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,612
registry number
NCC-74656.

732
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,197
You're from some sort of vessel?

733
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,407
Mm-hmm.

734
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,367
He's talking gibberish.

735
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,577
Maybe he's not.

736
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,953
This ship of yours--

737
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,413
is that where you took me?

738
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,748
Look here.

739
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,207
It says if you
can get a spirit

740
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,334
to reveal
his true name,

741
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:50,296
you'll render yourself
impervious to his charms.

742
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,841
What is your true name?

743
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:56,636
I haven't decided on one yet.

744
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,764
Katie's on that ship,
isn't she?

745
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,891
Tell me where to find
her so I can get to
the bottom of this.

746
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,184
I'm sorry, Michael.
I can't do that.

747
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,605
Then I guess I'm asking
the wrong person.

748
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,318
Tell me how to get
to<i> Voyager.</i>

749
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,320
WOMAN: No, Michael.
What are you doing, Sullivan?

750
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,907
No man who's gone
to the otherworld
has ever come back.

751
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,617
I have.

752
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,410
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

753
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,622
How do I get there?

754
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,756
TUVOK:
Captain, the mobile emitter

755
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,132
has been activated.

756
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,384
Lock on to the signal.

757
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,845
(<i> whoosh of</i>
<i>active transport)</i>

758
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,982
I had a cousin, went to America.

759
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,858
He saw some strange things...

760
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,777
but nothing like this.

761
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,156
You're not in America.

762
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,162
This is a starship.

763
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,371
It's called...

764
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,791
<i>Voyager.</i>

765
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,876
I know.

766
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,046
Should I transfer him
back to the holodeck?

767
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,380
No.

768
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,598
My name
isn't Katie O'Clare.

769
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,434
It's Kathryn Janeway.

770
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,603
<i>Captain</i> Kathryn Janeway.

771
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,773
It's going to be difficult
to explain.

772
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,693
Maybe it's best
if I just show you.

773
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,864
You've seen my world.
It seems fair

774
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,116
that I should have
a chance to see yours.

775
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,492
Captain?

776
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,926
So this really
is a starship.

777
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,679
But how can that
be possible?

778
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,848
Have you ever read
<i>The Time Machine</i>

779
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,683
by H. G. Wells?

780
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,978
Are you telling me you've
traveled back through time?

781
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,022
In a manner
of speaking.

782
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,238
That's Patrick Gibson
and his cousin, Frank.

783
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,781
They work on the wharf.

784
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,324
They're in my pub
every Saturday night

785
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,160
for the rings
tournament.

786
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,829
You'll find a lot of
familiar faces on<i> Voyager.</i>

787
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,082
We've been visiting
your town for months.

788
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,541
Why?

789
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,129
We're explorers.

790
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,381
I-I'm not letting you
off the hook that easy,

791
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,883
Kathryn Janeway.

792
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,593
There must be more
interesting places

793
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,428
to explore
than Fair Haven.

794
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,972
Can you think of any
place you'd rather be?

795
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,226
I guess that leaves
but one question.

796
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,603
How long are you
planning on staying?

797
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,313
Well, that depends...

798
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,566
if we're still
welcome.

799
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,277
My door
is always open.

800
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,446
But you're the Captain
of a starship.

801
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,948
I'm a barkeep.

802
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,869
Just because we're
from different worlds

803
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,163
doesn't mean we can't
care for each other.

804
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,873
Tuvok to Janeway.

805
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,208
Go ahead.

806
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,168
The situation has escalated.

807
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,130
The townspeople have started
to pile kindling

808
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,466
at the base of three lampposts
in the village square.

809
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,051
Stand by.

810
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,974
Take them outside now!

811
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,935
(<i> door opening</i> )

812
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,062
Stay back!

813
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,605
What are you doing?

814
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,816
That might not be
Michael Sullivan.

815
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,068
A demon could have
taken his shape!

816
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,903
It's me, Milo.

817
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,989
I've been to the place
they call<i> Voyager,</i>

818
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,531
and I've brought
Katie back with me.

819
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,408
I've come in hopes
that we can resolve

820
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,244
our differences peacefully.

821
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,037
Peacefully?
I'm sure

822
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,039
that's what you told
the people of Kilmanin.

823
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,208
They had nothing to do
with what happened
in Kilmanin,

824
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,835
if it happened at all.

825
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,878
We're truly sorry
for what's happened here.

826
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,173
We never meant
to frighten anyone.

827
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,382
Seamus, you were right
about one thing.

828
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,302
They<i> are</i> quite
different from us.

829
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,262
But not in so many ways
that we can't be friends.

830
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,931
And we're not
spirit folk.

831
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,268
Some of our technology
may seem like magic,

832
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,145
but I assure you it's not.

833
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,688
Katie showed
me things

834
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,731
that are beyond
our comprehension.

835
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,526
They have machines that
I can't begin to describe,

836
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,445
but not once have they
used them against us.

837
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,572
Quite the opposite,
in fact.

838
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,368
Milo, you said you
didn't like the rain.

839
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,121
And young Harry Kim
made it go away.

840
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,665
Edith Mulcahey herself
said that Katie O'Clare

841
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,751
pulled her daughter
from the well and
out of harm's way.

842
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,379
These are not the deeds
of spirits and
mischief-makers.

843
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,923
But they turned Maggie
into a cow!

844
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,426
Uh, that'll never happen again.
I swear.

845
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,137
MICHAEL:
There, you see--

846
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,972
we have his word.

847
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,474
And if we can't trust
a man's word in Fair Haven,

848
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,185
what can we trust?

849
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,187
If you want...

850
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,939
we'll leave
and never bother you again.

851
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,862
But we'd prefer to find some way
to keep our friendship alive.

852
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,158
(<i> device beeps</i> )

853
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,415
Captain?

854
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,129
I, for one, would like
to keep playing rings

855
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,672
with Harry and Tom.

856
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,675
Keep having Neelix's
steamed cabbage

857
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,510
at The Ox and Lamb,

858
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:33,139
keep taking walks
with Katie.

859
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,516
Let's not turn our backs
on these good people.

860
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,103
If we do,
we're only punishing ourselves.

861
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,733
Just because we're
from different worlds,

862
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:47,028
doesn't mean we can't
care for each other.

863
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,078
TORRES:
If we're going to
retain the program,

864
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,829
we can't keep running
it around the clock.

865
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,040
Not until we've repaired
these damaged systems.

866
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,666
Not ever!

867
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,585
We've pushed the limits
of holo-technology

868
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,045
and they've pushed back.
If we try it again,

869
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,671
we're just asking
for trouble.

870
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,299
I'm afraid we're
going to have to close

871
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,508
your open door policy.

872
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,344
Yes, ma'am.

873
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,512
What about
the characters?

874
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,765
Should I purge
their memories of
the last few days?

875
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,516
No. Leave them.

876
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,228
They think we're space men
from the future.

877
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,605
It won't exactly
be like old times.

878
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,775
We learn to accept alien species
with new technologies.

879
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,237
Let's hope
the people of Fair Haven
will learn to accept us.

880
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,407
But before we shut down
the program and begin repairs,

881
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:35,243
what do you say
to one more round at Sullivan's?

882
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,078
My treat.

883
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,955
(<i> laughter</i> )

884
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,499
You may be from the moon,
Tommy-Boy,

885
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,627
but I've got three shillings
that says I can still
whip you at rings.

886
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,795
Ho! You're on.

887
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,339
Hello, Harry.

888
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,673
I'll catch up
with you later.

889
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,758
SEAMUS:
Tommy-Boy!

890
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,511
I've been told there's a pot
of gold somewhere in Glen Abbey.

891
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,848
Would you be able to find it
with one of those fancy
machines of yours?

892
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,851
Just follow
the rainbow, Seamus.
Rainbow, eh?

893
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,354
KIM:
I didn't think you'd ever
speak to me again.

894
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,772
Well, I suppose I can
forgive and forget.

895
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,025
It's not that often
you meet a handsome
young man

896
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,318
from outer space.

897
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,777
(<i> chuckles</i> )

898
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,824
What's this,
Christmas come early?

899
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,118
It has for you.
Open it.

900
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,751
<i>A Connecticut Yankee</i>
<i>in King Arthur's Court</i>

901
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,504
by Mark Twain.

902
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,630
I've read some of his books,
but not this one.

903
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,924
It's about two people
from different times

904
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:36,179
who fall in love,
among other things.

905
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,973
Sounds familiar.
Maybe I have read it.

906
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,476
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Thank you, Katie.

907
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:44,770
Or Kathryn now, is it?
Oh!

908
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,315
They say if you know
a spirit's true name,

909
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:52,070
that it renders
you impervious
against her charms.

910
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,530
Do you think there's
any truth in that?

911
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,947
Not a word.

912
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,615
I'm glad to hear it.
