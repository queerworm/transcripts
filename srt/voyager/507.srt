00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:09,343
(<i> voices yelling and screaming)</i>

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:13,263
(<i> yelling and screaming</i>
<i>get louder</i> )

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,098
(<i> yelling and screaming stop)</i>

4
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,145
(<i> sniffs</i> )

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,731
COMPUTER:
<i>Regeneration cycle incomplete.</i>

6
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,017
(<i> sniffs</i> )

7
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,776
(<i> snorts in disgust</i> )

8
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,528
(<i> angry yell</i> )

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,366
(<i> angry growl</i> )

10
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,285
(<i> sniffs</i> )

11
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,006
(<i> ravenous growling</i> )

12
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,169
KIM:
When I checked
the overnight sensor logs,

13
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,629
this little surprise
was waiting for me.

14
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,007
Maybe I'm not quite awake,

15
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:38,510
but it looks like its
over 100 kilometers wide.

16
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,722
120. At first, I thought
it was an asteroid cluster

17
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,559
until I picked up
a residual warp signature.

18
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,062
It was
a Borg vessel.

19
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,397
There are tetryon particles
in the debris consistent

20
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,232
with the atmosphere
inside a cube.

21
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,109
Any idea what
destroyed it?

22
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,528
We would need to
run close-range scans

23
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,072
of the hull fragments.

24
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,365
Unless we alter course,
we'll get our chance.

25
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,117
The debris field's
directly ahead.

26
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,702
Then I suggest
we cut a wide berth.

27
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,579
Chances are the
Borg will send

28
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,247
more vessels
to investigate.

29
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,042
Alter course to avoid
the debris. If that's all...

30
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,335
NEELIX:
One other piece of business,
Captain.

31
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,754
It seems we had
another incident

32
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,963
in the Mess Hall
last night.

33
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,049
Return of the
midnight snacker?

34
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,509
NEELIX:
I'm afraid so. Casualties?

35
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,636
A leg of Kelaran
wildebeest I'd prepared

36
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,430
for Ensign Ryson's birthday.

37
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,265
Since Commander Tuvok
has been unable

38
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,725
to round up
any suspects,

39
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,060
I'd like to ask

40
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,770
that stronger
measures be taken.

41
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,396
Perhaps an armed
security detail...

42
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,648
I'd like to ask
permission to replicate

43
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,817
some locking mechanisms
for the cabinet doors.

44
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,985
Granted.

45
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,319
Dismissed.

46
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,205
Naomi Wildman,

47
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,373
Subunit of Ensign
Samantha Wildman,

48
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,001
state your intentions.

49
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,335
I...

50
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,922
Very well.
You leave me no choice

51
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,758
but to report your activities
to the Captain.

52
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,594
Please don't. I was just
observing you.

53
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,054
Explain.

54
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,598
Well, Neelix told
me that the Borg

55
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,975
do a lot of
things they do

56
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,852
because they're
trying to be perfect

57
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,062
and, even though you're not
really a drone anymore,

58
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,814
you still try
to be perfect.

59
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,524
Don't you?
Correct.

60
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,276
Well, if I can learn
to be perfect, too,

61
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,568
then Captain Janeway

62
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,403
will have to make me
her Bridge Assistant.

63
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,656
No such rank exists
aboard this vessel.

64
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,574
Not yet.

65
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:10,037
And you hope to achieve
this goal by emulating me?

66
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,412
Are you mad?

67
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,498
No. There are
many on this crew

68
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,667
that would benefit
from your example.

69
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,878
So you'll teach me.

70
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,297
Your objective
is admirable.

71
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,674
However, your neocortical
development is incomplete.

72
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,177
You would require several
months of accelerated growth

73
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,845
in a Borg maturation chamber.

74
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,015
Oh... I don't think I
like the sound of that.

75
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,558
Then I suggest that yo...

76
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,311
(<i> cacophony of yelling</i>
<i>and screaming</i> )

77
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,065
(<i> yelling and screaming stop)</i>

78
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,734
Hi.

79
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,736
Hi.

80
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,655
I'm bored.
Let's do something fun.

81
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,032
Like what?

82
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,117
Swimming?

83
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,953
Oh, I'm not allowed
to go swimming without my mom.

84
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,914
Oh.

85
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,790
Do you like Kadis-Kot?

86
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,917
Love it.

87
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,834
Come on.

88
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,629
(<i> both laughing</i> )

89
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,798
I'll be Bridge Assistant
for a while

90
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,800
then, I'll be
promoted to Ensign.

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,510
It'll be Lieutenant after that,

92
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,180
and by the time we reach
the Alpha Quadrant...

93
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,224
<i>Captain</i> Wildman.

94
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,937
Green, grid 14-4.

95
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,272
Kadis-Kot. I win.

96
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,480
(<i> giggling</i> )

97
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,024
You're really
good at this game.

98
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,317
You want a rematch?

99
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,777
Sure.

100
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,904
Captains don't have
much time to play, you know.

101
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,114
That's okay.

102
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,448
I'll be pretty busy by then.

103
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,284
Want to hear the rules
of first contact?

104
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,119
No.

105
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,162
How about the suborders
of the Prime Directive?

106
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,289
I know all 47 of them.

107
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,582
You study too much, Naomi.

108
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,667
Just like
my brother.

109
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,211
I didn't know
you had a brother.

110
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,879
Mm-hmm. 12 of them.

111
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,089
Twelve?

112
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,799
Nine older and
three younger.

113
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,301
We play Kadis-Kot
all the time.

114
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,220
I only have my mom
and Neelix to play with--

115
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,596
when they're not working.

116
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,348
You must get lonely.

117
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,810
A little. You get used to it.

118
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,936
You adapt.

119
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,729
Adapt?

120
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,398
You know, like the Borg.

121
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,943
Borg... I hate Borgs.

122
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,736
You do?

123
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,655
Yeah. They're mean.

124
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,240
<i>Torres to Seven of Nine.</i>

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,117
<i>Please report to Engineering.</i>

126
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,160
It's your move.

127
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,538
TORRES:
<i>Seven, respond.</i>

128
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,835
I'm on my way, Lieutenant.

129
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,629
Naomi Wildman...

130
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,465
Yes?

131
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,467
what am I doing here?

132
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,178
We're playing Kadis-Kot.

133
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,764
Seven?

134
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,365
Take a look
at this, will you?

135
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,450
I'm picking up
an energy signal

136
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,494
in the lower
subspace bands

137
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,953
and if I'm not mistaken,

138
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,663
it's got
a Borg modulation.

139
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,789
You're correct.

140
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,333
It is Borg.

141
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,751
I believe it's a neural
interlink frequency.

142
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,836
A what?

143
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,629
A frequency
that integrates

144
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,131
the minds
of Borg drones.

145
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,510
Can you pinpoint
the origin?

146
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,094
I will try.

147
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,433
No offense, Seven,
but you look terrible.

148
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,060
I am not well.

149
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,103
I experienced a brief
lapse in memory

150
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,813
and I am disoriented.

151
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,273
Maybe you should
get to Sick Bay.

152
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,774
No.

153
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,735
This interlink frequency
could explain m...

154
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,113
(<i> voices yelling and screaming)</i>

155
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,617
(<i> yelling and screaming stop)</i>

156
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,082
<i>Do-raq me'roch.</i>

157
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,666
I beg your pardon?

158
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,546
I am the son of K'Vok.

159
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,547
And you?

160
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,923
What house
are you from?

161
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,342
Is this some
kind of a joke?

162
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,388
You wear the uniform
of a Starfleet<i> puh-chah.</i>

163
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,224
What kind of a
warrior are you?

164
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,809
Tom put you up to this,
didn't he?

165
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,186
Well, it didn't work.

166
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,275
Come, warrior,
let me look at you.

167
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,609
Enough, Seven.

168
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,902
(<i> sniffs</i> )

169
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,028
Your blood is sweet!

00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,321
(<i> yells</i> )

171
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,200
Torres to Security.

172
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,826
Get somebody down here
right now.

173
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,328
You are strong.

174
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,788
You will make
an excellent mate.

175
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,331
Get the hell away from me!

176
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,293
You wish to prove
yourself in battle.

177
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,421
(<i> grunting</i> )

178
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,884
Report.

179
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,011
Seven of Nine attacked
B'Elanna in Engineering.

180
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,305
She's on Deck 9, Section 23.

181
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,056
Force fields.

182
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,182
Don't tell me those two

183
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,434
have actually come to blows.

184
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,983
JANEWAY:
<i>Bridge to Tuvok.</i>

185
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,154
<i>Seven's been contained--</i>
<i>Deck 10, Section 32.</i>

186
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,113
Acknowledged.

187
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,448
We're nearing
her position.

188
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,287
Seven?

189
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,040
Somebody's hurt
and he needs help.

190
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,464
Did I do something bad?

191
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,341
Who are you?

192
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,843
My name's Maryl.

193
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,387
Are you a Vulcan?

194
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,849
Computer, deactivate
force field.

195
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,272
Give me the phaser.

196
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,155
(<i> yelling voices crescendo,</i>
<i>then fade</i> )

197
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,366
You are not a physician,
Commander.

198
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,242
The logical course
of action

199
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,579
would be to take him
to the infirmary.

200
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,498
Maryl?

201
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,209
Subaltern Lorot,
Vulcan High Command.

202
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,877
May I be of assistance?

203
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,170
Yes.

204
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,839
Please accompany
me to Sick Bay.

205
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,676
Certainly.

206
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,010
Clearly he was attacked.

207
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,429
I suggest we use caution.

208
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,015
(<i> yelling voices crescendo,</i>
<i>then fade</i> )

209
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,600
<i>Pahtk!</i>

210
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,604
You will drown
in your own blood.

211
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,523
Keep moving.

212
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,649
(<i> yells</i> )

213
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,539
(<i> gasps</i> )

214
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,541
Seven?

215
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,001
Captain,
why am I here?

216
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,045
You've been unconscious
for nearly two hours.

217
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,463
We believe
you're experiencing

218
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,507
a neurological
disorder.

219
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,926
Voices... I hear voices...

220
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:40,843
Describe them.

221
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,053
(<i> voices yelling</i> )

222
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,431
They are agitated...

223
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,766
chaotic...

224
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,185
too many voices.

225
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,811
(<i> piercing scream</i> )

226
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,482
(<i> screaming</i> )

227
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,781
Too many voices!

228
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,325
(<i> gasping</i> )

229
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:08,329
The cortical inhibitor
is destabilizing.

230
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,916
I'm increasing
the neurotransmitter levels.

231
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,918
It's working.

232
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,962
Do you still hear
the voices?

233
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,505
They are fading.

234
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,136
They are gone.

235
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,638
All right.
Let's see what we can do

236
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,097
to keep them
from coming back.

237
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,558
What's the last thing
you remember?

238
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,354
I was in Engineering
assisting Lieutenant Torres.

239
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,939
You have no recollection

240
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,899
of a confrontation
with B'Elanna?

241
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,984
Confrontation?

242
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,110
I'm not sure why,

243
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,279
but you seem to
be manifesting

244
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,448
personalities
other than your own.

245
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,367
Naomi Wildman claims the two
of you played together

246
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,369
for nearly an hour
this afternoon.

247
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,497
You also attacked
Lieutenant Torres.

248
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,374
She told us you called
yourself "son of K'Vok"

249
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,918
and that you initiated
a Klingon mating ritual.

250
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,713
I have no memory
of those events.

251
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,922
DOCTOR:
Come look at this.

252
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,174
Doctor?

253
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,802
DOCTOR:
This is your
neural pattern.

254
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,429
The memory engrams
and synaptic pathways

255
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,723
that define you
as an individual.

256
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,891
Unfortunately,
you're not alone.

257
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,102
13 new neural patterns
have emerged

258
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,895
in your
cerebral cortex--

259
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,191
Klingon, Vulcan,
Terrelian, human

260
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,818
and several others
I can't identify.

261
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:20,985
How?

262
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,403
They're coming
from within you.

263
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,071
During your time
with the Borg,

264
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,658
the Collective assimilated
hundreds of different species.

265
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,785
All of those neural patterns
were integrated

266
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,786
into the hive mind.

267
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,953
Of course.

268
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,748
That means they're
in your mind, too,

269
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,083
stored within your
cortical implants...

270
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,627
dormant until now.

271
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,878
From what
we can tell,

272
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,380
the various
neural patterns

273
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,922
are surfacing
randomly.

274
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,801
In essence, you've developed
the Borg equivalent

275
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,678
of multiple personality
disorder.

276
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,640
Can you correct
the malfunction?

277
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,309
The cortical inhibitor
is suppressing the effect,

278
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,437
but it's only
a temporary measure.

279
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,357
Lieutenant Torres detected
a Borg interlink frequency.

280
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,860
It could be causing my cortical
implants to malfunction.

281
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,486
The signal appears
to be emanating

282
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,822
from the Borg debris field
we discovered this morning.

283
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,115
Maybe we should jump to warp--
try to get out of range.

284
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,868
The signal permeates subspace.

285
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,327
We cannot avoid it.

286
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,204
Our only hope is
to terminate the signal

287
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,455
at its point of origin.

288
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,916
Set a course for
the debris field.

289
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,126
When we arrive, we
may need your help.

290
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,545
Feel up to it?

291
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,171
Yes, Captain.

292
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,923
Keep a close eye
on her, Doctor,

293
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,593
in case she has any more
unexpected visitors.

294
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,769
Has any drone ever
experienced symptoms

295
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,144
like these before?

296
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,188
The Collective does not
tolerate imperfection.

297
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,190
Any drone with a malfunction
as serious as mine

298
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,025
would be destroyed
immediately.

299
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,570
Lucky for you, this crew
is a little more tolerant.

300
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,196
Oh, there you are.

301
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,283
Lieutenant Torres tells me
you're under the weather.

302
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,534
Correct.

303
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,786
Well, is
there anything

304
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,579
your morale officer
can do to help?

305
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,205
Assignments you
need me to finish

306
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,164
while you recuperate?

307
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,416
No.

308
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,293
I have some wonderful
medicinal teas.

309
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,961
Maybe I could
prepare one for you.

310
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,379
Talaxian homeopathy.

311
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,381
I don't think we're quite
that desperate yet.

312
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,801
How about if I make one of
your favorite nutritional...?

313
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,469
Your concern
has been noted.

314
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,888
The Doctor will inform you
when I am functional again.

315
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,306
Right. Sorry.

316
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,016
Oh, uh...
I almost forgot--

317
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,018
it's from Naomi Wildman.

318
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,021
It's a drawing of<i> Voyager.</i>

319
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,191
Or maybe it's
an asteroid belt.

320
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,945
I'm not sure.

321
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,155
Naomi thought that it
might make you feel better.

322
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,700
Tell her thank you.

323
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,798
DOCTOR:
I suspected as much.

324
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,091
There were several
interruptions

325
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,927
in your
regeneration cycle.

326
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,429
18 minutes,
five minutes, one hour.

327
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,348
I don't recall them.

328
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,350
Let's examine your
neural function logs.

329
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,435
Low serotonin levels
during regeneration.

330
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,979
That's normal.

331
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,982
But look at these spikes
in the prefrontal synapses.

332
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,776
They appear only seconds
before you left the alcove.

333
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,110
You were sleepwalking.

334
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,488
I don't remember entering
this data file.

335
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,031
Looks like we found
the identity

336
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,282
of the midnight snacker.

337
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,117
I'm sure Mr. Neelix
will be relieved.

338
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:20,206
SEVEN:

351
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,818
The individual who made
this recording

352
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,070
must have been a member
of the crew.

353
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,697
One of my victims.

354
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,448
Here's another
log entry--

355
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,117
this one encoded
for transmission.

00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,758
<i>Wait. I've got a better idea.</i>

363
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,385
<i>Why don't you leave your circle</i>
<i>and visit the colony?</i>

364
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,762
<i>You'd love it here-- sul...</i>

365
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,221
Anything familiar?

366
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,725
I helped to assimilate
thousands of individuals.

367
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,476
I do not remember
each of their names.

368
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,979
Seven, you were a Borg drone

369
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,898
who's now becoming
an individual.

370
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,441
That's practically
unheard of.

371
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,986
There's bound to be rough
spots along the way.

372
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,447
We just have
to get past them.

373
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,156
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Bridge to Seven of Nine.</i>

374
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,951
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>the debris field.</i>

375
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,201
Acknowledged.

376
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,460
Survivors?

377
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,586
TUVOK:
None.

378
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,879
Any sign of
Borg vessels?

379
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:50,838
No, sir.

380
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,339
We're the first ones here.

381
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,925
KIM:
I'm picking
up the source

382
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,510
of the interlink frequency,
bearing 027 mark 3.

383
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,220
On screen.

384
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,682
JANEWAY:
Magnify.

385
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,018
SEVEN:
It's a Borg
vinculum.

386
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,520
Vinculum?

387
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,981
The processing device

388
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,941
at the core of
every Borg vessel.

389
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,777
It interconnects the minds
of all the drones.

390
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,278
It purges individual thoughts

391
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,905
and disseminates information

392
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,197
relevant to the Collective.

393
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,532
It brings order
to chaos.

394
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,867
Precisely.

395
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,495
Looks like this one
has established a link

396
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,788
to your cortical implant.

397
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,414
I believe it has
identified me

398
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,041
as an errant drone.

399
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,961
It is attempting to reintegrate
me into the Collective.

400
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,879
The vinculum is
malfunctioning.

401
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,631
It is sending me
erratic commands.

402
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,592
Bringing chaos to order.

403
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,470
Yes.

404
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,180
Can you sever the link?

405
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,517
Not without risking permanent
damage to my own systems.

406
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,020
The vinculum must be
taken off-line.

407
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,482
Permission to beam
it aboard for analysis.

408
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,317
I have worked with this
technology before.

409
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,777
I may be able to disable it.

410
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,155
We're talking about
the heart of a Borg cube.

411
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,825
I'd rather not take it
inside my ship.

412
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,451
Can you disable it remotely?

413
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,037
Yes, but I would need
several days.

414
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,288
The Borg may return by then.

415
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,624
I recommend we take
the vinculum

416
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,585
and leave this
region immediately.

417
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,091
Tuvok, prepare to beam it
to Engineering.

418
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,551
Erect a level-10 force field

419
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,427
and maintain constant
surveillance.

420
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,597
The moment it poses a threat,
send it back into space.

421
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,475
Tom, as soon a it's aboard,
get us out of here, warp 9.

422
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,352
Aye, Captain.

423
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,229
I understand what
you're going through

424
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,481
and I want to help you
in every way I can,

425
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,275
but the safety of this crew
is my first responsibility.

426
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,278
We haven't had the best
of luck with the Borg.

427
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,531
Nor have I.

428
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,873
TORRES:
Let's keep on eye
on those antigrav struts.

429
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,458
Boylan, lock out
all primary command consoles

430
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,795
and reroute transporter controls
to Main Engineering.

431
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,589
Yes, Lieutenant.

432
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,466
(<i> voices yelling and screaming)</i>

433
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,468
Seven?

434
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,304
The voices,
I hear them.

435
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,182
It's your proximity
to the vinculum.

436
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,808
The link is
stronger here.

437
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,228
I'm adjusting your
neurotransmitter levels.

438
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,771
(<i> voices fade</i> )

439
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,773
We better get started.

440
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,865
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

441
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,659
The son of K'Vok
will not be joining us.

442
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,203
Glad to hear it.

443
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,538
Does this qualify
as our second date?

444
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,625
Just think of me
as your chaperon.

445
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,043
So...

446
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,502
where's the off switch?

447
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,422
The vinculum is equipped
with many safeguards.

448
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,967
I will need to access
its transneural matrix

449
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,176
and disable it directly.

450
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,344
(<i> console beeping</i> )

451
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,180
I'm reading
a power surge.

452
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,724
It's a normal response
to my intrusion.

453
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,767
Don't be alarmed.

454
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,271
Curious...

455
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,898
I'm detecting an organism
within the vinculum.

456
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,608
It appears to be
a viral agent.

457
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,692
Let's see it.

458
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,362
It's a synthetic pathogen.

459
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,823
The virus was originally

460
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,865
a biological agent,

461
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,117
but it's mutated.

462
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,952
It's attacking
the vinculum's programs

463
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,245
as it would
living cells.

464
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,872
An organism that
attacks technology?

465
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,000
The cube was infected
three days ago,

466
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,543
shortly after assimilating
an alien shuttlecraft.

467
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,464
Species 6339.

468
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,842
They were the last ones to
come in contact with the cube.

469
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,011
Looks like we've found
our Typhoid Mary.

470
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,686
Species 6339, humanoid.
Warp-capable.

471
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,190
Origin: Grid 124,
Octant 22-Theta.

472
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,440
They first encountered the Borg

473
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,358
approximately
four years ago.

474
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,569
Since that time,
11 billion individuals

475
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,238
have been assimilated.

476
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,157
Three days ago,
the Collective detected

477
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,450
one of their last
surviving shuttlecraft.

478
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,994
A cube was sent
to intercept it.

479
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,078
We believe the virus

480
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,955
was carried
within their bodies.

481
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,207
Once they were
assimilated,

482
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,749
it spread to
the vinculum.

483
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,459
The drones aboard
no doubt

484
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,296
experienced symptoms
similar to my own.

485
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,381
It is no surprise they
destroyed themselves.

486
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,219
I'd like to find
Species 6339.

487
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,929
They may be able
to help us treat you.

488
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,806
Begin long-range
astrometric scans.

489
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,892
See if they have any more
vessels in this region.

490
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,185
Yes, Captain.

491
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,769
I've already begun
a spatial diag...

492
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,272
(<i> voices yelling</i> )

493
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:25,154
My... My, my.
Look at the size

494
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,280
of that thing.

495
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,157
This viewscreen.
It's got to be one

496
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,533
of the biggest
I've ever seen.

497
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,617
I'll give you

498
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,119
20 bars of latinum for it.

499
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,080
I think the inhibitor's
gone off-line.

500
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,706
Would you come
here, please?

501
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,125
Be quiet. Can't you see
I'm in the middle of a deal?

502
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,710
(<i> sighs</i> )

503
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,713
Name your price, Captain...?

504
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,757
Janeway, and you are...?

505
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,759
DaiMon Torrot.

506
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,135
You're Ferengi.

507
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,762
Of course I'm Ferengi.

508
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,598
Is that some kind of insult
about the size of my ears?

509
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:53,974
No, not at all.

510
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,018
I'd be happy to
negotiate with you,

511
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,187
but, first, we have
to get you to Sick Bay.

512
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,855
Sick Bay?
What for?

513
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,108
Because... you're ill.

514
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,360
I've never felt better.

515
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,819
Doctor.

516
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,863
I'm afraid you've contracted

517
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,241
a nasty strain
of the Ankaran flu.

518
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:13,619
We've been treating you
several days. Remember?

519
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,413
No.

520
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,748
Short-term memory loss--
it's one of the symptoms.

521
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,541
Don't worry. It isn't
life-threatening,

522
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,501
but we'll need to treat you...
in Sick Bay.

523
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,797
What is this treatment
going to cost me?

524
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,340
It's free of charge.

525
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,341
Free?

526
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,968
Yes.

527
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,095
You know, I have been
having a nagging pain

528
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,431
in my lower left lobe,
and while you're at it

529
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,766
why don't you run a complete
tricardial diagnostic?

530
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,393
The Ferengi Health Commission

531
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,438
is trying to revoke
my trading license.

532
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,856
Impressive vessel,
Captain. Galaxy-class?

533
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,024
<i>Intrepid.</i>

534
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,443
Ah. Ah! And here we are

535
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,320
in the much talked
about "Sick Bay."

536
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,488
Not exactly state
of the medical art now, is it?

537
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,531
What do you mean?

538
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,699
Low on bio-beds,

539
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,951
terrible lighting,

540
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,078
obsolete instruments.

541
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,289
Lucky for you, I know
a medical supplier

542
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,167
that can spruce this place up
in a nanosecond

543
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:04,378
and I'll even drop my commission
to a mere... 30 percent?

544
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,796
How generous
of you.

545
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,048
Computer, activate force field.
Force field?

546
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,135
You said I wasn't contagious.
It's for your own safety.

547
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,012
I set the cortical
inhibitor to maximum...

548
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,388
I've been kidnapped!

549
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,265
but it is no longer
suppressing the effect.

550
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,350
These personalities--

551
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,185
are going to
keep surfacing.

552
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,728
All the more reason to shut down
the vinculum as soon as we can.

553
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,689
Even if we do break the
link, it may be too late.

554
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,774
Seven's own neural pattern
is destabilizing.

555
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,276
It could be lost.

556
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,403
SEVEN (<i> in anguished voice):</i>
Please help me.

557
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,570
I'm looking for my son--

558
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,365
Gregory Bergan,
Lieutenant Bergan.

559
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,491
Have you seen him?

560
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,034
No, I'm afraid not.

561
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,077
From the Starship<i> Melbourne.</i>

562
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,371
<i>Melbourne...</i>

563
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:42,124
I was supposed to
meet him at Wolf 359,

564
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,293
but Starfleet
sent out a warning

565
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,379
that the Borg were
attacking that sector.

566
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,714
It was too late
for us to turn back.

567
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,841
We were caught
in a terrible battle.

568
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,510
My ship was badly damaged.

569
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,552
We had to leave on escape pods.

570
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,515
I never found out
what happened to Gregory.

571
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:01,101
Please, I haven't heard from him
in over three days.

572
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,813
Could you check with
Starfleet Headquarters?

573
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,858
I'll see what I can do.

574
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,069
Thank you, Captain.

575
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,612
If... if you do
speak with him,

576
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,408
could you tell him that
his mother is all right

577
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,992
and if he could pos...?

578
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,746
(<i> voices yelling</i> )

579
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,373
Captain...

580
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,707
Seven?

581
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,126
Yes.

582
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,545
The vinculum...

583
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,380
We're preparing
to shut it down right away.

584
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,007
I'll give the order
as soon as Torres is ready.

585
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,010
How long was I... absent?

586
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,721
About 20 minutes.

587
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,847
How many?

588
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,558
Two.

589
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,437
One of whom wanted to acquire
half the items on the ship.

590
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,604
DaiMon Torrot, I believe.

591
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,525
Species 180, Ferengi.

592
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,236
Yes. The other
was a woman

593
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,364
whose son was lost
in a Borg attack.

594
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,117
You'll get through
this, Seven.

595
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,869
I do not share
your optimism.

596
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,083
When you took me
from the Borg

597
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,794
and began to turn me
into an individual,

598
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,171
I found the silence
of my own mind

599
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,381
difficult to bear.

600
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,595
I missed the voices
of the Collective.

601
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,180
But now that I am
an individual

602
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,601
those same voices...

603
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,810
frighten me.

604
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,273
Captain, I don't know

605
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,151
if I can tolerate this
condition much longer.

606
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:36,029
My courage is
insufficient.

607
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,867
Your job is
to keep trying...

608
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,997
to hold on, even when
you think you can't.

609
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:48,250
Leave the rest
to me and the crew.

610
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,932
CHAKOTAY:
Meet anyone
interesting?

611
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,060
Just finished swapping jokes
with a Bolian manicurist.

612
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,937
Before that,
I was debating

613
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,731
the finer points of temporal
physics with a Krenim scientist.

614
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,775
12 new personalities
have surfaced

615
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,068
in the past hour alone.

616
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,406
Seven's having
a rough time of it.

617
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,116
The Doctor
had to sedate her.

618
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,742
And how's
the Captain holding up?

619
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,371
I've been better,
Chakotay.

620
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,207
In fact...

621
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,625
I'm starting to wonder

622
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,835
if my first officer
was right all along.

623
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,253
About what?

624
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,964
You always said that
bringing Seven into the fold

625
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,175
might be impossible.

626
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,677
"You can take the Borg

627
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,887
out of
the Collective, but..."

628
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,390
I don't believe that.

629
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,350
Not anymore.

630
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,811
I didn't think she'd last
a day, much less a year.

631
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,398
I'd say you've
proven me wrong.

632
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,940
<i>Torres to Bridge.</i>

633
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,026
<i>We're ready to begin</i>
<i>disabling the vinculum.</i>

634
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,069
Proceed.

635
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,198
Target the transneural matrix.

636
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,825
Stand by to initiate
the dampening field

637
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,244
on my mark.

638
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,371
Three, two, one.

639
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,707
Mark.

640
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,753
Its power output
is dropping.

641
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,256
(<i> monitor beeping</i> )

642
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,132
Doctor to Bridge.
It seems to be working.

643
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,800
Her neural pattern
is stabilizing.

644
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,265
Power output
is down to 77 percent.

645
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,434
71 percent...

646
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,851
Wait a second.

647
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,020
It's increasing.

648
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,022
I am refocusing
the dampening field.

649
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,191
TORRES:
It's still increasing.

650
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,737
TUVOK:
The vinculum is rerouting
its internal circuitry.

651
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,029
It's adapting.

652
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,072
(<i> voices yelling</i> )

653
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,031
<i>Puh-chah me'roq!</i>

654
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,074
(<i> grunts</i> )

655
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,158
DOCTOR:
Engineering!

656
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,452
Mother!

657
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,412
Her synaptic pathways
are destabilizing!

658
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,455
Abort the procedure!

659
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,372
...voices. Help me!

660
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,749
(<i> yelling</i> ):
Abort!

661
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,500
Stand by, Doctor.

662
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,960
Power output at 98 percent.

663
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,671
The force field
is collapsing.

664
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,381
TORRES:
Transfer to emergency power.

665
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,840
It won't work,
Lieutenant.

666
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,883
We must abort.

667
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,051
Tuvok to Bridge.

668
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,011
<i>The procedure was unsuccessful.</i>

669
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,556
<i>The vinculum has returned</i>
<i>to full power.</i>

670
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,682
Acknowledged.

671
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,142
Doctor, report.

672
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,312
Seven's neural pattern
has disappeared, Captain.

673
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,314
It appears that...

674
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,191
the other patterns
have taken over completely.

675
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,276
We've lost her.

676
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,703
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

677
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,913
<i>Long-range sensors</i>
<i>have detected a vessel</i>

678
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,041
<i>belonging to Species 6339.</i>

679
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,002
<i>We've set a course</i>
<i>to intercept them</i>

680
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,380
<i>in the hopes they can help us</i>
<i>restore Seven of Nine.</i>

681
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,258
I've managed to stabilize
her primary cortical functions,

682
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,428
but the woman in Sick Bay is not
Seven of Nine-- not anymore.

683
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,847
New personalities are emerging
every few seconds now.

684
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,056
She can't finish a sentence

685
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,809
before the next one
rears its head.

686
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,353
It's creating an incredible
strain on her cerebral cortex.

687
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,229
If we don't deactivate
the vinculum soon,

688
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,272
we may never get her back.

689
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,315
Tuvok?

690
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,316
Lieutenant Torres

691
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,526
is taking measures

692
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,277
to prevent the vinculum
from adapting,

693
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,029
but there's no guarantee
she'll succeed.

694
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,782
Captain, I've exhausted every
viable treatment in my database.

695
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:10,035
Then logic dictates
we go beyond medical science.

696
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,663
I will attempt to mind-meld
with Seven of Nine.

697
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,374
A mind-meld? You consider
that a viable treatment?

698
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,459
Seven's neural pattern--
her sense of self--

699
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,836
is immersed in chaos.

700
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,754
I will attempt
to isolate her true self

701
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,214
and guide it
to the surface.

702
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,216
It's dangerous enough
to meld with one person,

703
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,385
let alone hundreds of
different personalities.

704
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,386
It's too risky.

705
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,054
The risk is
mine to take.

706
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,181
I'm aware of that, but
is this our only option?

707
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,683
I believe it is, Captain.

708
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,309
How long would you
need to prepare?

709
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,602
Captain...

710
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,479
you can't actually be
considering this...

711
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,064
Vulcan mumbo jumbo.

712
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,066
I will require two
hours of meditation.

713
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,609
Begin immediately.

714
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,319
Report to Sick Bay
when you're ready.

715
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,863
You said it yourself.

716
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,614
We've exhausted
every medical treatment.

717
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,867
I just hope I don't find
myself with a second patient.

718
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,451
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Captain to the Bridge.</i>

719
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,494
On my way.

720
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,372
Commander?

721
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,249
It's them-- Species 6339.

722
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,876
Their vessel
is well-armed, Captain.

723
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,544
I'm picking up
22 phaser cannons

724
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,837
on the aft section alone.

725
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,129
Hail them.

726
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,256
They're responding.

727
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,841
On screen.

728
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,301
I'm Captain Janeway

729
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,012
of the Federation Starship
<i>Voyager.</i>

730
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,891
We recently found a piece
of Borg technology.

731
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,184
It's been infected
with a viral agent

732
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,853
we believe was
transmitted by your...

733
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,813
The vinculum.
You have it?

734
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,107
Yes.

735
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,485
You've made
a terrible mistake, Captain.

736
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,820
A weapon?

737
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,697
Yes. Since the Borg
decimated our world,

738
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,116
we've been looking
for ways to retaliate.

739
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,244
So you created a virus
to infect their technology.

740
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,872
13 of my people were
injected with the virus.

741
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,916
They allowed themselves
to be assimilated

742
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,668
so that the virus would spread
to this vinculum.

743
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,629
Once another Borg ship
had retrieved it,

744
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,422
they would be infected as well.

745
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,382
Then another cube,
and another...

746
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,801
We had the opportunity

747
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,303
to infect dozens, even
hundreds of Borg vessels

748
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,805
until you interfered!

749
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,180
Why?

750
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,392
Your virus has had one
unexpected casualty...

751
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,102
a member of my crew.

752
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,480
It wasn't designed
to infect other species.

753
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,689
She's Borg.

754
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,316
CHAKOTAY:
We liberated her

755
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,234
from the Collective
over a year ago.

756
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,527
She's an individual now.

757
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,863
We were hoping you could
help us treat her.

758
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:14,409
We designed that virus
to destroy Borg, Captain.

759
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,036
We never considered a treatment.

760
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,415
I'm afraid your
drone won't survive,

761
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,836
but we must return the vinculum
to the debris field immediately.

762
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:27,297
If the Borg arrive first,
we'll have lost our chance.

763
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,592
And those 13 people
will have died in vain.

764
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,095
All right.
We'll return it to you,

765
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,098
but first we need to try
to save our crew member.

766
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,433
We think we have a way

767
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,310
to counteract
the vinculum's effects.

768
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,478
B'Elanna?

769
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,980
I'm going to try
to remodulate

770
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,648
our dampening field
to compensate...

771
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,566
We don't have
time for this.

772
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,819
The vinculum, Captain.

773
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,154
I can't give it to you.

774
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,113
Not yet.

775
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,199
You've scanned our vessel.

776
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,035
You're aware of our firepower.

777
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,414
You could undoubtedly do
significant damage to<i> Voyager</i>

778
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,208
and to the vinculum.

779
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,002
Is that what you want?

780
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:11,424
The vinculum survived
the destruction of one ship.

781
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,053
What makes you so sure
it won't survive another?

782
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,482
Doctor...

783
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,525
Seven.

784
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,278
A necessary precaution.

785
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,741
A few of your... guests
have been violent.

786
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,116
The vinculum.

787
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,326
It keeps adapting.

788
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,954
We haven't been able
to shut it down.

789
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,666
Your own neural pattern was
nearly destroyed in the process.

790
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,586
I wasn't sure
I'd find you again.

791
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,671
I am damaged.

792
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,965
One of your... personas

793
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,342
didn't appreciate
the restraints.

794
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,596
She seemed intent on forcing
her way to freedom.

795
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,973
I apologize.

796
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,975
It was hardly your fault.
You're ill.

797
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,393
Irrelevant.

798
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,353
I am Borg--
I should be able to adapt.

799
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,230
Surprise--
you aren't invincible.

800
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,983
I suppose that's something
we'll have to tackle

801
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,651
in our next social lesson.

802
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,655
(<i> voices yelling and screaming)</i>

803
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,491
Voices?

804
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,660
They're getting louder.

805
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,205
It won't be long
before I lose you again.

806
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,791
(<i> voices fade away</i> )

807
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,667
It's my duty as
your physician

808
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,628
to inform you of an
alternative treatment.

809
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,088
What treatment?

810
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,381
Commander Tuvok has
proposed a mind-meld

811
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,675
to help stabilize
your neural pattern.

812
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,385
I had a
similar reaction.

813
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,637
If you don't approve...

814
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,305
What is the probability
of success?

815
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,932
I don't know.

816
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,392
A mind-meld is hardly
a standard medical practice.

817
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,561
Are there any risks to Tuvok?

818
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,146
He could suffer
brain damage,

819
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,024
but he's confident he'll
be able to break the meld

820
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,901
before that happens.

821
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,070
Even if we do
shut down the vinculum,

822
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,363
it may not be enough.

823
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,825
If Tuvok can do
anything to help me...

824
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,076
I understand.

825
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,162
Doctor...

826
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,666
you have shown
a great deal of patience.

827
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,417
Not at all.

828
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:14,006
Inform the crew that I am
also grateful for their efforts.

829
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:16,591
You'll be able
to tell them yourself afterward.

830
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,135
(<i> voices yelling</i>
<i>and screaming</i> )

831
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,427
Seven!

832
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,428
Voices!

833
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,721
Concentrate.

834
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,181
(<i> groaning</i> )

835
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,142
Focus on the
sound of<i> my</i> voice.

836
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:26,977
Get them out, please!

837
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,312
I can't...

838
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,065
I can't...

839
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,693
No! No!

840
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,240
(<i> voices fade away</i> )

841
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,254
Report.

842
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,715
The alien vessel
is coming about.

843
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,383
They're charging weapons.

844
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,759
Shields.

845
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,975
As if the meld weren't
dangerous enough,

846
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,728
the aliens are trying
to take the vinculum by force.

847
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,521
Commander Chakotay
is at tactical.

848
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,231
The Captain wants
you here with Seven.

849
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,440
This will allow me

850
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,859
to monitor your
neural activity

851
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,276
for the duration
of the meld.

852
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,737
At the first
sign of trouble...

853
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,738
You will do nothing.

854
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,198
I beg your pardon?

855
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,825
There will undoubtedly be
many signs of trouble.

856
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,452
You must have faith
in my ability to endure them.

857
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,913
I'll try. I just
hope my faith

858
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,373
doesn't leave the two
of you brain-damaged.

859
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,417
Your concerns
have been noted, Doctor.

860
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,878
With all of these new
personalities floating around,

861
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,838
it's a shame
we can't find one for you.

862
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,048

Why am I tied
to this bed?

866
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,515
Please let me go.

Ten bars of latinum?

872
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,069
Twenty?

873
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,529
This isn't medicine.
It's torture!

874
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,573
I'll sue for malpractice!

875
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,453
I fail to see the logic
in this meld, Commander.

876
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,788
My mind to your mind.

877
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,748
You are but one mind
confronting thousands.

My thoughts
to your thoughts.

879
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,794
You will not succeed.

880
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,630
TUVOK: Your mind to my mind.
SEVEN: Let me go.

881

My mind to your mind.

882
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,507
We've got to evacuate.

00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,509
My thoughts to your thoughts.
Listen to me!!

(<i> sobbing</i> ):
I'm lost! Somebody help me!

904
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,416
Please! I don't like it here!

905
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,584
I want to go home!

906
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,128
I can't find my...

907
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,880
Mommy! Please! Help me!

908
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,382
Please! I don't
want to stay here!

909
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,051
I want to go home!
I don't like it!

910
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,636
Please help me!
I want to go home!

911
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,848
These people are scary!
Please don't go!

912
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,808
Please! Why are you
leaving me here?!

913
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,560
Don't go!

914
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,979
Please! I don't
like it here!

(<i> gasping</i> )

917
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,109
Sick Bay to Engineering.

918
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,944
How long until the vinculum's
off-line?

919
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,488
Two, maybe three minutes...

920
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,783
provided<i> Voyager</i> can stay
in one piece for that long.

921

Shields down to 60 percent.

922
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,416
Evasive maneuvers.

923
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,792
Target their
weapons array.

924
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,587
Targeting systems
are malfunctioning.

925
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,923
We're losing power
to main thrusters.

926
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,424
Shields to 35 percent.

927
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,260
Reroute all available
power to shields.

928
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,345
Chakotay, initiate
manual targeting.

929
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,804
Torres to Bridge.

930
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,639
The vinculum's stopped adapting.

931
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,975
I think the new dampening field
is working.

932
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,477
We should have it disabled
in the next 60 seconds.

933
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,480
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning. Neurochemical synapses</i>

Unable to comply. Power
transport systems are off-line.

936
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,364
Tuvok, if you can hear me,
we have to terminate the meld.

937
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,074

(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

950
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,208
Bridge, we just lost
the field emitters.

951
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,627
We took a direct hit
to the power grid.

952
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,339
Stand by. We're switching
to emergency backup.

953
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,516
Seven!

954
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,648
Bridge, the vinculum's
powering up again.

JANEWAY:
The field emitters
are back on line.

956
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,235
Pull the plug.

957
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,823
It's working.

958

TORRES:
It's done, Captain.

967
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,970
The vinculum's off-line.

968
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,474

Yes.

DOCTOR:
We have her back, Captain.

973
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,159
Hail the lead vessel.

974
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,245
Tell them we're surrendering
the vinculum.

975
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,123
No response.

976
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,583
Lock onto the damn thing.

977
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,085
Beam it into space.

978
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,839
CHAKOTAY:
Transport complete.

979
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,593
They're withdrawing.

980
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,970
Take us out of here, Tom.
Warp 9.

981
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,097
Yes, ma'am.

985
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:38,157
DOCTOR:
Neuroprocessor, cortical
receptors, all stable.

986
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,825
She's fit
to return to duty.

987
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,536
What about her other
personalities?

988
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,579
Any sign of them?

989
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:43,955
Those neural patterns

990
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,082
have returned to
their dormant state.

991
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,167
The voices will not return?

992
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,921
I suppose that depends
on your perspective.

993
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,214
You may not hear them,

994
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,508
but I suspect they'll
always be with you.

995
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,766
The members of this crew put
themselves at risk to help me.

996
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,894
I am unsure how to reciprocate.

997
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,813
Let's start with
something small.

998
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,441
Like a recalibration
of the EPS manifolds?

999
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,901
B'Elanna's expecting
you in Engineering.

1000
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,154
I will join her shortly.

1001
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,740
There is a crew member
I must see first.

1002
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,913
These are star charts for
the next three systems

1003
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,583
<i>Voyager</i> will pass through.
Familiarize yourself with them.

Study it.
I will.

1007
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,256
As Bridge Assistant,

1008
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,049
you will find this
information relevant.

1009
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,218
Consider it
"assimilated."

1010
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,137
There is one more
assignment.

1011
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,764
I require
your assistance.

1012
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,600
Me?

1013
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,521
I wish to participate
in recreational activities.

1014
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,230
Great.

1015
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,567
Kadis-Kot.

1016
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,111
Instruct me how to play.

1017
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,113
I will comply.
