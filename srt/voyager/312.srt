00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,629
Good health, strong body,

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,214
And you.
Your hospitality,

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,926
your generosity,
your patience.

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,469
Many thanks.

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,221
My colleague's behavior...

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,056
our apologies.

7
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,434
Consul, I assure you,
I intended...

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,186
Please make her quiet.

9
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,479
Captain, please.

10
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,939
I understand.

11
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,192
Good health, strong body,
clear mind.

12
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,987
And you.

13
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:32,282
Your journey home
short and safe.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,543
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50425.1.</i>

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,379
<i>Mr. Neelix and I have completed</i>
<i>our three-day trade mission</i>

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>with the Tak Tak,</i>

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,924

<i>We are en route</i>

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,932
Oh...

21
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,810
I've always been taught
to be tolerant

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,603
of other cultures
and points of view--

23
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,104
no matter how alien--

24
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,606
but I have to say
that the Tak Tak

25
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,191
are the most
unforgiving people

26
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,651
I've ever met.

27
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,403
They are a little impatient.

28
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,780
They make the Klingons
look sedate.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,366
I may never put my hands
on my hips again.

30
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,910
You had no way of knowing

31
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,246
you were making one
of the worst insults possible.

32
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,623
Obviously, they've never
heard of "forgive and forget."

33
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,792
It's a good thing you
were there, Mr. Neelix.

34
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,419
I might have been shot at dawn.

35
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,129
I have studied
chromolinguistics,

36
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,464
American Sign Language,

37
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,051
the gestural idioms
of the Leyron,

38
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,762
but I just couldn't get the hang
of the Tak Tak.

39
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,515
It seemed like more than just
a language to me, Captain.

40
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,434
A lot of their gestures,

41
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,853
from what I could tell,
were ritualistic--

42
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,730
you might even say
superstitious.

43
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,650
You have a genuine flair
for diplomacy, Mr. Neelix.

44
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,945
I may have to promote you...

45
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:54,073
from morale officer
to ambassador.

46
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,699
With all the species
we're bound to meet,

47
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:59,327
I could use a man like you
at the front door.

48
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,455
Ambassador Neelix.

49
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,498
I like the sound of that.

50
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,667
(<i> console beeping</i> )

51
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,087
We're approaching
the rendezvous coordinates.

52
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:12,257
Dropping to
one-quarter impulse.

53
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,759
<i>Voyager's</i> not there.

54
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,385
And they're not responding
to hails.

55
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,139
I'm running
a long-range scan.

56
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,474
There they are.

57
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,768
They're holding position
in Sector 3-8.

58
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,395
Coordinates 121 mark 6.

59
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,898
That's over a light-year
away from here.

60
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,733
The ship appears
to be adrift.

61
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,485
They could be in trouble.

62
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,862
Engaging maximum warp.

63
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,412
Janeway to<i> Voyager.</i>

64
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,999
Commander Chakotay, respond.

65
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,794
The ship looks
perfectly fine.

66
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,963
There's no sign
of any external damage.

67
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,464
Is there any sign
of the crew?

68
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,758
There's some kind
of bioelectric interference.

69
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,218
I can't get clear
life sign readings.

70
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,638
The escape pods are all in place

71
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,765
and there's no
indication of any recent

72
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,182
transporter activity.

73
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,560
Grab a phaser, Ambassador.

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,896
We're going to get some answers.

75
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,393
Still no sign of the crew,

76
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,021
but these sensor readings
are highly erratic.

77
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,065
The bioelectric field
is permeating the ship.

78
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,691
Where's it coming from?

79
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,277
I can't localize it.

80
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,238
Let's try accessing
the ship's internal sensors.

81
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,449
See if we can get
a better reading.

82
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,835
Same problem.

83
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,878
The main computer's off-line.

84
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,880
So is the com system.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,133
This is strange.

86
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,303
One of the bio-neural gel packs
in the Mess Hall ruptured,

87
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:48,723
but most of the systems in there
seem to be functioning normally.

88
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,518
Let's get to the Bridge.

89
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,150
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

90
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,656
Someone was doing maintenance
work on this power relay.

91
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,741
All the equipment
is still active,

92
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,244
but the work hasn't
been completed.

93
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,745
It's almost as if
they dropped

94
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,540
what they were
doing and ran.

95
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,667
Come on.

96
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,255
This certainly isn't

97
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,216
the welcome home
I was expecting.

98
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,177
Me neither, but if there was
an attack of some kind,

99
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,137
why didn't Chakotay
try to contact us

100
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,347
or send out a warning buoy?

101
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,098
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

102
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,517
I'm picking up a com signal
about ten meters ahead.

103
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,773
It's coming from
inside this room.

104
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,193
This is Ensign Wildman's
quarters.

105
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,278
Is she in there?

106
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,738
I can't tell.

107
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,283
Let's take a look.
Stand ready.

108
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,912
NEELIX:
<i>Coming up next,</i>

109
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,622
<i>our very special guest--</i>
<i>Ensign Kaplan.</i>

110
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,209
<i>She's going</i>
<i>to be sharing her...</i>

111
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,668
Here's our com signal--

112
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,712
your<i> Good Morning,</i>
<i>Voyager</i> program.

113
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:04,174
Ensign Wildman is one
of my most dedicated viewers.

114
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,052
According
to the time index,

115
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,680
she activated this program
approximately 11 hours ago.

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,099
Why is it still running?

117
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,017
The program is set
for automatic playback

118
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,852
until it's turned off.

119
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,402
The baby's missing, too.

120
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,819
According to the
protein decay,

121
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,197
I'd say Ensign Wildman
replicated this...

122
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,408
11 hours ago.

123
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,700
When we get to the Bridge,

124
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,035
we'll check the
communications logs.

125
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,412
They might tell us
whether or not...

126
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,040
(<i> low-frequency buzzing</i> )

127
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,296
There!

128
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,090
I can't tell if it's humanoid,

129
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,050
but it's emanating
a bioelectric field.

130
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,804
Whatever it is, it just
ran into a dead end.

131
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,639
(<i> clanking</i> )

132
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,864
Over here.

133
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,666
Something just punched
right through this floor panel

134
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,209
into the Jefferies tubes.

135
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,753
What is it?

136
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,922
Some sort of mucilaginous
compound.

137
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,259
High concentrations
of amino acids, proteins...

138
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,096
and fragments
of non-humanoid DNA.

139
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,431
Well, Ambassador,

140
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,726
I'd say we've got
an unexpected guest.

141
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:43,231
Somehow, I don't think
he's the diplomatic type.

142
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,859
(<i> console beeping</i> )

143
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,949
Main power is failing

144
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,244
and the environmental controls
are going off-line.

145
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,872
Systems are starting
to shut down one by one.

146
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,291
We'd better get to the Bridge.

147
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,225
Good. We've still
got auxiliary power.

148
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,518
Deck 1.

149
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,478
It's getting awfully hot
in here.

150
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,480
When environmental
controls fail,

151
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,440
heat from the warp plasma
conduits can't be vented.

152
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,401
Expect a heat wave
before long.

153
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,403
No problem.
I'm used to it.

154
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,779
I grew up near
the Rinax marshlands.

155
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,740
Our summers were the hottest
in the sector--

156
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,911
50 degrees Celsius,
90 percent humidity--

157
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,788
And the most vicious lavaflies
you've ever seen.

158
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,665
Summers in Indiana
were pretty similar

159
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,833
when I was growing up.

160
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,710
Except that
we had three suns,

161
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,422
and the lavaflies grew to be
six centimeters long.

162
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,714
Six centimeters, eh?

163
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,509
Insect repellent
was a booming business.

00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,557
There's a life-form
in the turboshaft.

167
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,601
I'm engaging
the manual override.

it sounds like our guest
has brought a few friends.

One more second.

(<i> loud thud</i> )

175
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,040
That was no lavafly.

176
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,711
There's no life-form
in the tube above us.

177
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,005
We're getting out of here.

178
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,479
Are you all right?

179
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,941
Yes. Disgusting,
but all right.

180
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,776
That's the same
mucilaginous compound

181
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,987
we saw in the
transporter room.

182
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,156
Come on.

183
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,550
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

184
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,759
What is it?

185
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,429
Human life signs.

186
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,973
Very faint.
30 or more.

187
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,724
Where are they coming from?

188
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,602
Several decks above us.

189
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,312
I can't pinpoint the location.

190
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,189
Maybe the crew
is hiding from the aliens

191
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,857
and they set up
a defense perimeter.

192
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,652
Maybe.
One thing's for sure--

193
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:37,656
whoever's up there,
they're still alive.

194
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,782
Once we get
the main computer on line,

195
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,244
we'll be able to get a fix
on their location.

196
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,016
So hot.

197
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,101
My head is spinning.

198
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,062
You've got a high fever,
fluid in your lungs.

199
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,438
Lung.

200
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,065
That alien compound
is acting quickly.

201
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,067
Try to hang on.
Just three more decks.

202
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,402
Aye, aye, Captain...

203
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,323
Captain, go on
without me.

204
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,575
I'm not going to
leave you here, Neelix.

205
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,285
I can't.
I'm so dizzy.

206
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,705
There should be an emergency
medical kit up that tube.

207
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,873
I'll bring back something
to get you on your feet.

208
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,375
Don't go away.

209
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,799
(<i> panting</i> )

210
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,068
(<i> faint buzzing</i> )

211
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,330
(<i> buzzing intensifies</i> )

212
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,801
(<i> loud buzzing</i> )

213
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,346
NEELIX:
Help! Captain!

214
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,682
I'm coming, Neelix!

215
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,647
(<i> intense buzzing</i> )

216
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,191
(<i> Neelix screaming</i> )

217
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,110
Neelix!

218
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,672
(<i> distant thudding</i> )

219
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,890
(<i> clattering</i> )

220
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,548
(<i> thudding</i> )

221
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,076
(<i> keypad beeping</i> )

222
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,958
(<i> buzzing</i> )

223
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,352
(<i> buzzing</i> )

224
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,490
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

225
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,576
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager</i>

226
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,952
to anyone within range.

227
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,287
My ship has been seized
by unknown life-forms.

228
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,790
Require any and all assistance.

229
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,877
(<i> buzzing approaching</i> )

230
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,796
(<i> console beeping</i> )

231
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,299
(<i> buzzing intensifies</i> )

232
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,387
( gasps )

233
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,251
(<i> console beeping</i> )

234
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,502
(<i> faint coughing</i> )

235
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,140
( coughing )

236
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,620
( raspy moaning )

237
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,373
Harry...

238
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,708
Harry?

239
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,769
Chakotay.

240
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,990
(<i> buzzing</i> )

241
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,758
(<i> groaning</i> )

242
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,053
(<i> coughing</i> )

243
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,348
(<i> panting</i> )

244
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,566
(<i> keypad beeps denial</i> )

245
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,317
(<i> sighs</i> )

246
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,501
(<i> grunting</i> )

247
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,799
Captain.

248
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,342
Needless to say, I-I thought
you were something else.

249
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,437
It won't be long before
the other aliens sense you here

250
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,897
and try to invade Sick Bay.

251
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,857
We don't have much time
to treat you.

252
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,986
Doctor, what's going on?
What are tho...?

253
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,612
(<i> groans</i> )

254
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,116
You've ruptured
your dorsal extensor muscle

255
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,659
and bruised two ribs.

256
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,452
I'm going to have to
perform minor surgery.

257
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,580
Lie on your side and try to
remain perfectly still.

258
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,167
Oh...
Tell me what's happened.

259
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,460
<i>Voyager</i> has been infected
by a macrovirus.

260
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,212
A macrovirus?

261
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,423
A form of life I've never
encountered or even imagined.

262
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,758
What about the crew?

263
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,260
Captain...

264
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,179
I promise, I will tell you
exactly what happened

265
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,972
if you just lie still.

266
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,891
Shortly after you'd left
for the Tak Tak homeworld,

267
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,312
we received a distress call
from a nearby mining colony,

268
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,522
a race called the Garans.

269
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,149
<i>They were experiencing</i>

270
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,068
<i>what appeared to be</i>
<i>a minor viral outbreak.</i>

271
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,946
<i>Fever...</i>
<i>disorientation.</i>

272
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,241
<i>I think it's</i>
<i>some kind of virus.</i>

273
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,744
<i>Nothing serious,</i>
<i>but if we don't stop it now,</i>

274
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,664
<i>we'll be forced</i>
<i>to shut down the operation.</i>

275
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,499
We may be able to help you.
Doctor?

276
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,626
A synthetic antigen
may do the trick.

277
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,670
However, it<i> will</i>
<i>have to be modified</i>

278
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,130
for the specific virus.

279
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,840
I'd like to beam down
to the mining colony

280
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,218
and examine
a few of the infected.

281
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,011
An away mission.

282
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,096
I'm the only member of this crew
who can successfully enter

283
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,140
a contaminated environment
without risk.

284
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,934
Besides, I've been
looking forward

285
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,811
to spreading
my wings.

286
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,479
Good enough.

287
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,191
It'll take us about
three hours to reach you.

288
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,775
Thank you, Commander.

289
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,779
I don't think we'll...
be going anywhere.

290
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,157
Prepare to download
my program

291
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,491
into the autonomous
emitter.

292
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,826
Yes, Doctor.

293
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,791
They're not responding
to our hails.

294
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,252
Life signs.

295
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,587
There's a lot
of bioelectric interference.

296
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,214
I can't get a clear reading.

297
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,548
Perhaps their condition

298
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,175
is more serious
than they thought.

299
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,634
I better get down there.

300
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,469
Doctor, don't forget.
You're not invulnerable.

301
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,264
If anything happens
to that portable emitter,

302
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,140
your program could be lost.
Don't worry, Commander.

303
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,351
I've been studying
the Starfleet guidelines

304
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,852
for away-team members.

305
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,354
For this particular
scenario--

306
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,689
Medical Emergency
on Alien Terrain--

307
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,776
it is recommended we keep an
open com channel at all times.

308
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,403
You heard the man.

309
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,364
Channel open.

310
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,415
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>

311
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:18,832
Transport was successful,

312
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,044
and my portable emitter
is working perfectly.

313
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,505
I am scanning the mine shaft
and proceeding on vector 1-4-7.

314
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:29,176
Ambient temperature
is 16 degrees Celsius.

315
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,304
Cavern illumination is minimal,

316
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,639
but shouldn't pose a problem
for my optical sensors.

317
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,808
The cave walls
are comprised of granite

318
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,435
with a mixture of pyroclastic...

319
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,687
Doctor, I appreciate
your attention to detail,

320
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,231
but we don't need
that much information.

321
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,191
Let us know when
you've found the miners.

322
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,525
Oh. Very well.

323
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,403
Stand by then.

324
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,656
(<i> moaning gasps</i> )

325
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,075
<i>Voyager,</i> I've found
one of the miners.

326
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,875
He appears to be suffering

327
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,378
from the advanced stages
of severe viral infection.

328
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,213
CHAKOTAY:
Can you treat him?

329
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,632
Not without a more specialized
immunizing agent.

330
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,805
This is curious.

331
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,556
The virus has begun
to concentrate

332
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,058
in a region near his neck,

333
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,643
and it's using
his glandular tissue

334
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,771
to create some sort of...
orifice.

335
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,441
(<i> faint buzzing</i> )

336
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,443
Something is emerging.

337
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,990
A life-form.

338
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,036
Commander, I think
I've just discovered

339
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,498
a completely new form of life.

340
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,708
From what I can tell,
it appears to be...

341
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,294
a macroscopic
version of the virus.

342
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,544
You mean the virus has grown.

343
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:50,174
Yes.
By a factor of billions.

344
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:54,011
The virus absorbed
the miner's growth hormones

345
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,846
into its protein structure

346
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,265
and used them to increase
its own mass and dimensions.

347
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,518
In essence,
the virus has found a way

348
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,102
to leave the microscopic world

349
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,190
and enter the macroscopic
world-- our world.

350
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,485
It's a remarkable
evolutionary development.

351
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,951
The virus appears to be
attracted to infrared radiation.

352
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,663
It's mistaking my holo-matrix
for body heat.

353
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,336
At the moment,
this one's approximately

354
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,797
.5 millimeters in diameter,
but it's continuing to grow

355
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,008
at a rate
of 30 microns every second.

356
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,968
Commander, permission
to beam the virus aboard

357
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,220
for further analysis.

358
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,972
No. The virus
isn't in our database.

359
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,640
The biofilters
might not recognize it.

360
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,560
You'll have to settle
for tricorder data.

361
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,144
Very well,
but I think I should...

362
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,812
(<i> rustling</i> )

363
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,359
Stand by,<i> Voyager.</i>

364
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,529
(<i> gasping</i> )

365
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,282
Hold on. Stop.

366
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,743
You... you've
got to help us.

367
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,537
I intend to, but first
I must return to my ship

368
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,829
and prepare an antidote.

369
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,081
Oh, take me with you.

370
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,583
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

371
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,959
We'd risk infecting
the crew.

372
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,253
You can't...

373
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,879
leave me.

374
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,090
(<i> moaning</i> )

375
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,468
Please.

376
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,596
Commander Chakotay,

377
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,598
perhaps if we established
a force field around Sick Bay

378
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,349
and beamed victims directly...

379
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,059
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
we can't take the chance.

380
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,561
But these people need...

381
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,897
Doctor, away team guidelines
specifically forbid

382
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,899
the transport
of unknown infectious...

383
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,234
Of unknown infectious agents

384
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,777
onto a starship
without establishing

385
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,904
containment
and eradication protocols.

386
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,324
I understand.

387
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,330
I'll do my best to help you.

388
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,540
Away team to<i> Voyager.</i>

389
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,000
One to beam up.

390
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,257
Doctor to Bridge.

391
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,343
Checking the biofilters.

392
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,848
It appears
several viral organisms

393
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,057
were beamed up as well.

394
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,101
The biofilter
has isolated them.

395
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,311
Purge the filters.

396
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,895
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

397
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:12,316
Purging is complete.
I'll be in Sick Bay.

398
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,234
<i>What I didn't realize</i>

399
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,736
<i>was that, in the few seconds it</i>
<i>took me to purge the filters,</i>

400
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,696
<i>some of the virus</i>
<i>had already migrated</i>

401
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,116
<i>into the transporter buffer.</i>

402
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,326
Any luck?

403
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,328
I'm creating
a synthetic antigen

404
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,872
that will inhibit the virus'
ability to replicate,

405
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,040
but I haven't quite figured out

406
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,791
how to restore
the infected cells

407
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,502
to their
original condition.

408
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,753
As for the larger versions
of the viruses--

409
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,215
what I've termed
the macrovirus--

410
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,758
I would suggest a flyswatter.

411
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,760
How long
before the antigen's ready?

412
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,929
I'd say another 12 hours.

413
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,306
That gives us time

414
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,807
to rendezvous
with the Captain.

415
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,184
We'll deal with this
after she's aboard.

416
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,145
Commander,
I'd like to apologize

417
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,189
for my overzealous behavior
on the away mission.

418
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,526
Compassion is nothing
to be sorry about, Doctor.

419
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,152
It won't be the last
time you're faced

420
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,445
with a moral dilemma
in the field.

421
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,364
But if it makes you
feel any better,

422
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,617
your performance
was... exemplary.

423
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,118
Thank you.

424
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,996
I told you he'd understand.

425
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,709
Yes. You did.

426
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,711
<i>We continued working</i>
<i>on the antigen.</i>

427
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,630
<i>Unfortunately, the macrovirus</i>
<i>was working faster.</i>

428
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,007
<i>It had already moved</i>
<i>from the transporter buffer</i>

429
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,719
<i>into an adjacent system.</i>

430
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,644
B'Elanna,
thank God you're here.

431
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,271
The natives
are getting restless.

432
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,647
What's the emergency?

433
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,232
Well, I volunteered

434
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,443
to help out while Neelix
is away on the trade mission.

435
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,111
The heating array overloaded.

436
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,863
It incinerated
a 12-kilo pot roast

437
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,865
and all the food replicators
went off-line.

438
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,492
Mmm. Looks delicious.

439
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,077
Maybe there's a problem

440
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,622
with the bio-neural gel pack
in the replicator panel.

441
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,708
Actually...

442
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,419
I'm a pretty<i> good</i> cook when
Engineering's doing its job.

443
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,045
(<i> laughs</i> )

444
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,005
Oh, so this is<i> my</i> fault.

445
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,383
Well, the gel packs are
your department, aren't they?

446
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,469
Besides, what was
I supposed to tell

447
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,929
all these hungry,
irritable people?

448
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,348
You know, I think that there's
a plasma relay on Deck 7

449
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,891
that really needs repairs.

450
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,394
Oh, no, you can't
leave me now, Lieutenant.

451
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,397
Oh, you need me.
I'm touched.

452
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,736
What's going on here?

453
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,656
It looks like this gel pack
has an infection.

454
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,699
Half the neurodes
have been burned out

455
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,075
and the pack is filled with

456
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,620
some kind of
mucilaginous compound.

457
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,206
Tom, call the Doctor
and tell him...

458
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,083
B'Elanna.

459
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,305
Were any other
gel packs infected?

460
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,140
No. Just the one
in the Mess Hall.

461
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,475
The ship is healthy.

462
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,310
It's the crew
we have to worry about.

463
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,479
Your bones have healed,
but the surrounding tissue

464
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,523
will be sensitive
for a few days.

465
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,399
(<i> groaning</i> )

466
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,984
It's getting warmer in here.

467
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,612
I'm afraid it's not
just the ship, Captain.

468
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,988
It's also you.

469
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,532
You've been infected
with the macrovirus.

470
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,200
You're experiencing
a high fever.

471
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,828
Yes, on the Bridge, I was
bitten by one of them.

472
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:13,997
Your glandular system
is already being affected.

473
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,666
If I don't treat you now,

474
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:19,461
you'll end up like
the rest of the crew.

475
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,756
I've spent the past few hours
perfecting the antigen...

476
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,592
but I haven't tested it
on a live subject yet.

477
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,178
Looks like I'll have to be
your guinea pig, Doctor.

478
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,347
The crew-- why are they
all in the Mess Hall

479
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,849
and the cargo bays?

480
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,851
I believe
the larger macroviruses

481
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,853
are driven
by some sort of instinct

482
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,813
to assemble
their host population.

483
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,940
Tell me what happened
after B'Elanna was exposed

484
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,694
to the infected gel pack.

485
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:47,197
I was faced
with an imminent epidemic.

486
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,747
Oh, no.

487
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,832
Doctor to the Bridge.

488
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,125
The macrovirus
is on board<i> Voyager</i>

489
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,461
and appears to be... airborne.

490
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,380
I suggest a level-4 quarantine
of the Mess Hall

491
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,923
<i>and all adjoining sections.</i>

492
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,425
Acknowledged. Red Alert.

493
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,886
Initiate level-4 quarantine
protocols on Deck 2.

494
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,220
Aye, sir.

495
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,099
All hands,
this is Commander Chakotay.

496
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,935
We've detected an airborne virus
in the Mess Hall.

497
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,311
Deck 2 is under quarantine.

498
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,022
No crew member--
repeat--no crew member

499
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,817
is to leave or enter
any section on Deck 2.

500
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,527
Stand by for further
instructions.

501
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,320
I've erected
the biocontainment fields.

502
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,239
The area has been sealed.

503
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,909
DOCTOR:
<i>We managed to avoid</i>
<i>a shipwide outbreak,</i>

504
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,036
<i>but every crew member on Deck 2</i>
<i>had been contaminated.</i>

505
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,206
<i>I collected a single live</i>
<i>specimen of the macrovirus</i>

506
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:42,669
<i>and returned to Sick Bay</i>
<i>in hopes of finding a cure.</i>

507
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,045
Ready, Doctor.

508
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,131
Optimal magnification.

509
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,300
The specimen
has synthesized

510
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,594
B'Elanna's growth hormone
into its own structure.

511
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,554
Excellent.
That should give us

512
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,097
the information we need
to destroy the virus

513
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,767
without killing
its host cells.

514
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,815
The virus has grown
by 150 microns.

515
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,275
Its rate of growth
shouldn't hinder our analysis,

516
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,862
as long as its genetic structure
stays the same.

517
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,910
Doctor...

518
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,370
Computer, erect
a level-3 force field

519
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,915
around the microscope station.

520
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,717
(<i> groaning</i> )

521
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,719
Well, so much for lunch.

522
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,972
(<i> moaning</i> )

523
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,349
I may never look
at food again.

524
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,769
I thought Klingons
didn't get nauseated.

525
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,563
You have
a redundant stomach.

526
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,191
Well, right now...

527
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,443
they're both unhappy.

528
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,531
(<i> groaning</i> )

529
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,585
Paris to Sick Bay.

530
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,420
DOCTOR:
<i>Go ahead, Lieutenant.</i>

531
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,840
I just saw two macroviruses
come out of B'Elanna's neck.

532
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,257
<i>Stand by, Mr. Paris.</i>

533
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,092
We're close to formulating
an antigen.

534
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,930
The virus has grown
to .3 meters.

535
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,141
On the microscopic level,

536
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,019
the virus uses that
needle-like projection

537
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,645
to penetrate a cell membrane.

538
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,647
On our level,
it probably impales

539
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,399
its victim
in much the same way

540
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,693
infusing him
with its own genetic code.

541
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,069
(<i> beeping</i> )

542
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,946
The antigen is ready.

543
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,032
Kes...

544
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:42,330
Computer,
deactivate force field.

545
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,293
(<i> buzzing angrily</i> )

546
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,337
(<i> hypospray whooshes</i> )

547
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,549
Well...

548
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,722
one down, ten billion to go.

549
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,560
<i>Eager to inoculate</i>
<i>those already infected,</i>

550
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,938
<i>I quickly headed</i>
<i>for the quarantined area.</i>

551
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,606
<i>Though their condition</i>
<i>had grown worse,</i>

552
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,692
<i>it was the least</i>
<i>of our problems.</i>

553
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,027
Lieutenant...

554
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,737
if you can hear me,

555
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,782
I'm going to give you
an injection.

556
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,617
It should eliminate
the virus.

557
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,787
What? What is that?

558
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,747
(<i> low-pitched buzzing</i> )

559
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,916
You don't want to know.

560
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,056
Doctor to the Bridge.
Intruder alert.

561
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,475
Deck 2, Section 13.

562
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,144
<i>Within minutes,</i>
<i>dozens of the larger organisms</i>

563
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,731
<i>forced their way beyond Deck 2</i>
<i>and overwhelmed the ship.</i>

564
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,275
It wasn't long before
the crew was incapacitated.

565
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,903
Although I've developed
an effective vaccine,

566
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,571
I can't administer it.

567
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,657
Every time I try to get
to the crew, I'm attacked.

568
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,533
Perhaps with your help.

569
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,787
How many of the larger
macroviruses are there?

570
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,455
I have no way of knowing.

571
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,832
Dozens, perhaps hundreds.

572
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,416
They're replicating
at an exponential rate.

573
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,543
By this time tomorrow,
there could be thousands.

574
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,171
(<i> low-pitched buzzing,</i>
<i>thumping</i> )

575
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,923
Speak of the devil.

576
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,598
You're cured.

577
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,850
The question is:

578
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,602
How do we cure
the rest of the crew?

579
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,147
This antigen--
can it be distributed

580
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,648
in a gaseous form?

581
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,525
For absorption via
the respiratory system?

582
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,152
I've already considered
dispensing it

583
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,611
through environmental
controls.

584
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,863
But they're off-line

585
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,489
and I have limited
engineering expertise.

586
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,199
Leave that to me.
All we have to do

587
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,743
is get to Environmental Control
on Deck 12.

588
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,370
Easier said than done.

589
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,788
We'll run into the same problem
I faced

590
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,206
when I tried to get
to the Mess Hall.

591
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,582
Not if I can help it.

592
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,835
Prepare two canisters
of antigen.

593
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,087
We'll split up and
take different routes

594
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,588
to Environmental Control.

595
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,882
It'll double
our chances.

596
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,551
If you get there first,
call me,

597
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,219
and I'll talk you through
the repairs.

598
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,972
The macroviruses are attracted
to infrared radiation.

599
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,850
Set your tricorder to emit
a thermal scattering signal.

600
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,768
It will make it more difficult
to target you.

601
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,353
Ready when you are.

602
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,481
(<i> buzzing</i>
<i>and thumping continue)</i>

603
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,570
We'll be right with you.

604
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,123
Take Jefferies Tube 11.

605
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,959
What's wrong?

606
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,711
I've been studying
the ship's infrastructure

607
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:35,962
and I'm familiar
with most of it,

608
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,423
but how do I get
there from here?

609
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,925
Jefferies Tube 11.

610
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,634
Take a left at Section 31.

611
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,428
Head straight down
past the tractor beam emitter

612
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,263
until you hit Deck 10.
Get out at Section 3

613
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,556
and follow the corridor
all the way around...

614
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,141
Until I hit
the shuttle bay.

615
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,018
Then I crawl through
Access Port 9,

616
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,187
go past three airlocks
and then two decks down.

617
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,064
Environmental Control's
at the end of the hall.

618
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,481
Now I remember.

619
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,401
Who designed this ship,
anyway?

620
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,861
Good luck.

621
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,992
(<i> distant thumping and buzzing)</i>

622
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,878
(<i> groaning</i> )

623
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,675
(<i> buzzing approaching</i> )

624
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,475
<i>Doctor to Captain Janeway.</i>

625
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,269
Go ahead.

626
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,646
<i>I won't be joining you</i>
<i>as soon as I'd hoped.</i>

627
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,815
The macroviruses overwhelmed me
on Deck 10

628
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,818
and my portable emitter
was nearly destroyed.

629
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:43,905
I've taken refuge inside the
shuttle bay in a shuttlecraft.

630
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,323
Stay put, Doctor.

631
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,367
I'm close
to environmental control.

632
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,595
Janeway to Doctor.

633
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,806
I've got the environmental
controls back on line.

634
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:13,643
Set the dispersal nodes
to one part per thousand.

635
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,605
What's going on?

636
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,608
I'm not sure, but I think
someone's firing at Voyager.

637
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,360
Doctor,
use the shuttle's sensors

638
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,612
to find out what's happening
and patch the data to me.

639
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,239
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

640
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:33,412
It's the Tak Tak.

641
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,167
Doctor, open a channel
and hail their captain.

642
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,543
<i>Stand by.</i>

643
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,920
Consul, this is
Captain Janeway.

644
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,797
Why are you
firing at us?

645
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,050
<i>The Garan mining colony,</i>
<i>infected.</i>

646
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,759
<i>We purified them.</i>

647
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,179
<i>Your distress call received.</i> 
Voyager<i> infected.</i>

648
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,889
<i>We are purifying you.</i>

649
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,349
Purifying?
You're trying to destroy us.

650
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,476
<i>No choice.</i>
<i>No cure for the virus.</i>

651
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,520
Voyager's<i> existence a threat.</i>

652
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,898
<i>Your illness.</i>
<i>Our apologies.</i>

653
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,567
Wait.
We've developed a cure.

654
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,236
But your torpedoes
just stopped us

655
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,029
from getting it to our crew
and putting an end to this.

656
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,780
<i>Cure?</i>

657
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,533
Yes. A synthetic antigen.
We've tested it and it works.

658
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,285
I can prove it to you.

659
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,037
And I'd be willing to share
the antigen with your people,

660
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,497
but first, you've got to
stop attacking my ship.

661
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,124
Give me a chance
to save my crew.

662
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,502
<i>A chance.</i>
<i>One hour.</i>

663
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,966
(<i> console beeps</i> )

664
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,634
Doctor, we've got a problem.

665
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,929
That last torpedo destroyed
the secondary power couplings.

666
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,932
I can't get the environmental
controls back online.

667
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,350
(<i> thumping and thudding</i> )

668
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,894
We appear to be
low on options.

669
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,313
The only systems
we still have access to

670
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,565
are the ones
with independent power sources--

671
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,319
shuttlecraft, life-support,
the holodecks...

672
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,489
Doctor,
you said the macroviruses

673
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,784
are attracted
to infrared signatures.

674
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,535
<i>That's right.</i>

675
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,788
Right now, you and I are
the only targets left on board.

676
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,917
What if we gave them something
new to sink their teeth into?

677
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,295
What are you suggesting?

678
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,963
(<i> steel drum music playing</i> )

679
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,590
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

680
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,806
(<i> buzzing approaching</i> )

681
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,933
(<i> screaming</i> )

682
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,313
(<i> console beeping</i> )

683
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,023
Doctor, it seems to be working.

684
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,359
I've programmed
the holo-characters

685
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,693
to react to the viruses.

686
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,112
We don't have much time.

687
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,030
Grab your hypospray
and get to the crew.

688
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,490
You've got a clear path
to the Mess Hall

689
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,075
and both cargo bays.

690
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,577
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
<i>What about you, Captain?</i>

691
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,539
I've put together what you
might call an "antigen bomb."

692
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,709
Now all I have to do
is drop it.

693
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,066
(<i> distant buzzing</i> )

694
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,865
(<i> buzzing intensifies</i> )

695
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,607
(<i> buzzing stops</i> )

696
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,458
Doctor to Captain Janeway.

697
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,876
Captain, please respond.

698
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,337
Go ahead.

699
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:13,425
<i>It worked. The macroviruses</i>
<i>have been destroyed.</i>

700
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,301
And the ship?

701
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,180
There was heavy damage
suffered on Holodeck 2,

702
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,641
but there are
no hull breaches in evidence.

703
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:27,564
<i>Astonishment.</i>
<i>Your vessel, purified.</i>

704
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:30,191
And we'd be willing to share
the cure with you

705
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,986
if you'd be kind enough
to forego destroying our ship.

706
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,240
<i>Of course, of course.</i>
<i>Purification will cease.</i>

707
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,575
<i>My word.</i>

708
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,911
<i>Many thanks,</i>
<i>Captain of</i> Voyager.

709
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,206
<i>Good health.</i>

710
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,666
(<i> sighs</i> )

711
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,045
Good health.

712
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,717
(<i> soft jazz playing</i> )

713
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,803
(<i> door chimes</i> )

714
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,472
Come in.

715
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,349
Good morning, Captain.

716
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,684
Here's an update
on repairs.

717
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,355
How's the crew holding up?

718
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,608
They're fine, although
the doctor tells me

719
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:14,193
a few people are still
reporting post-viral queasiness.

720
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,945
I'm not surprised.

721
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:19,657
Inform the crew I'm granting
extended R&amp;R for all personnel

722
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,700
and work out
the shift rotations.

723
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,204
Aye, Captain.
Speaking of R&amp;R...

724
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,373
a few of us are going skiing
on the holodeck--

725
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,625
the Ktarian glaciers.

726
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:32,086
Fresh air, good workout.
Care to join us?

727
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,754
No, thank you, but have fun.

728
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,131
Not your cup of tea?

729
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,008
Oh, on the contrary.
I love to ski.

730
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,551
Let's just say...

731
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,262
I've had enough of a workout
for the time being.

732
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,599
Understood.

733
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,229
( sighs )

734
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,110
( pencil scraping )
