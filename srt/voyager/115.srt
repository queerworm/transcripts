1
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,173
He hasn't left me
with a single shot.

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,091
In that case, pal,
call a safety.

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,301
Safety?

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,595
It's a defensive strategy.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,138
Since you can't make a shot,

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,932
the idea is to leave
the cue ball

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,851
somewhere on the table where
Tuvok can't make a shot, either.

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,394
Oh, I don't know.
It sounds cowardly.

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,271
Suit yourself, pal,

10
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,732
but if you leave "Vulcan Slim"
over here with an open shot,

11
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,234
he's got a very good chance
of running the table.

12
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:30,739
All right... safety.

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,037
Ah!

14
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,040
Mr. Vulcan,

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,417
let's see you reason your way
out of this conundrum.

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,127
This safety business
is a lot more satisfying

17
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,462
than I imagined.

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,298
I've left him with
an impossible shot.

19
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,842
The shot may be difficult,
Mr. Neelix,

20
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:53,052
but to say it is impossible
is an exaggeration.

21
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,223
Go ahead, then.
Call your shot.

22
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,518
Logic would dictate that if
I strike the cue ball properly,

23
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,396
it will deflect first off
the rear bumper, then the side,

24
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,523
striking the 11 ball
and causing it to roll

25
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,233
directly into
the corner pocket.

26
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>This</i> I have to see.

27
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,704
Perhaps the ships' stabilizers

28
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,873
are not operating
at peak efficiency.

29
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:24,251
Yeah, and maybe Tom Terrific
over here forgot to tell you

30
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,086
that Sandrine's table rolls
a little to the "east."

31
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,381
You should have
called a safety.

32
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,593
JANEWAY:<i> Janeway to Mr. Neelix.</i>
<i>Please report to the Bridge.</i>

33
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,811
You wanted
to see me, Captain?

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,898
Yes, Neelix. We've received
a subspace message

35
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,482
from an approaching vessel.

36
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,109
They're asking for you.

37
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,611
Me?

38
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,072
The alien ship is entering
visual range, Captain.

39
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,365
Slow to impulse. On screen.

40
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,495
JANEWAY:
Do you recognize it?

41
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,707
That's a Haakonian shuttle.

42
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,834
Haakonian?

43
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,462
My people were at war with them

44
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,965
for the better part
of a decade.

45
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,383
They...

46
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,596
conquered my homeworld
more than 15 years ago.

47
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,266
Any idea what the Haakonians
want with you now?

48
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,851
None at all.

49
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,436
The shuttle is hailing us,
Captain.

50
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,980
Open a channel.

51
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,106
Channel open.

52
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,690
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway

53
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,734
of the Federation Starship
<i>Voyager.</i>

54
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,319
What can we do
for you?

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,822
<i>As I stated</i>
<i>in my message, Captain,</i>

56
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,491
<i>I understand you have</i>
<i>a Talaxian called Neelix</i>

57
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,994
<i>aboard your vessel.</i>

58
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,329
I'm Neelix.

59
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,705
What do you want?

60
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,417
<i>It is a matter</i>
<i>of utmost urgency.</i>

61
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,921
<i>However, I would prefer</i>
<i>to speak with you privately.</i>

62
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,298
<i>Your life may very well</i>
<i>depend upon it.</i>

63
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,929
Who are you?

64
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,222
<i>Forgive me.</i>

65
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,142
<i>I am Jetrel.</i>

66
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,852
<i>Dr. Ma'bor Jetrel.</i>

67
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,231
Neelix...

68
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,265
He's a mass murderer!

69
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,145
When I was much younger,

70
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:15,315
my family and I lived
on a moon called Rinax--

71
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,443
a colony with
the most temperate climate

72
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,737
in the entire Talaxian system.

73
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,323
Warm days, balmy nights...

74
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,701
until the Metreon Cascade.

75
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,829
Melodic name, isn't it?

76
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,999
Especially for a weapon
of mass destruction.

77
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,002
And Jetrel was somehow
involved with this weapon?

78
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,716
Dr. Jetrel was the scientist
who conceived

79
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,760
the Metreon Cascade,
then he led

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,097
the team of scientists
who built it.

81
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,515
I see.

82
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,225
In the blink of an eye

83
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,228
Rinax was enveloped
by a deadly cloud

84
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,729
and those lovely days

85
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,191
were turned into one endless,
frigid night.

86
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,948
More than 300,000
were killed.

87
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:09,119
But you... survived.

88
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:13,748
I had the good fortune
to be on Talax at the time

89
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,625
with our defense forces

90
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,338
preparing for an invasion
that never came.

91
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,631
It wasn't necessary.

92
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,093
The day after the Cascade
was deployed,

93
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,594
Talax surrendered
unconditionally

94
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,263
to the Haakonian
order.

95
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,393
And your family?

96
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,694
I am so sorry.

97
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,699
Dr. Jetrel.

98
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,869
Lieutenant Tuvok,
my Chief of Security.

99
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,663
I have heard of your
transporter technology, Captain,

100
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,376
but to experience it
first-hand

101
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,044
is truly remarkable.

102
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,380
Mr. Neelix has declined
to meet with you.

103
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,298
That's not surprising.

104
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm afraid I am not
a very popular figure

105
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,802
among the Talaxian people.

106
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,679
May we show you
to your quarters?

107
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,935
Mr. Neelix has
given me permission

108
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,937
to speak on his behalf.

109
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,189
You indicated that he may be
in some kind of danger...

110
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,108
Yes. It's imperative
that he undergo

111
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,151
a complete medical
examination.

112
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,652
For what purpose?

113
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,988
Our war records show
that he was part of the team

114
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,074
that returned to Rinax
after the Cascade

115
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,159
in order to
evacuate survivors.

116
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,453
He was exposed
to high concentrations

117
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,372
of Metreon isotopes.

118
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,292
In recent years, several of
the rescuers have developed

119
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,920
a degenerative blood disease
called Metremia.

120
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,671
Is it serious?

121
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,134
I am afraid that it's fatal.

122
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,262
The disease attacks its victims
on a molecular level.

123
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,180
It may lay dormant
for years

124
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,682
but once it manifests itself,

125
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,060
it will cause the body's
atomic structure

126
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,728
to undergo fission.

127
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,815
The cells will begin
to disintegrate.

128
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,817
My equipment
is specifically designed

129
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,693
to detect
the subatomic signature

130
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,028
of the disorder.

131
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,156
May I ask, Doctor,
why you've taken it

132
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,699
upon yourself
to examine Mr. Neelix?

133
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,077
I've evaluated as many
members of the team

134
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,745
as possible,
collecting data,

135
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,622
in hopes that one day
my research

136
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,666
will lead to a cure
for metremia.

137
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,586
Please, try to persuade
Mr. Neelix to see me.

138
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,880
Each Talaxian I screen

139
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,508
brings me one step closer
to a cure.

140
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,984
Neelix, why didn't you ever
tell me about the war?

141
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:50,030
Maybe this is one experience
that can't be shared.

142
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,742
It's too...

143
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,786
hard to...

144
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,122
describe how I feel

145
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,334
to someone who didn't
see what I saw.

146
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,585
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,047
You have nothing to be
sorry about, Neelix.

148
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,051
Excuse me.

149
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,844
Captain, back from your

150
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,513
doctor's appointment already?

151
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:19,226
I'm afraid I have some...
disturbing news, Neelix.

152
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,811
Nothing you tell me
could make this day

153
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,439
any more disturbing
than it's already been.

154
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,614
According to Jetrel,
you were exposed

155
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,535
to dangerous levels
of Metreon poisoning

156
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:40,705
and may be at risk of developing
a fatal blood disorder.

157
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,458
He wants to screen you
for the disease.

158
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,384
Uh, Captain...

159
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,845
please tell Dr. Jetrel
that I am... touched

160
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,057
by his tender concern
for my state of health,

161
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,725
but that I'd rather
be immersed

162
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,937
in a pit of Krallinian eels
than be examined by him.

163
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,148
Neelix, if there's
something wrong with you,

164
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,733
we should find out.

165
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,778
I don't want that man
within ten parsecs of me!

166
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,821
I understand your feelings,

167
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,116
but this is your life
we're talking about.

168
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,661
Don't either of you find it
the slightest bit strange

169
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,664
that a man who has made
it his life's work

170
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,208
to develop a weapon

171
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,710
to destroy as many
Talaxians as possible

172
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,340
should suddenly be concerned
with this Talaxian's health?

173
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,842
I don't know
what his motives are.

174
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,221
Maybe he's trying
to undo some of the damage

175
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,848
his weapon caused,
but he seems sincere, Neelix,

176
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,351
and at this point
I have no reason to doubt him.

177
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,523
If the disease is fatal,

178
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,151
what's the point of knowing
whether I have it or not?

179
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,570
Our doctor is
the most skilled physician

180
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,489
either of us has ever met.

181
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,449
If you have this disease,

182
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,785
he won't stop until
he's found some way to treat it.

183
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,663
And if Jetrel discovers
you don't have the disease,

184
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,626
at least you'll have
peace of mind.

185
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:11,588
Peace of mind
is a relative thing, Captain.

186
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,466
I simply want you to hear
what he has to say,

187
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,843
then if you still don't
want him to examine you,

188
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,138
no one will force you.

189
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:24,392
Oh, outnumbered
and outflanked.

190
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,811
All right, then.

191
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,271
I surrender.

192
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,489
The Metreon isotopes
are unique.

193
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,158
Their rate of decay
is highly variable.

194
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,660
We have found that
it's sometimes years

195
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,246
before metremia sets in,
and unfortunately...

196
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,832
Why are you doing this?

197
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,626
I beg your pardon?

198
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,921
Is it all just
scientific curiosity?

199
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,091
Metreons and isotopes?

200
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:03,890
Or do you feel... guilty
about what you did?

201
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,767
Guilty?

202
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,769
I do not regret it.

203
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,564
I did what had to be done.

204
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,441
Really? It was necessary
to vaporize

205
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,859
more than a quarter
of a million people

206
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,361
and to leave
thousands of others

207
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,446
to be eaten away
by Metreon poisoning?

208
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,657
Would it make any difference
if I told you

209
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,952
we never thought there would be
any radiation poisoning?

210
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,581
That anyone close enough
to be exposed

211
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,291
would be killed
by the initial blast?

212
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,043
It was unfortunate
we were wrong.

213
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,628
Unfortunate?

214
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,296
( chuckles )

215
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:39,092
Did you hear that, Captain?
It was "unfortunate."

216
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,011
Neelix, I think
what Dr. Jetrel is trying...

217
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,348
No, Captain. That's all right.
I'm used to it.

218
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,059
I'm simply a scientist.

219
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,187
Yes, I developed the weapon,

220
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,650
but it was the government
and the military leaders

221
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,238
who decided to use it, not I.

222
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:04,825
That must be a very convenient
distinction for you.

223
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,203
Does it help you sleep at night?

224
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,415
I slept no worse last night
than I have any other night

225
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,917
for the past 15 years.

226
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,002
What is that supposed to mean?

227
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,755
It means I must

228
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:21,718
live with my conscience
as you must live with yours.

229
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,219
How many did you kill

230
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,679
during the war?

231
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,473
Gentlemen, please.

232
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,352
This is obviously very difficult
for both of you,

233
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,689
but we are not here
to debate history.

234
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,567
We are here to talk about
Neelix's condition.

235
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,069
Don't worry about
it, Captain,

236
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,363
because Dr. Jetrel
will have to find himself

237
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,824
another laboratory rodent
to help his experiments.

238
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:52,332
Because I would rather die
than help you

239
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,001
ease your conscience.

240
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,004
I do not expect you
to like me, Mr. Neelix,

241
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,508
nor do I hope to allay
your obvious pain

242
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,134
with moral arguments

243
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,261
but I do believe
I can help you--

244
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,888
if not you,
others of your race.

245
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:13,019
Isn't that more important
than punishing me?

246
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,283
Are you... sure
you can't do this?

247
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,286
Your newfound confidence in me
is flattering, Mr. Neelix,

248
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,206
but Dr. Jetrel has instruments
designed specifically

249
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,917
to analyze
Talaxian physiology.

250
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,296
Just get it over with.

251
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,804
Did I ever tell you

252
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,641
about the notorious
two-tailed Talchoks of Rinax?

253
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,226
I don't think so.

254
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,935
Nasty little vermin.

255
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,397
Sharp claws, dripping fangs.

256
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,858
Ew! It was quite a nuisance.

257
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,026
So one summer when I was a boy,

258
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,696
I decided to do
something about them.

259
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,447
I spent weeks tinkering

260
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:11,494
creating a foolproof
Talchok trap.

261
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,456
Once I perfected it,
I set it in the garden.

262
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,376
And the next day,
I found one of those beasts

263
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,878
pinned at the neck.

264
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,129
But it wasn't dead.

265
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,465
It was squirming and squealing

266
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,092
in agony.

267
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,762
And suddenly, it didn't
look so fiendish anymore.

268
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:32,557
It looked like
a poor, innocent animal.

269
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,851
What a horrible story.

270
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,229
Well, you see, I had become
so fascinated with my invention

271
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,814
that I never really thought

272
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,316
about how that poor creature
would suffer.

273
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,777
Are you finished?

274
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,152
For now.

275
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,030
So am I.

276
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,407
And...?

277
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,576
I'm sorry, Mr. Neelix.

278
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,327
Sorry? Why are you sorry?

279
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,164
I'm afraid you have
incipient metremia.

280
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,271
( door chimes )

281
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,397
Come in!

282
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,192
How are you feeling?

283
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,655
Kes, my sweet.

284
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,699
I'll have you know
this is not the first time

285
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,410
I have stared into
the gaping maw of death.

286
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,330
Why once, during the battle
of the Pyrithian gorge,

287
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,706
I faced down

288
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,460
an entire battery
of Haakonian artillery.

289
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,630
There I was with only
a small crevice for cover.

290
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,090
Neelix, you're
protecting me again.

291
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,761
I can understand your not
wanting to talk about Rinax.

292
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,806
I wasn't there.
You're right.

293
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,684
But I'm here now with you.

294
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,728
We have to face
this together.

295
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,192
Well, there's one good thing
that will come from all this.

296
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:11,113
When I first met you,
I didn't know that your species

297
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,825
only lived eight
or nine years.

298
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,576
I fell in love with you

299
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,997
without knowing
how lonely it would be

300
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,624
to live without you
after you're gone.

301
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,460
Now that I'm going
to die first,

302
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,713
I don't have
to worry about it.

303
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,088
Before I met you,

304
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,717
eight or nine years
seemed like an eternity.

305
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,345
It never occurred to me
that anyone could live longer.

306
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,972
Now that we're together,

307
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,724
no matter how many years
we have left,

308
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,934
it doesn't seem
like enough.

309
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,439
But the important thing

310
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,275
is to cherish whatever time
we have together.

311
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,239
Whether it's a day
or a decade.

312
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,750
( door beeps )

313
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,043
Come in.

314
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,921
Am I interrupting?

315
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,966
Please, sit down.

316
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:18,264
Captain, I must tell you
your ship is simply astounding.

317
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,434
I have been studying
your transporter system.

318
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,561
Transporter systems?
I would think

319
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,772
you'd be more concerned
with Mr. Neelix.

320
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,690
Forgive me.

321
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,693
But that is what
I am here to talk about.

322
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,780
I believe with a relatively
few minor modifications,

323
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,907
the transporter system
could be used

324
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,200
to retrieve a sample
of the Metreon cloud

325
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,702
surrounding Rinax.

326
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,454
To what end?

327
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,040
I've always believed
that if I could isolate

328
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,626
the free isotope
that causes metremia

329
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:50,129
it could be used
to synthesize an antibody.

330
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,050
Then theoretically

331
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,843
the victim's own
immune system could destroy

332
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,177
the disease.

333
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,764
Yes, Captain, and
your transporter system

334
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,808
makes it all possible.

335
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,810
Is the isotope stable enough
to be transported?

336
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,938
I believe so.

337
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,522
We could construct
a containment field

338
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,817
to prevent any
contamination of the ship.

339
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,110
And I could have
our doctor assist you

340
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,987
with synthesizing
the antibody.

341
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,030
My thoughts exactly.

342
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,657
Janeway to Bridge.

343
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,075
<i>Chakotay here, Captain.</i>

344
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,118
Have Dr. Jetrel's vessel

345
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,577
tractored into
the Shuttlebay.

346
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,080
And lay in a course
for the Talaxian system.

347
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,290
That's a significant
detour, Captain.

348
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,750
<i>I'm aware of that, Commander.</i>

349
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,878
But it may mean saving
Neelix's life.

350
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,630
<i>Understood.</i>

351
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,674
I'll send a message
to Talax requesting permission

352
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,550
to transport material
from the cloud.

353
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,886
In the meantime,
Lieutenant Torres in Engineering

354
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,514
can give you a hand with
the transporter modifications.

355
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,518
Thank you, Captain.

356
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,687
Thank you, Dr. Jetrel.

357
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,148
It's a very
promising idea.

358
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,568
( grunts )

359
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,528
What is it?

360
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,696
( coughing )

361
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,656
Nothing. I just think, uh...

362
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,492
I'm a little overexcited
about the prospects

363
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:05,163
of discovering a cure,
and all that sparring

364
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,414
with Mr. Neelix
does take a toll.

365
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,416
Maybe you should let the doctor
have a look at you.

366
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,545
No, I'm fine,
and there's so much to be done.

367
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,463
I want to start right away.

368
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,849
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's log:</i>
<i>Stardate 48832.1.</i>

369
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,102
<i>Kes has prevailed upon Neelix</i>
<i>to allow Dr. Jetrel</i>

370
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,021
<i>to continue metabolic scans</i>

371
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,065
<i>in the hope that it will</i>
<i>facilitate treatment</i>

372
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,734
<i>once the antibody</i>
<i>has been synthesized.</i>

373
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,821
Will you be needing
my assistance, Doctor?

374
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,573
Not until
we have the isotope.

375
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:45,036
Mr. Neelix, is there
anything more I
can do for you?

376
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,662
Very well then.

377
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:51,500
Computer, override command one
E.M.H. Alpha and end program.

378
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,836
Incredible.

379
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,758
A hologram
that can deactivate itself.

380
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,718
Is there anything
besides science

381
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,179
that makes your heart
beat faster, Jetrel?

382
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,680
Not anymore.

383
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,891
Now would you
please sit down?

384
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:15,024
You know what
I've been thinking?

385
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:19,112
If I'd been in charge
of the Cascade

386
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,030
I'd have...

387
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,074
I don't know, uh...

388
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,367
chosen a military target

389
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:30,623
or simply deployed it
on an uninhabited planet.

390
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,208
Somehow I don't think

391
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,544
I'd have targeted
innocent civilians.

392
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,004
The military strategists

393
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,339
did not think a demonstration
would work.

394
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,801
They wanted to show
the power of the Cascade

395
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,302
in all its horror.

396
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,056
You should have tried
to stop them!

397
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,849
Why didn't you speak out?

398
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,602
People would have listened
to you.

399
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,773
It would not have made
<i>any</i> difference.

400
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,734
If I had not discovered
the Cascade

401
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,903
it would have been someone else.
Don't you see?

402
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,656
It was a scientific
inevitability,

403
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,034
one discovery flowing
naturally to the next.

404
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,911
Something so enormous as science

405
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,039
will not stop for something
as small as man, Mr. Neelix.

406
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,834
So you did it for science.

407
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,460
For my planet.

408
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,713
And, yes, for science--

409
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,259
to know whether or not
it could be done.

410
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,679
It's good to know
how the world works.

411
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,223
It is not possible
to be a scientist

412
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,517
unless you believe
that all the knowledge

413
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,478
of the universe and all
the power that it bestows

414
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,691
is of intrinsic value
to everyone

415
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:43,154
and one must share
that knowledge...

416
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,406
and allow it to be applied,

417
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:51,120
and then be willing
to live with the consequences.

418
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,081
Consequences?

419
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,501
Who are you
to talk about consequences?

420
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,046
You are not the only one
to lose family

421
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,380
during the war, Mr. Neelix.

422
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,799
Your family was killed?

423
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,552
Nothing as clean as death.

424
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,307
When I returned home
after the Cascade to my wife--

425
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,727
my lovely wife Ka'ree--

426
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,522
she could not bear
to look at me.

427
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,276
When I would reach out for her,
she would pull away

428
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,863
as if had some
contagious disease.

429
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,782
You see, like you,
she thought I had

430
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,784
become a monster.

431
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,830
Shortly after that,
she took my three children...

432
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,168
and I have not seen them since.

433
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,921
That's a sad story, Jetrel.

434
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:47,093
But let me tell you another one.

435
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:52,472
A man goes back to Rinax
after the Cascade,

436
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,601
back to what
had been his home

437
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,063
to look for survivors.

438
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,690
But the impact of the blast
has set off hundreds of fires

439
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:08,114
and there's nothing there,
just smoldering ruins

440
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,158
and the stench of seared flesh.

441
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,450
But in the distance,

442
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,703
in the middle
of all that emptiness,

443
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,997
from out of this...

444
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,251
huge cloud of billowing dust...

445
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:27,425
he can see bodies moving,

446
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,927
whimpering,

447
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,429
coming toward him.

448
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,058
They're monsters...

449
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:40,187
their flesh horribly charred.

450
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,064
The color of shale.

451
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:50,072
One of them comes toward him.

452
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,284
Mangled arms outstretched.

453
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,787
And he can't help it.

454
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,539
He-- he-- he turns away,
frightened.

455
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,919
But then the thing
speaks.

456
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,923
And he knows by the sound
of her voice

457
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:12,052
that she's not a monster
at all, but a child...

458
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,680
a little girl.

459
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,808
Mr. Neelix, I...

460
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,941
Her name was Palaxia.

461
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,529
We brought her back to Talax
with the other survivors.

462
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,326
Over the next few weeks,
I stayed at her bedside

463
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,661
and watched her wither away.

464
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,252
Those are consequences,
Dr. Jetrel.

465
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,967
There is no way

466
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,305
I can ever apologize
to you, Mr. Neelix.

467
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,226
That's why I have not tried.

468
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:06,273
Did you ever think that
maybe your wife was right?

469
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,193
That you had become a monster?

470
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,404
Yes.

471
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,615
The day we tested
the Cascade,

472
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,745
when I saw that
blinding light

473
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,914
brighter than
a thousand suns...

474
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:29,380
I knew at that moment
exactly what I had become.

475
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,426
I hope you have to live
with that a very long time.

476
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:38,264
I'm afraid you will not
get your wish, Mr. Neelix.

477
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,140
And why is that?

478
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,184
( sighs )

479
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,270
I have advanced metremia.

480
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,106
I will be dead
in a matter of days.

481
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,615
It's your turn!

482
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,826
There's no open shot.

483
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,954
Why don't you call a safety,
Neelix?

484
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,914
Isn't that what you always do?

485
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,375
I'm no coward.

486
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,834
That's not what I've heard.

487
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,669
Wait, what are you doing?
It's my turn.

488
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,464
You lost your chance to play.

489
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,630
Now you're going to lose.

490
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,468
Neelix, where did you go?

491
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,303
Why did you leave us?

492
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,971
I did what I thought was right.

493
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,932
You were afraid!
No!

494
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,016
I...

495
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,352
Neelix...
Who are you?

496
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,814
It's me, Palaxia.
Palaxia?!

497
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,233
Why weren't you here to help us?

498
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,359
( gasps )

499
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,532
You!

500
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,326
You did this, butcher!

501
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,790
JANEWAY:
<i>Bridge to Neelix.</i>

502
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,964
H-Here, Captain.

503
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,383
<i>Neelix, I thought</i>
<i>you'd like to know.</i>

504
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,552
<i>We're approaching Rinax.</i>

505
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,474
Neelix?

506
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,020
Thank you, Captain.
I'll be right there.

507
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,525
Entering
synchronous orbit, Captain.

508
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,360
( door opening )

509
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,540
Hard to believe
that on clear nights

510
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,957
you could look up from Talax

511
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,169
and see the shimmering lights
of the colony.

512
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,591
The night of the Cascade,

513
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,261
a bright flash
cut across the sky--

514
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,390
so blinding that people

515
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,849
threw themselves
to the ground...

516
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:52,314
and everything stopped
like a moment out of time.

517
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,941
Then we all looked up

518
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:59,697
to see where the flash
had come from,

519
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:02,866
but the sky seemed oddly empty.

520
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,163
It took most of us
a few seconds to realize

521
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,956
it was because Rinax was...

522
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,669
gone.

523
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,837
Of course, the moon
was still there.

524
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,049
We just couldn't see it because
of that Metreon cloud.

525
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,427
TORRES:
<i>Engineering to Bridge.</i>

526
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,263
<i>We're ready</i>
<i>to begin transporter</i>
<i>presequencing, Captain.</i>

527
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,889
Acknowledged.

528
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,517
This brings back
too many memories, Captain.

529
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,143
If you'll excuse me?

530
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,029
Of course.

531
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,496
I believe I asked for
a larger container.

532
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,498
Correct me
if I'm wrong, Doctor,

533
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,500
but we're talking
about a cloud sample

534
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,920
large enough to contain a few
subatomic particles, right?

535
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,338
Yes, but the isotope

536
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,048
accounts for just
a minuscule fraction

537
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,508
of the cloud's total mass.

538
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,469
I want to be sure
we get enough.

539
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,804
Don't worry.
We do this all the time.

540
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,723
Presequencing complete, Captain.

541
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,558
I'm ready to begin transport.

542
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,726
JANEWAY:<i> Proceed.</i>

543
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,186
Targeting scanners.

544
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,482
Locking on.

545
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,857
Energize.

546
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,741
Captain, we have
the sample aboard.

547
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,618
The containment field
is holding.

548
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,746
<i>Well done.</i>
<i>Janeway out.</i>

549
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,247
Good luck, Doctor.

550
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,430
Neelix?

551
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,809
Neelix, are you in here?

552
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,314
Neelix?

553
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,989
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

554
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,785
Why did you take
your com badge off?

555
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,829
I wanted to be alone.

556
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:16,208
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I was worried.

557
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,713
I know how you must feel.

558
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,674
No, you don't know.

559
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,843
Not everything.

560
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,432
You don't know where I was
the night Rinax was destroyed.

561
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:37,688
On Talax, fighting with
the defense forces.

562
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,981
I was on Talax,

563
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,776
but I wasn't fighting
with the defense forces.

564
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,407
I was hiding from them.

565
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,707
I wasn't a hero at the Battle
of the Pyrithian Gorge.

566
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,796
I've never even been there.

567
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,506
I don't understand.

568
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,511
I never reported for duty.

569
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,890
Why not?

570
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,518
I thought the war was unjust,

571
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,812
that Talax was fighting
for reasons

572
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:24,025
that weren't
worth killing for,

573
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:29,406
or at least that's
what I told myself,

574
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,491
but...

575
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,536
the real reason
I didn't report...

576
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,999
was because I was a coward.

577
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:44,880
Now you know.

578
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,638
If the Talaxian authorities
would have caught you,

579
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,014
what would they have done?

580
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,058
During wartime,
the punishment

581
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,938
for refusing
military service was death.

582
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,273
So...

583
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,776
you put your life
at risk for something

584
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,569
you believed in

585
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,655
and you think that
makes you a coward.

586
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,281
I don't understand.

587
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,200
It makes me a<i> liar.</i>

588
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,828
I'd lied about it
all these years to you,

589
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,079
to Jetrel, to everyone.

590
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,874
Because you're dishonest?

591
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,751
Because I'm ashamed.

592
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,632
What an awful burden you've
carried all these years.

593
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,676
No wonder you're
so angry with Jetrel.

594
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,885
Of course I am.

595
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,971
He killed them all--

596
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:37,516
my mother, my father,
my little brothers.

597
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,352
Is that really why?

598
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,520
What?

599
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,313
Ever since Jetrel
came on board,

600
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,940
you've despised him.

601
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,818
The hurt and anger
you've held in all these years

602
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,236
was vented right at him,

603
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:53,699
but was it really Jetrel
you were angry with?

604
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,535
Is he the one you blame
for what happened?

605
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,704
I... I don't know.

606
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:02,666
Or was he just
a convenient target

607
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:06,419
to keep you from looking
somewhere else?

608
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,838
You mean...

609
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,758
from looking at myself?

610
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,057
You may be right...

611
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,687
but I hate him,

612
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,566
and I don't think
I can stop hating him.

613
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,944
Maybe you have to stop
hating yourself first.

614
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,671
Are we ready to begin
synthesis?

615
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:54,885
Computer, override command one
E.M.H. Alpha and end program.

616
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:55,928
Now just wait one...

617
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,048
Dr. Jetrel.
You startled me.

618
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,841
I'm sorry,
but I need to speak with you...

619
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,427
Is it possible
we could talk later?

620
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:41,473
It won't be long before I am
too weak to work.

621
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,725
I would like to finish
before I die.

622
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,397
What is that?

623
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,654
You're engaging in some kind of
bizarre experiment, aren't you?

624
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,947
What is it this time?

625
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,197
You don't understand.

626
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,908
I can help them.

627
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,829
NEELIX:
What do you call that?

628
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,247
Scientific progress?

629
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,666
I'm going to the captain.

630
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,218
Any report on Dr. Jetrel's
progress, Commander?

631
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,428
Not yet, Captain.

632
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,680
Bridge to Sick Bay.

633
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,222
Janeway to Sick Bay.

634
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,020
<i>Janeway to Dr. Jetrel.</i>

635
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,606
Computer, activate emergency
medical hologram.

636
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,191
COMPUTER:
<i>Please, state the nature...</i>

637
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,027
What the hell is going on down
there, Doctor?

638
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,195
Dr. Jetrel deactivated me.

639
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,488
<i>He's gone now.</i>

640
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,615
Computer, locate Dr. Jetrel.

641
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,827
COMPUTER:<i> Dr. Jetrel</i>
<i>is in Transporter Room One.</i>

642
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,287
And Mr. Neelix is unconscious.

643
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,289
It appears he's been
tranquilized.

644
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,626
You have the Bridge, Commander.

645
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,171
Security, meet me
in Transporter Room One. Tuvok.

646
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,805
Please, step aside, Doctor.

647
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,557
You must let me continue.

648
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,017
Lives depend on it.

649
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,102
We've heard that
from you before.

650
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,146
You're beginning to lose
credibility.

651
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,438
Captain, I beg you.

652
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,191
Let me bring them back.

653
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:18,695
Bring who back?
Who, Doctor?

654
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,740
Who is it you're going
to bring back?

655
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,202
The victims of Rinax.

656
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,922
He's out of his mind,
Captain.

657
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,258
Please, look at
my calculations.

658
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,054
You remember what I told you
about metremia, Captain?

659
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,556
How it causes the body's
atomic structure

660
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,225
to undergo fission.

661
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:52,104
( groaning )
It mirrors the way

662
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:55,273
the Metreon Cascade
vaporized its victims--

663
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,110
through bio-molecular
disintegration.

664
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,821
Do we have
to listen to this?

665
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,615
I think we should
hear him out.

666
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,701
What I've been working on
for the past 15 years

667
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,830
is a way to rebuild
that atomic structure.

668
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,666
What I call
regenerative fusion.

669
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,710
Are you saying

670
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,756
you're actually trying
to restore people

671
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,341
who were vaporized
by the Metreon Cascade?

672
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,427
Yes.

673
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,096
Given the degree
of fragmentation

674
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,472
you're talking about,

675
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,266
I don't see
how that's possible.

676
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,310
The electrostatic properties
of the clouds are as such

677
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,562
that the disassembled
bio-matter

678
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,941
has been held in a state
of animated suspension.

679
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,611
I discovered years ago
that reintegration is possible.

680
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:45,406
Is that what you were doing
with that thing in Sick Bay?

681
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,117
Yes, exactly.

682
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,493
Neelix saw it.

683
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,786
It was an amalgamation

684
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,997
of randomly fused
organic material.

685
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,248
Bits and pieces

686
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,792
of previously
vaporized bio-matter.

687
00:38:55,792 --> 00:39:00,505
But if the bio-matter
in the cloud is so random,

688
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,674
so jumbled,

689
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,384
how could you reconstruct
something whole?

690
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,305
I used medical records
to identify the genetic coding

691
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,390
of a specific victim--
a test case, if you will.

692
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,602
Once we input his DNA sequence,

693
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:19,191
then we can isolate
his atomic fragments

694
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:24,487
with your targeting scanners,
and then rematerialize him.

695
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,657
What if he's right?

696
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,909
Captain,
Dr. Jetrel is proposing

697
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,828
the reconstruction
and re-animation

698
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,997
of a remarkably complex set
of bio-systems

699
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,041
from billions
of subatomic particles.

700
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,961
I'm afraid I have to agree.

701
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,464
It all sounds
very implausible.

702
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,092
( groaning )

703
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,387
You sound exactly
like my country.

704
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:55,560
I asked them for more funds
to continue my research

705
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,021
to help the victims
of Rinax

706
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,774
because I wanted
the world to know

707
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,485
I am not a monster.

708
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:10,367
My theories can be used
to heal as well as to destroy.

709
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:14,037
But they... they refused me,

710
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:17,623
called me
a Talaxian sympathizer

711
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,167
and exiled me.

712
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,631
Does Neelix
really have metremia?

713
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,133
Or was that just
a pretext

714
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,510
for getting us
to come to Rinax?

715
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,348
It was just a pretext,
Captain.

716
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,768
You do not have metremia,
Neelix.

717
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,686
You are not going to die.

718
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,861
Why didn't you just tell us
the truth in the first place?

719
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,322
Your captain
is an accomplished scientist.

720
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:53,118
She doubts my theories.
My own government did, too.

721
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:57,414
I just could not risk
being not believed again.

722
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,915
But...

723
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:04,963
Captain, it will work.

724
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:09,884
Captain, if there's
any chance he can do it,

725
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,263
you've got to
let him try.

726
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:16,349
Neelix, there are just
too many variables.

727
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,769
Please, Captain.

728
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,693
Lieutenant Tuvok,

729
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,363
activate the emergency
containment field

730
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,864
around the transporter pad.

731
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,949
Aye, Captain.

732
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,413
Emergency containment field
activated.

733
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,291
JANEWAY: We'll have
to retarget scanners

734
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,126
to the widest possible
confinement beam.

735
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,211
It's our only hope
of achieving bond cohesion

736
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,629
with such broadly
scattered fragments.

737
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,923
Retargeting scanners
to wide beam.

738
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,175
Energize.

739
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,553
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:
Phase transition coils
to maximum.

740
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,888
Aye, Captain.

741
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,436
Is the bio-genic
field operational?

742
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,938
Affirmative.

743
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,149
It's incredible.

744
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,485
Atomic cohesion has dropped
to 49%, Captain.

745
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,069
JANEWAY:
Pattern buffers
to maximum power.

746
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,779
TUVOK:
They are already at 100%.

747
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,490
Take them to 120,
Lieutenant.

748
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,659
Pattern buffers
to 120% of rated maximum.

749
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,952
We're losing him.

750
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:22,040
Atomic cohesion to 39%...
22%... 14%...

751
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,334
His pattern
is degrading rapidly.

752
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:27,253
You must increase the power
to the pattern buffers, Captain!

753
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,796
We've got
to stimulate cohesion.

754
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,798
Is there any way to augment
the bio-genic field?

755
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,134
The degree of fragmentation
is simply too great.

756
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,887
It will not work. We are
overloading the system.

757
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,437
Shut it down, Mr. Tuvok.

758
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:05,624
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's log:</i>
<i>Stardate 48840.5.</i>

759
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:09,003
<i>Dr. Jetrel's metremia is now in</i>
<i>its final stage.</i>

760
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,590
<i>He's spending his</i>
<i>remaining hours in Sick Bay.</i>

761
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,776
Neelix...

762
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,573
I suppose you think

763
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,951
this is a fitting
punishment for me.

764
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:47,417
Maybe the Cascade
was a punishment for all of us,

765
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:51,254
for our hatred,

766
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,964
our brutality.

767
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:58,094
There's something
I need to tell you.

768
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,515
I tried to tell you
before, but...

769
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,145
Wha... What is it?

770
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,772
I want to tell you...

771
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,067
that I forgive you.

772
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,953
( sighs )

773
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,414
( theme playing )

774
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:01,491
( theme playing )
