1
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,464
Report.

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,215
The Borg shields
are off-line.

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,801
I've got a lock
on Captain Janeway.

4
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,970
Get her out of there and break
us free of the cube.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,012
Stand by all weapons.

6
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,641
I'm trying to energize.
( console beeping denial )

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,685
The Borg are scattering
the beam.

8
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,812
Compensate.

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,439
No effect.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,941
We're being hailed.

11
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,484
On screen.

12
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,236
<i>Commander,</i>
<i>cut the transporter beam.</i>

13
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,655
Captain?

14
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,031
<i>Do it.</i>

15
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,536
<i>I have reached an agreement</i>
<i>with the collective.</i>

16
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:40,290
<i>We're going to help them design</i>
<i>a weapon against Species 8472.</i>

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,292
<i>In exchange, they've granted us</i>

18
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,586
<i>safe passage</i>
<i>through their space.</i>

19
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,005
Cube is altering course.

20
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:47,923
They're heading toward
the Alpha Quadrant.

21
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,424
<i>That's part of the plan.</i>

22
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>We'll work on the weapon</i>
<i>en route.</i>

23
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,428
<i>Once we're across</i>
<i>their territory,</i>

24
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>we'll give them the nanoprobes.</i>

25
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,892
<i>They appear to be holding up</i>
<i>their end of the bargain.</i>

26
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,434
<i>I suggest we do the same.</i>

27
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,437
How do you propose
we begin this "collaboration"?

28
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,982
<i>I'm going to work here</i>
<i>on the cube.</i>

29
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,442
<i>They have technology</i>
<i>that'll make the job go faster.</i>

30
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,861
<i>I want to take advantage of it.</i>

31
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,696
It's not necessary
for you to stay there.

32
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,280
We can set up a com-link
with the Borg...

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,116
<i>It's part of the deal.</i>
<i>I work here.</i>

34
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,578
All right.

35
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:21,999
As long as we're cooperating...

36
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,919
maybe the Borg would be willing
to disengage their tractor beam.

37
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,837
We can match their course
without a leash.

38
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,213
<i>I'll propose it.</i>

39
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,131
<i>Mr. Tuvok, transport</i>
<i>to my coordinates.</i>

40
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,926
Understood.

41
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,678
<i>We're going to make this work,</i>
<i>Commander. Janeway out.</i>

42
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,562
You heard the Captain.

43
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,098
DOCTOR:
I've replicated nearly ten
million Borg nanoprobes,

44
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,893
each of them reprogrammed
to my specifications,

45
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,897
each capable
of targeting the alien tissue.

46
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,439
Assimilating it?

47
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,233
Just momentarily.

48
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,028
The Borg technology will
denaturate within seconds

49
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,946
taking the alien tissue
along with it.

50
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,579
Mr. Kim, I'm about to
inject your carotid artery.

51
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,372
You'll feel a
tingling sensation.

52
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,750
Don't be alarmed.

53
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,398
Nice to see you
again, Ensign.

54
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,649
It's working.

55
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,317
Prepare another dose
of nanoprobes.

56
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,653
Yes, Doctor.
Good work.

57
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,363
Let me know when he's
back on his feet.

58
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,824
Commander,
I must tell you,

59
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,952
I have my doubts
about this alliance.

60
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,745
You may have
convinced the Borg

61
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,622
the nanoprobes can
defeat their enemy,

62
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,332
but a medical treatment is
a long way from a weapon of war.

63
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,334
We'll leave that
to the Captain.

64
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,378
This situation
is unpredictable,

65
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,131
so we're going to stay
at full Red Alert.

66
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,216
Keep all information
about the nanoprobes

67
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,675
stored in your holo-matrix.

68
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,136
Don't worry.
I'll delete myself

69
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,511
at the first
sign of trouble.

70
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,015
Well... maybe not
the first sign.

71
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,484
TORRES:
We've just received word.

72
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,820
Tuvok beamed to the cube.
He's joined the Captain.

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,529
Keep a transporter lock
on both of them.

74
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,324
I'll try, but the Borg are
regenerating their shields.

75
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,118
Try matching
their shield frequencies.

76
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,411
It won't work. They'll be able
to adapt too quickly.

77
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,122
I don't want to hear
what we can't do!

78
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,456
Just find a way
to get our people

79
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,875
out of there if we have to.
Aye, sir.

80
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,295
( console beeping )

81
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,214
They've released
their tractor beam.

82
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,758
Match their
course and speed.

83
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,011
I never thought I'd hear
myself say this, but...

84
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,180
looks like the Borg
are cooperating.

85
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,366
( snarling )

86
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,420
( snarling )

87
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,798
( screaming )

88
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,717
DOCTOR:
Kes, Kes!

89
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,845
Kes! What's wrong?

90
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,930
They're watching us.

91
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,854
TUVOK:
May I ask where
we're being taken?

92
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,065
Grid nine-two
of subjunction 12--

93
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,567
our very own workspace. It's
near the center of the cube.

94
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,320
These are my tricorder readings
of the bioship we examined.

95
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,240
I believe you will find
them most revealing.

96
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,616
Have you compared this
to the Doctor's analysis

97
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,202
of the alien tissue?

98
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,038
Yes. Many of the cellular
structures are identical.

99
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,040
The aliens and their ships
are made of the same

100
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,625
organic material.
Apparently so.

101
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,466
COLLECTIVE:
<i>You have entered grid nine-two</i>
<i>of subjunction 12.</i>

102
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,511
<i>Proceed.</i>

103
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,348
All right.

104
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,809
We've analyzed one
of the alien vessels

105
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,063
and it appears to be constructed
of organic material

106
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,108
vulnerable
to the modified nanoprobes.

107
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,194
I suggest we begin thinking

108
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,738
about a large-scale
delivery system.

109
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,573
A way to infect their ships

110
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,533
and destroy them
at the microsc-- Ugh!

111
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,327
<i>We will begin.</i>

112
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,079
What are you doing?

113
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,457
<i>A neuro-transceiver is required</i>
<i>for maximum communication.</i>

114
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,709
<i>We will work as one mind.</i>

115
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,711
No, that wasn't the agreement.

116
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,422
<i>The neural link is temporary.</i>

117
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,300
<i>You will not be damaged.</i> 
I don't care.

118
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,760
I prefer to communicate
verbally, thank you.

119
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,679
<i>Your primitive communication</i>
<i>is inefficient.</i>

120
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,390
On the contrary...

121
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,476
we work better
with our individuality intact.

122
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,895
Surely, we've proven that
to you by now.

123
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,149
<i>Irrelevant.</i>
<i>You must comply.</i>

124
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,524
We "must" do nothing.

125
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,903
Tell your drone
to remove the transceiver.

126
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,120
What about choosing
a representative,

127
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,206
a single Borg we can work with
and talk to directly?

128
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,707
<i>Elaborate.</i>

129
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,293
You've done it before

130
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,379
when you transformed
Jean-Luc Picard into Locutus.

131
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,589
We will not be assimilated.

132
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,801
Choose a representative,
or the deal's off!

133
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,272
( grunts )

134
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,777
( door clangs open )

135
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,880
I speak for the Borg.

136
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,347
I'm Captain Janeway. This is
Lieutenant Tuvok.

137
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,349
We are aware
of your designations.

138
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,060
What's your designation?

139
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,395
Seven of Nine,

140
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,856
Tertiary Adjunct of
Unimatrix Zero One.

141
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,151
But you may call me
Seven of Nine.

142
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,113
You are proposing
a large-scale weapon.

143
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,740
We concur.

144
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,450
I thought you might.

145
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,204
We could encase the nanoprobes
in some of our photon torpedoes,

146
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,499
in essence, turn them
into biomolecular warheads.

147
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,792
Your torpedoes
are inadequate.

148
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,670
They lack the necessary range
and dispersive force.

149
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,298
Do you have
a better idea?

150
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,092
We are Borg.

151
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,097
I take that as a "yes."

152
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,609
A multikinetic
neutronic mine,

153
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,278
five million isoton yield.

154
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,571
An explosion that size

155
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,364
could affect an
entire star system.

156
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,700
Correct.
The shock wave will disperse

157
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,203
the nanoprobes over a radius
of five light-years.

158
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,705
JANEWAY:
That's somewhat larger
than I had in mind.

159
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,042
You're proposing a weapon
of mass destruction.

160
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,710
We are.

161
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,254
Well, I'm not.

162
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,548
You'd be endangering
innocent worlds.

163
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,383
It would be efficient.

164
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,718
We would need approximately
50 trillion nanoprobes

165
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,221
to arm this mine.
It would take the Doctor

166
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,098
several weeks
to replicate that amount.

167
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,142
You are losing
this conflict.

168
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,185
Are you willing
to risk further delay?

169
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,520
JANEWAY:
Right now,

170
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,356
your enemy believes
it is invulnerable.

171
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,068
If we create smaller weapons
using our torpedoes,

172
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,862
and destroy
a few of their bioships

173
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,239
it may deter them,

174
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,575
convince them
to give up this war.

175
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,495
You are individuals.

176
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,121
You are small

177
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,540
and you think
in small terms.

178
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,800
But the present
situation requires

179
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,676
that we consider your plan.

180
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,144
<i>Voyager's</i> 
weapons inventory.

181
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,105
Photon torpedo complement, 32,

182
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,565
class-6 warhead.

183
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,026
Explosive yield,
200 isotons.

184
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,195
How did you obtain
this information?

185
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,406
We are Borg.

186
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,826
Naturally.

187
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,886
Commander, we have
some disturbing news.

188
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,555
At this point,
I'm getting used to it.

189
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,057
Her telepathic visions
are increasing,

190
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,892
both in frequency and intensity.

191
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,477
It feels different
this time.

192
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,896
It's almost like...
they're right here

193
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,439
in the room.

194
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,610
DOCTOR:
There it is again.

195
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,904
I'm trying
to block them out...

196
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,114
but I can't.

197
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,579
Every time she has a vision,
specific regions

198
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,373
of her cerebral cortex go into
a state of hyper-stimulation--

199
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,667
memory engrams,
perceptual centers.

200
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,960
I can't be sure, but I think
there's more going on here

201
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,088
than just a simple "hello."

202
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,634
Enhance this grid.

203
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,095
I want to take a closer look
at the detonator.

204
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,934
We must analyze the bioship.

205
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,310
Your data.

206
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,537
You're human, aren't you?

207
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,164
This body was assimilated
18 years ago.

208
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,626
It ceased to be
human at that time.

209
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,502
I'm curious.
What was your name before--?

210
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,422
Do not engage us
in further irrelevant discourse.

211
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,048
( buzzing beeps )

212
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,510
We are being hailed
by your vessel.

213
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,848
Commander, what is it?

214
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,059
<i>It's Kes. </i>
<i>The Doctor believes</i>

215
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,061
<i>that the aliens</i>
<i>are accessing her memory.</i>

216
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,523
If that's true, they may already
know what we're planning.

217
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,985
I've ordered long-range scans
for bioships. Nothing so far.

218
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,988
We should alter course,
try to throw them off.

219
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,365
Agreed.

220
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,078
Our course and heading
have been changed.

221
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,955
Match them and keep me apprised

222
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,332
of any changes
in Kes.

223
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,833
<i>Chakotay out.</i>

224
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,253
We now require
one of your photon torpedoes

225
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,922
and the nanoprobes.
One step at a time.

226
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,676
We're not safely across
your territory yet.

227
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:06,513
We must construct
and test a prototype now.

228
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,097
The risk of attack
has increased.

229
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,224
Irrelevant. We have an
agreement.

230
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,393
You're asking me
to give up my only guarantee

231
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,188
that you won't assimilate us.
I won't risk it.

232
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,899
Are you willing to risk
a direct confrontation with us?

233
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,528
If we transport

234
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,489
500 drones onto your vessel,

235
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,534
do you believe you could offer
sufficient resistance?

236
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,661
We'd die trying.

237
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,040
That won't be necessary.

238
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,875
We must construct
a launching system

239
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,127
to accommodate this design.

240
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,467
CHAKOTAY:
Glad you could join us, Mr. Kim.

241
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,761
PARIS:
Harry, welcome back.

242
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,847
Thanks. Reporting
for duty, sir.

243
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,724
The Doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

244
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,517
Did I miss anything?

245
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,686
Not too much.

246
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,730
Take your station, Ensign.

247
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,446
You've still got a tendril
up your nose.

248
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,823
PARIS:
Commander,

249
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,867
I'm picking up
gravimetric distortions.

250
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,535
12,000 kilometers aft.

251
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,246
It's a singularity.

252
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,998
( alarm sounds softly )

253
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,292
We are under attack.

254
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,964
They're charging weapons.
Shields.

255
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,427
Keep a lock
on the away team.

256
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,387
Direct hit
to our secondary hull.

257
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,681
( console beeping )
Transporters are off-line.

258
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,266
Shields and weapons are down.

259
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,899
<i>Voyager</i> has taken heavy damage.

260
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,735
We cannot let the
nanoprobes be destroyed.

261
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,113
We're being targeted.

262
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,156
Brace for impact.

263
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,179
The cube?

264
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,682
Destroyed... and it took
the bioship with it.

265
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,518
( haltingly ):
<i>Tuvok to Chakotay.</i>

266
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,103
Go ahead, Tuvok.
Where are you?

267
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,688
<i>I'm in Cargo Bay 2...</i>

268
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,482
( grunting )

269
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,526
along with the Captain...

270
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,487
and a number of Borg.

271
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,949
<i>We were beamed over</i>
<i>just before impact.</i>

272
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,243
<i>We require assistance.</i>

273
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,455
Tuvok? Tuvok?

274
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,165
Secure that deck.

275
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,250
Security team
to Cargo Bay 2.

276
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,377
Paris, you have the Bridge.

277
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,160
SEVEN OF NINE:
Lower your weapons.

278
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,791
We are here
with your Captain's consent.

279
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,460
It was necessary
to sacrifice our vessel

280
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,462
to protect yours.

281
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,513
We have an alliance,
do we not?

282
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,563
CHAKOTAY:
For now, they're contained.

283
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,982
They've assimilated Cargo Bay 2
and are drawing energy

284
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,734
from the secondary
power couplings.

285
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,402
But they've gone
no further?

286
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,779
Not yet.
I've sealed off Decks 9

287
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,574
through 13 and posted security
details at every access point.

288
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,992
I suggest we
increase security

289
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,619
around Sick Bay as well.
Already done.

290
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,371
How far did you get
on the weapon?

291
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,040
We are ready to
construct a prototype.

292
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,292
You're fit to return
back to duty, Lieutenant.

293
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,211
And you, Kes?

294
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,546
Oh, I'm all right.

295
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,506
The visions have
stopped for now.

296
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,890
The plasma burns to her
thoracic region I can treat

297
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,100
and I've already stopped
the internal bleeding,

298
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,770
but her neural injuries
are going to require some...

299
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,564
creative thinking.
Before we beamed out,

300
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,650
an alien energy discharge
struck very near the Captain.

301
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,151
Well, it appears to have
disrupted

302
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,112
all her neuroelectrical
pathways.

303
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,405
I'll have to induce a coma

304
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,198
to protect
her higher brain functions,

305
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,450
but I must tell you,

306
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,660
unless I can
repair the damage...

307
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,496
she may never
regain consciousness.

308
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,541
Make sure those Borg stay put.

309
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,418
I want tactical updates
every 20 minutes.

310
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,046
Aye, sir. Shall I resume
working with them?

311
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,090
Stand by for now.

312
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,092
The Captain wishes
to speak with you.

313
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,135
Please keep it brief.

314
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,146
( weakly ):
The Doctor...

315
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,608
explained my condition.

316
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,027
You are in command.

317
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,863
I understand.

318
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,491
They'll push you...

319
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,367
they'll threaten you,

320
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,454
but they need you.

321
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,457
They need this alliance.

322
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:33,255
You have to make this work.

323
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:39,553
I want you to
make this work.

324
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:44,017
Get this crew home.

325
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,979
I must begin.

326
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,027
Where is
your Captain?

327
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,444
I must speak with her.

328
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,697
In our medical bay,
recovering.

329
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,408
You'll be dealing
with me now.

330
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:46,204
Circumstances have changed.
I'd say so.

331
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:49,916
The loss of our vessel requires
that we modify our agreement.

332
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,169
I've been giving that
some thought.

333
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,504
I'm willing
to let you stay on board.

334
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,924
We'll continue to work
with you on the weapon.

335
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,676
Once we're safely out
of Borg territory,

336
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,720
we'll give you
the nanoprobes,

337
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,639
shake hands
and part company.

338
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,433
Insufficient.

339
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,769
Our latest tactical
projections indicate

340
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,396
that the war
will be lost by then.

341
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,735
The nearest Borg vessel
is 40 light-years away.

342
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,780
You will reverse course
and take us to it.

343
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,407
Even at maximum warp,
that's a five-day journey,

344
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,034
in the wrong direction.

345
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,536
We're supposed to be
heading out of Borg space

346
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,746
not deeper into it.

347
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,415
There is no alternative.
Look...

348
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,333
I'll honor
the original agreement,

349
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,294
but I'm not turning
this ship around.

350
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,712
It's too dangerous.

351
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:43,177
Denying our request
is also dangerous.

352
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,472
I'll think about it.

353
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,015
Think quickly.

354
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,817
A five-day trip back into
the heart of Borg territory,

355
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,735
it's too risky.

356
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,029
With those drones
and the nanoprobes on board,

357
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,991
we might as well have a
bull's-eye painted on our hull.

358
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,368
We're a prime target
for Species 8472.

359
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,204
We'd never survive
another attack.

360
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,456
What is the
alternative?

361
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,459
I'm going to end this alliance,
here and now.

362
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,170
We're going to
drop the Borg off

363
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,712
on the next
uninhabited planet,

364
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,423
give them the nanoprobes
and take our chances alone.

365
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,383
They can wait for a Borg ship
to pick them up

366
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,012
and finish the weapon.
I'm in command now

367
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,388
and I have to do what I think
is best for this crew.

368
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,890
Tom, I want you to scan

369
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,143
for the nearest uninhabited
planet and set a course.

370
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,104
Aye, sir.
I must caution you, Commander.

371
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,439
The Borg may not
go quietly.

372
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,816
We'll see.

373
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,401
Bring that female drone
to the ready room.

374
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,029
Dismissed.

375
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,700
Once we've beamed
you to the surface,

376
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,118
we'll send down
the nanoprobes

377
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,537
and all our research.
Unacceptable.

378
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,746
We don't have time...

379
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,332
This isn't open
for discussion.

380
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,293
I'm not turning
this ship around.

381
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,337
You're getting what you wanted.

382
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,630
I suggest
we part ways amicably.

383
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,176
There is another option.

384
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,468
We could assimilate your vessel.

385
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,804
If a single drone
steps one millimeter

386
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,599
out of that cargo bay,
I'll decompress the entire deck.

387
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,435
You won't pose much of a threat
floating in space.

388
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,899
When your Captain
first approached us,

389
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,400
we suspected that an agreement
with humans would prove

390
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,653
impossible to maintain.

391
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,656
You are erratic,
conflicted,

392
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,616
disorganized.

393
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:33,913
Every decision is debated,
every action questioned,

394
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:39,168
every individual entitled
to their own small opinion.

395
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,713
You lack harmony, cohesion...

396
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,882
greatness.

397
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,511
It will be your undoing.

398
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,641
Escort our guest back
to the cargo bay.

399
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,049
Well, I've made my decision.

400
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,550
If it were only a matter

401
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,762
of going against the orders
of my superior officer...

402
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,684
You're more
than just my Captain.

403
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,979
You're my friend.

404
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,066
I hope you'll understand.

405
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:11,344
COLLECTIVE:
<i>Species 8472 has penetrated</i>
<i>matrix 010,</i>

406
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,637
<i>grid 19.</i>

407
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,722
<i>Eight planets destroyed.</i>

408
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,892
<i>312 vessels disabled.</i>

409
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,855
<i>4,000,621 Borg eliminated.</i>

410
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,025
<i>We must seize control</i>
<i>of the Alpha Quadrant vessel</i>

411
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,402
<i>and take it</i>
<i>into the alien realm.</i>

412
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,571
We understand.

413
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,253
Class-H moon,
oxygen-argon atmosphere.

414
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,839
It'll do. Take us out of warp,
and enter orbit.

415
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,757
Aye, sir.
Tuvok...

416
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,511
stand by to transport the Borg
directly from the cargo bay.

417
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,013
After they're on the surface,
have security run a sweep of--

418
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,516
I'm reading power fluctuations
in the deflector array.

419
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,808
Cause?
It looks like the Borg

420
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,268
have accessed
deflector control.

421
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,145
They're trying to realign
the emitters.

422
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,147
Shut them out.

423
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,444
They've bypassed
security protocols.

424
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,413
They're emitting
a resonant graviton beam.

425
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,415
It's creating another
singularity!

426
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,875
Reverse course.

427
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,794
We're fighting intense
gravimetric distortion.

428
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,130
I can't break free!

429
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,008
Bridge to Cargo Bay 2.
Stop what you're doing,

430
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,262
or I'll depressurize that deck
and blow you out into space.

431
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,931
This is your final warning.

432
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,935
Do it.

433
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,875
Decompression cycle complete.

434
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,172
I still don't have
deflector control.

435
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,842
Commander,
a single Borg has survived.

436
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,267
We're being pulled in!

437
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,654
Report.

438
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,492
TUVOK:
We appear to have crossed
an interdimensional rift.

439
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:40,826
( console beeping )

440
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,702
We've definitely
left our galaxy.

441
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,662
No stars, no planets.

442
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,706
Let's see.

443
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,044
TORRES:
I'm recalibrating sensors.

444
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,716
The entire region
is filled with...

445
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,011
with some kind of organic fluid.

446
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,888
This isn't space.

447
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,932
It's matter.

448
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,935
SEVEN OF NINE:
<i>Commander Chakotay.</i>

449
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,897
<i>We have entered the domain</i>
<i>of Species 8472.</i>

450
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,109
<i>Report to the cargo bay.</i>

451
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,613
Paris, repressurize
Cargo Bay 2.

452
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,198
Tuvok.

453
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,290
Our entry into
fluidic space

454
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,125
has created a
compression wave.

455
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,085
They know we're here.

456
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,631
A fleet of bioships is already
converging on our position.

457
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:40,010
Time to intercept:
three hours, 17 minutes.

458
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,262
You've been here before.

459
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,264
How else could you know
about fluidic space?

460
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,725
We must prepare this vessel
for the altercation.

461
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,228
We will construct a complement
of biomolecular war--

462
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,148
Why?
Why were you here?

463
00:28:55,651 --> 00:29:00,364
You started this war...
didn't you?

464
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,823
What's the matter?

465
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,909
Our galaxy wasn't
big enough for you?

466
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,911
You had to conquer
new territory?

467
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,414
But this race fought back--

468
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,083
A species as malevolent
as your own.

469
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:18,674
Species 8472 was more resistant
than we anticipated.

470
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,218
Their technology
is biogenically engineered.

471
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,679
It is superior to that
of all other species

472
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,180
we have previously
encountered.

473
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,766
Which is precisely
what you wanted.

474
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,769
They are the apex
of biological evolution.

475
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,021
Their assimilation
would have greatly added

476
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,565
to our own perfection.

477
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,983
So, instead of assimilating
these aliens,

478
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,695
you opened a door for them
to our galaxy.

479
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,283
There is only one
course of action.

480
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,286
Destroy them first.

481
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,162
My subspace link
to the collective

482
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,540
has been weakened
by the interdimensional rift.

483
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,918
We cannot signal for help.
We are alone.

484
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:59,131
We must construct a complement
of biomolecular warheads

485
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,924
and modify your weapons
to launch them.

486
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,635
I've got a better idea.

487
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:05,011
Why don't you open up
that rift again

488
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,972
and take us back?

489
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,225
If I do that, you will
no longer cooperate.

490
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,852
<i>Doctor to Chakotay.</i> 
Go ahead.

491
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,896
<i>Report to Sick Bay at once.</i>

492
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,565
On my way.

493
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,863
Captain?

494
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,575
Ah, as you can see,

495
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,161
I've repaired
her neural damage.

496
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,331
Ensign Kim, the Captain.
I'm two for two.

497
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,333
Doctor, if you'll excuse us
for a moment.

498
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,834
Hmm?

499
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,753
Eh?

500
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,798
Oh. Gladly.

501
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,300
Computer, deactivate
EMH program.

502
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,472
The Doctor brought
me up to speed,

503
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:53,059
but he couldn't tell me
what I really wanted to know.

504
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,728
Why?

505
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,314
The collective ordered me
to reverse course,

506
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,566
travel 40 light-years
back the way we came.

507
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,818
What would you have done?

508
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,569
I probably would have
reversed course--

509
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,571
maintained the alliance
as long as possible.

510
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,365
In my mind, the alliance
was already over.

511
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,784
You never trusted me. You never
believed this would work.

512
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,619
You were just waiting
for an opportunity

513
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,288
to circumvent my orders.
Trust had nothing to do with it.

514
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,082
I made a tactical decision.
And so did I.

515
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,335
They've been taking advantage
of us from day one.

516
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,295
We made concessions,
so did they.

517
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,714
They lied.

518
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,924
The Borg started the war
with Species 8472.

519
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,097
We've only got one Borg left
to worry about.

520
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,391
We should try
to disable her

521
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,975
and get back
to the Delta Quadrant.

522
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,478
We might be able to duplicate
the deflector protocols

523
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,397
they used to open a singularity.

524
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,024
No.

525
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,402
I won't be caught tinkering
with the deflector

526
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,904
when those aliens attack.

527
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,947
There is no other way out
of this, Chakotay.

528
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,325
It's too late for opinions. It's
too late for discussion.

529
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,619
It's time to make the call,
and I'm making it.

530
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,206
We fight the aliens, in full
cooperation with the Borg.

531
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,917
I was linked
to a collective once, remember?

532
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,461
I had a neuro-transceiver
embedded in my spine.

533
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,463
I know who we're dealing with.

534
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,382
We've got to get rid
of that last Borg

535
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,966
and take our chances alone.

536
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,803
It won't work.

537
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,014
This isn't working, either.

538
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,392
There are two wars going on,
the one out there

539
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,978
and the one in here, and...
we're losing both of them.

540
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,482
"It will be your undoing."

541
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,859
What?

542
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:30,699
Our conflicted nature,
our individuality.

543
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,534
Seven of Nine said
that we lacked

544
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,536
the cohesion
of a collective mind.

545
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,538
That one day,
it would divide us

546
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,206
and destroy us.

547
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,251
And here we are,
proving her point.

548
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,671
I'll tell you when we lost
control of this situation,

549
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,633
when we made our mistake.

550
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,009
It was the moment
we turned away from each other.

551
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,512
We don't have to stop being
individuals to get through this.

552
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,682
We just have to stop
fighting each other.

553
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,195
Captain Janeway.

554
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,949
I've relieved Mr. Chakotay
of his duties

555
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,408
and confined him to the brig.

556
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,327
I'm back in command.

557
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,707
And you understand
the situation?

558
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,208
Completely.

559
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,378
Tuvok, give her the nanoprobes.
Work with her.

560
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,714
Build as many warheads
as you can

561
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,716
and start modifying
our weapon systems.

562
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,094
I suggest we think about
enhancing our defenses as well.

563
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,805
If we're going
to fight this battle,

564
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,264
I intend to win it.

565
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,018
We are in agreement.
Good.

566
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,270
This is the plan.

567
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,482
We engage the enemy here,
in their space.

568
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,025
We show them
what they're up against.

569
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,068
If they have any sense
of self-preservation,

570
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,445
they'll back off,

571
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,823
pull their ships out
of the Delta Quadrant.

572
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,992
That's provided
the weapons are effective.

573
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,284
If they aren't...

574
00:33:56,284 --> 00:34:00,121
it's been nice
working with you.

575
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,165
We've got to get this
ship armed and ready

576
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,376
in under two hours.

577
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,295
We're going to war.

578
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,404
Borg modifications are complete.

579
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,447
Bring them on line.

580
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,496
Torpedo launch tubes active.

581
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,081
Hull armor
engaged.

582
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,624
Shield enhancements stable.

583
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,376
Biomolecular weapons are ready.

584
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:50,839
13 standard photon torpedoes
and one class-10 armed

585
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,591
with a high-yield
warhead.

586
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,010
All hands,
this is the Captain.

587
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,428
Ready your stations,

588
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,097
seal all emergency
bulkheads, and prepare

589
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,767
to engage the enemy.
Stand by for my orders.

590
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,734
Four bioships
have just entered sensor range.

591
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,111
Battle stations.
( alarm sounding )

592
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,488
I've got a visual.

593
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,365
On screen.

594
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,460
I can hear them.

595
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,129
They want to talk through me.

596
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,591
They say we've contaminated
their realm.

597
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,009
Tell them we had no choice.

598
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,261
We were only trying
to defend ourselves.

599
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:46,061
They say our galaxy is impure.

600
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:50,899
Its proximity is a threat
to their... genetic integrity.

601
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,485
Tell them we have a weapon,
a devastating weapon

602
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,487
that can destroy them
at the cellular level.

603
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,864
If they don't stop their attacks
on the Delta Quadrant,

604
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,407
we'll be forced to use it.

605
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:06,247
They said, "Your galaxy
will be purged."

606
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,340
( groaning )

607
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,758
( grunts )

608
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,516
Shields and weapons
are off-line!

609
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,476
Rerouting emergency power
to the launchers.

610
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,478
They're coming around
for another assault!

611
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,063
I've lost thrusters!

612
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,065
Biomolecular warheads
are charged and ready.

613
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,566
Fire.

614
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,285
Direct hit on all four vessels.

615
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,454
No effect.

616
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,914
They're charging weapons.

617
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,890
The nanoprobes were successful,
if not prompt.

618
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,350
All four ships
have been destroyed.

619
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,103
I think we've made our point.

620
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,689
Now open a singularity
and get us out of here.

621
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,664
Captain.

622
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,003
Kes, are you still in contact?

623
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,880
Yes.

624
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,715
Tell them if they continue
their attack,

625
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,508
we'll use the weapon again.

626
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,303
They're not responding.

627
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,265
Evasive maneuvers.
PARIS: Aye, Captain.

628
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,101
They're in pursuit.

629
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,977
Prepare to fire
the high-yield warhead.

630
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,478
Aft torpedo bay.

631
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,154
Ready, Captain.

632
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,240
Do it.

633
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,876
Thirteen bioships
have been destroyed.

634
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,170
The others
are in retreat.

635
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,423
I have regained full contact
with the collective.

636
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,094
What are they saying?

637
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,808
All remaining bioships
in the Delta Quadrant

638
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,685
are returning to their realm.

639
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,854
The Borg have prevailed.

640
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,357
With a little help from us.

641
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,153
Now, it's time you fulfilled
your end of the agreement.

642
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,738
Tell the collective
we expect safe passage

643
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,116
from here on out. We'll give you
a shuttlecraft.

644
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,576
You can head
for the nearest Borg ship.

645
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,288
Unacceptable.

646
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:53,414
This alliance is terminated.

647
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,541
Your ship and its crew
will adapt

648
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,836
to service us.

649
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,050
Resistance is futile.

650
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,805
Captain, she's tapping
into helm control.

651
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,765
She's trying to access
our coordinates.

652
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,643
Shut her out.
I can't.

653
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,354
Bridge to Chakotay. Scorpion.

654
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,446
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Seven of Nine,</i>
<i>stop what you're doing.</i>

655
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:29,326
<i>You're human,</i>
<i>a human individual.</i>

656
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,786
<i>Our minds are linked.</i>
<i>We are one.</i>

657
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,746
<i>I can hear your thoughts.</i>

658
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,541
His link is stable,
but it won't be for long.

659
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,376
You must hurry.

660
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,753
Just a few more seconds.

661
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,964
<i>I can see your memories.</i>

662
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,467
<i>You remember being human.</i>

663
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,803
We are Borg.

664
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,723
<i>I see a young girl.</i>

665
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,185
<i>A family.</i>

666
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,479
Irrelevant.

667
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,066
Your appeal to my humanity
is pointless.

668
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,776
Almost there, Chakotay. You've
got to keep her distracted

669
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,278
if we're going
to make this work.

670
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,864
<i>Listen to your human side...</i>

671
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,241
<i>to yourself...</i>

672
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,658
<i>the little girl.</i>

673
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,951
( beeping warning )

674
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,620
<i>Seven of Nine... Annika.</i>

675
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,414
He's losing the link!

676
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,208
Initiating power surge...

677
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,210
now!

678
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,800
( gasps )

679
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,970
( cries out )

680
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,015
( yelling )

681
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,434
( groaning )

682
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,606
Her connection
to the collective is severed.

683
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,401
Get her to Sick Bay.

684
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,693
Bridge to Doctor.

685
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,112
Report.

686
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,824
Commander Chakotay's going
to be all right,

687
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,119
although he may wake up
with a bit of a headache.

688
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,955
Tom, plot a course
out of Borg space,

689
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,706
maximum warp.

690
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,375
Yes, ma'am.

691
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:06,464
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51003.7.</i>

692
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,135
<i>Three days, and no sign</i>
<i>of Borg or bioships.</i>

693
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,095
<i>We appear to be out of danger,</i>

694
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,097
<i>but the entire crew is on edge</i>

695
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,807
<i>and so am I.</i>

696
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,393
<i>Not even the calm</i>
<i>of Master da Vinci's workshop</i>

697
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,937
<i>is enough to ease my mind.</i>

698
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:29,028
( holodeck door opens )

699
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,702
Am I interrupting?
Not at all.

700
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,830
I'm just finishing up my log.

701
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,499
The old-fashioned way.
I wanted to get as far away

702
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,919
from bio-implants
and fluidic space and...

703
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,256
and this feels
more human somehow.

704
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,301
I hate to spoil the mood, but
you might want to take a look

705
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,678
at this Engineering report.
It'll take at least two weeks

706
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,681
to remove the Borg technology
from our systems.

707
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,099
B'Elanna did note

708
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,852
that the power couplings
on Deck 8 work better

709
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,603
with the Borg
improvements.

710
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,022
Leave them.

711
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,606
How is our passenger?

712
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,192
The Doctor says
she's stabilizing.

713
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,652
Her human cells
are starting to regenerate.

714
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,114
I wonder what's left under
all that Borg technology...

715
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,658
if she can ever
become human again.

716
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,327
You plan to keep her on board?

717
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:18,995
We pulled the plug.

718
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:22,165
We're responsible
for what happens to her now.

719
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,794
She was assimilated
at a very young age.

720
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,672
The collective's
all she knows.

721
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,966
She might not
want to stay.

722
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,177
I think she might.

723
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:37,138
We have something
the Borg could never offer.

724
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,184
Friendship.

725
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,397
I want you to know
that disobeying your orders

726
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,982
was one of the most difficult
things I've ever had to do.

727
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,402
I understand.

728
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:52,987
And I respect
the decision you made,

729
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,490
even though I disagree with it.

730
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,450
What's important
is that, in the end,

731
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,744
we got through this, together.

732
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,414
I don't ever want that
to change.

733
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,290
Agreed.

734
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,502
Good. Well...

735
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,422
I think it's time
we get back to our Bridge.

736
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,340
No argument there.
