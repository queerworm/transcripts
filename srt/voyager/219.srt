1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,093
Sorry I'm late,

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,053
but I have
a very good excuse.

3
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,472
Picture this:

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,683
I'm just getting ready
to leave the Mess Hall

5
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,977
when Ensign Wildman
goes into labor.

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:20,604
What else could I do
but deliver the baby?

7
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,356
Oh, you should
have been there, Harry.

8
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,693
There is nothing like bringing
a new life into the world.

9
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,486
I think I missed
my calling.

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,865
What if I told you

11
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,074
the turbolift got stuck
on Deck 6?

12
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,118
This is the third time
you've been late this week,

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,161
Mr. Paris.

14
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,330
It won't happen again.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,790
TUVOK:
Commander,

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,208
I am picking up
a distress call

17
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,835
on one of the upper
subspace bands.

18
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,169
CHAKOTAY:
What's the source?

19
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,713
A small spacecraft.

20
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,088
No weapon systems.

21
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,757
One life-form aboard.

22
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,342
Extremely weak life signs.

23
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,719
CHAKOTAY:
Slow to half impulse.

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,261
According to
the bioscanner,

25
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,638
it's a Vidiian female.

26
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,431
Open a channel.

27
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,017
No response.

28
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,519
She may be too sick.

29
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,521
Or maybe it's
some kind of trick.

30
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,440
Preliminary scans show no other
Vidiian ships in this sector.

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,401
It is unlikely
that this is a trap.

32
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,194
Commander Chakotay,
notify the Doctor.

33
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,071
Mr. Kim, beam the woman
to Sick Bay.

34
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,406
KIM:
Aye, Captain.

35
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,167
Her renal organs

36
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,420
are functioning at
20 percent of normal

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,713
and her cardiovascular system

38
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,130
is on the verge
of collapse.

39
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,842
20 milligrams
of lectrazine.

40
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:41,226
Cardiovascular and renal
systems are stabilizing,

41
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,311
but her neural patterns
are fading.

42
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,651
What is it?

43
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,737
In her parietal lobe.

44
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,073
It looks like
some sort of implant.

45
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,829
It's a very complex web
of bio-neural circuitry,

46
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,122
nano-fibers.

47
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,583
Could this be
what's causing the problem?

48
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,126
On the contrary.

49
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,711
According to these readings,

50
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,756
the device is actually
storing her synaptic patterns,

51
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,049
processing them

52
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,968
and transmitting
neuro-electrical impulses

53
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,594
to the rest
of her systems.

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,978
Are you saying it's some kind
of artificial brain?

55
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,105
No.

56
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,608
I'd say it's more like
a neuro-cortical stimulator

57
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,319
designed to supplement
the higher brain functions.

58
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,113
But it's not
working anymore.

59
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,322
From what I can tell,

60
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,282
the implant itself
is functioning,

61
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,367
but it's connected
to mostly dead nerve cells.

62
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,120
If we don't do
something quickly,

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,664
she'll be brain dead
in a matter of minutes.

64
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,374
What about trying to
stimulate cell regeneration

65
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,418
with a high dosage
of inaprovaline?

66
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,962
Very impressive, Kes,

67
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,006
but I think it's
too late for that.

68
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,550
Get me a high-frequency
RF transmitter.

69
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,719
You're going to have
to hurry, Kes.

70
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,972
The patient's brain function
is diminishing rapidly.

71
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,186
Now... set the
delta band frequency

72
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,231
of the holo-emitter
to 8.6 tetrahertz.

73
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,733
What are we doing,
exactly?

74
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,652
Transferring the patient's
synaptic patterns

75
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,904
into the holo-buffer
before they degrade completely.

76
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,366
Is there enough
storage capacity

77
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,869
in the holo-matrix for such
complex data patterns?

78
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,245
There's enough capacity
for my program, isn't there?

79
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,749
And my program contains over
50 million gigaquads of data,

80
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,793
which, I don't have to tell you,
is considerably more

81
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,004
than the most highly-developed
humanoid brains.

82
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,464
What good is preserving
her synaptic patterns

83
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,216
if there is no body?

84
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,885
I'm creating
a holographic body.

85
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,554
Not only will we be able
to communicate

86
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,597
with the patient, but we'll
have an accurate model

87
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,557
of healthy Vidiian

88
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,683
physiology
that will aid

89
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,267
in treating
her actual body.

90
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:50,605
Computer, project the patient's
skeletal structure.

91
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,360
Now add internal organs.

92
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,697
Add musculature.

93
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,869
Now apply epidermal layers.

94
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,332
Computer,
use transporter records

95
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,877
to recreate
the patient's clothing.

96
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,764
(<i> sighs</i> )

97
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,689
[♪♪♪]

98
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,584
According to her ship's
navigational logs,

99
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,880
the woman was en route
to a remote Vidiian colony.

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,089
Are we anywhere near it?

101
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,008
It's about ten
light-years away.

102
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,969
We should be in the general
vicinity in about 22 days.

103
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,386
Assuming she survives

104
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,015
and we can take adequate
security precautions,

105
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,809
we'll turn her over to her
people when we get there.

106
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,393
Captain.

107
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,979
Is there something wrong?

108
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,732
I wanted to talk to you
about Lieutenant Paris.

109
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,152
His attitude lately's been
less than professional.

110
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,029
I've noticed.

111
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,698
I know crew discipline's
my responsibility,

112
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,118
but, in this case, I thought
I should let you get involved

113
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,452
before I took any action.

114
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,704
In a way, Paris has been

115
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,623
your personal
reclamation project.

116
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,960
I appreciate your bringing this
to my attention, Commander,

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,215
but I trust you to handle
the problem any way you see fit.

118
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,473
DOCTOR:
<i>Chief Medical Officer's Log,</i>

119
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,142
<i>Test results indicate</i>

120
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,895
<i>that the holographic body</i>
<i>is functioning normally.</i>

121
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,398
<i>The patient's synaptic patterns</i>

122
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,566

123
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,902
<i>her cognitive</i>
<i>and motor processes.</i>

124
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,711
Who are you?

125
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm the Chief Medical Officer

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,673
of the Federation Starship
<i>Voyager.</i>

127
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,635
We received your distress call
and brought you aboard.

128
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,186
What have you done to me?

129
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,729
It's quite
simple really.

130
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,940
I used the undamaged chromosomes
in your cerebellum

131
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,443
to recreate
your original DNA code,

132
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,027
and then programmed
the computer

133
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,654
to project
a holographic template

134
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,239
based on that genome.

135
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,074
Holographic?

136
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,576
A three-dimensional
projection

137
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,953
of light and energy.

138
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,247
See for yourself.

139
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,384
(<i> gasps</i> )

140
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,349
Your neural patterns
were degrading rapidly.

141
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,641
It was too late

142
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,518
to expect results
from inaprovaline,

143
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,021
so I was forced to improvise,

144
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,483
not that it would have occurred
to just any physician.

145
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,242
Why are you crying?

146
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,745
I'm sorry. I...

147
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,456
I thought you'd be pleased.

148
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,874
I am.

149
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,628
I just never expected
to look healthy again.

150
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,215
I've been sick for so long.

151
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,012
I'll need
a complete medical history.

152
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,680
How long have you
been ill exactly?

153
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,850
I was first diagnosed with
the phage when I was seven.

154
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,060
And when did you

155
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,270
begin receiving
replacement tissue?

156
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,897
About that same time.

157
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,732
At first, it was hard
to get used to the changes,

158
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,693
but it happened so often
that after a while,

159
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,487
I almost stopped noticing.

160
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,072
I-I never...

161
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,910
I never thought
I'd see myself again.

162
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,875
Thank you.

163
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,877
This is the most
extraordinary thing

164
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,379
anyone has ever done for me.

165
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,880
I wouldn't be too grateful.

166
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,216
There are serious limitations
to being a hologram.

167
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,676
First of all, we can only exist
within environments

168
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,055
equipped with holo-emitters,
such as this Sick Bay.

169
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,973
You mean, you're...

170
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,309
I'm this ship's emergency
medical holographic program.

171
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,938
You're a computer simulation?

172
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,733
An incredibly sophisticated
computer simulation.

173
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,110
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,906
What did you say your name was?

175
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,119
I don't have a name.

176
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,204
It wasn't part
of my original program.

177
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,082
However, you,
I'm sure, have one.

178
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,708
Danara.

179
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,709
Danara Pel.

180
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,211
Well, Miss Pel,

181
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,589
may I ask what someone
with an illness like yours

182
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,300
was doing alone in space
with no access to medical care?

183
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,551
I was helping to treat

184
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,553
an outbreak of the phage
on Fina Prime.

185
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,638
I was on my way
back to my home colony,

186
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,266
but it's a long journey
and my condition got worse.

187
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,768
You're a medical practitioner
of some kind?

188
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,103
A hematologist.

189
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,772
Well, then, perhaps,
given your expertise,

190
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,857
you can help me
with your treatment.

191
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,818
My treatment?

192
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,570
I feel fine.

193
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,238
Unfortunately, that's
only temporary.

194
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,198
Your synaptic patterns
will eventually degrade

195
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,033
if we don't get them out
of the pattern buffers

196
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,076
and back into your brain.

197
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,119
How long?

198
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,288
A few days.
Perhaps a week.

199
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,831
I see.

200
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,958
Your real body is in stasis.

201
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,960
As you can see,
we have to find a way

202
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,629
to repair your
damaged neural tissue.

203
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,049
(<i> gasps</i> )

204
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,510
Is something wrong?

205
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,012
It's nothing.

206
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,181
I'm eager to
discuss treatments.

207
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,723
Of course.

208
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,781
The procedure is quite simple.

209
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,575
I'll drill an opening
into your skull

210
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,370
precisely two millimeters
in diameter,

211
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,703
and then use a neuralyte probe

212
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,789
to extract a sample
of your parietal lobe

213
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,249
weighing approximately
one gram.

214
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,460
It doesn't sound simple to me.

215
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,752
I still have nightmares

216
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,338
about what those people
did to me.

217
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,756
And now you want
to crack open my head,

218
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,509
cut out a piece of my brain

219
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,759
and give it to<i> her?</i>

220
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,679
Your experience
in the Vidiian prison

221
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,848
suggests Klingon DNA
is resistant to the phage.

222
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,351
Losing a small amount of neural
tissue is inconsequential.

223
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,394
Not to me, it isn't.

224
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,936
Yet that same tissue,

225
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,105
grafted onto the patient's brain
and stimulated to grow,

226
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,607
will significantly
slow the spread

227
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,234
of her infection.

228
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,528
If we can increase the grafted
tissue mass quickly enough,

229
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,613
we can transfer
her synaptic patterns

230
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,241
back into her brain before they
degrade in the holo-buffer.

231
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,741
It won't cure the phage,

232
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,744
but it should
prolong her life considerably.

233
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,622
Please change
into a surgical gown

234
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,082
and lie down
on bio-bed number one.

235
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,083
I am not going...

236
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,585
Excuse me.

237
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,715
I just want to say that...

238
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,966
I've read about the experiments
that were done on you.

239
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,261
What you went through
must have been very traumatic.

240
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,012
That is an understatement.

241
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,431
I'm sure it is.

242
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,725
Please understand,
this disease

243
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,060
has been killing my people
for hundreds of years.

244
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,438
Trying to stop it
has become an obsession

245
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,273
and many of our politicians
and scientists

246
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,566
have never developed

247
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,736
compassion for the people
who keep us alive.

248
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,945
As much as I want

249
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,572
to go on living,

250
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,700
I have accepted the fact
that I will die soon.

251
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,497
I only want your help
if you are willing to give it.

252
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,087
Of course, I... I'd like
to help you if I can.

253
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,635
If you have any questions at all
about the procedure,

254
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:25,430
I'd... I'd be happy
to answer them for you.

255
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,682
(<i> sighs</i> )

256
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,562
I'll go and get changed.

257
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,818
DOCTOR:
I've finished
ingrafting

258
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,321
the Klingon
neural tissue

259
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,739
to your
cerebral cortex.

260
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,822
Now, all I have to do

261
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,325
is create
an axonal pathway

262
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,452
between that tissue
and your basal ganglia.

263
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,203
Your technique
is very impressive.

264
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,913
It's all part
of my programming.

265
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,915
For example, this exact
procedure was developed

266
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,418
by Dr. Leonard McCoy
in the year 2253.

267
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,587
I'm equipped with the collective
medical knowledge

268
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,964
of more than 3,000 cultures.

269
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,801
Additionally,
as you see here,

270
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,720
my imaging system
allows me to perform

271
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,180
and, in many cases,
improve upon

272
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,349
the most delicate
tactile maneuvers

273
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,100
required by
a dizzying array

274
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,519
of surgical procedures.

275
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,561
Incredible.

276
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,853
It is, isn't it?

277
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,856
Hand me the submicron
suture, please.

278
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,361
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

279
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,113
There.
That should do it.

280
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,366
Ah. Excellent
work, Doctor.

281
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,950
I was only assisting.

282
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,828
Nonetheless,
that assistance was invaluable.

283
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,496
It could be
two or three days

284
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,289
before we'll know
if the graft will hold.

285
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,250
In the meantime, perhaps
I should deactivate

286
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,002
your program
temporarily.

287
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,629
Do you have to?

288
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,298
It would slow the degradation
of your synaptic patterns.

289
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,591
But I have
so much energy.

290
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,092
I don't know.

291
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,094
Maybe it's the excitement
of the surgery, or...

292
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,222
or maybe it's this new body.

293
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,475
What I'd really like to do
is take a walk

294
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,268
and see the rest of your ship.

295
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,937
Unfortunately,
that's not possible.

296
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,149
However, if you're looking
for something to do,

297
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,901
please feel free
to use my office

298
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,444
to access our medical database.

299
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,405
You'll find several
interesting texts

300
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,947
on comparative endocrinology.

301
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,241
All right.

302
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,076
Thank you.

303
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,413
On second thought,

304
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,623
there is someplace
else we could go.

305
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,209
(<i> conversation, music</i>
<i>and laughter</i> )

306
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,175
It's wonderful.

307
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,177
If I had a place
like this to go to,

308
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,596
I'd be there every day.

309
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,223
Don't your people have
recreational facilities?

310
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,100
Congregating
in groups

311
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,602
is strictly
regulated.

312
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,478
It's considered to be a
threat to public health.

313
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,814
A wise policy.

314
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,357
I suppose.

315
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,443
Sometimes, I think my
people spend so much time

316
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,778
trying to save lives,

317
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,696
they don't know
how to live anymore.

318
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,700
Doctor, aren't you going
to introduce me to your date?

319
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,118
She is not my date.

320
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,578
She's my patient.

321
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,039
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize...

322
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,040
Mr. Neelix,

323
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,167
this is Dr. Danara Pel.

324
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,586
As Chief Morale Officer,

325
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,798
may I be the first
to welcome you to<i> Voyager.</i>

326
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,383
Madame, your loveliness

327
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,094
illuminates
our dark little cavern.

328
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,763
May I have the pleasure
of this next dance?

329
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,681
DOCTOR:
Go away immediately.

330
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,975
Both of you.
You're disturbing my patient.

331
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,604
You are just jealous
because you cannot dance.

332
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,106
Let's go.

333
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,942
You're making
the lady nervous.

334
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,527
Nice to meet you.

335
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,614
I apologize.

336
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,032
No. They were
just being nice.

337
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,702
Irritating, isn't it?

338
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,706
I guess I'm just not used
to... so much attention.

339
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,835
Where I come from,

340
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,294
when you're as sick as I am,

341
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:47,214
people, healthy people.
stay away from you.

342
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,425
I guess...

343
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,930
I...
I forgot for a second

344
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,098
that I don't look
like that anymore.

345
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,852
It's a natural response.

346
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,980
All this talk about me.

347
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,149
There's still so much
I'd like to know about you.

348
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,443
There's not much to tell,
really.

349
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,737
My program was developed
by Dr. Louis Zimmerman

350
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,656
in a lab on Jupiter Station.

351
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,075
I was activated
on stardate 48308.

352
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:19,121
Since that time, I've performed
347 medical exams,

353
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,334
healed 11 compound fractures,
performed three appendectomies

354
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,378
and, in my greatest feat
of medical prowess,

355
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,840
I once cured Mr. Neelix
of an acute case of the hiccups.

356
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,257
(<i> laughing</i> )

357
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,968
You're very funny.

358
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,344
I am?

359
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,932
Well, several clinical studies

360
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,851
have shown humor
to be very therapeutic.

361
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,895
Consider it
part of your treatment.

362
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,900
What is it?

363
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,193
It's, uh... just that I...

364
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,031
I haven't laughed
in a very long time.

365
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,701
Thank you.

366
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,666
What did that man mean
when he said you can't "dance"?

367
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,459
(<i> accordion music continues</i> )

368
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,169
That's dancing.

369
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,303
And you can't do it?

370
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,598
It's not part
of my programming.

371
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,016
Oh.

372
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,350
I see.

373
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,991
Well, Dr. Pel...

374
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,952
Please, call me Danara.

375
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,329
As you wish... Danara.

376
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,540
And what about you?

377
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,042
What should I call you?

378
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,044
Well, as I said--

379
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,837
I know.
You don't have a name.

380
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,092
Would it be all right
if I gave you one?

381
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,552
Well, I...

382
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,971
How about...

383
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,724
Shmullus?

384
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,644
Shmullus?

385
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,395
It was my uncle's name.

386
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,356
He used to make
me laugh, too.

387
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,360
Doctor...

388
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,154
Shmullus.

389
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,116
I think I like
the sound of that.

390
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,159
(<i> music continues</i> )

391
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,010
Well...

392
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,553
here we are.

393
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,430
Yes.

394
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,016
Here we are.

395
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,727
Danara, I think we should--
Yes?

396
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,188
Deactivate your program
for at least eight hours.

397
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,816
If you think it's best.

398
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,609
I do.

399
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,986
All right, then.

400
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,362
All right.

401
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,321
Computer...

402
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,073
Shmullus?
Yes?

403
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,285
I had a wonderful time.

404
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm pleased.

405
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,292
Thank you...

406
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,045
for...

407
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,754
everything.

408
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,882
Thank you for...

409
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,968
giving me a name.

410
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,026
Uh... well...

411
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,986
good night, Danara.

412
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,488
Good night...

413
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,990
Shmullus.

414
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,701
Computer,

415
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,997
deactivate Vidiian
program Alpha.

416
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,440
Mind if I join you?

417
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,743
So how are things, Tom?

418
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,494
Excuse me?

419
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,247
How have you been
feeling lately?

420
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,831
Is something bothering you?

421
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,128
Oh, no offense, Commander,

422
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,464
but why the sudden concern
for my feelings?

423
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,340
Well, you've been
moody lately,

424
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,592
indifferent to your duties.

425
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,761
To be honest, you
don't seem to be

426
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,055
taking your job
very seriously.

427
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,265
If you've got a problem,

428
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,849
I'd like to know
what it is.

429
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,521
Yeah, I've got a problem.

430
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,482
My problem is you.

431
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,113
You care to elaborate?

432
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,866
You tell me
I don't take my job seriously,

433
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,327
but half the time,
you don't let me do my job.

434
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,996
What's that supposed to mean?

435
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:10,997
It means that you

436
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,414
don't trust my judgment.

437
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,250
You don't allow me
to take initiative.

438
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,459
Remember last week?

439
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,877
I suggested
that we might save time

440
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,754
by traveling through
that emissions nebula.

441
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,339
But what did you say?

442
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,759
"Oh, no, that's not the way
we do things on this ship."

443
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,470
Look, sometimes I'm not going
to agree with your suggestions,

444
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,056
but making decisions
is part of being a leader.

445
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,225
Maybe someday you'll
understand that.

446
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,477
Being a leader also means
knowing when to give your people

447
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,147
a little leeway
and let them be creative.

448
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,356
We might as well put this ship
on autopilot

449
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,567
for all the freedom
you give me to do my job.

450
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,445
I didn't come here for a lecture
from you on how to do myjob.

451
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,282
Yeah, well, I know you don't put
much stock in my opinion,

452
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,075
so maybe you should talk

453
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,493
to some
of these people.

454
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,120
Because I'm not
the only one around here

455
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,330
who's got a problem with you.

456
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,916
Now, if there's nothing else...

457
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,417
sir...

458
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,919
I'd like to be excused.

459
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,966
Sure, Paris.

460
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,383
You're excused.

461
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,601
<i>Dissension among</i>
<i>the</i> Voyager<i> crew.</i>

462
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,064
<i>Maje Culluh will find that</i>
<i>very interesting.</i>

463
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,732
<i>Good work, Mr. Jonas.</i>

464
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,692
<i>Now, there's something else</i>
<i>we'd like you to do.</i>

465
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:25,571
<i>We want you to create a small</i>
<i>accident, which will damage</i>

466
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,780
Voyager's<i> warp coils.</i>

467
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,324
Why?

468
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,993
<i>There's no need to concern</i>
<i>yourself with that.</i>

469
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,330
<i>You just... plan the accident.</i>

470
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,664
<i>We'll let you know</i>

471
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,209
<i>exactly when we want it</i>
<i>to happen.</i>

472
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,170
<i>Do we understand each other?</i>

473
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,256
I want to talk to Seska.

474
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,464
<i>I'm afraid Maje Culluh...</i>

475
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,799
You tell Maje Culluh

476
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,760
that I won't do anything
to damage<i> Voyager,</i>

477
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,595
and if he has
a problem with that,

478
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,638
tell him to have
Seska contact me.

479
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,890
(<i> cuts com contact</i> )

480
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,188
Doctor, when you
have a minute.

481
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,857
I'm running a level-2
self-diagnostic right now.

482
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,692
I'll be there
as soon as I'm finished.

483
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,778
Why are you running
a diagnostic?

484
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,572
I've been experiencing
periodic lapses in concentration

485
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,699
and difficulty handling objects.

486
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,410
There may be a malfunction

487
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,578
in my tactile
acuity subroutine.

488
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,163
How long has this
been going on?

489
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,748
About two or three days.

490
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,666
Since Danara came aboard.

491
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,543
What's your point?

492
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,046
Maybe she's the reason
you're feeling this way.

493
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,215
I fail to see a connection.

494
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,759
Maybe you're attracted to her.

495
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,679
I told you,
my program's malfunctioning.

496
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,765
Romance is not a malfunction.

497
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,600
Romance is not part
of my programming.

498
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,852
Your programming's adaptive,
isn't it?

499
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,937
Yes.

500
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,730
Then I'd say it's adapting.

501
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,066
What if...

502
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,447
I don't want it
to adapt right now?

503
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,157
Why wouldn't you?

504
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,241
Because I don't like

505
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,951
what's happening to me.

506
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:03,377
I'm used to being in control
of my faculties...

507
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,839
confident of my decisions.

508
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,924
But lately...

509
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,051
whenever Danara's program
is deactivated

510
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,304
and I should be
concentrating on my work...

511
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,641
I find myself thinking
of nothing but her.

512
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,852
Why don't you
reactivate her?

513
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,356
Because whenever I do that,
I suddenly feel...

514
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,650
unsettled...
unsure of myself,

515
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,819
and I have no idea
what to say.

516
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,449
Why would people
seek out situations

517
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,868
which induce
such unpleasant symptoms?

518
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,245
Because when the other person
feels the same way you do,

519
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,622
it's the most wonderful
thing in life.

520
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,712
Suppose...

521
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,754
hypothetically

522
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,797
of course...

523
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,257
Of course.

524
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,096
I wanted to pursue
that possibility.

525
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,348
How would I proceed?

526
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,350
You'd have to tell her
how you feel.

527
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,269
That's it?

528
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,813
Just... tell her how I feel?

529
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,816
Otherwise, you may never know
how she feels.

530
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,076
I'm going to try stimulating
your motor neurons.

531
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,160
(<i> instrument whirs</i> )

532
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,162
Well, the nucleus cuneatus

533
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,331
appears to be functioning
normally.

534
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:27,461
And now for the anterior
thalamic pathway.

535
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,756
Excellent.

536
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,384
By the way, Danara, I've
been meaning to tell you...

537
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,427
Yes?

538
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,802

543
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,112
Yes.

544
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,905
Well?

545
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,491
Doctor, maybe now
isn't the time to...

546
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,077
Excuse me, Kes.
I was speaking to Danara.

547
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:09,086
I think it's best if we keep our
relationship... professional.

548
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,513
Well...

549
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,976
I'm going to...

550
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:28,355
try stimulating
the posterior sciatic nerve.

551
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,243
Doc, what brings you here?

552
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,120
Is somebody sick?

553
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,247
Actually, Mr. Paris,
I was looking for you.

554
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,915
Oh.

555
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,584
Well, pull up a chair.

556
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,043
Mr. Paris,

557
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,920
I assume you've had a
great deal of experience

558
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,464
being rejected by women.

559
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,132
Oh, thanks a lot, Doc.

560
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,134
What I'd like to know is:

561
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,718
What does one do to recover

562
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,847
from the unpleasant symptoms
of romantic rejection?

563
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,057
Why the sudden interest
in romance?

564
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,476
I can't tell you.

565
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:09,188
It's a matter of doctor/
patient confidentiality.

566
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,524
Ah.

567
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,817
All right, well, let's see.

568
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,072
Sometimes there's
not a lot you can do

569
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,617
to get over a woman
you really care about.

570
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,161
(<i> chuckling</i> )

571
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,080
I remember when Susie
Crabtree dumped me

572
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,376
back in my first year
at the Academy.

573
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,294
I broke out in hives.

574
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,753
Couldn't get out
of bed for a week.

575
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,215
I almost failed
Stellar Cartography.

576
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,883
I walked around
in a daze

577
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,010
for the rest
of that year.

578
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,763
Of course, the first one

579
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,183
is always the hardest
to get over.

580
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,978
I see.

581
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,023
But... eventually,

582
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,859
you start thinking
about her less and less,

583
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,154
until finally,
without realizing it,

584
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,864
she's not on your mind anymore.

585
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,076
So the symptoms do subside
over time?

586
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,995
For the most part.

587
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:12,501
But every now and then,
even years later,

588
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,169
something reminds you of her--

589
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,173
a certain smell,
a few notes of a song--

590
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,383
and suddenly you feel

591
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,134
just as bad as the day
she told you

592
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,929
she never wanted
to see you again.

593
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,724
If you want to know
the honest truth, Doc,

594
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,893
you never completely get over
a woman you really cared about.

595
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,356
Wait a minute.

596
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:38,110
Doc, we're not talking
about<i> you,</i> are we?

597
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,655
I told you, it was confidential.

598
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:45,158
Oh, boy, you've got it bad.

599
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,161
Look, Doc, I don't
mean to intrude,

600
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,039
but if you tell me what's
going on, maybe I can help.

601
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,924
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

602
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,181
Hello, Kes.

603
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,267
Are you feeling
all right?

604
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,145
I'm fine.

605
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm just... waiting
for the Doctor.

606
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,816
Oh.

607
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,234
He's been gone a long time.

608
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,864
You really like
him, don't you?

609
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,620
Then... why didn't
you tell him

610
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,037
that you felt the same way

611
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,540
when he told you that he
was attracted to you?

612
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,751
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.

613
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,085
He just blurted it out.

614
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,505
He's very blunt.

615
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,964
You shouldn't
take it personally.

616
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,257
How could he
possibly have

617
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,677
those kinds
of feelings about me?

618
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,052
Maybe because

619
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,387
you're a compassionate person,

620
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,348
a brilliant doctor,

621
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,724
you appreciate his humor...

622
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,184
Should I go on?

623
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,019
Please don't.

624
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,229
One thing you're
not very good at

625
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,190
is accepting
a compliment.

626
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,483
The next time
someone has

627
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,026
something nice to
say about you

628
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,737
maybe you should just
take them at their word

629
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,155
and feel good
about yourself.

630
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,908
It's not easy to feel
good about yourself

631
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,620
when you're used to living
your life... like that.

632
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,413
Danara, I can't
pretend to know

633
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,873
what your life's
been like,

634
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,625
but I do know
there's nothing sadder

635
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,669
than a missed
opportunity.

636
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,172
Maybe what you
and the Doctor need

637
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,842
is to spend some time
together... alone.

638
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,389
It sounds to me
like she might just be shy.

639
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,932
I think you
scared her off.

640
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,309
I did?

00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,730

642
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,107
Well, what would be
the right approach?

643
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,569
Women like romance.

644
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,404

take them someplace special.

646
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,825
Where would I take her?

00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,199
So, when should I
report back for duty?

719
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,037
When you decide to start
taking your job seriously,

720
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,288
we'll discuss it.

721
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,832
But right now,
you're dismissed.

722
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,126
Get your hands off me!

723
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,049
Mr. Tuvok.

724
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,383
Yes, Captain.

725
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,846
Please escort Mr. Paris
to the brig.

Oh, boy, am I glad to see you.

728
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,705
I wasn't even sure if they were
giving you my messages.

729
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,165
<i>I've gotten them all, Mike.</i>

730
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,582

732
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:54,504
Do you know
what they're asking me to do?

733
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,131
<i>You mean about the warp coils?</i>

734
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,841
<i>I was thinking you could do it</i>

735
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,302
<i>by forcing the magnetic</i>
<i>constrictors out of alignment.</i>

736
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,388
Look, Seska, I don't mind
feeding you information,

737
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,765
but if you're planning
some kind of attack...

738
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,644
I have no intention of raising
my child on a Kazon ship!

748
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,551

of the holo-emitter

to seven terahertz.

754
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,104
Seven terahertz.

755
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,232
(<i> tricorder beeping warning</i> )

756
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,067
Wait a minute.

757
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:00,237
Did you administer the cervaline
as I instructed?

758
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,781
500 milligrams
every four hours.

759
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,865
I don't understand it.

760
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,366
What's wrong?

761
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:09,537
The brain-- your brain--
it's rejecting the graft.

762
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,331
We can't go through
with the transfer.

763
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,885
I'm detecting elevated
levels of nytoxinol.

764
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,137
Where could that
have come from?

765
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,846
Is it possible
you made an error?

766
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,890
Administered nytoxinol
instead of cervaline?

767
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,851
No, I don't think so.

768
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,770
But here's
the hypospray I used.

769
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,105
Check for yourself.

770
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,190
You're correct.
It's cervaline.

771
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,775
Has anyone else
been in Sick Bay

772
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,069
during the last 24 hours
other than you and Danara?

773
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,946
Crewman Foster came
in for some analgesic

774
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,614
and Ensign Wildman
was here

775
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,616
for her regular
prenatal visit. Why?

776
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,994
Because, if the nytoxinol was
not administered by accident,

777
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,453
I can only conclude

778
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,747
that someone is deliberately
trying to kill Danara.

779
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,249
Who would want to kill her?

780
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,459
Perhaps someone who bears
ill will toward Vidiians.

781
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,961
Whoever it is,
I intend to find out.

782
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,337
I'm calling
Lieutenant Tuvok.

783
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,131
Please don't do that.
We have to find out

784
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,133
who's trying
to obstruct your recovery.

785
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,844
Iadministered
the nytoxinol.

786
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,722
Didn't you know
it would kill you?

787
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,390
You mean kill her.

788
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,392
She is you.
Was me.

789
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,520
I don't ever want
to be her again.

790
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,902
What are you doing?

791
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,362
Looking for the cervaline.

792
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,489
I have to reduce the rate
of tissue rejection

793
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,573
before it's too late.

794
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,202
Kes, would you excuse us?

795
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,167
I don't want to go through
with the transfer.

796
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,835
If we don't get
your neural patterns

797
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,045
out of the holo-buffer,

798
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,796
you'll be brain dead
in a matter of days.

799
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,256
I can't let that happen.

800
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,009
I'd rather live two more
days like this with you

801
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,426
than go on for who
knows how long,

802
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,720
wasting away a piece
at a time.

803
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,347
It's my duty
to keep you alive.

804
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,015
I thought you were
more than my doctor.

805
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,391
I thought you
were my friend.

806
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,851
I amyour friend.

807
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,853
What kind of friend
would ask me

808
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,437
to go on living
like this?

809
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,731
And for what?

810
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,233
So that I can go back to a world

811
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,026
where everyone I ever
loved has died,

812
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,778
where almost everyone
I meet is going to die?

813
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,738
You're a doctor.

814
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,697
You can help them.

815
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:08,907
I can't
help them.

816
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,325
I can't cure them.

817
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,994
All I can do
is prolong their suffering...

818
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,289
just like you want
to do to me now.

819
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,499
Danara...

820
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,921
I have no desire
to see you suffer.

821
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,173
Do you know what
it's like? Do you?

822
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,507
No, but...

823
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,343
What it's like to be
a nine-year-old child

824
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,635
and suddenly your best friend

825
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,637
doesn't want to come
to your house anymore.

826
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,473
And when you ask
your mother why...

827
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,310
"Why won't Mala come
and play with me anymore?"

828
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,478
And she tells you
it's because...

829
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:45,193
it's because the other children
are afraid of you.

830
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,987
(<i> sighs</i> )

831
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,494
Listen to me.

832
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,414
Before I met you,

833
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,291
I was just a disease.

834
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,210
But now, everything's different.

835
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,461
When people look at me,

836
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,630
they don't see
a disease anymore.

837
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,760
They see a woman,

838
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,096
a woman you made,

839
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,764
a woman you love,

840
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,183
a woman you're not
afraid to touch.

841
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,645
Danara, I was never
afraid to touch you.

842
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,148
Why? Because
you're a doctor?

843
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,358
Because I love you.

844
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,568
You say that now,

845
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,529
but if I go through
with the transfer...

846
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,074
If you go through
with the transfer...?

847
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,493
I will be sick again...

848
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,911
and ugly.

849
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,122
Danara, you're not ugly.
You're simply ill.

850
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,206
(<i> sighs</i> )

851
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,835
Please, stop patronizing me!

852
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,214
I know how people see me.

853
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:51,134
Danara, do you think
if you go back

854
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,260
into your own body,

855
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,928
I'll feel different
about you?

856
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,929
Won't you?

857
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,055
Listen to me.

858
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,432
Nothing could
ever change

859
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,933
the way I feel about you--

860
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,270
not a few scars,
not some diseased skin, nothing.

861
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,231
You have given me
the most extraordinary gift

862
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,816
that anyone has ever given me.

863
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,360
You brought me to this ship

864
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,112
where no one is sick,
and people are friendly.

865
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,866
You've made me
healthy and beautiful.

866
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:20,163
I don't want to go back
to the way things were.

867
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:25,210
You said, before you knew me,
that you were just a disease.

868
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,505
Well, before you, I was just
a projection of photons

869
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,631
held together by force fields,

870
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,510
a computerized physician
doing a job,

871
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,220
doing it exceptionally well,
of course,

872
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,099
but still, it was... just
a profession, not a life.

873
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,770
But now that you're here,
and my programming has adapted,

874
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,981
I'm not just working anymore.

875
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:47,982
I'm living,

876
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,608
learning what it means...

877
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,944
to be with someone,
to love someone.

878
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,739
I don't think
I can go back

879
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,908
to the way things
were either.

880
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:02,705
Danara, please...

881
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,291
don't die.

882
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,253
I want us to be together.

883
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,838
So do I.

884
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,760
But if you put me back
into that body,

885
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,390
I'll have to go home...
and help my people.

886
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,724
I know.

887
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,810
But we'd still have
two weeks together

888
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,813
before we reached
your colony.

889
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,569
Danara, please,

890
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,653
be with me

891
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,697
for as long as you can.

892
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:44,349
Computer, play music program
