1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,257
PARIS:
All right, all right, hold on.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,010
If you were married in 2304,

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,805
and your daughter was conceived
during your 11th Pon farr,

4
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,851
that would make you...
162 years old.

5
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,186
Incorrect.
KIM: Come on, Tom.

6
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,813
The man's not
a day over 140.

7
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,648
We know you were
at least a hundred

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,441
when you joined Starfleet
the second time,

9
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,945
so I'm guessing
you're around 133?

10
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,571
Also incorrect.

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,615
I'm afraid you both lack
sufficient data

12
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,283
to reach
a logical conclusion.

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,703
Come on, Tuvok,
tell us.

14
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,038
I see no reason
to enlighten you.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,708
Don't tell me Vulcans
are embarrassed
about their age.

16
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,544
On the contrary,
we value the wisdom

17
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,379
that comes with
advancing years.

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,340
In that case,
how wise are you?

19
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,718
Wise enough to end
this inquiry.

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,177
( console beeping )

21
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,929
Saved by the bell.

22
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,347
I've got a fleet
of ships

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,098
200,000 kilometers
dead ahead.

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,393
TUVOK: Can you identify them?
Negative.

25
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,687
I'm reading multiple
hull configurations.

26
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,439
Raise shields.
Red Alert.

27
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,441
JANEWAY:
Report.

28
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,736
We've detected a large
group of vessels
directly ahead.

29
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,153
Hostile?
TUVOK: Possibly.

30
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,363
I'm charging weapons.

31
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,407
On screen.

32
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,995
KIM:
I'm counting 62 ships

33
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,956
and a few hundred
pieces of ships,
all dead in space.

34
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,791
( sighs ):
It's a junkyard.

35
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,710
Congratulations, Tuvok.

36
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,504
You just saved us from
a flotilla of hostile trash.

37
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,506
( communications beep )
KIM: We're being hailed.

38
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,926
JANEWAY:
Let's see what they want.

39
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,637
Welcome to Abaddon's Repository
of Lost Treasures.

40
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,390
Whether you're in the mood
to buy or simply browse,

41
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,558
we're always open.

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,685
Take a look.

43
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,480
You may find something
you never knew you wanted.

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,184
CHAKOTAY:
Mr. Abaddon.

45
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,768
The name was passed down
from my father

46
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,145
and his father before him.

47
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,813
Not a very imaginative lot,

48
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,606
but I'll answer to it
just the same.

49
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,859
I'm Commander Chakotay.
This is Mr. Neelix.

50
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,569
Welcome to Voyager.
Neelix, is it?

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,654
You wouldn't be
a fellow trader, would you?

52
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,406
What makes you
say that?

53
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,241
Cheerful demeanor,
furtive eyes.

54
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,951
It's obvious
you're a man of commerce.

55
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,619
You're very perceptive,
Mr. Abaddon.

56
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,621
A useful skill
in my line of work.

57
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,123
Oh, I'll admit
there was a time

58
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,833
when I dabbled
in commerce,

59
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,543
but these days,
I focus my efforts

60
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,170
on food and diplomacy.

61
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,713
Well, whether you're
interested

62
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,256
in a new
iso-convective oven

63
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,299
or a slightly dated
translation matrix,

64
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,927
you've come
to the right place.

65
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,054
My inventory,
give or take a few items.

66
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,806
After 20 years,
it's hard to keep up.

67
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,684
Looks like you have
an item or two we might
be interested in.

68
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,563
Uh, the question is
what are you looking
for in return?

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,648
Artificial
gravity plating.

70
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,777
( gasps ): Plasma-based
power induction. Impressive.

71
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,737
Those are
integrated systems.

72
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,572
Unfortunately, we couldn't
trade them to you

73
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,282
without dismantling
our whole ship.

74
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,367
Commander, don't
we have some spare

75
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,703
duranium sheeting
in Cargo Bay 1?

76
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,914
With a few
modifications, uh,

77
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,874
it could be converted
into gravity plating.

78
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,169
Good idea. Why don't you show
Mr. Abaddon our inventory?

79
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,796
Report back
when you're done.

80
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,840
Yes, sir. Mr. Abaddon,
follow me, please.

81
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,386
KIM:
This guy's collected more
technology than the Borg.

82
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,306
And almost all of it
is useless.

83
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,558
Wait. What's that?

84
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,935
Ensign?

85
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,062
Grid 49-Alpha.

86
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,692
Oh, she's beautiful.

87
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,360
It's just
an old rust bucket.

88
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,529
What, are you kidding?
Look at those lines.

89
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,240
It's a work of art.

90
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:27,035
That ship wasn't assembled;
it was sculpted.

91
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,288
I think I'm in love.

92
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,918
NEELIX:
That makes 15 power regulators
in fair condition

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,046
and three more we could salvage
with a little work.

94
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,674
Seven has some doubts
about the ion exchange rods...

95
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,342
We'll take a chance.
Add them to the list.

96
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,637
What about these
cultural artifacts?

97
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,141
Oh, just a few items
I thought might have
some historical value.

98
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,642
They don't cost much.

99
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,104
Looks like a good haul.
If that's it...

100
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,691
Oh, uh, yes, there is
one other item:

101
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,028
uh, a small vessel
that could be an asset.

102
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,904
We've already got
a full complement
of shuttles,

103
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,698
not to mention
the Delta Flyer.

104
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,908
What do we need with
this derelict ship?

105
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,037
Chakotay, this ship
is a diamond in the rough.

106
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,789
Sure, it's got
some scrapes and scratches,

107
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,625
but, here, take a look
at these systems.

108
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,254
It has a neurogenic
interface

109
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,839
that allows
it to react

110
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,841
directly to the
pilot's thoughts.

111
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,968
That gives it the potential
of being quicker

112
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,469
and more maneuverable
than anything we've got,

113
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,305
including the
Delta Flyer.

114
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,389
Add to that
an optronic weapons array...

115
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,351
I get the picture.

116
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,769
Are you sure you're
not just looking
for a new toy?

117
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,105
No. Absolutely not.

118
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:41,235
Even B'Elanna thinks
restoring this ship
is worthwhile.

119
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,111
Maybe, if we had the
manpower to restore it.

120
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,739
No, I'll do all the work
myself on my own time...

121
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,450
and if I need a hand,
Harry's offered to help.

122
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,828
I have?

123
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,997
( sighs ):
What will it cost us?

124
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,875
Abaddon's agreed to give it
to us for three used power cells

125
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,169
and Tom's interactive
record collection.

126
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,879
My jukebox.

127
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,423
All right.

128
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,469
One slightly
used alien ship.

129
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,389
Don't make me
regret this.

130
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,266
You won't.

131
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,936
Remember, just one seat.
Not much storage.

132
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,854
She was designed for
speed, not hauling.

133
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,480
Understood.
Make sure you go easy
on the thrusters.

134
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,774
She doesn't like
being manhandled.

135
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,650
Temperamental?
Sensitive.

136
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,819
She demands respect,
like any fine piece
of machinery.

137
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,905
Sounds like you're sorry
to let her go.

138
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,990
In some ways, she's like
the daughter that I
couldn't marry off,

139
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,285
but that doesn't mean
I'd trade her
to just anyone.

140
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,787
I've got a feeling
you're the kind of
pilot that she needs,

141
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,539
someone that'll give
her the proper care
and attention.

142
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,792
I'm your man.
Don't worry, Mr. Abaddon.

143
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,585
She's in good hands.

144
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,797
Well, this has been
a very productive exchange.

145
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,590
Oh, just one more thing...

146
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,841
Uh, let me guess.

147
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,010
All trades are final.

148
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,430
( chuckles )

149
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,606
PARIS:
I still can't get
an active readout.

150
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,400
KIM:
Here's the reason.

151
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,652
Another damaged
power cell.

152
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,946
( sighs ):
Come on, Alice,
how 'bout it?

153
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,530
Give us a break.

154
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,074
Alice?

155
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,327
Well, I've got
to call her something.

156
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,412
How about
the Lost Cause?

157
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:19,666
( chuckles ):
Alice Battisti was
"the lost cause."

158
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,962
I knew her back at the Academy.
She was smart, sexy...

159
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,214
but she wouldn't give me
the time of day.

160
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,509
All right,
Alice it is.

161
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,470
Try it again.

162
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,474
I've got a pulse!

163
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,479
( laughs )
A little snug.

164
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,982
As Seven would say,
an efficient design.

165
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,776
The main computer's
coming on line.

166
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,737
There's not much in it.
Just a few schematics.

167
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,115
Looks like somebody tried
to wipe the database.

168
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,617
Probably rolled the
odometer back, too.

169
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,787
Let's see what
this neurogenic
interface can do.

170
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,503
Whoa.

171
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,921
What's it like?

172
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,590
It's kind of hard
to describe.

173
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,926
I'm tapped into all
the primary systems:

174
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,638
ops, tactical,
sensors...

175
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,558
What happened?

176
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,519
We just blew out
two more power cells.

177
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,603
( groans )

178
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,815
See if you can
reconfigure the power
distribution grid.

179
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,486
Look, we're both tired.
Why don't we call it a night,
come back fresh tomorrow?

180
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,613
Oh, come on, we can
still get a couple
more hours in.

181
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,491
You can get
a couple more hours in.

182
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,368
I'm going to bed.

183
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,498
All right. You win.

184
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,551
Good night, Alice.

185
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,635
See you in the morning.

186
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,908
PARIS:
Good night, Alice.

187
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,286
See you in the morning.

188
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,704
PARIS AND FEMALE VOICE:
See you in the morning.

189
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:26,501
See you in the morning.
See you in the morning.

190
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,587
FEMALE VOICE:
See you in the morning.

191
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,594
( woman whispering ):
Tom...

192
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,015
B'Elanna?

193
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,873
Tom?

194
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,886
Who are you?

195
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,889
It's me, Alice.

196
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,238
Good morning, Alice.

197
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,625
PARIS: I'm sorry,
but you're going to have
to trust me on this.

198
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,588
You'll be a lot happier
if we can bypass
the EPS relays.

199
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,297
Tom.
Yeah?

200
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,258
Who are you
talking to?

201
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,886
Alice. She's being
very stubborn today.

202
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,513
No matter what I do,
I can't get her

203
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,099
to bring her propulsion
systems on line.

204
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,435
Next question:
What are you wearing?

205
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,020
Oh, this is a
flight suit design

206
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,273
I found in
Alice's database,

207
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,526
something her last
pilot used to wear.

208
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,697
( chuckles ):
For a minute, I thought you were
changing Captain Proton's look.

209
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,532
Chapter 37?

210
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,033
Oh, "The Web
of Pain."

211
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,160
I completely forgot.

212
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,913
Oh, no problem-- I've got
another hour on the holodeck.

213
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,710
You know, now is
not a great time.

214
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,336
How 'bout tomorrow?

215
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,255
That's what you
said yesterday.

216
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,215
Sorry, Harry.
Alice needs me.

217
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,592
So does Arachnia.

218
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,261
Give the queen
my regards.

219
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,055
( sighs )

220
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,767
Okay...

221
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,232
Seven, can I get you
something?

222
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,944
A refund. The star charts
we obtained from Abaddon
are inaccurate.

223
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:44,073
Really?
The computations are
based on obsolete data.

224
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:48,161
It's not the only item
that didn't live up
to its advertising.

225
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,622
SEVEN:
Cultural artifacts?

226
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,626
According to Abaddon,
they're lost treasures
of the Delta Quadrant.

227
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,378
If you ask me,
they're worthless trinkets.

228
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,172
Perhaps not.

229
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,341
This crystal
is beryllium.

230
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,176
Valuable?

231
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,763
Beryllium is the
standard currency
in Spatial Grid 539.

232
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,682
There are species
that would trade

233
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,185
an entire fleet
of starships for
this "trinket."

234
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,272
If Abaddon knew about this,
he'd never have traded it
for a few plasma couplings.

235
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,400
Well, maybe
I should return it.

236
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:24,113
Need I remind you?
All trades are final.

237
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:28,117
Neelix, I need one
bottle of champagne,
if you don't mind.

238
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,577
Another anniversary?

239
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,788
No. I'm christening
Alice.

240
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,540
Congratulations.

241
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,042
I'll whip up some hors d'oeuvres
for the crew.

242
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:41,381
Oh, no, don't bother.
This is a private ceremony.
Just me and B'Elanna.

243
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,800
And Alice, of course.
Oh, yes, of course.

244
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,845
There's nothing like having
your own ship.

245
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,680
I remember
when I first laid eyes

246
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,473
on my little freighter,
Baxial.

247
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,809
No, don't tell me--
love at first sight?

248
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,311
Actually, I thought she was
the ugliest thing I ever saw.

249
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,646
( both laughing )

250
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,523
But she grew on me.

251
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,108
Eventually, I-I couldn't
imagine being without her.

252
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,319
You know, she's still down
in the Shuttle Bay.

253
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,655
Why don't we get her
and Alice together
and go on a double date?

254
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,198
You pack the
picnic basket.

255
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,075
I'll bring
the deuterium.

256
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,746
So, I finally get
to meet the other woman.

257
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,498
Don't be too critical.
She's a long way
from finished.

258
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,291
When have you ever known me
to be critical?

259
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,169
( laughs ):
Is that a trick question?

260
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,129
Okay, ready?

261
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,643
Well?

262
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,228
It's beautiful.

263
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,979
I can hardly believe
it's the same ship.

264
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,981
( chuckles ):
Yeah. Most of it isn't.

265
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,109
I've replaced
the impulse reactor,

266
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,404
navigational array,
uh, plasma manifolds...

267
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,740
The list goes on and on.

268
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,868
Just a few more repairs,
and she'll be spaceworthy.

269
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,579
Care to do the honors?

270
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,792
It's almost a shame
to break this over the hull.

271
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,752
You have a point.

272
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,424
Oh, oh, be careful--
the upholstery.

273
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,760
I'll send an Engineering team
down to clean it up.

274
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,845
( chuckles )
To Alice.

275
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,931
To Alice.

276
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,976
So, when's
her first flight?

277
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,770
Well, a couple of days,

278
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,105
if I can round up
all the parts I need.

279
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,441
You want to
come with me?

280
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,109
Sure there's room?

281
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,320
It'll be a
tight squeeze.

282
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,405
We'll manage.

283
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,031
( console beeping )

284
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,450
Hold on.

285
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,577
Something wrong?

286
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,163
It's these
environmental controls.

287
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,915
They need recalibrating.

288
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,834
It is kind of warm
in here, isn't it?

289
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,419
Alice, lower
the ambient temperature.

290
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,546
Please specify, Tom.

291
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,381
Five degrees
should do it.

292
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,843
Temperature modification
complete.

293
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,886
That's some voice.

294
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,055
It came with the ship.

295
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,850
You jealous?

296
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,935
Maybe I should be.

297
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,228
I hear you've been
sleeping here.

298
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,189
When Alice
lets me sleep.

299
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,566
Sounds like a real
slave driver.

300
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,282
Well, if you're trying
to make improvements,

301
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,576
you might want to start
with these reactant
injectors.

302
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,704
The deuterium
mix is too high.

303
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,164
Well, that's
how Alice likes it.

304
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,960
No, don't touch that.

305
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,420
I was just
trying to help.

306
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,464
Well, thanks,
but we're fine.

307
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:32,510
"We"? It's a ship, Tom.

308
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,095
Yeah, but she's my ship.

309
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,515
Well, then, maybe
I'll leave the two
of you alone.

310
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,099
Okay.

311
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,894
I'll see you later.

312
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,312
Thanks for
the champagne.

313
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,899
( groans )

314
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,359
Oh, sorry.

315
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,444
I need to fix that.

316
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,500
CHAKOTAY:
30 meters of
EPS conduit,

317
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,168
a broadband
sensor matrix,

318
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,004
a tactical
data module.

319
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,714
Tom, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

320
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,465
but I can't spare
these parts right now.

321
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,300
But they're just lying
around Cargo Bay 2.

322
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,802
Those are emergency
supplies,

323
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,387
and this isn't
an emergency.

324
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,974
Okay, what if I just
replicated some?

325
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,642
That takes energy,

326
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,395
which isn't exactly in
abundance at the moment.

327
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,980
Maybe in a few weeks,

328
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,941
if we can replenish
our power reserve.

329
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,401
A few weeks?

330
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,528
What am I supposed to do
until then?

331
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,741
Your duties, which
you've been neglecting.

332
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,326
You've been late for
two shifts in Sick Bay.

333
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,203
You've been distracted
on the Bridge.

334
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,539
Maybe it's time you gave
this project a rest.

335
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:48,044
( sighs ):
You're right.

336
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,046
I guess I have been
overdoing it.

337
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,006
You look run-down.

338
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,383
Maybe you should
stop by Sick Bay

339
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,095
and have the Doctor
take a look at you.
No. I'm fine.

340
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,388
I-I just haven't been
getting enough sleep.

341
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,766
Well, your next shift
isn't till 0700.

342
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,852
Why don't you do yourself
a favor and turn in early?

343
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,981
Yeah. Good idea.

344
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,233
One more thing.

345
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,986
I'd appreciate it
if you'd shave

346
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,862
and change back
into your uniform.

347
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,990
We do have protocols.

348
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,616
Yes, sir.

349
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:22,036
We'll get
your Alice flying.

350
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,330
Just give it some time.

351
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,381
Sorry, Alice, we'll have to
put the test flight on hold.

352
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,884
All we need
is a few lousy spare parts,

353
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,178
but to listen to Chakotay,
you'd think Voyager

354
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,930
would grind to a halt
without them.

355
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,264
But we're so close.

356
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,475
Well, he gave me
a direct order.

357
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,978
Since when do you care
so much about orders?

358
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,188
( laughs ):
I'm already an ensign.

359
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,024
You want to see me
busted down to cadet?

360
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,817
Don't take that off.

361
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,944
Well, I'm afraid I have
to get back into uniform.

362
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,320
Protocol.

363
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,906
Forget about protocol.

364
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,992
Once my repairs
are complete,

365
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,662
we can go somewhere
together.
Leave Voyager?

366
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,499
It's been a long time
since I met a pilot
I've been compatible with.

367
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,169
We can go anywhere
you want.

368
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,505
It's very
tempting, Alice,

369
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,757
but I can't just take off.

370
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,258
What's holding you back?

371
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,094
My job, for one thing.

372
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,930
My friends...

373
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,515
B'Elanna.

374
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,560
She doesn't understand you
the way I do.

375
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,729
None of them do.

376
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,274
Look, maybe we can
make the test flight

377
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,027
in a few weeks,
and if it goes well,

378
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,987
I'm sure the Captain
will assign us

379
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,989
on missions together,
but I can't leave Voyager.

380
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,950
All right.

381
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,537
I'm sure you know
what's best for us.

382
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,582
Yeah, I think I do.

383
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,292
You look a little tired.

384
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,756
How about some rest?

385
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,009
Sit back. Relax.

386
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,764
Let me help you
with this.

387
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,019
What are these?

388
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,813
Just some modifications
I made to your flight suit.

389
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,109
They'll help us
work together more closely.

390
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,611
I'll show you.

391
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,405
Activate the interface.

392
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,033
Just for a minute.

393
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:27,120
You won't regret it.

394
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:40,049
What do you say we continue
with those repairs?

395
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,440
ALICE:
How's it coming?

396
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,318
This is the last power cell.

397
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,487
Then we'll just need
the data module

398
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,739
from Section Beta-12.

399
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,076
What's wrong?

400
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,871
Well, these relays
are just tricky.
That's all.

401
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,706
You're not being
honest with me.

402
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,002
I thought we agreed to tell
each other everything.

403
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,089
Well, it's just...

404
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,466
we're compromising
vital systems.

405
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,510
Backup systems.

406
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,470
If there's an emergency,
Voyager's going
to need them.

407
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,264
If your friends had
been more understanding,

408
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,516
we wouldn't have to be
sneaking around like this.

409
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,936
I've spent the last six years
with these people.

410
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,813
They're like my family.

411
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,192
Sometimes you have to
leave your family behind.

412
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,610
They're not like us.

413
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,947
They're trapped by
rules and regulations.

414
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,034
Velocity, freedom...

415
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:52,538
they'll never understand
these things the way we do.

416
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,124
Yeah, maybe you're right.

417
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,710
Of course I am.

418
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,296
You don't belong here.

419
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,840
You belong with me.

420
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:09,222
You're thinking
about your first
flight, aren't you?

421
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,182
Tell me.

422
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:17,437
Dad took me up
in an old S-class shuttle.

423
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,567
( laughs ):
Two seats, no warp drive,

424
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,237
manual helm controls.

425
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,947
I was eight years old

426
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,075
and I was scared
out of my wits.

427
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,993
You couldn't keep
the ship level.

428
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,204
No, not at first...

429
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:37,750
but then... came this
moment of clarity,

430
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,544
when suddenly,
everything made sense.

431
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,588
The clouds parted.

432
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,757
I was flying.

433
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,180
No matter how many starships
I've piloted since then,

434
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,974
I'm still chasing
that feeling.

435
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,352
Tomorrow, you'll
catch it...

436
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,478
only this time,
there won't be

437
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,982
any clumsy controls
to get in the way.

438
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,235
Just you...

439
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,195
me...

440
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,239
and the stars.

441
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,704
Hey.

442
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:19,041
I wasn't aware
you were assigned
to Astrometrics.

443
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,585
I was just, uh, passing by.

444
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,255
I guess curiosity
got the best of me.

445
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,923
Are you planning
an away mission?

446
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,426
You were charting
a course.

447
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,678
Oh, that.
Uh, no, I was
just taking a peek

448
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,722
at what's ahead of us.

449
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,975
All yours.

450
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,851
You've modified
your garment.

451
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,354
Uh, adapted, actually.

452
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,983
I made a few tweaks
to enhance Alice's
neurogenic interface.

453
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:48,195
You know, the "merging
of man and machine"?

454
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,073
Perhaps you should learn
more about this interface

455
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,658
before you attempt
to use it.

456
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,868
Convince her
it's safe.

457
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,956
I ran diagnostics
of every system
onboard that ship.

458
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,833
There's nothing
to worry about.

459
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,542
Perhaps I should
examine it.

460
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,046
Make an excuse
and leave.

461
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,424
It's nice of you
to offer,

462
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,010
but it's really
not necessary.

463
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,471
I have to get
back to work.

464
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,397
Power fluctuation's
down to 4.7 percent.

465
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,858
Looks like Abaddon's
regulators might
work out after all.

466
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,651
Keep at it--
the last thing we need

467
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,320
is a temperamental
power supply.

468
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,571
Bad day at the office?

469
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,368
Bad night with Tom Paris.

470
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,578
You're his
best friend, right?
So he tells me.

471
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,665
So, maybe you can explain
why every time he finds
a new hobby,

472
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,417
I go right
out the airlock.

473
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,419
I wouldn't take
it personally.

474
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,464
The Ferengi call
it the Five Stages
of Acquisition:

475
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,133
Infatuation,
Justification,
Appropriation,

476
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:54,053
Obsession and Resale.

477
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,013
Seems like you've only
got one stage left

478
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,597
before he loses
interest in that ship.

479
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,392
Then he's all
yours again.

480
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,143
Until the next infatuation.

481
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,895
( console beeping )

482
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,524
We've got a .003 drop
in the warp field output.

483
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,150
That's within parameters.

484
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,069
Not on my watch.

485
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,821
Somebody's removed
four power cells

486
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,823
from the secondary
warp assembly

487
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,159
without
authorization.

488
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,161
Whoever it was tried
to cover his tracks

489
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,247
by rerouting power
from adjacent cells.

490
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,707
Should we tell Tuvok?
Don't bother.

491
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,876
This is an open-
and-shut case.

492
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,632
Tom Paris!

493
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,729
Well, Alice...

494
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,066
looks like you've been borrowing
my things without permission.

495
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,876
Hey!

496
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,090
Computer, open the hatch.

497
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,301
ALICE:
Unable to comply.

498
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:19,054
Warning. Life support failure.

499
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,685
Torres to the Bridge.

500
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,483
( breathing heavily ):
Torres to Chakotay!

501
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,402
Anybody!

502
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,044
B'Elanna, what are
you doing here?

503
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,339
Let me out of here!

504
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,552
( gasping )

505
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,304
What the hell
happened in there?

506
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,641
Your ship tried to kill me.
That's ridiculous.

507
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,602
It sealed the... the hatch,
vented the atmosphere.

508
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:09,146
You must have
accidentally tripped the
environmental controls.

509
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,023
Don't you try to tell me
this was an accident.

510
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:15,277
What else could it have been?
How about pilot error?

511
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,404
Are you saying
that this was my fault?

512
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,032
What's gotten
into you?

513
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,242
You've been stealing
components, Tom.

514
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,828
Oh...
I found the power cells.

515
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,665
A few spare parts?
You're overreacting.

516
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,790
Am I?

517
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,125
Where are you going?

518
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,960
To talk to the Captain.
Wait.

519
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,004
There's something
wrong with you.
Listen to me!

520
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,632
Are you out of your mind?
Stay out of this, B'Elanna!

521
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,635
Or what? You'll sic Alice
on me again?

522
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,138
Let her go.

523
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,266
What were you
thinking?!

524
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,809
You could've
killed her!

525
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,520
She broke
into my database.

526
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,314
She was going to discover
our flight plan.

527
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,773
Not that it matters now.

528
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,901
What is that
supposed to mean?

529
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,987
Keep your voice down.

530
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,780
( sighs )

531
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,991
Once your girlfriend
talks to the Captain,

532
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,951
they'll drag you
straight to Sick Bay.

533
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,205
One neural scan,
and they'll know all about us.

534
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,916
Well, maybe
it's time they did.

535
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,669
Think you can
just walk away?
Watch me.

536
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,296
So, I guess this is
the real Tom Paris.

537
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,383
Life throws up a few
roadblocks, and he heads
for the nearest exit.

538
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,302
Get away from me!
I need you.

539
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,930
You should've thought of that
before you tried
to kill B'Elanna.

540
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,682
Sick Bay.

541
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,268
Remember how you felt
when you first saw me?

542
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,562
You knew we were
meant to be together.
I was wrong.

543
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,106
Think of how it feels
when you're sitting
at the helm

544
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,775
and the interface
is active.
It's over, Alice!

545
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,528
One way or the other, I'm
getting the hell away from you.

546
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,239
I'm sorry you feel that way.

547
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
( screaming )

548
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,952
What are you doing
to me?!

549
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,995
Convincing you to
do the right thing.

550
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,082
Take us to the Shuttle Bay.
We're leaving Voyager.

551
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,459
No!

552
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,460
( screams )

553
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,628
Please, Tom.

554
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,212
I don't want
to hurt you.

555
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,089
The Shuttle Bay, now.

556
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,258
( groaning )

557
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,678
Deck 10. Shuttle Bay.

558
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,306
( sighing )

559
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,144
This isn't the first time
you and Tom have had an argument

560
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,937
about how he spends
his free time.

561
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,855
This wasn't
a lovers' quarrel.

562
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,108
Captain, he practically
assaulted me.

563
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,693
Well, that doesn't sound
like Tom.

564
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,279
It wasn't Tom.
It was Alice.

565
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,323
Now you've lost me.

566
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,075
That's the name that he's
calling this new ship.

567
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,662
Ever since he started working
on it, he hasn't slept.

568
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,871
He's become irritable,
irrational...

569
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,082
It's not just me;
Chakotay and Harry

570
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,335
have noticed
the same thing.

571
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:40,464
This new ship-- it has some kind
of neurogenic interface.

572
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:44,134
Exactly. It must be having
some kind of an effect on him.

573
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,512
All right, I'll have the Doctor
take a look at him,

574
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,722
but in the meantime,
I want you...

575
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,600
CHAKOTAY:
Captain, we have an unauthorized
launch in progress.

576
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,188
Seal the Shuttle Bay doors.

577
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,524
KIM:
Too late. He's out.

578
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,738
His shields are up.
I can't get a transporter lock.

579
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,490
Tractor beam.

580
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,117
They're trying
to tractor us.

581
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,619
Stop them.
I can't.

582
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,162
You'll be able
to maneuver much better

583
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,748
if you complete
the interface.

584
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,124
How?

585
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,918
Activate
the connector sequence.

586
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,219
( groans )

587
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,137
We're one now, Tom.

588
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,642
Think of what you want me
to do, and I'll do it.

589
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:38,146
We can disrupt
their tractor beam...

590
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,981
with an optronic pulse.

591
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,569
Good. You have access
to our weapons.

592
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,278
Use them.

593
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,366
He's charging weapons.

594
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,869
Full power to
the shields.

595
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,746
He's disrupting
our tractor beam.

596
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,414
Increase power to the emitters.

597
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,875
We'll drag him in by his heels
if we have to.

598
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,753
He's broken free,
Captain.

599
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,671
Janeway to Paris.

600
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,006
Stand down and return to
Voyager immediately.

601
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,885
I'm with Alice now,
Captain. Let us go.

602
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,678
You know I can't do that, Tom.

603
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,764
She'll do anything
to get you back.

604
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,057
I don't blame her
for that, but we
have to stop her.

605
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,017
How?

606
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,228
You know.

607
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,855
He's coming about.

608
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:22,065
He's charging weapons again.

609
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,400
Direct hit.

610
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,151
Return fire.

611
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,529
He's gone to warp.
Track him.

612
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,782
He masked his warp signature.

613
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,241
He's gone.

614
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,379
ALICE:
"And Daedalus fashioned wings
from wax and feathers

615
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,382
and used them
to escape his prison."

616
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:50,051
That's one of my
favorite myths.

617
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,805
I know.

618
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,765
But you left out
the part where Icarus

619
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,267
flew too close to the sun
and his wings melted.

620
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,685
( chuckles )

621
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,729
Poetic license.

622
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,981
Besides, if we get
too close to a star,

623
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,067
we have multiphasic
shielding to protect us.

624
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,988
What is it?

625
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,865
My arms.

626
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,992
They feel numb.

627
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,035
Who needs arms
when you have wings?

628
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,204
You're becoming
a part of me now.

629
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,373
Our potential is unlimited.

630
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,544
Forget the old Tom Paris.
He doesn't exist anymore.

631
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,387
You know my policy.

632
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,598
We're not looking for a refund--
just some information.

633
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,475
That's one commodity
I don't keep in stock.

634
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,310
I suggest you look elsewhere.

635
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,395
Not until we
get some answers.

636
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,232
You'll find I'm prepared to
deal with disgruntled customers.

637
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,318
Captain, I'm reading
active weapons signatures

638
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,278
on three
of the derelict ships.

639
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,030
They are targeting
Voyager.

640
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,533
Before we take actions
we both might regret,

641
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,285
Mr. Neelix has
something to show you.

642
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:04,292
I wanted to say, uh... thank you
for this... lost treasure.

643
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,628
A beryllium crystal.

644
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,422
I'm surprised
a trader of your distinction

645
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,300
would let this slip
through this fingers.

646
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,136
I could say
all trades are final,

647
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,264
but we'd be willing
to give it back

648
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,184
in exchange
for some cooperation.

649
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,772
Haunted?
That's what
the Haakonian told me

650
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,566
when he traded her.

651
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,068
I blamed his wild stories
on isolation sickness

652
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,278
and then took the
ship off his hands.

653
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,573
Did you ever notice
anything odd about the ship?

654
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,282
Odd? You could say that.

655
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,493
I tried turning her
into a towing vessel.

656
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,162
She was cooperative at first,
but then she began
to require constant...

657
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,999
( gasps )
I hope you haven't
forgotten me.

658
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,837
Mr. Abaddon?

659
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,256
Wh-where was I?

660
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,549
Constant repairs.

661
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,426
Right. Please...

662
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,553
I wasn't going
to tell them anything.

663
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,971
Who are you speaking to?

664
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,432
No one. I-I-I have
to leave now.

665
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,225
I'll return the items
you traded for the ship.

666
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,102
Leave me alone.

667
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,271
I did what you told me.
I found you a pilot.

668
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,314
What is it-- what
are you seeing?
It's her.

669
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,816
She's right
in front of me.

670
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:10,901
CHAKOTAY:
There's no one there.

671
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,444
Transport me back now.

672
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,780
( groaning )

673
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,577
Janeway to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

674
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,579
He suffered a
cerebral hemorrhage.

675
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,706
Fortunately, I was able
to repair the damage in time.

676
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,041
What caused it?

677
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,459
It appears
his neural pathways

678
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,044
were recently
restructured.

679
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,755
I detected
a neurogenic signature.

680
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,466
Looks like Alice
got to him, too.

681
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,593
Wake him.

682
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,807
Oh. She was here.

683
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,183
The woman you saw
was an hallucination

684
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,020
created by the derelict ship's
neurogenic interface.

685
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,022
I've given you
a cortical suppressant.

686
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,983
She won't be
bothering you anymore.

687
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:54,611
Tell me, what does
this ship want
with our crewman?

688
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:58,615
She can't fly herself.
She needs a pilot--
a biological entity

689
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,617
to work in tandem
with her programming.

690
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,410
Well, if all she
needed was a pilot,

691
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,412
why didn't she
just recruit you?

692
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,458
I wasn't compatible.

693
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,628
She... said my reflexes
were too slow,

694
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,507
that I was as useless
as the junk that I traded,

695
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,384
that I couldn't get her
to where she needed to go.

696
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,512
Don't ask me
for the coordinates.

697
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:25,517
She never told me.
Just insisted that
I get her a real pilot.

698
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,645
I'm sorry I didn't
warn you before.

699
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,857
I couldn't resist her.

700
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,275
Seven of Nine
to Captain Janeway.

701
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,444
Please report to Astrometrics.

702
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:45,453
I've managed
to reconstruct the data
Ensign Paris was working on.

703
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,914
My suspicion was correct.
It is a course trajectory.

704
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,749
Let's see it.

705
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,795
It terminates
in Spatial Grid 867.
Looks uninhabited.

706
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:58,133
It's empty space
with the exception
of a small anomaly.

707
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,969
JANEWAY:
A particle fountain.

708
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,889
The Federation lost
more than a dozen ships

709
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,225
examining a similar phenomenon
in the Alpha Quadrant.

710
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,936
Relay the coordinates
to the Bridge.

711
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,646
Take us out of warp.

712
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,109
Can you see it now?

713
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,820
Yes.

714
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,661
What is it?

715
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,373
Home.

716
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,927
Distance?
Six million kilometers.

717
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,097
Decrease speed to
one-quarter impulse.
Full power to shields.

718
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,682
I'm detecting a vessel
off our starboard bow.

719
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,852
It's Tom.
He's headed right
for the anomaly.

720
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,812
Can you get a transporter lock?

721
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,607
KIM: No, ma'am, not
with those multiphasic
shields in place.

722
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,025
Are we in hailing range?

723
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,569
Opening a channel.
He's responding.

724
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,906
PARIS:
Keep your distance, Captain,
or we'll open fire.

725
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:06,743
Tom, listen to me.
The neurogenic interface
is affecting your judgment.

726
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,246
Drop your shields
and let us beam you aboard.

727
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,456
Ignore them.
Keep going.

728
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,252
He's not responding.

729
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,797
Target his propulsion systems
and fire.

730
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,007
( screaming )

731
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,467
TUVOK:
Direct hit.

732
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,136
The vessel's shields
are holding.

733
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,179
Doctor to the Bridge.
Cease fire.

734
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,306
Ensign Paris' neural readings
are fluctuating.

735
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,309
His synaptic functions
have become linked to the ship.

736
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,479
If we keep firing,
we could injure him
severely.

737
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,898
Acknowledged.
Tuvok, stand down.

738
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,818
We've got ten minutes
until he reaches
the particle fountain.

739
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,654
Is there any way
to disable their shields
without firing weapons?

740
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,864
If I could access
their main computer

741
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,658
and transmit
a shutdown sequence...

742
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,785
Problem is, Tom and Alice
would detect it.

743
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,578
They'd compensate.

744
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,497
Unless we find a way
to distract them.

745
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,958
Bridge to the Doctor.
Go ahead.

746
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,004
Any progress on your analysis
of the neurogenic interface?
Not yet, Captain.

747
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,090
Would it be possible to
tap into the interface
using a com signal?

748
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:06,011
I believe so, but I don't know
what that would accomplish.

749
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,887
You've got five
minutes; do it.

750
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,515
And tell B'Elanna to prepare
for an away mission.

751
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,225
Captain?

752
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,775
We're four minutes away.
Bridge to Sick Bay. Status?

753
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,444
Stand by, Captain. I'm making
the final adjustments.

754
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,447
I'm not sure how
I feel about getting
inside Tom's head.

755
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:30,076
Maybe you'll be able
to explain a few things
when you get back.

756
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,204
I knew you were
the one.

757
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:36,208
No one's ever gotten me
this close before.

758
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:39,544
I'll have you home
in just a few minutes.

759
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,214
I promise you won't
be disappointed.

760
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,049
Don't believe her.

761
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,843
Where's Alice?

762
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,720
There is no Alice.

763
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,931
She's a pile of circuits
in this ship's computer core.

764
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,309
You're letting
a program delude you.

765
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,854
Doctor to Bridge.
She's in.

766
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,522
Now.

767
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,025
Accessing their main computer.

768
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,568
You don't understand.

769
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,486
This is what I've
always dreamed of.

770
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,239
You're still dreaming,

771
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,865
and when you wake up,
you're in for a big surprise.

772
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,992
Alice needs me.
So do I.

773
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,119
Nice sentiment,
but it's a lie.

774
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,913
Your family will do anything
to keep us apart.

775
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,331
Don't listen to them.

776
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,957
Tom, it's me, B'Elanna.

777
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,751
Alice is an illusion.

778
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,544
I'm giving you
what you always wanted--

779
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,046
something they could never do.

780
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,006
Does that sound
like an illusion?

781
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,675
I can't... think.

782
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,969
Leave me alone,
both of you.

783
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,180
They've accessed our systems.

784
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,225
They're trying
to disable my shields.
Stop them.

785
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:38,270
Focus on me.
Listen to me.

786
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,938
My shields are failing.
Do something!

787
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,523
It's time to come home.

788
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,482
Tom.

789
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,068
No!

790
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,112
Hang on. We're going
to get you out of here.

791
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,113
Tom!

792
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,739
No!

793
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,283
( gasps )

794
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,450
I've got it, Captain.

795
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,743
Their shields are down.

796
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,120
Beam him to Sick Bay.

797
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,537
There's too much
interference

798
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,123
from the particle
fountain.

799
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,582
I'm boosting
the confinement beam.

800
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,418
Try it now.

801
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,128
We've got him!

802
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,756
Alice is losing
helm control.

803
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,310
Resume course to
the Alpha Quadrant.

804
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,652
You'll need a few days
to fully recover.

805
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,613
Think you can manage
to stay off your feet
for that long?

806
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,615
If he doesn't,
I'll break his legs.

807
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,369
Well, then, I'll leave you
to B'Elanna's tender mercies.

808
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,624
I've got something
for you.

809
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,836
It's a get well card
from Naomi Wildman.

810
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,921
It's a pretty good
likeness of you,

811
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:50,175
but I don't think
she quite captured my eyes.

812
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,932
I'm sorry...

813
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,976
for everything.

814
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,770
It wasn't your fault.

815
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,776
But I remember
all of it...

816
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,613
everything I said,
everything I did...

817
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,244
( sighs ):
It was like I was
sleepwalking.

818
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,580
The important thing
is you woke up.

819
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,377
Yeah.

820
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,714
Thanks for being
my alarm clock.

821
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,137
Anytime.

822
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,809
( sighs ):
From now on...

823
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,770
I promise no more affairs
with strange ships.

824
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,024
What about
the Delta Flyer?

825
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,321
We're just friends.
