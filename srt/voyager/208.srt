1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,879
<i>Paris to the Captain.</i> 
Janeway here.

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,799
<i>I've done an analysis of</i>
<i>our route through Botha space</i>

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,884
<i>whenever you have a minute</i>
<i>to check it out.</i>

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,803
I'm on my way to Engineering.

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,095
I'll be with you
as soon as I'm done.

6
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,765
Ah, Captain.

8
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,350
The computer told me
I'd find you

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,602
on Deck 11, Section 4B,
starboard side,

10
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:19,854
and sure enough,
here you are.

11
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,355
What can I do for you,
Neelix?

12
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,857
I assumed you'd
want to talk to me.

13
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,692
About?
About the Botha.

14
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,986
We're headed for their space,
and as I told you,

15
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,863
they're going to have to be
handled very carefully.

16
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,656
I understand, and of course
I want your counsel,

17
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,949
but, right now,
I'm late for a meeting.

18
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,868
I wouldn't put this off
too long.

19
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,577
We're getting closer,
you know.

20
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,912
Yes, I know,

21
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,331
and I will be with you
as soon as I can.

22
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,881
Sorry I'm late.
What do you have?

23
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,423
I think
we're about ready

24
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,842
to make our first
attempt, Captain.

25
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,301
If you're successful,
will the Doctor

26
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,761
be able to move freely
around the entire ship?

27
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,388
Not exactly.

28
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,139
The holo-emitters will be
set up in certain key areas--

29
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,725
The Bridge, Engineering.

30
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,476
We'll be able to transfer
him to those locations.

31
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,145
In the same way we can now
transfer him to the holodeck?

32
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,899
Exactly. But if he tries
to move into an area

33
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,776
where there's no emitter field,
he'll dematerialize.

34
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,277
KIM:
I have the holo-
projector on line.

35
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,612
We're ready to start.

36
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,947
Proceed.
I don't have much time.

37
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,281
TORRES:
Engineering
to Sick Bay.

38
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,909
Doctor, we're ready here.

39
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>I'm standing by.</i>

40
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,953
Okay. Here goes.

41
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,621
Initiating transfer.

42
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,708
Here he comes.

43
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,172
Well, this is certainly
a brilliant feat of engineering.

44
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,175
What happened?

45
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,887
I'd guess
the imaging interface

46
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,346
wasn't properly stabilized.

47
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,599
Just a small
oversight.

48
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,975
No pun intended.

49
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,852
Very amusing.

50
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:42,937
How long will it take you

51
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,064
to correct
this small oversight?

52
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,066
Maybe a couple
of hours.

53
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,359
Mr. Kim, I have to assess
our navigational plan

54
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,946
and get ready to make contact
with an alien species.

55
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,114
I can't drop everything
whenever you call.

56
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,950
<i>Tuvok to Janeway.</i>

57
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,618
Go ahead.

58
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,620
<i>Captain, I would like</i>
<i>a half an hour of your time</i>

59
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,080
<i>to review the security</i>
<i>protocols</i>

60
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,873
<i>before we encounter</i>
<i>the Botha.</i>

61
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:08,754
Yes, Mr. Tuvok, somehow...
I will find half an hour.

62
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,798
DOCTOR:
Excuse me, Captain.

63
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,133
Would you come down here,
please?

64
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,514
(<i> sighs</i> )

65
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,808
Yes?

66
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,977
When did you last
take shore leave?

67
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,519
About two months ago.

68
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,271
Ah. How long
since you've done

69
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,189
something pleasurable
for recreation?

70
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,984
Doctor, I know I'm
a bit testy today,

71
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,568
but I can assure you...

72
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,403
How long?

73
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,030
(<i> sighs</i> )

74
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,492
It's... been a while.

75
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,744
I have a holonovel program.

76
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,370
It helps me unwind.

77
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,915
I haven't had time to
run it for a few weeks.

78
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,875
Well, I want you to-- Now.

79
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,877
Doctor, I'm really
very busy.

80
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,463
I've checked
Starfleet regulations.

81
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,798
The Chief Medical Officer

82
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,173
outranks the Captain
in health matters.

83
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,802
Now, I realize
this may be the first time

84
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,887
a hologram has given an order
to a Captain,

85
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:03,851
but I'm ordering you to report
to the holodeck--<i> Now.</i>

86
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,310
Aye, sir.

87
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,735
And the two of you
can get busy undoing

88
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,113
this ridiculous blunder
of yours!

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,609
Good afternoon, milord.

90
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,363
Will the children be
joining us for tea?

91
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,657
Presently.

92
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,871
Lord Burleigh...

93
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,372
is something wrong?

94
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,791
Yes.

95
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,459
Terribly wrong.

96
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,183
I have fallen in love
with you, Lucie.

97
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,880
Milord.

98
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,715
Hello, Father.

99
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,300
We're ready for tea.

100
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,718
I want cucumber
sandwiches.

101
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,553
You'll wait your turn,
young man.

102
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,681
What may I serve you, milord?

103
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,225
Nothing. Thank you.

104
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,022
I see.

105
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,069
I want my tea in this cup,
please,

106
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,571
and I don't want
a cucumber sandwich.

107
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,074
I don't like the way
cook cuts them.

108
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,992
LUCILLE:
Milord, you'll
be very pleased

109
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,286
with the children's progress
in their studies this week.

110
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,580
Henry shows a real talent
for mathematics,

111
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,959
and Beatrice turned out
to be quite musical.

112
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,754
Beatrice?

113
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,297
Musical?

114
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,092
I don't know
what she means.

115
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,676
She's very modest
about it.

116
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,470
I've heard her several times
in the music room,

117
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,599
playing a lovely Mozart sonata,

118
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,020
but whenever I ask her
to play it for me, she won't.

119
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,813
I think her talent
should be encouraged.

120
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,399
Would you consider lessons?

121
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,984
I didn't know Beatrice
could play the piano.

122
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,403
(<i> glass shatters</i> )

123
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,283
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,285
It's just a cup.

125
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,660
Don't be a goose.

126
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,705
It's the flower cup--
Mother's cup.

127
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,207
It doesn't matter!

128
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,626
Mrs. Templeton!

129
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,169
Please take the children
to the nursery.

130
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,088
Yes, milord. Come.

131
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,218
Please stay here,
Mrs. Davenport.

132
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,387
Beatrice is upset.
I should be with her.

133
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,930
I want you here.

134
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,686
What's happening
in this house?

135
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,149
How can you not know that
Beatrice plays the piano?

136
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,234
Why shouldn't I go
to the fourth floor?

137
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,444
What's up there?

138
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,736
Those are questions
you must not ask.

139
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,988
But I am asking them.

140
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,490
I'm worried
about the children.

141
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,909
Beatrice fantasizes that
her mother is still alive.

142
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,702
Don't pursue this,
I beg you.

143
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,037
<i>Bridge to the Captain.</i>

144
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,747
Freeze program.

145
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,835
Janeway here.

146
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,711
<i>We've been hailed</i>
<i>by a representative</i>

147
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,005
<i>of the Bothan government.</i>

148
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,589
<i>They'd like to talk to you.</i>

149
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,549
I'll be right there.

150
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,970
Sorry, milord.

151
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,596
Duty calls.

152
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,481
Captain, I knew we should
have talked this morning.

153
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,857
Tell me what you know,
Neelix.

154
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,108
I've been in subspace contact

155
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,277
with some old friends
of mine--

156
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,364
Uh, nomads, collectors,
much as I used to be.

157
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,407
They're in a position
to gather information

158
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,825
during their travels.

159
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,618
What they've told me
doesn't sound good.

160
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,870
In what way?

161
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,872
There are lots of
rumors about ships

162
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,666
entering Bothan space,
never to be heard from again.

163
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,001
My sources on Mithren say

164
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,128
that they have lost
a number of vessels.

165
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,048
They say the Botha protect
their territory fiercely.

166
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,299
But we aren't aggressors.

167
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,925
I don't think
they are either.

168
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,388
They just don't want anyone
crossing their borders.

169
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,889
Will they negotiate?

170
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,640
Will they respond
to diplomacy?

171
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,184
It's hard to say.

172
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,353
There's some belief
that they don't even have

173
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,188
a legitimate claim
to the space--

174
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,107
that they're nothing more than
pernicious, odious vandals,

175
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,236
in which case, diplomacy
would fall on deaf ears.

176
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,363
TUVOK:
We're being hailed
again, Captain.

177
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,655
On screen.

178
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,494
I'm Kathryn Janeway

179
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,121
of the Federation
Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

180
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,083
<i>Why have you entered our space</i>
<i>without permission?</i>

181
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,168
We didn't realize
this was your space.

182
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,794
On what basis do you claim it?

183
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,881
<i>I have no intention</i>
<i>of explaining myself to you.</i>

184
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,134
<i>The fact is, you're violating</i>
<i>our territory.</i>

185
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,179
I assure you,
we mean no disrespect.

186
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,181
We are from another part
of the galaxy.

187
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,308
We're just trying
to make our way home.

188
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,769
<i>We'll send a ship</i>
<i>to rendezvous with you.</i>

189
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,440
<i>If you meet the criteria,</i>
<i>we'll consider your request.</i>

190
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,608
Thank you.

191
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,693
What are the criteria?

192
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,571
<i>We'll discuss that</i>
<i>when we meet.</i>

193
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,823
Friendly fellow.

194
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,867
At least they're willing
to talk.

195
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,537
KIM:
I wonder why he wouldn't
let us see his face.

196
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,747
I suspect it was
a calculated move--

197
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,707
An attempt to intimidate us.

198
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,543
Commander, you have the Bridge.
Aye, Captain.

199
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,128
Mr. Neelix, join me
in my ready room.

200
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,921
We should talk
about this meeting.

201
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,172
Captain, if I may...

202
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,800
when was the last time
you ate?

203
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,135
Ate?

204
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,512
Oh, I had some soup
last night.

205
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,098
Let me suggest that we conduct
our talk in the Mess Hall.

206
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,809
We're serving a sumptuous
repast for lunch.

207
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,446
Right.
Lunch it is.

208
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,868
Captain, you have
a nasty habit

209
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,162
of skipping meals,

210
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,413
and that can do
horrible things

211
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,872
to your electrolyte levels.

212
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,791
I know, but sometimes
I just get too busy to eat.

213
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,751
All you have to do
is give me a call.

214
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,878
I'll be there
in a trice with a tray

215
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,965
of foods so delectable,
you won't be able to resist.

216
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:18,011
I do think I've outdone
myself this time.

217
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:23,766
An exquisite paté made
from Seltin wood fungus.

218
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:28,563
Brine-soaked<i> neccel</i> strips.

219
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,856
Ooh.

220
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,151
Deviled wood throk.

221
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,408
Where did these come from?

222
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,910
Lieutenant Hargrove
asked for them.

223
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,287
Is something wrong?

224
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,876
No. Just a funny
coincidence.

225
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,794
Something I saw on the holodeck.

226
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,840
Thank you, Neelix.
This all looks delicious.

227
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,967
And it's bound to boost
my electrolyte levels.

228
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,554
(<i> liquid pouring</i> )

229
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,557
Where did you get that cup?

230
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,266
Why, I'm not sure.

231
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,726
I think I found several
of them in storage.

232
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,980
Unusual, isn't it?

233
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,858
Captain,

234
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,277
is everything all right?

235
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,737
(<i> sighs</i> )

236
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,323
It's perfectly all right,
Neelix.

237
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:27,664
I just have to remind myself
that coincidences do happen.

238
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,048
BURLEIGH:
<i>I can't help myself.</i>

239
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,050
<i>I've fallen in love with you.</i>

240
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,911
My mother<i> is</i> alive

241
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,871
and my father loves her,

242
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,415
not you.

243
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,510
In the course of your
experiments with the Doctor,

244
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,471
have you accessed any
of the holodeck programs?

245
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,139
No, we're bypassing
the holodecks.

246
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,141
Where did you get
this holo-projector?

247
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,892
We found several
of them in storage.

248
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,686
We've been reconfiguring
them one by one.

249
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,563
So you haven't worked directly
with any of the projectors

250
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,897
on the holodecks?

251
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,190
No.

252
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,276
Is there anything you've done--

253
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,278
Anything you can think of--
That might have caused

254
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,155
holographic objects
and characters

255
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,198
to appear outside
the holodeck?

256
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,118
Not that I'm aware of.

257
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,121
I was sure your experiments
would explain it.

258
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,375
Captain, there
has to be a reason

259
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,876
why you've had
these delusions.

260
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,712
And we're going to figure
out what it is.

261
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:01,466
The Doctor pointed out that
I've been under some stress.

262
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,259
I can't ignore that.

263
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,552
I think we should check out

264
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,179
the imaging systems
on the holodeck.

265
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,306
There might be
a simple malfunction.

266
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,433
Good idea.
TORRES: We can run diagnostic

267
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,144
from Engineering, but you should
activate the program first.

268
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,313
I'll contact you
from the holodeck.

269
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,073
Janeway to Engineering.

270
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,284
<i>Torres here.</i> 
Have you set up the diagnostic?

271
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,910
<i>We're ready, Captain.</i>

272
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,414
Go ahead.

273
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,874
BURLEIGH:
Lucie!

274
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,377
Thank God you've come back.

275
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,465
Why are you dressed
so strangely?

276
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,844
It's...

277
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,094
a costume.

278
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,639
You'd look lovely in anything.

279
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,184
I've thought of you
constantly.

280
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,812
Remembered your touch...

281
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,355
your perfume...

282
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,440
your lips.

283
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,819
Computer,
delete character.

284
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,655
<i>Torres to Janeway.</i>
<i>We're finished, Captain,</i>

285
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,281
<i>but we didn't find</i>
<i>any malfunctions.</i>

286
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,950
Recalibrate and try it again.

287
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,453
I'm going to check
something else.

288
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,996
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

289
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,418
Captain!

290
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,461
I'm delighted
to see you.

291
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,921
Do you want a snack?

292
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,130
No, I'm fine.

293
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,258
But I wanted to ask you
about lunch.

294
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,802
Didn't you like it?

295
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,345
It was delicious.

296
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,389
I was just trying to remember
all the dishes you made.

297
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,391
There was... the Seltin pâté.

298
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,517
Delectable.

299
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,643
The<i> neccel</i> strips.
Exquisite.

300
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,354
The deviled throk.
Sublime.

301
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,565
And the cucumber sandwiches.

302
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,817
Cucumber sandwiches?

303
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,194
Weren't there...

304
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,363
cucumber sandwiches?

305
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,532
I don't even know
what that is.

306
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,619
The other item on the menu
was a fried<i> murt</i> cake.

307
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,912
You ate one.

308
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,248
And the cup
you served my tea in?

309
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,503
One of these.

310
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,505
The ones I found
in storage.

311
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,302
I thought...

312
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,971
it had flowers on it.

313
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,640
Flowers?

314
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,726
Well, no, I don't see
any flowers.

315
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,938
Maybe there was another cup,
but I-I don't think so.

316
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,107
Would you like a cup
with flowers on it?

317
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,652
I'm sure I could
replicate one.

318
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,612
It's all right, Neelix.

319
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,114
You've told me
what I need to know.

320
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,038
DOCTOR:
I don't detect
anything so far.

321
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,667
No evidence of aneurysm...

322
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,043
subdural hematoma...

323
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,378
stroke.

324
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,299
Could it be...
stress?

325
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,717
Possibly.

326
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,594
Did you go to the holodeck,
as I ordered?

327
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,804
Yes.

328
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,305
And was that relaxing?

329
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,058
It was interesting.

330
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,436
I'm not sure how
relaxing it was.

331
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,648
There are other possibilities
we should consider.

332
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:08,110
I want to scan for airborne
bacteria and viruses.

333
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,821
We should investigate
the possibility

334
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,405
of an alien intruder.

335
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,159
And I'd like to do
a cerebro-cortical scan on you.

336
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,911
Oh!

337
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,705
Kes?

338
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,208
I... I don't know.

339
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,168
Strange.

340
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,006
Suddenly, I felt
cold, shivery.

341
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,257
Someone was walking
on your grave.

342
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,592
Hmm?

343
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,555
Just an old saying on Earth.

344
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,141
A way of describing
an odd feeling like that.

345
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,727
Hmm. How macabre.

346
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,144
It's a human expression,
Doctor.

347
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,479
I'd think
you'd have heard it.

348
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,398
My programmers
didn't clutter me up

349
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,025
with pithy Earth trivia.

350
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,110
They programmed me
with far more important data.

351
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,697
Kes, would you please get

352
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,990
my sub-neural scanner
from the med lab?

353
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,282
Yes, Doctor.

354
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,495
BEATRICE:
What about
my mother's grave?

355
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,915
There's no one inside.

356
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,624
The coffin is empty.

357
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,793
Doctor. Doctor.

358
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,130
Who do you see here?

359
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,176
I see you.

360
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,470
And I see you...

361
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,641
but I also see a little girl
from my holodeck program.

362
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,862
(<i> gasps</i> )

363
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,572
What happened?

364
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,954
I'm not sure.

365
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,331
The image of the little girl
suddenly rushed at me.

366
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,292
I saw it, too.

367
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,420
When I came in...

368
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,838
I felt as though
something hit me--

369
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,298
Bounced off me--

370
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,884
Then I saw the little girl
moving right into you.

371
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,429
As though you became a mirror.

372
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,474
You reflected her back
toward me.

373
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,393
I've been doing some
mental exercises with Tuvok

374
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,104
developing
my telepathic abilities,

375
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,397
but we haven't done
anything like this.

376
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,860
Captain, until I am able
to determine

377
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,403
the cause
of these hallucinations,

378
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,363
I'd prefer that you return
to your quarters.

379
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,949
Get some rest.

380
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
Vegetable bouillon.

381
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,340
No, cancel that.

382
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,383
Coffee ice cream.

383
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,366
(<i> soft thuds</i> )

384
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,494
Hello?

385
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,212
Is anyone there?

386
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,673
(<i> mumbling voice</i> )

387
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,675
Computer...

388
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,636
is there anyone
in these quarters except me?

389
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,680
<i>Negative.</i>

390
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,482
MAN'S VOICE:
<i>Kath, are you there?</i>

391
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,275
Who's that?

392
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,903
<i>Come look at the puppies.</i>

393
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,529
Mark...

394
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,372
(<i> dogs barking</i> )

395
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,543
<i>I've missed you so much, Kath.</i>

396
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,587
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

397
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,757
<i>I don't think</i> you've<i> missed me.</i>

398
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,594
<i>Someone else</i>
<i>is in your thoughts now.</i>

399
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,852
<i>Isn't that true?</i>

400
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>Isn't there someone</i>
<i>you're thinking of?</i>

401
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,397
Computer, open the door.

402
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,611
Everything was fine
until you came here.

403
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,530
I took care of him.

404
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,199
He trusted me,

405
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:09,328
but when you arrived,
all that changed.

406
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,122
Janeway to Security.
Intruder alert.

407
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,833
You've done nothing
but cause trouble.

408
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,336
We don't want more trouble
in our lives!

409
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,964
(<i> grunts</i> )

410
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,468
Security
to the Captain's quarters!

411
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,803
Tuvok, please respond!

412
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,013
Captain!

413
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,264
Can you still see
the hallucination?

414
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,807
Yes. The woman
with the knife

415
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,558
is receding into the Captain
just like before.

416
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,561
Captain, listen to me!
You are in Sick Bay.

417
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,563
You are all right.

418
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,440
Captain!

419
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,817
(<i> gasps</i> )

420
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,960
I think Neelix can help you.

421
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,253
No one knows much
about the Botha,

422
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,671
but he has some
information.

423
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,922
I know he's been
doing research.

424
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,381
I'll check with him.

425
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,758
You'll probably want him
on the Bridge with you

426
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,302
when their ship arrives.
Good idea.

427
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,761
I'm not sure how Torres
and Kim are coming.

428
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,055
You know they're
trying to find a way

429
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,639
to transfer the Doctor
out of Sick Bay.

430
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,016
Yes.
It's not a priority...

431
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,433
but you might want to
stay on top of it.

432
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,102
Of course.
Let's see.

433
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,645
There was a problem with
one of the deflector shields.

434
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,022
You'll want to
follow up on that.

435
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,523
And Stellar Cartography

436
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,234
was hoping for a review
of their latest report.

437
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,361
I think Tuvok wanted to discuss
something about weapons storage.

438
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,279
Captain.

439
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,947
You've trained
your crew well.

440
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,699
We'll be able to do
without you for a few days.

441
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,326
In the meantime,

442
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,828
we're continuing diagnostics
on all ship's systems.

443
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,914
There's a reason for
what's happening to you

444
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,540
and we're not stopping
until we find it.

445
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,751
Thank you, Commander.
My patient has to rest now.

446
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,878
I'm sure you'll want
to get to the Bridge.

447
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,671
Call me if there's
anything I can do.

448
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,840
Just be sure to report to me
after you meet with the Botha.

449
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,508
Yes, ma'am.
Captain, if you'll take a seat

450
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,677
on one of the beds, I'd like
to do some further tests.

451
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,970
Kes, please
prepare the Captain

452
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,680
for a cerebro-cortical scan.

453
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,099
Certainly.

454
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,018
Captain, I saw
your hallucination again.

455
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,395
What did you see?

456
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,771
You were struggling
with a woman.

457
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,897
She had a knife.

458
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,732
She was trying
to hurt you.

459
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,234
That's right.
As I focused on you,

460
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,319
it was just like
with the little girl--

461
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,987
the image seemed
to reflect off of me

462
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,406
and move back into you.

463
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:11,117
Your telepathic abilities
must be increasing.

464
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,701
I think it's more than that.

465
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,121
I think something strange
is happening on this ship,

466
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,290
and it's not just
happening to you.

467
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,500
TUVOK:
I am picking up a ship

468
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,044
on long-range sensors,
Commander.

469
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,089
It is a design
we have not encountered before.

470
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,216
I show it
on a direct intercept course.

471
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,717
That must be
our welcoming party.

472
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,136
They're in a hurry too.

473
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,387
Closing fast.

474
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,679
They are hailing,
Commander.

475
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,931
On screen.

476
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,434
<i>Where is your Captain?</i>

477
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,185
She's not available right now.

478
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,354
I'm Commander Chakotay,
the First Officer.

479
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,688
I can speak for her.

480
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,607
<i>We observe</i>
<i>rather strict protocols.</i>

481
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,111
<i>I'd prefer to negotiate</i>
<i>with the Captain.</i>

482
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,405
I understand, but she's not
able to come to the Bridge now,

483
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,782
and in her absence,
our protocols allow me

484
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,367
to assume her place.

485
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,952
Our request is the same.

486
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,829
We'd like permission
to cross through your space.

487
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,496
We'll do it
as quickly as possible.

488
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,417
<i>What kind of weapon systems</i>
<i>do you possess?</i>

489
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,795
I'm not sure why that
information is necessary.

490
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,423
<i>How do I know you aren't</i>
<i>a heavily armed invader,</i>

491
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,133
<i>here to attack our settlements?</i>

492
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,593
I don't know
how to convince you,

493
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,095
but we're a peaceful people.

494
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,930
If you doubt us...

495
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,307
What happened?

496
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,017
I terminated
the transmission, Commander,

497
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,394
and made it look like
an accidental interruption.

498
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,938
I am concerned about some
anomalous sensor readings.

499
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,192
I'm getting them, too.
Residual energy displacements.

500
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,525
Two discrete readings--

501
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,569
one off the port bow,
one off starboard.

502
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,031
We have to consider the
possibility of cloaked ships.

503
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,782
Reverse course,
Mr. Paris.

504
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,075
Aye, sir.

505
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,243
(<i> console beeping</i> )

506
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,619
Two ships de-cloaking.

507
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,874
The Bothan ship
is powering up weapons.

508
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,792
Evasive maneuver gamma five.

509
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,880
Report.

510
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,342
Shields at 87 percent.
Minor damage on Decks 4 and 12.

511
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,843
They're turning back
for another strike.

512
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,761
Initiating evasive pattern
beta two.

513
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,138
Get the weapons
online.

514
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,474
Powering up
lateral phaser arrays.

515
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,394
Shields down to 83 percent.

516
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,686
Return fire.

517
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,484
A direct hit.

518
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,444
However, their shields
were not penetrated.

519
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,781
I can't stay here.

520
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,034
Captain, I can't allow
you to leave Sick Bay.

521
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,702
You're in no condition...
Sorry, Doctor.

522
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,913
If we're in trouble,
my place is on the Bridge.

523
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,750
There's something weird
going on, Commander.

524
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,043
I'm not reading any life signs

525
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,669
on the two ships
that just de-cloaked.

526
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,921
There's no crew?

527
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,588
It looks like the ships
are automated.

528
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,133
They're being controlled
by the Bothan ship.

529
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,011
Return fire, Tuvok.

530
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,516
We have hit their weapons array,

531
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,393
but not severely enough
to disable it.

532
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,354
Commander, the three ships
are maneuvering to surround us.

533
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,314
Get us out of here, Paris.

534
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,108
I'm trying.

535
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,568
The ships are powering
their weapons.

536
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,403
Preparing to fire.

537
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,701
That last volley took
our shields down to 21 percent.

538
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,953
We've got damage on all decks.

539
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,288
Reports of injuries.

540
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,583
All stop.

541
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,965
The lead ship
is hailing us, Commander.

542
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,592
On screen.

543
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:19,012
<i>Your ship is damaged</i>
<i>and your Captain incapacitated.</i>

544
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,890
<i>I will accept</i>
<i>your immediate surrender.</i>

545
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,641
You're not getting one.

546
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,935
The Captain is fine.

547
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,270
<i>I don't think so.</i>

548
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,898
<i>I think the battle is over now.</i>

549
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,824
Mark.

550
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,662
<i>Don't you recognize</i>
<i>the man you love?</i>

551
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,339
Mr. Paris, who do you see
on the viewscreen?

552
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,969
It's... my father.

553
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,805
<i>I hope you've been</i>
<i>behaving yourself.</i>

554
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,100
I see my girlfriend Libby.

555
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,645
Mr. Kim,
shut down visual.

556
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,523
I'm trying, Captain.

557
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,065
It won't terminate.

558
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,860
Mr. Tuvok, do a multiphasic
scan on those ships.

559
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,987
I want any evidence
of defensive weakness

560
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,533
and prepare the forward
photon torpedoes for launch.

561
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,535
Tuvok?

562
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:26,121
I do not understand
how this can be.

563
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,832
<i>Don't try to understand, Tuvok.</i>

564
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,250
<i>Just accept it.</i>

565
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,085
<i>We're together again.</i>

566
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,879
No.

567
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,589
You are not my wife.

568
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:39,134
<i>Of course I am.</i>
<i>I'm T'Pel.</i>

569
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,928
<i>And there,</i>
<i>right in front of you,</i>

570
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,389
<i>is your lute,</i>

571
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,475
<i>the one you used to</i>
<i>play for me.</i>

572
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,814
<i>And look... look around you.</i>

573
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:56,485
<i>You're back home on Vulcan.</i>

574
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,780
JANEWAY:
Tuvok?

575
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,991
Tuvok, answer me.

576
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,951
Tuvok!

577
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,370
Captain, I'll do it.

578
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,705
Running a multiphasic scan.

579
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,206
<i>Torres to the Captain.</i>

580
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,499
Janeway here.

581
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,958
<i>We're having problems</i>
<i>down here.</i>

582
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,377
People are becoming delusional.

583
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,878
JANEWAY:
<i>It's happening here, too.</i>

584
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,714
I think I know why.

585
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,258
There's a massive energy field
coming from those ships.

586
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,886
It's bioelectric, modulating
on a delta-wave frequency.

587
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,515
It has psionic properties,
and it's permeating the hull.

588
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,767
A psionic field
has a psychoactive effect.

589
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,519
That would explain
the hallucinations.

590
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,729
<i>You can try remodulating</i>

591
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,897
the shields,
but, in the meantime,

592
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,816
I'm going to set up a resonance
burst from the warp core.

593
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,151
That'll probably
block the field,

594
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,737
but it'll take
a while to set up.

595
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,071
Notify the Doctor.

596
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,573
If the field is bioelectric,

597
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,533
he might have some ideas
how to neutralize it.

598
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,577
Commander, give Lieutenant
Torres a hand in Engineering.

599
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,370
Mr. Neelix, if the crew

600
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,289
ever needed a morale officer,
now is the time.

601
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,831
See if you can help.
Aye, Captain.

602
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,252
<i>Kath, do you always</i>
<i>have to be the Captain?</i>

603
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,504
<i>Can't you relax for a minute?</i>

604
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,131
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>

605
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,676
Mr. Kim, remodulate the shields
on a rotating frequency.

606
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,890
Janeway to Kes.

607
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,017
<i>Yes, Captain?</i> 
Can you come to the Bridge?

608
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,145
I think we could use you.
<i>Right away.</i>

609
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,813
Paris, are you still with me?

610
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,189
Sure am, Captain.

611
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,857
I'm running the scans
on those ships.

612
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,318
I'll work
on the shields.

613
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,027
I suggest you don't look
at the viewscreen.

614
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,155
It's not even tempting.

615
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,452
How's it going
down here?

616
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,662
Not good.

617
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,371
I can't get a response
from anybody.

618
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,790
It's like they're catatonic.

619
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,291
It's the same
all over the ship.

620
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,168
On my way here, I must
have seen 50 people

621
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,670
just sitting, staring.

622
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,797
A few minutes ago, there was
a momentary interruption

623
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,006
in the psionic field.

624
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,549
Were there any indications

625
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,593
that the alien
somehow came on board?

626
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,969
I'll find out.

627
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,096
Chakotay to Janeway.

628
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,101
Chakotay to the Captain.
Please respond.

629
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,522
Chakotay to anyone
on the Bridge.

630
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,190
Kim, Paris, anybody!

631
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,568
We may be
the last ones left.

632
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,153
What do we do?

633
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,448
I think we should take
an escape pod.

634
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,908
We passed an M-Class planet
yesterday.

635
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,285
The pod should get us there
in a week.

636
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,662
We can try to get help.

637
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,372
A week? That might
be too late.

638
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,790
It may be our only hope.

639
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,458
If we stay here,
we'll end up like the others.

640
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,044
No. I have to keep trying
to set up the resonance burst.

641
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,462
Do I have to give you
an order?

642
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,255
I can't believe
you're saying this.

643
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,132
You know we have to stay here
and try to help the others.

644
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,134
I want you with me.

645
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,721
You aren't Chakotay.

646
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:32,140
I'm the Chakotay
you want me to be.

647
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,852
The one who loves you.

648
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:37,730
This is what you want,
isn't it?

649
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,065
The secret
you've been keeping?

650
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,651
You want us to be together.

651
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,372
And we can be.

652
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,167
(<i> panting</i> )

653
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,088
I have to help the others.

654
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,757
I want you.

655
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,466
I've always wanted you.

656
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,801
(<i> moaning</i> )

657
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,887
You feel the
same way too.

658
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,181
Yes!

659
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:22,065
Captain, I'm getting results
from the scans.

660
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,109
No apparent
defensive weaknesses.

661
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,152
Metallurgical analysis
is inconclusive.

662
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,363
I can't remodulate the shields.
Try moving us out of here.

663
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,240
If we can get some distance
between us and those ships,

664
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,700
we might be able
to block the effects.

665
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,952
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,913
MAN:
This time, let's see
if you can do it

667
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,748
without causing
an accident.

668
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,292
You usually manage
to make a mess

669
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,794
of everything you do.

670
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:48,967
Let me say something
I've always wanted to say.

671
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,095
Get out of my life!

672
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,723
I'm just telling you
what you already know.

673
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,559
When the going gets tough,
you crumble.

674
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,937
Not anymore.

675
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,148
Not anymore.

676
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,401
You don't really believe that
in your heart.

677
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,405
You believe you'll fail again
and, of course, you will.

678
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,867
You can't do
anything right.

679
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,911
You'll fail.

680
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,663
Why even try?

681
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,208
JANEWAY:
Tom?

682
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,380
Tom?

683
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,257
Janeway to Engineering.

684
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,134
Janeway to Torres.
Are you there?

685
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,094
Engineering, respond.

686
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,221
If anyone in Engineering
can hear me, I'm on my way.

687
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,891
Computer, put the Bridge
controls on security lockout.

688
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,275
Deck 11.

689
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:53,156
Now maybe you have
time to talk to me.

690
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,034
You're so strong, Kath.

691
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,369
It's one of the things

692
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,329
I always loved
in you.

693
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,878
What's the matter?

694
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,629
You used to love it
when I kissed you there.

695
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,382
I don't know who you are--
What you are--

696
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,967
But I won't let you
touch me.

697
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,719
What about the man
on the holodeck?

698
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,805
You didn't seem to mind
him touching you, did you?

699
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,224
In fact, I think
you liked it.

700
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,519
Now I ask you, Kath,
is that fair to me?

701
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,145
I've stayed
faithful to you.

702
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,940
I've vowed to wait for you
no matter how long it takes.

703
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,568
Shouldn't you
do the same?

704
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,207
I haven't been unfaithful.

705
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,167
Oh, Kath...

706
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,183
Sick Bay to Engineering.

707
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,603
Lieutenant Torres,
please respond.

708
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,066
Doctor to the Mess Hall.
Mr. Neelix, are you there?

709
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,819
This is the Doctor
to anyone on the ship.

710
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,280
If you can hear me,
please reply.

711
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,035
Either the communications system
is malfunctioning,

712
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,453
or everyone on board

713
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,622
has succumbed
to a delusional state.

714
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,291
Except you and me.
It would appear

715
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,293
that if the psionic field
is to be blocked

716
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,921
and the crew restored to normal,
it's up to us.

717
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,506
You will have to go
to Engineering

718
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,258
and complete
Lieutenant Torres' efforts

719
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,718
to create a resonance burst.

720
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,470
I don't know
how to do that.

721
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,805
I will assist you from here.

722
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,514
Do you know how to do it?

723
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,977
I... discussed the matter
with Lieutenant Torres.

724
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,604
I think I understand the basic
principle behind her plan.

725
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,608
How hard can it be?

726
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,401
All right.

727
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,488
Go to Engineering immediately.
I'll contact you there.

728
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,704
(<i> man moaning</i> )

729
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,917
Tom, what happened?

730
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,418
A plasma leak.

731
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,670
Caught me in the face.

732
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,921
Help me.

733
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,255
Can you get to Sick Bay?

734
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,548
The Doctor is there.

735
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,050
Come with me.

736
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,302
I can't, I have
to get to Engineering.

737
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,847
You can't leave me
like this.

738
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,306
It hurts!

739
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,058
Tom, you can walk.

740
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,144
You have to get
to Sick Bay on your own.

741
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,938
Kes, please.

742
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,857
I can't.

743
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,776
You don't want me
to get to Engineering.

744
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,944
No.

745
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,946
I'm... I'm
hallucinating.

746
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,657
Kes... wait!

747
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,994
Come back! Don't leave me!

748
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,537
Come back!

749
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,339
<i>Finally.</i>

750
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,841
<i>What took you so long?</i>

751
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,551
Doctor, we have to set up
this resonance burst

752
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,887
as quickly as possible.
I've started hallucinating.

753
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,348
<i>Then see if Lieutenant Torres'</i>
<i>last program is active.</i>

754
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,145
I think I have it.

755
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,189
B'Elanna was writing
a program

756
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,606
to open
a symmetrical warp field.

757
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:17,027
<i>All right.</i>
<i>You'll have to sequence</i>

758
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,611
<i>the magnetic plasma</i>
<i>constriction</i>

759
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,072
<i>to the following formula:</i>

760
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:24,868
<i>T = c sub one</i>
<i>over theta times p sub e.</i>

761
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,536
How do I do that?

762
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,247
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

763
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,665
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

764
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,125
<i>I'll see if I can access</i>

765
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,293
<i>Starfleet's</i>
<i>interactive database.</i>

766
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,422
Sweeting!

767
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,715
Thank goodness I found you.

768
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,383
Are you all right?

769
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,177
Where have you been?
In the Mess Hall

770
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,429
trying to help
the poor souls there.

771
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,264
Why didn't you answer
the Doctor's hails?

772
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,557
I didn't hear them.

773
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,267
The com system must be down,

774
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,394
and, frankly,
I was a little busy.

775
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,063
Ashmore thought
I was a Kazon.

776
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,565
Tried to kill me
with a carving knife.

777
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,985
How do I know
you're really Neelix?

778
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,446
Who else would I be?

779
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:05,117
Kes, all I want to do
is protect you--

780
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,785
To keep you safe.

781
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,704
We have to get
away from here--

782
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,123
Get to my shuttle.

783
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,336
Doctor, have you figured out

784
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,714
how I can enter
that sequencing code?

785
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,049
<i>It's quite simple really.</i>

786
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,592
<i>Do you know where</i>
<i>the command module is?</i>

787
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,510
Of course.
<i>Activate it</i>

788
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,972
<i>and select</i>
<i>"magnetic plasma sequencing."</i>

789
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,598
You're becoming
annoying.

790
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,977
I-I've got it.

791
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,603
It's activated.

792
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,272
Now it's asking me

793
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,689
to enter the
core temperature.

794
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,608
Move away from that console.

795
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:42,695
DOCTOR:
<i>Now, we need a temperature</i>
<i>high enough to emit</i>

796
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,614
<i>the resonance burst,</i>
<i>but not so high</i>

797
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,365
<i>as to irradiate</i>
<i>everyone on the ship.</i>

798
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,493
<i>Try three million kelvins.</i>

799
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:52,622
(<i> screaming</i> )

800
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,717
<i>Kes, look at him.</i>

801
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,970
It hurts!

802
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,222
<i>Look at him. Focus.</i>

803
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,682
I can't.

804
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,225
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

805
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,477
The mirror, remember?

806
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,395
It hurts too much!

807
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,691
<i>Kes, look at him.</i>

808
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,076
(<i> screaming</i> )

809
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,954
What's the matter, Kes?
Can't lift your head?

810
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,915
Focus.

811
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:46,801
(<i> screaming</i> )

812
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,269
Stop it!

813
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,900
(<i> screaming and groaning</i> )

814
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,788
I'm all right now, Doctor,
and I've entered a temperature

815
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,415
of three million kelvin.

816
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,710
<i>Then all you have to do</i>
<i>is activate the warp field.</i>

817
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,212
All right. Here we go.

818
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,396
Kes to the Captain.

819
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:42,023
If you can hear me,
please report to Engineering.

820
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,984
What happened?

821
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,319
It's a long story,

822
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,321
but I think everything's
all right now.

823
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,198
Is that who's responsible
for all this?

824
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,950
KES:
Apparently.

825
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,659
He looks so harmless.

826
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,996
It's hard to believe
he almost destroyed us.

827
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,884
You're a powerful little thing.

828
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,720
I must say, you surprised me.

829
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,022
Why did you do this to us?

830
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,566
Because I can.

831
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,573
Is it just telepathy,
or is there technology involved?

832
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,242
Does it matter?

833
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:38,413
Oh, it matters to me,
because I don't intend

834
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,915
to let you continue
preying on others.

835
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,294
How would you
propose to stop me?

836
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,714
We could destroy
your technology,

837
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,426
or adjust
your brain wave patterns

838
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,178
to prevent telepathy,

839
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:56,222
and then we could turn you over
to the government of Mithren.

840
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,767
We could even keep you
confined in our brig

841
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,978
behind a force field.

842
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,398
I'm sure you're
very well-intentioned, Captain,

843
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:10,320
and I'd like to be able to
accommodate you...

844
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,571
but, you see...

845
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,825
I'm not really here.

846
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,465
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

847
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,718
<i>We have no explanation for</i>
<i>the mysterious disappearance</i>

848
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,678
<i>of the telepathic alien.</i>

849
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,307
<i>We can't even be certain</i>
<i>that he was actually here.</i>

850
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,850
<i>He seems to have left us</i>

851
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,853
<i>with any number</i>
<i>of unanswered questions.</i>

852
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,109
I'm surprised to see
you here, Captain.

853
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,154
Isn't this the day
that you're usually

854
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,947
in the holodeck
with your novel?

855
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,992
I thought after
our recent experience

856
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,954
that I'd take a break
from fantasy for a while.

857
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,041
I don't blame you.

858
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,711
I think... it had quite
an impact on all of us.

859
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,344
Do you think it's true--

860
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,680
that the alien
was reading our minds,

861
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,892
creating images
from our own experiences?

862
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,770
It seemed that way.

863
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,068
He had an uncanny ability to...

864
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:36,531
bring buried thoughts
out into the open.

865
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,907
Why?

866
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,326
Oh, it's just...

867
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,206
I experienced something...

868
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,250
I'd rather not admit.

869
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,502
I know.

870
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,795
Me too.

871
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,801
But in a way...

872
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,221
maybe he did us all a favor.

873
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,514
Maybe it's better to...

874
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,018
look those feelings in the eye

875
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,314
than to keep them
locked up inside.

876
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,318
I guess.

877
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,361
I'll have to think about that.

878
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,158
Well, I have
an early watch tomorrow,

879
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,118
so I'd better turn in.

880
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,079
Good night, Captain.

881
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,582
Good night, B'Elanna.

882
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,375
Sweet dreams.

883
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,129
Thanks.

884
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,007
You too.
