(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,803
(<i> sighs</i> )

3
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,972
(<i> all clapping</i> )

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:17,935
Incredible.

5
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,937
Absolutely thrilling.

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:24,525
All I can say
is...wow! Ha.

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,776
What about you,
Mr. Vulcan?

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,862
Isn't that just...?

9
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,321
Wow! Ha.

10
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,573
Your inarticulate
expression of awe

11
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,074
notwithstanding,
Mr. Neelix,

12
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:36,620
it was
a fascinating spectacle.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,079
That's the edge
of the shock wave.

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,040
The pressure's
over 90 kilopascals.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,583
Thirty percent more
than we predicted.

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,377
Tom, back us off
at full impulse.

17
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,253
I want to stay ahead
of the brunt of that wave.

18
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,422
Yes, ma'am.

19
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,924
Congratulations, everyone.

20
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,218
Only two other crews
in the history of Starfleet

21
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,470
have witnessed
a supernova explosion.

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,930
But neither one was this close,

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,016
less than ten billion
kilometers.

24
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,183
Definitely a record.

25
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,852
Who brought the champagne?

26
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,187
Champagne? Captain, if I thought
you wanted champagne, I...

27
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,189
JANEWAY:
Relax, Neelix.
It's a figure of speech.

28
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,107
Thanks for inviting us
to watch with you, captain.

29
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,526
It's really
gotten me interested

30
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,570
in learning more about
stellar phenomena.

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,821
Just remember, Kes,

32
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,531
anyone can stargaze
on the bridge--

33
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,825
even a hologram
with a mobile emitter

34
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,412
but the real action
will always be in sick bay.

35
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,455
How'd those shield modifications
hold up, B'elanna?

36
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,374
Less than
a seven percent power drain.

37
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,835
Good job. Chakotay,
what do you say

38
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,713
we get started analyzing those
carbon conversion readings?

39
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,882
Captain, you've been on
the bridge for fourteen hours.

40
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,550
Don't you think you
deserve a little rest?

41
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,135
Harry and I will get to work
on the astrometric analysis

42
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,221
and we'll give you
a full report in the morning.

43
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,515
You win.
I'll see you at 0700.

44
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,530
Janeway to security.

45
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,907
Intruder alert.

46
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,701
There's no need to call
room service, Kathy.

47
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,202
I've already ordered.

48
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,371
Oh, Q.

49
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,624
You did say
you wanted champagne.

50
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,918
Janeway to security.
Intruder alert.

51
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,377
Oh, it's no use.

52
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,922
I've taken the proverbial
phone off the hook.

53
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,591
After all, we don't want
any interruptions.

54
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,676
What are you doing here?

55
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,636
To us.

56
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,554
There is no us, Q.

57
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,309
The night is young, and
the sheets... are satin.

58
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,478
I want you out, but first,
get rid of this bed.

59
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,938
I have no intention
of getting between

60
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,481
those Starfleet
issue sheets.

61
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,232
They give me a
terrible rash.

62
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,735
Well, since you won't
be getting in the bed

63
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,070
I wouldn't worry about it.

64
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,783
Oh, Kathy...
don't be such a prude.

65
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,118
Admit it.

66
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,869
It has been a while.

67
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,245
And it's going to
be a while longer.

68
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,288
Now get out.

69
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,165
So tense.

70
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,085
Why don't you slip into
something more comfortable?

71
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,382
If you think this puerile
attempt at seduction

72
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,969
is going to work, you're
even more self-deluded

73
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,471
than I thought.

74
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,639
Oh, I see.

75
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,723
You think I'm interested

76
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,309
in some tawdry
one-night stand.

77
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,186
That's because I haven't
told you why I'm here yet.

78
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:11,274
Out of all the females,
of all the species

79
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,569
in all the galaxies,
I have chosen you

80
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,365
to be the mother
of my child.

81
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,684
I know that you're
probably asking yourself

82
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,228
"Why would a brilliant,
handsome,

83
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,648
"dashingly omnipotent being
like Q want to mate

84
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,859
with a scrawny little
bipedal specimen like me?"

85
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,153
Let me guess.

86
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,655
No one else in the universe
will have you.

87
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,990
Nonsense.

88
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,741
I could have chosen
a Klingon Targ

89
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,745
the Romulan empress,
a Cyrillian microbe.

90
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,957
Really? I beat out
a single-celled organism?

91
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,208
How flattering.

92
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,252
It's an overwhelming
honor, isn't it?

93
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,212
I can't get you
out of my mind.

94
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,798
You're confident,
passionate, beautiful.

95
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,009
And totally uninterested.

96
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,637
Kathy, you can't leave.

97
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,682
My cosmic clock is ticking.

98
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,102
Besides, you have no idea
what you're missing.

99
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,689
Foreplay with a Q
can last for decades.

100
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,985
Sorry, but I'm busy
for the next 60 or 70 years.

101
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,571
Oh, I see. This is one
of those silly human rituals.

102
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,490
You're playing hard to get.

103
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,576
As far as you're concerned,
Q, I'm impossible to get.

104
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,788
Goody. A challenge.

105
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,123
This is going to be fun.

106
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,631
(<i> sighing</i> )

107
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,342
Janeway to bridge.

108
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,718
<i>Chakotay here, Captain.</i>

109
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
I thought you were going
to get some sleep.

110
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,224
<i>I've just had a visit from Q.</i>
<i>He's gone now,</i>

111
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,850
but I want
to be notified immediately

112
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,768
if he reappears
anywhere on the ship

113
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,937
or if anything odd
starts to happen.

114
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,898
Acknowledged.

115
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,567
What did he want?

116
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,570
Let's just say he had
a personal request.

117
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,779
Captain?

118
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,366
I'm not sure what
he's really up to,

119
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,034
but I have
a feeling he'll be back.

120
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,451
Janeway out.

121
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,124
(<i> sighing</i> )

122
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:03,924
(<i> door beeping</i> )

123
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,633
Come in.

124
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,636
I've got those carbon conversion
readings from the supernova.

125
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,264
Thank you.

126
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,475
Is there something else?

127
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,228
Have you heard
anything more from Q?

128
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:21,608
No. I wish I could believe
he's gone for good.

129
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,943
I was wondering

130
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,819
just what you meant
when you said he made

131
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,238
a personal request.

132
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,244
He wants to mate with me.

133
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,330
(<i> exhaling</i> )

134
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,790
I see.

135
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,666
Obviously, it's
out of the question

136
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,627
and I suspect it's
a smoke screen.

137
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,671
Knowing Q he's probably
got some hidden agenda.

138
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,923
Maybe...

139
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,716
Chakotay...

140
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,635
I know I don't have
any right to feel this way,

141
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,221
but this bothers
the hell out of me.

142
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,098
Q:
I do believe
you're jealous.

143
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,934
Why didn't you tell me
there was another man?

144
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,144
Because there isn't.

145
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,604
I'm just not
interested in you.

146
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,398
Any more questions?

147
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,025
I was wondering, Kathy,
what could anyone

148
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,611
possibly see
in this big oaf anyway?

149
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,363
Is it the tattoo?

150
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,116
Because mine's bigger.

151
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,827
Not big enough.

152
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,882
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 50384.2.</i>

<i>Q's unannounced visits</i>
<i>continue. </i>

154
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,470
<i>Since I suspect</i>
<i>he's up to something</i>

155
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,096
<i>more than pursuing me,</i>

156
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,474
<i>I've instructed the crew</i>
<i>to take every opportunity</i>

157
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,393
<i>to uncover his true motives.</i>

158
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,978
Who says
crew performance reports

159
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,355
have to be a chore?

160
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,606
(<i> both moaning</i> )

161
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,025
It sure beats
working on the bridge.

162
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,776
Now, if we
could just convince

163
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,446
the captain to start holding
morning briefings in here...

164
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,655
that'll be the day.

165
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,243
Nice program, Tommy,
but it's all

166
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,412
just so much hollow
pleasure, isn't it?

167
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,705
All right, Q, we'll bite.

168
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,625
What do you want?

169
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,130
Guys... I just don't
understand your captain.

170
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,883
I've tried everything--
filling the bridge with roses

171
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:14,346
writing Drabian love sonnets,
serenading her in her bath.

172
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,805
Oh, I'll bet she loved that one.

173
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,266
But no matter what
lengths I go to win her heart

174
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,185
she rejects me. Me!

175
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,187
How, I ask you,
is that possible?

176
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,732
Did it ever occur to you that
she just doesn't like you?

177
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,150
No.

178
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,736
Look, Q, we've been told

179
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,197
about your appearances
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

180
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,699
We know your little visits
usually turn out

181
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,243
to be more than meet the eye

182
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,161
so save
your broken-heart routine

183
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:44,376
and tell us
what you're really after.

184
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,170
I just thought
that the two of you

185
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,130
might be able to give me
some advice

186
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,175
on how to break through
Kathy's icy exterior.

187
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,136
You know, man-to-man.

188
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,350
My advice would
be to give up

189
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,812
before you embarrass yourself
any more than you already have.

190
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,814
Come on, Harry.
We're not going to get

191
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,316
a straight answer
out of this guy.

192
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,700
(<i> slurping</i> )

193
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,791
You-- bar rodent-- another one
of these... fruity concoctions.

194
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,001
Not unless you tell me

195
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,003
why you're bothering
Captain Janeway.

196
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,338
Captain Janeway?

197
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,591
Now, that's a subject
I want to discuss.

198
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,302
Tell me, what are some
of her favorite things?

199
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,720
Chocolate truffles,
stuffed animals,

200
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,264
erotic art?

201
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,309
You can't bribe
Captain Janeway.

202
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,311
Oh, no?
Isn't that what you do?

203
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,979
What are you
talking about?

204
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,982
I understand that you
acquire things for her--

205
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,110
create little
interesting diversions

206
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,154
prepare little tasty treats.

207
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,241
After all, why else
would she be fond of your...

208
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,578
fur-lined face?

209
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,745
Do you want to know

210
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,372
what Captain Janeway
likes about me?

211
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,873
I'll tell you.

212
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:10,337
I am respectful, loyal,
and most of all, sincere,

213
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,172
and those are qualities
which someone like you

214
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,174
could never hope
to possess.

215
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,805
(<i> chuckles</i> )

216
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,558
(<i> faint whimpering</i> )

217
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,161
(<i> gasps</i> )

218
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,298
This isn't going to work, Q.

219
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,676
How can you ignore that face?

220
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,637
He's adorable,
but this has to stop.

221
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,598
Please. Accept him...

222
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,933
as a small token
of my affection.

223
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,185
No.

224
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,811
Suit yourself.

225
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,896
May we talk?

226
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,189
Just talk?

227
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,547
<i>( clearing throat</i> )

228
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:47,183
I'm... afraid that I
haven't been sincere.

229
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,685
When you first asked

230
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,271
why I wanted to have
a child with you

231
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,649
I made jokes,
bragged about my prowess,

232
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,817
engaged in sexual innuendo.

233
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,696
I was using all that
to cover up my true feelings.

234
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,947
And I suppose
you want to share

235
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,243
your true feelings
with me now.

236
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,869
I'm lonely.

237
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,371
Lonely?

238
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,081
Oh, I know it's hard to believe

239
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,875
but I've been single
for billions of years.

240
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,837
It was fun at first--
gallivanting around the galaxy

241
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:21,134
using my omnipotence to impress
females of every species.

242
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,095
(<i> laughs</i> )

243
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,391
The fact of the matter
is that it left me empty.

244
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,978
I want someone
to love me for myself.

245
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:37,942
I guess what I'm saying is...
I want a relationship.

246
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,445
I just thought
if you and I had a child

247
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,532
it would give me that kind
of stability and security

248
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,118
that I've been missing.

249
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,036
Sorry, Q.

250
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,164
I'm not buying it.

251
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,165
Oh.

252
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,916
All right.

253
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,169
Let's see if you buy this.

254
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,802
You're stuck out here, thousands
of light years from home

255
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,347
and you aren't getting
any younger, are you?

256
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,974
All your hopes for
home, hearth or family

257
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,851
grow dimmer
every day.

258
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,730
Admit it, Kathryn.
You're lonely too.

259
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,735
And you wonder if you will
ever... have a child.

260
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,612
You're right.

261
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,656
I would like to have
a child someday...

262
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,657
Oh.

263
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,075
But not with you.
Why not?

264
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,704
I'm just not the right
kind of woman for you, Q.

265
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,123
Truer words
were never spoken.

266
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,584
Q! How did
you find me?

267
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,002
Never mind that.

268
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,296
What are you doing
with that dog?

269
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,134
I'm not talking about the puppy.

270
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,349
Can't you see
I'm busy here?

271
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,059
Stop stalking me!

272
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,520
You should be back
in the Continuum.

273
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,104
Excuse me...

274
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,440
but who are you exactly?

275
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,069
Kathryn Janeway,
may I present... Q.

276
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,779
Not just any Q--

277
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,864
his Q.

278
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,742
We were involved
for a while.

279
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,951
About four billion years.

280
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,037
And now you desert me

281
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,165
to pollute the Continuum
with the DNA of this...

282
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,334
narrow little being.

283
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,087
I never said
it was exclusive.

284
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,590
Stay away from him.

285
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,965
Look...

286
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,134
Miss Q, I'll save you
a lot of trouble.

287
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,969
I have zero interest in him.

288
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,347
Oh, now you see
what you've done?

289
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,183
And I was finally
making progress.

290
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,435
CHAKOTAY:
<i>Bridge to Janeway.</i>

291
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,728
<i>You'd better come in here.</i>

292
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,187
On my way.

293
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,147
I'd really appreciate
it if you would take this

294
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,234
domestic squabble off my ship.

295
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,241
Report.

296
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,368
CHAKOTAY:
You're not going
to believe this, captain.

297
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,412
But another star in this
cluster just went supernova.

298
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,790
It's .02 light years
from our current position.

299
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,083
KIM:
Make that
two supernovas, commander.

300
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,128
I just picked up another
one at 217 mark 47.

301
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,005
Estimated time
of implosion: 67 seconds.

302
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,549
Get us out of here, Tom.

303
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,676
I can't. The subspace
shock wave from the star

304
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,928
is collapsing
the warp field.

305
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,178
Red alert.

306
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,013
Tuvok, increase power
to the shields.

307
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,974
Tom, lay in a course away
from that shock wave.

308
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,434
Maximum impulse.

309
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,604
A star going supernova is
an event that occurs

310
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,940
once every century
in this galaxy.

311
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,483
Now we're about
to witness our third

312
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,026
in less than three days--
all in the same sector.

313
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,905
Why do I suspect you have
something to do with this?

314
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,490
She may be a member
of an intellectually

315
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,534
challenged species,
but she's right.

316
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,953
Your irresponsible behavior

317
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,414
is continuing
to have cosmic consequences.

318
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,416
Will you stop overreacting?!

319
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,001
Always nagging.

320
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,962
Now you see why I left her.

321
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,880
Are you causing
these supernovas?

322
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,632
Well, not exactly.

323
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,883
What's that
supposed to mean?

324
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,635
PARIS:
It's no use, captain.

325
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,011
The shock wave
is too fast for us.

326
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,638
Try evasive maneuvers.

327
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,890
I'm afraid a course correction
will be futile, captain.

328
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,725
There are three distinct
shock waves

329
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,727
heading toward us
on various trajectories.

330
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,646
It will be impossible
to avoid them all.

331
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,564
Divert auxiliary power
to the shields.

332
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,359
You have the ability to get us
out of here, so do it.

333
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,904
CHAKOTAY:
16 seconds to impact. I'm not
sure if the shields will hold.

334
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,281
Do something, Q!

335
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,492
Well..

336
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,660
if you insist.

337
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,704
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

338
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,080
That two-timing toad!

339
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,582
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

340
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,917
Contact with the first
shock wave

341
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,293
within three seconds,
commander.

342
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,920
All hands,
brace for impact.

343
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,477
Q?

344
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,896
Where have you taken me?

345
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,832
Well, I must admit
your gown is very becoming.

346
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,834
I don't have time
for your little fantasies.

347
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,836
Return me to<i> Voyager.</i>

348
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,338
This is no fantasy.

349
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,883
You're in the Q Continuum now.

350
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,634
The Continuum?

351
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,970
That's right.

352
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,431
I'm simply allowing you
to perceive it in a context

353
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,391
your human mind can comprehend.

354
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,560
The last time
you brought me here

355
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,730
it looked like some sort of
way station on a desert road.

356
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,567
Ha. It<i> was</i> awfully
drab, wasn't it?

357
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,779
But<i> this</i> -- this is
a much more colorful

358
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,988
representation for a human

359
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,282
of American descent,
don't you think?

360
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,159
An elegant manor house,
a beautiful southern belle,

361
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,954
a dashing union officer

362
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,914
determined to win
her affections

363
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,750
despite her hatred
for Yankee interlopers...

364
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,544
Enough. The only thing that
interests me right now

365
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,005
is the welfare of
my ship and crew.

366
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,759
Well, I'm sure your first
officer-- "Chuckles," is it?

367
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,927
I'm sure he's
got everything

368
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,804
under control
for the moment.

369
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,346
I'd like to make sure
of that myself

370
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,890
if you don't mind.

371
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,476
This has gone
way beyond your ship.

372
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,646
It's even gone
beyond you and me.

373
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:10,858
This is about the future
of the Continuum itself.

374
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,403
Stop speaking in riddles
and tell me what's going on.

375
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,823
I'll do better
than that.

376
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,074
I'll show you.

377
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,667
The Continuum
is burning.

378
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,087
The Q are in the middle
of a civil war.

379
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,638
JANEWAY:
Start explaining.

380
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,850
Do you remember
our friend Quinn?

381
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,769
Q who committed suicide
aboard<i> Voyager?</i>

382
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,022
Do you recall what
I said might happen

383
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,732
if he were allowed
to take his own life?

384
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,317
You said it would represent

385
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,612
an interruption
to the Continuum...

386
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,032
that it could have
dire consequences.

387
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,951
I'd say a civil war
is pretty dire, wouldn't you?

388
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,997
His death caused this conflict.

389
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,291
It caused chaos and upheaval...

390
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,044
because even though he was gone

391
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,504
his calls for freedom
and individualism

392
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,506
continued to echo
in the ears of those

393
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,633
who believed
in his teachings--

394
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,468
myself among them.

395
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,638
I sounded the trumpet
and carried the banner.

396
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,141
Naturally, others followed.

397
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,433
The forces of the status quo

398
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,019
tried to crush us
once and for all

399
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,687
but we fought back

400
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:33,107
and now there's a cosmic
struggle for supremacy

401
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,234
and the battle is spreading

402
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,903
causing hazardous repercussions

403
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:37,904
throughout the galaxy.

404
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,198
Oh, the supernovas.

405
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,993
You might call them...

406
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,204
"Galactic cross fire."

407
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,456
It's terrible, isn't it?

408
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:53,669
But it's also
a wonderful opportunity.

409
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,047
I fail to see anything
wonderful about a war.

410
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,590
War can be an engine of change.

411
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,718
War can transform
a society for the better.

412
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,302
Your own civil war
brought about an end

413
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,013
to slavery and oppression.

414
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,305
But our civil war came at a time

415
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,599
before mankind had learned

416
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,643
to resolve disputes
without bloodshed.

417
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,271
Surely, the Q have
evolved to a point

418
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,232
where you can find
a non-violent way

419
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,900
to resolve a conflict.

420
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,526
That's where you come in.

421
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,195
What do I have to do
with any of this, Q?

422
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,447
I want you to help me
transform the Continuum

423
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,617
in the same way your civil war
transformed the nation.

424
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,035
By mating with you?!

425
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,120
I know.

426
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,039
It's brilliant, isn't it?

427
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,083
I don't see how a baby
is going to end a war

428
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,877
being fought by a race
of omnipotent beings.

429
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,336
It's simple.

430
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,965
Mating will create
a new breed of Q, which will

431
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,093
combine my omnipotence
and infinite intellect

432
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,971
with the best that humanity
has to offer.

433
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:49,058
You believe human DNA 
is going to restore peace?

434
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,684
Precisely.

435
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,812
What the Continuum needs
right now

436
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,772
is an infusion of fresh blood.

437
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,149
A new sensibility.

438
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,399
A new leader.

439
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,692
A new<i> messiah.</i>

440
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,028
(<i> shouts and gunfire</i> )

441
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,280
Think of it, Kathy--

442
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,364
our child will be
like a precious stone

443
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,075
tossed into the cosmic lake

444
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,285
sending endless ripples

445
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,453
of human conscience
and compassion

446
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,498
to wash up on every distant
shore of the universe.

447
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,792
What greater contribution

448
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,210
could a being of
your limited power

449
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,087
ever hope to make?

450
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,799
What is more important
to humanity than peace?

451
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,843
I'm offering you
the opportunity

452
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,179
to be the mother of peace.

453
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,471
(<i> gunfire</i> )

454
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,686
Well, what's it
going to be?

455
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,896
(<i> gunshots,</i>
<i>cries out</i> )

456
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,439
Q!

457
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,193
(<i> groaning</i> )

458
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,069
You're bleeding.

459
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,655
(<i> gunshots</i> )

460
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,330
(<i> explosion</i> )

461
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,919
(<i> explosion</i> )

462
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,129
Report.

463
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,715
Shield strength
is at 20%.

464
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,884
Hull damage on decks
nine through 14.

465
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,385
Minor injuries
reported on all decks.

466
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,804
Warp drive is off-line.

467
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,764
KIM:
Commander, according to
these readings

468
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,350
the shock waves have
knocked us 16 billion

469
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,185
kilometers from our
previous location.

470
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,647
I want to know
what's going on here.

471
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,191
Where's Captain Janeway?

472
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:23,610
Let me go before I hurl
this ship and everyone on it

473
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,031
into the Therinian ice age.
I don't think you can.

474
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,157
Don't be ridiculous.

475
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,283
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

476
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,576
I don't know how or why

477
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,203
but something's
affected your powers.

478
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,871
Otherwise, you wouldn't
still be here

479
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,831
and you wouldn't have a bruise
on your forehead.

480
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,208
Now start talking

481
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,752
before I hurl you
into the brig<i> .</i>

482
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,633
CHAKOTAY:
And it's the war
in the Continuum

483
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,220
that's causing
the supernovas?

484
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,223
May we presume that this
conflict is also responsible

485
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,766
for the weakening of your powers

486
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,434
and your inability
to return to the Continuum?

487
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,854
The Vulcan talent
for stating the obvious

488
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,356
never ceases to amaze me.

489
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,648
How were Q and
Captain Janeway

490
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,942
able to reenter
the Continuum

491
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,442
and you weren't?

492
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,696
I tried to return but
I was wounded in the process.

493
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,198
Don't try to understand it.

494
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,368
It's far beyond your limited
capacity to comprehend.

495
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,744
What's important is

496
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,038
I'm stuck here
with you mortals

497
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,915
while Q is probably
in the process

498
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,750
of irreparably
harming the Continuum

499
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,585
with that... woman.

500
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,088
Hmm! Tossed aside

501
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,216
for someone
five billion years younger.

502
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,635
If it weren't
so laughable, I'd cry.

503
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,638
Look, we want
our captain back,

504
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,765
and you obviously
want to get home.

505
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,642
Why don't we
help each other?

506
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,145
How could you
possibly help me?

507
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,521
There's got to be some way
to get back to the Continuum

508
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,983
besides snapping
your fingers.

509
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:48,446
Hmm. Well, there
is one possibility

510
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:51,407
but, somehow, I don't
think this rickety barge

511
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,285
or your half-witted crew members
are up to the challenge.

512
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,830
May I remind you, madam,
that this "rickety barge"

513
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,581
and its "half-witted crew"

514
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,875
Are your only hope
at the moment.

515
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,765
Ow! That hurts.

516
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,769
Be still. I never thought
a Q could be injured.

517
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,521
As I said, this is
only your perception

518
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,815
of what is happening.

519
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,236
I can assure you

520
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,696
those are not
mere cannon balls

521
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,824
and lead charges
being fired at us.

522
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,701
So they're some sort of...

523
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,703
Q weapons?

524
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,580
You'd be surprised
what innovative munitions

525
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,540
can be created
by one immortal being

526
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,918
who set his mind
on killing another.

527
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,296
MAN:
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

528
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,714
You're surrounded, Q.

529
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,467
Surrender now
and we'll be merciful.

530
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,135
Call a truce. Talk to them.

531
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,388
Maybe you can
resolve this peacefully.

532
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,931
MAN:
What's your answer, Q.

533
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,741
I'll never surrender,
you know that!

534
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:20,329
MAN:
Resume fire! Resume fire!

535
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,663
Q:
Get the rifle
in the corner.

536
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,123
Take the other window.

537
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,084
This is your fight, Q,
not mine!

538
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,419
If that's how you feel about it.

539
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,421
But if their weapons
can make me bleed

540
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,963
what do you think
they'll do to you?

541
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:31,924
(<i> gunshots</i> )

542
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,972
(<i> explosion</i> )

543
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,311
Oh!

544
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,479
Q?

545
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,440
Q, come on.

546
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,191
Oh!

547
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,276
Come on!

548
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,651
(<i> explosion</i> )

549
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:02,580
CHAKOTAY:
<i>First officer's log,</i>
<i>stardate: 50392.7.</i>

550
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,039
<i>While we don't fully understand</i>

551
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,874
<i>the astrophysics</i>
<i>underlying her plan,</i>

552
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,794
<i>the female Q has suggested</i>
<i>several modifications</i>

553
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,923
<i>which may allow</i> Voyager
<i>to enter the Continuum.</i>

554
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,883
Well?

555
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,884
Well, what?

556
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,677
Are you finished yet?

557
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,012
What you've asked us to do

558
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,598
requires a complete
reconfiguration

559
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,557
of the shield array.

560
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,724
It takes a while...

561
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,768
for us mere
mortals, that is.

562
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,853
Surely there's some way you
can speed up the process?

563
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,315
If you're in such a hurry why
don't you just snap your fingers

564
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,024
and do it yourself?

565
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,401
Oh, that's right.

566
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,321
You've lost your powers
and you need our help.

567
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,072
I don't think you understand.

568
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,241
It's imperative that I
get back to the Continuum

569
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,243
before Q mates
with your captain.

570
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,869
I understand perfectly.

571
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,121
You aren't the first female

572
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,332
who's ever had a man
run out on her.

573
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,917
I hope you're not comparing
some failed romance

574
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,921
in your pitiful existence to
my eternal association with Q?

575
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,591
You know, I have really had it

576
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,135
with this superiority complex
of yours.

577
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,096
It's not a complex, dear.
It's a fact.

578
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,015
Well, here's another fact:

579
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,184
if you don't stop pestering me
I'm never going to finish,

580
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,436
in which case,
your association with Q

581
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:11,649
might not be quite
as eternal as you think.

582
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,029
You know, I've always
liked Klingon females.

583
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,199
You've got such... spunk.

584
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,822
(<i> gasps</i> )

585
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,033
Where are we?

586
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:06,704
One of your faction's
encampments.

587
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,038
How?

588
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,415
I pulled you out of the mansion

589
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,042
and managed to hide you
from the enemy patrols.

590
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,711
Then I spotted
some of your people

591
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,922
retreating from the battle.

592
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:22,344
From the look of them, I'd say
you're not on the winning side.

593
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,763
You saved my life.

594
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,057
And now, it's time
to end all this.

595
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,101
I knew you'd come around.

596
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,482
I've been thinking
about what you said.

597
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:39,194
That creating a new Q
could bring an era of peace.

598
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,198
Oh, my wild, sweet Kathy.

599
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,951
I promise you won't regret it.

600
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:49,580
Oh, you're not going to have
a child with me.

601
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,624
You're going to mate with
that charming lady friend

602
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:55,419
of yours that appeared
on my ship.

603
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,385
Mate with another Q? Ridiculous.

604
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:07,264
Sounded to me like you and she
had a very long relationship.

605
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,308
Yes, but it was never physical.

606
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,144
I mean,
the Q are way beyond sex.

607
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,437
It's never been done.

608
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,230
Really?

609
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,566
Then how exactly did
the Q come into existence

610
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,776
in the first place?

611
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,736
The Q didn't come
into existence.

612
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,613
The Q have always existed.

613
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,115
Besides, I can only
mate with a species

614
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,409
capable of copulation...

615
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,536
like you.

616
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,288
But I don't love you, Q.

617
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,081
Yes, but what does that
have to do with it?

618
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,584
Everything.
It's the foundation of a family.

619
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,795
I could never have a child
with someone I didn't love,

620
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,713
much less give it up
to the Continuum.

621
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,508
Dearest Kathy, I would never
dream of having you give it up.

622
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,218
I mean, who would raise it?
Who would look after it?

623
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,805
I'm really not cut out
to be a wet nurse.

624
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,515
(<i> sighing</i> )

625
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,434
Oh... so you're not willing
to do the hard work?

626
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm an idea man.

627
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,189
Hard work isn't my forte.

628
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,191
I'd change specialties
if I were you

629
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,651
'cause the kind of trouble
you're in

630
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,235
needs more than a quick fix.

631
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,822
You can't just sprinkle
a little human DNA

632
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,115
into the Continuum
and make everything all right.

633
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,451
Why not?

634
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,538
(<i> sighs</i> )

635
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:16,333
Those "best qualities
of humanity" you talked about

636
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,670
aren't a simple matter
of genetics.

637
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,005
Love, conscience,
compassion...

638
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,007
(<i> groans</i> )

639
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,927
They're attributes that mankind
has developed over centuries.

640
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,723
Values that have passed from
one generation to the next

641
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:35,268
taught by parents
to their children.

642
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:39,690
Creating a new kind
of Q is a noble idea,

643
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,108
but it will take more
than impregnating someone

644
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,069
and walking away.

645
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:48,156
If you want your offspring
to embrace your ideals

646
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,243
you're going to have
to teach them yourself.

647
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,412
Yes, but that's exactly
why I want you here--

648
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,039
to nourish and guide
the little tyke.

649
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,500
Think of the opportunities
here in the Continuum.

650
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,379
The entire universe would
be our child's playground.

651
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,424
Together, the two of you
could explore dimensions

652
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,552
you've never
even imagined.

653
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,136
Fess up.

654
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:14,974
Isn't it even...
slightly tempting?

655
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:18,186
I'd be lying if I said no.

656
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,188
What explorer
wouldn't be intrigued

657
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,902
by the idea of seeking out
whole new dimensions?

658
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,237
But I have
other responsibilities

659
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,197
and I won't just abandon them.

660
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:34,202
Ah, yes. The crew of
the intrepid starship<i> Voyager.</i>

661
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:39,249
Perhaps you'd be interested
in sending them home.

662
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,960
You've tempted me
with that prospect before

663
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,214
but frankly, your credibility
is more than a little suspect.

664
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,928
My crew and I will get home.

665
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,012
We're committed to that,
but we're going to do it

666
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,683
through hard work
and determination.

667
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,103
We are not looking
for a quick fix.

668
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,150
Even if I wanted to mate,
I wouldn't know how.

669
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,860
It's totally unprecedented.

670
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,278
You'll figure something out.

671
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,531
You are omnipotent,
after all.

672
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,991
I need time to think about it.

673
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,702
Time's up, Q.
You've got to stop this war

674
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,997
before it destroys
the Continuum.

675
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,373
Now, I'm taking
this white flag

676
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,875
and I'm going over
to the enemy camp

677
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,710
and I'm going to tell them
you're ready to talk

678
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,505
about terms for a cease-fire.

679
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,966
Kathy, don't be a hero.

680
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,969
I'm going, Q.

681
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,596
So if I were you,
I'd start working on a way

682
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,431
to set that precedent.

683
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,775
CHAKOTAY:
<i>First officer's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

684
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,610
<i>We've laid in a course</i>
<i>for the point in space</i>

685
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,070
<i>where the female Q says</i>
<i>we can enter the Continuum</i>

686
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,324
<i>and find the captain.</i>

687
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,702
You-- helm boy.

688
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,913
Adjust course to
heading 235 mark 08.

689
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:03,166
Increase speed
to maximum impulse.

690
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,084
Sir?

691
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,586
KIM:
Uh, commander?

692
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,754
What is it, Harry?

693
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,964
She's put us on a direct course

694
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,384
for another star
about to go supernova.

695
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,887
You did say you wanted
to get into the Continuum.

696
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,262
Yes, but in one piece.

697
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,724
Try to wrap your
minuscule mind around this:

698
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,977
these supernovas are actually
caused by spatial disruptions

699
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,062
within the Continuum--
the result of the war.

700
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,064
Now, each time
a star implodes,

701
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,650
a negative density
false vacuum is created

702
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,485
which actually sucks
the surrounding matter

703
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,737
into the Continuum.

704
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,405
So<i> Voyager</i> will be
pulled in too.

705
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,156
If we time it perfectly.

706
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,742
Otherwise,
the subsequent explosion

707
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,577
will blow you all
into micro-fragments.

708
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,119
TUVOK:
Commander.

709
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,496
I needn't remind you

710
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,374
that close proximity
to a supernova will crush us

711
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,834
whether or not
we time it perfectly.

712
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,960
(<i> sighs</i> )

713
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,295
You're so negative.

714
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,463
He does have a point.

715
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,841
Humanoids. Q to Engineering.

716
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,217
Go ahead, Q.

717
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,011
<i>Take warp drive off-line</i>

718
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,014
<i>then remodulate the shield to</i>
<i>emit a beta-tachyon pulse</i>

719
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,725
and prepare to emit a series
of focused anti-proton beams

720
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,101
to the shield bubble.

721
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,228
Does this make any sense
to you, B'elanna?

722
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,647
I'd be lying if I said
I understood it completely,

723
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,817
but if she's thinking
what I think she's thinking

724
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,612
we should increase power
to the shields by...

725
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,113
a factor of ten.

726
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,115
That's assuming, of course,
that the shield bubble

727
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,034
doesn't ignite
and burn us all to a crisp.

728
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,577
We'll be reaching
the imploding star

729
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,328
in 13 seconds.

730
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,040
I still have time
to change course.

731
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,165
Maintain your course.

732
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,918
B'elanna,
take warp drive off-line

733
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,252
remodulate the shields

734
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,671
and get ready to emit
the anti-protons.

735
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,756
Acknowledged.

736
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,555
Entering the star's corona
in three seconds.

737
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,767
Anti-protons now, B'elanna.

738
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,243
Ah, Captain Janeway I presume.

739
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,787
You're dismissed.

740
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,164
I'm sorry to have kept
you waiting, madam.

741
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,541
Please, sit down.

742
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,251
(<i> clears throat</i> )

743
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,338
I understand you walked into
our camp alone and unarmed?

744
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,007
That's right.

745
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,258
The Continuum is a dangerous
place for all us right now

746
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,636
not to mention
a solitary human female.

747
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,721
I admire your bravery.

748
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,017
I've come with an offer
of truce from Q.

749
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:28,394
I'm afraid the time
for diplomacy is past, madam.

750
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,980
If we don't end this war quickly

751
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,108
the damage to subspace
will be... irreversible.

752
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,360
Then you agree
the fighting has to stop.

753
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,987
Most certainly.

754
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,280
That's why we intend to bring
this war to a conclusion

755
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,909
by the most expedient
means possible.

756
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:47,497
I'm relieved to hear
you say that. May I ask how?

757
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,082
Quite simple,
really.

758
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,249
Since Q is the ringleader

759
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,502
of the so-called
"Freedom Faction"

760
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:56,422
We shall have to execute him.

761
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,258
With all due respect, sir,

762
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,137
there are no chapters in
the history of my own people

763
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,849
more tragic than wars which
set neighbor against neighbor.

764
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,476
Q has an idea
for a non-violent way

765
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,646
to bring this conflict
to an end.

766
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,482
I urge you to listen
to what he has to say.

767
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,986
We're already resolved, madam.
I'd be greatly in your debt

768
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,155
if you'd tell me
where we can find him.

769
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,948
I won't do that.

770
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,117
No, I didn't think you would.

771
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,789
Fortunately we won't be
needing your assistance.

772
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,751
I told you, he's willing
to negotiate, let him go.

773
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,753
She's right.
I've had a change of heart.

774
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,254
Grovel all you want, Q.

775
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,216
I've been waiting for this
moment for an eternity.

776
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,717
Put them both in chains.

777
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,428
Wait. What are you
charging me with?

778
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,013
Collaborating
with the enemy,

779
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,347
which, in the Continuum,

780
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,349
is a crime punishable....

781
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,851
by death.

782
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,460
JANEWAY:
Why won't you listen to me?

783
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,920
I told your commander
last night

784
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,883
we can resolve
this situation peacefully.

785
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,010
If it's any consolation, there
are those in the Continuum

786
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,096
who will remember us
as martyrs.

787
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,056
I'd rather skip
that particular honor.

788
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,017
Oh...

789
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,895
Still, you have to admit
there's something romantic

790
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,981
about going
to our deaths together.

791
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,154
Do you have any last words?

792
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,989
I won't plead for my own life.

793
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,242
From your perspective,
I know it seems insignificant,

794
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,660
but what is not insignificant

795
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,955
is the fact that the Q
as an omnipotent race

796
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:55,000
have an opportunity
to be a positive force

797
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,168
to set a higher standard

798
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,586
for other beings
in the galaxy.

799
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,755
I implore you all,
don't go through with this.

800
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,007
Don't allow yourselves

801
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,425
to continue using violence
to resolve

802
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,179
your differences.

803
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,181
Q, do you have anything to add?

804
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,479
Today, I sacrifice my existence
for the principles

805
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:23,236
of freedom and individuality
that I have fought for so long.

806
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:26,698
But this woman is innocent.

807
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,492
What's more she saved my life,

808
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,786
and she tried to save us
from each other.

809
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,454
Kill me if you must...

810
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,584
but let her go.

811
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,837
COLONEL Q:
It's a very touching speech, Q.

812
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,756
But as usual, your rhetoric
fails to compensate

813
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,177
for your irresponsibility.

814
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,069
Ready.

815
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,324
Aim.

816
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,665
I'm sorry.

817
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,126
I know.

818
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,378
COLONEL Q:
Fire!

819
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,921
(<i> groans</i> )

820
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,505
(<i> moaning</i> ): I'm hit.

821
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,549
I'm dying.

822
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,680
Q.
What?

823
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,681
They're not firing at us.

824
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,766
They're not?

825
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,032
CHAKOTAY:
Harry, get the captain.

826
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,511
Captain, are you all right?
I'm fine.

827
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,555
Oh, darling, I knew
you'd come for me.

828
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,974
Aren't you going
to untie me?

829
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,600
How do I know
you won't run off

830
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,019
with the next bi-pedal female
that catches your eye?

831
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,188
Well, it just so happens
I have a proposal

832
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,441
which will reassure
you of my devotion.

833
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,900
Hmm!

834
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,283
Put down the gun!

835
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,045
Think of it, Q.

836
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,256
We'd be visionaries,
innovators

837
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,383
the parents of peace.

838
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,593
That does have
a ring to it.

839
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,680
PARIS:
Captain, what should
I do with him?

840
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,099
Q and I have a plan to end
the war. Call off your troops.

841
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,601
Do as she says,
and I'll call my people off.

842
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:06,483
They may be humanoids,
but they're using our weapons.

843
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,734
Cease fire! Cease fire!

844
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,736
Tell our people
to stop shooting.

845
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,737
Hold your fire!

846
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,572
Put down your weapons.

847
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,283
So, darling, have you
given any thought

848
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,285
as to how we
might accomplish

849
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,162
this historic act
of procreation?

850
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,372
I've thought
of nothing else

851
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,664
since you suggested it.

852
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,666
(<i> whispering</i> )

853
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,709
Oh.

854
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,544
Oh. Oh.

855
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,296
(<i> laughing</i> )

856
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,340
I love it when
you talk dirty.

857
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,883
Why don't I give you two
some privacy?

858
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:32,884
Oh, Kathy.

859
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,511
Don't you
like to watch?

860
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,980
Oh!
Mm!

861
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,606
(<i> both sigh</i> )

862
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,775
I was good,
wasn't I?

863
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,651
Very good.

864
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,070
(<i> chuckles</i> )

865
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,572
That was it?

866
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,698
You had your chance.

867
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,450
Don't go crying
about it now.

868
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,835
Lieutenant Paris,
what's our position?

869
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,798
We're back
on our original course.

870
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,551
All crew are present
and accounted for.

871
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:19,013
Ensign Kim,
any sign of supernovas?

872
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:23,268
No, ma'am.
Nothing but calm space ahead.

873
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,020
Looks like
the war's over.

874
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,400
Mr. Chakotay, run a series
of standard diagnostics.

875
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,861
If everything checks out,
take us to warp six.

876
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,904
Aye, Captain.

877
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,364
I'll be in my ready room.

878
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,536
(<i> Q babbling playfully</i> )

879
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,204
(<i> gasps</i> )

880
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,663
Q!

881
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,292
He's got my cheekbones,
don't you think?

882
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,626
He's adorable.

883
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,840
I'd say fatherhood
agrees with you.

884
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,510
Well, I'll admit,
I... I look at the universe

885
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,845
in an entirely
different way now.

886
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,680
I mean, I can't go around

887
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,726
causing temporal anomalies
or subspace inversions

888
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,605
without considering the impact
it'll have on my son.

889
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:12,150
I'm glad to hear you intend
to set a good example.

890
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,403
By the way, did I tell
you how smart he is?

891
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,529
I've already taught him how to

892
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,947
knock small planets
out of orbit.

893
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,574
And I thought
you were going to teach him

894
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,327
about love and conscience.

895
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,620
Oh!

896
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,704
That's why we want
Aunty Kathy

897
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,833
to be the godmother now,
don't we?

898
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,295
I'm... honored.

899
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,089
Yeah, well, wait until
we ask you to baby-sit.

900
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,882
You can't leave
the little guy alone

901
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,344
for a nanosecond.

902
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:43,348
Well... it's time to be going.

903
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:48,144
The old ball and chain really
hates it when we're late.

904
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,646
Say bye-bye.

905
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,858
Bye-bye.
