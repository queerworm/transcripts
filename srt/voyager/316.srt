JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50537.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,883
<i>Routine scans</i>
<i>of an uninhabited star system</i>

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,260
<i>have revealed the presence</i>
<i>of gallicite,</i>

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,180
<i>a very rare substance,</i>
<i>on the fourth planet.</i>

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,390
If these readings are right,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,393
we're looking at a yield
of nearly a kiloton.

7
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,854
That would be enough gallicite

8
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,939
to completely refit
the warp coils.

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,149
They sure could use it
with all the damage

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,901
they've taken
the past two years.

11
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,194
Is there anyone in the area

12
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,863
who might consider this
their property?

13
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,072
There are indications
that a colony once existed

14
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,449
on the planet's surface.

15
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,910
However, it appears
to be long abandoned.

16
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,454
All right,
let's stake a claim.

17
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,414
I'll leave this
in your hands, B'Elanna.

18
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,667
Use whatever resources
and personnel you need.

19
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,251
You might want to talk
to Mr. Neelix.

20
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,713
I believe he spent some time
working in a mining colony.

21
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,589
Aye, Captain.

22
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,050
TORRES:
These tunnels are
clearly artificial.

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,678
Someone else must've
been interested

24
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,221
in digging up
this gallicite.

25
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,306
That should make it easier
to access the deposits.

26
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,933
True, but we have
to be careful.

27
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,019
There's been a lot of
seismic activity down there.

28
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,103
Look, these tunnels
are completely collapsed.

29
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,148
We should bring Tom Paris
on the away team.

30
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,776
He's had quite a lot
of rock-climbing experience.

31
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,612
I have spent several summers
exploring the Osana caverns,

32
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,823
which involved
some quite treacherous climbing.

33
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,200
Great. You two can be
our safety experts.

34
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,415
Have we completed
our preparations

35
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,750
to your satisfaction?

36
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,002
We're done here, yes.

37
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,921
Let me take
this opportunity

38
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,797
to declare<i> Koon-ut so'lik,</i>

39
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,466
my desire to
become your mate.

40
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,510
What?

41
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,846
In human terms, I am...

42
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,723
proposing marriage.

43
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,098
Do you accept?

44
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,894
Uh, this is a-a little sudden...

45
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,854
isn't it?

46
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,982
Besides, I thought that
Vulcan marriages were arranged.

47
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,859
Don't you already have somebody
back home?

48
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,653
She has sufficient reason
to consider me lost,

49
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,031
and has most likely chosen
another mate.

50
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,366
It's appropriate for me
to do the same.

51
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,827
And you've chosen me.

52
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,161
I've come to greatly admire,

53
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,122
not only your impressive
technical skills,

54
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,207
but also your bravery
and sense of moral duty.

55
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,086
All excellent qualities
in a prospective mate.

56
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:11,048
But you're a Vulcan.
I am... half-Klingon.

57
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,967
I really can't imagine...

58
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,761
Perhaps we are not
an obvious match.

59
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,138
However our differences
would complement each other.

60
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,848
You've often expressed
frustration

61
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,433
with your Klingon temper.

62
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,518
My mental discipline
would help you control it.

63
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,520
Furthermore, I feel that--
Wait, please.

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,397
Please. Um...

65
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,484
I see that you've given this
a lot of, um, logical thought,

66
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,904
and, uh, I really am
very flattered...

67
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,239
but my answer is no.

68
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,618
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,122
B'Elanna...

70
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,957
you may wish to reconsider.

71
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,001
Your choices for a mate
are currently limited

72
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,877
to 73 male crew members
on this ship,

73
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,629
some of whom are
already unavailable.

74
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,132
I'll worry about my
choices myself, thank you.

75
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,425
I should also remind you
that many humanoid species

76
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,636
are unable to withstand
Klingon mating practices.

77
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,554
Okay, that's enough.
Whereas, my superior

78
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,849
Vulcan strength would make me
a very suitable partner.

79
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,558
( gasps )

80
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,904
( sighs )

81
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,851
Here are the results
of his cortical scan.

82
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,686
So, what's wrong with him?

83
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,648
In addition to
a dislocated jaw,

84
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,650
Ensign Vorik seems
to be suffering

85
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,652
from a neurochemical
imbalance.

86
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,904
Meaning... what?

87
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,908
I believe I should
discuss that

88
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,827
with the patient
privately.

89
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,711
You're going through
the<i> Pon farr,</i> aren't you?

90
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,508
That's an extremely...

91
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,302
personal question, Doctor.

92
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,053
Yes, I'm aware
that Vulcans prefer

93
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,140
to keep their mating practices
very much to themselves.

94
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,184
There's almost nothing
in the medical database

95
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,769
beyond a few observations
made by Starfleet doctors

96
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,396
over the years.
Your symptoms--

97
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,774
the chemical imbalance and
loss of emotional control--

98
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,985
are consistent
with those observations.

99
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,321
Have you been eating
and sleeping normally?

100
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,114
I knew there was
something wrong.

101
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,616
I was hoping it wasn't...

102
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,826
this.

103
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,705
I assume this is
your first<i> Pon farr?</i>

104
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,832
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

105
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,834
It's a normal
biological function.

106
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,585
I'll do what I can
to help you through it,

107
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,546
but I'll need
a little more information.

108
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,674
We do not discuss it.

109
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,301
I'm afraid you'll have to.

110
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,594
You have a severe imbalance
in your brain chemistry.

111
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,097
If it gets much worse, it could
become life-threatening.

112
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,517
Now I need to know how Vulcans
deal with this condition.

113
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,694
We...

114
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,072
go home.

115
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,699
Every seven years
of our adult life,

116
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,286
Vulcans experience
an instinctual...

117
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,789
irresistible urge to
return to the homeworld

118
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,710
and... take a mate.

119
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,588
But in your case,
being stranded

120
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,507
halfway across the galaxy,
that's impossible.

121
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,884
Yes.

122
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,053
So, then, logically,
you try to find a mate here.

123
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,804
I assume that explains
your behavior

124
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,431
toward Lieutenant Torres.

125
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,767
I have always had great
respect for B'Elanna.

126
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,894
I hope she isn't too...

127
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,478
upset with me.

128
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,358
With Lieutenant Torres,
"upset" is a relative term.

129
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,318
In any case, we're going
to have to try to find

130
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,946
another way to treat
your condition.

131
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,906
Let's start with
a micro-cellular scan.

132
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,075
No!

133
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,786
I don't want medical treatment.

134
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,746
I will resolve this myself.

135
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,082
How do you intend to do that?

136
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,960
There are certain
meditative techniques.

137
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,921
I will be fine
if simply left alone.

138
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,214
Please...

139
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,799
allow me to return
to my quarters.

140
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,217
Confine me there if you wish,

141
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,971
but allow me to resolve
my situation privately.

142
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,559
Until I have a better idea

143
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,561
of how to treat
your condition...

144
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,106
I'll release you
to your quarters.

145
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,025
You'll be under confinement

146
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:08,780
and wearing a cortical
monitor at all times.

147
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,661
Thank you.

148
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,504
I'm concerned about Ensign
Vorik's cortical readings.

149
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,131
One returns to normal levels.

150
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,466
Then another one spikes.

151
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,883
It's chaotic,
as if the brain's

152
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,470
regulatory system
had simply shut down.

153
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,721
I can't tell if he's
making any progress

154
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,515
with these meditations.

155
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,518
I thought you could suggest
other possible treatments.

156
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,936
I cannot.

157
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,313
Is that because you don't know

158
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,064
or because you don't
want to discuss it?

159
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,858
For both of those reasons,

160
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,567
there is little help
that I can offer.

161
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,820
It is inappropriate for me
to involve myself

162
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,697
in Ensign Vorik's
personal situation.

163
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,408
For such an intellectually
enlightened race,

164
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,245
Vulcans have a remarkably
Victorian attitude about sex.

165
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,747
That is a very human
judgment, Doctor.

166
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,416
Then here's a Vulcan one.

167
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,419
I fail to see the logic
in perpetuating ignorance

168
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,214
about a basic
biological function.

169
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,591
There is nothing logical
about the<i> Pon farr.</i>

170
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,844
It is a time when
instinct and emotion

171
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,679
dominate over reason.

172
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,224
It cannot be analyzed
by the rational mind

173
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,934
nor cured by
conventional medicine.

174
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,436
Anyone who has
experienced it

175
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,397
understands that it
must simply be followed

176
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,939
to its natural
resolution.

177
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,317
Which is what, exactly?

178
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,113
There are three options
that I am aware of:

179
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,616
taking a mate, which Ensign
Vorik has already attempted;

180
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,661
the ritual combat,
which does not apply

181
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,456
to his situation.
Combat?

182
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,624
An ancient tradition
of fighting for one's mate--

183
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:47,003
which, as I have said,
is not relevant here.

184
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,090
The third alternative
is the intensive meditation

185
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,758
he has chosen to try.

186
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,386
Isn't there anything we can do
to help him with that?

187
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,221
I believe that any interference

188
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,598
would be unwelcome
and counterproductive.

189
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,518
You must allow him to face
this challenge privately.

190
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,478
If he possesses
enough discipline

191
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,273
to reach a point
of psychological resolution,

192
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,733
then his chemical imbalance
should correct itself.

193
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,487
The Vulcan brain
never ceases to amaze me.

194
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,533
Thank you, Lieutenant.
You've been a great help.

195
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,208
Ah, you two are awfully prompt.

196
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,543
Impressed?

197
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,086
Oh, it'll take
a little more work

198
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,879
than that to impress me,
Lieutenant.

199
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,839
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,428
All right. Let me show you
our target area.

201
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,388
Shouldn't we wait
for Ensign Vorik?

202
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,014
He's not coming.

203
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,933
This seems to be the most
accessible vein of gallicite.

204
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,227
We'll beam to the surface, then
go down through this passageway

205
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,354
until it dead-ends
in this chamber.

206
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,940
Then we'll descend almost
50 meters, almost straight down.

207
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,234
Do you see any problem
with that, Tom?

208
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,361
Um... well, as long as

209
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,614
we go slow and easy,
we'll be fine.

210
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,031
Good. You're all set, Neelix?

211
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,783
I've got a laser drill,
sample cases,

212
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,453
geo-spectral analysis kit--
In other words, you're ready.

213
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,204
Let's go.

214
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,468
This way.

215
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,178
Look over here.

216
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,474
This must have been
the colony.

217
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,560
Not more than 50
or 60 years ago.

218
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,562
Hardly enough time
for these structures

219
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,356
to decay so badly.

220
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,983
They must have suffered
some kind of disaster.

221
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,901
Maybe an earthquake.
Well, we'll send down

222
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,778
an archaeological team later on.
Right now,

223
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,281
we've got our own work to do.
Are we in a rush?

224
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,450
I just don't see any
point in wasting time.

225
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,411
Unless, of course,
you want to stall,

226
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:47,706
to put off demonstrating
your climbing expertise.

227
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,835
Grab your gear
and try to keep up.

228
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,219
( grunts )

229
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,269
No matter how real
a holodeck program may seem,

230
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,104
it just doesn't get
your heart pumping

231
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,772
like a genuine
physical challenge.

232
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,483
It's exhilarating.

233
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,239
If you're looking
for exhilaration...

234
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,076
NEELIX:
It didn't look
quite so steep

235
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,869
on the sensor map,
did it?

236
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,663
We're prepared for this.

237
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,039
We can handle it.

238
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,708
Let's go.

239
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,297
All this Starfleet
technology

240
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,756
almost takes
the fun out of it.

241
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,342
If you mean the fun
of wondering

242
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,094
whether your anchor
will hold

243
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,096
while you're dangling
over a cliff,

244
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,889
I think I'll pass.

245
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,974
See you below.

246
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,818
TORRES:
You go first.
I'll follow you.

247
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,625
( grunts )

248
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,168
Watch your footing!

249
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,921
You're right.
My heart is pumping faster.

250
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,633
Wait till we climb back up
with a pack full of gallicite.

251
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,552
Oh, I'm just
getting warmed up.

252
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,140
( screaming )

253
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,351
No!

254
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,315
( grunting )

255
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,609
( coughing )

256
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,201
Are you hurt?

257
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,037
You, you almost
got us both killed!

258
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,665
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,082
I don't know what happened.

260
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,501
( yells )

261
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,085
PARIS:
Careful, careful.

262
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,545
You might have broken it.

263
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,465
You had no business
rigging safety equipment

264
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,717
when you had no idea
what you were doing!

265
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,261
Calm down.
This wasn't Neelix's fault.

266
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,722
I saw him drive the piton,
and it was solid.

267
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,391
It must have malfunctioned.
You are hurt.

268
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,059
I'm fine.
No thanks to you two.

269
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,145
I would have been better
coming down here alone.

270
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,272
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little bit?

271
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,025
Just drag him to the ship. I'll
get the gallicite myself.

272
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,901
We can't leave you
down here alone.

273
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,362
PARIS:
He's right.

274
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,238
Let's contact the ship.

275
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,032
You get your hands
off of me.

276
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,034
( growls )
( yells )

277
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,661
B'Elanna!

278
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,330
What is wrong with you?

279
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,290
Nothing.

280
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,584
I'm in charge of this mission.

281
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,170
I'll finish it.

282
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,589
Wait.

283
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,341
NEELIX:
Go ahead, Tom.

284
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,176
I'll be all right here.

285
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,763
The last thing we need

286
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,682
is for all three of us
to split up.

287
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,600
Paris to<i> Voyager.</i>

288
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,770
We've got problems down here.

289
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,316
I haven't been able
to contact her.

290
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,360
She's either
out of communications range

291
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,571
<i>or just not responding.</i> 
Where is she now?

292
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,449
The last location I can verify
is about ten meters below us.

293
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,577
I tried to stop her
from leaving, Captain,

294
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:15,248
but she got very hostile
and... bit me.

295
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,041
She bit you?

296
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,252
<i>And she seemed</i>
<i>to be enjoying it</i>

297
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,045
<i>in a Klingon kind of way.</i>

298
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,714
<i>She's really not herself.</i>

299
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,931
Any luck in getting
a transporter lock on them?

300
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,267
No. They're too far
beneath the surface.

301
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,143
Tom, I'm sending an away team
down to you.

302
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,396
We'll get Neelix out of there,
then go after B'Elanna.

303
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,980
Tuvok,
you're with Chakotay.

304
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,609
Captain, I'd like to request
a short delay.

305
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:47,196
I may have an explanation
for Lieutenant Torres' behavior.

306
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,031
( door chimes )

307
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,744
Go away.

308
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,039
I said... go away!

309
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,376
I'm sorry, sir.

310
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:05,214
No. I must apologize
for the intrusion,

311
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,801
particularly at this time.

312
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,552
Then you know.

313
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,512
Yes. I regret

314
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,181
that I must ask you some
uncomfortable questions

315
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,850
regarding
Lieutenant Torres.

316
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,228
Yes, sir.

317
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,107
It is important for me
to know specifically

318
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,777
what happened between
the two of you.

319
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,362
Was there any
physical contact?

320
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,865
Yes.

321
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,993
Please describe your actions.

322
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,414
It's... hard to remember.

323
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,751
I was acting irrationally.

324
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:45,630
I believe... I approached her.

325
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,013
I...

326
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,807
I touched her face.

327
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,767
I meant
to be gentle,

328
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,644
but she tried to move away

329
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,730
and then I was
holding her more tightly,

330
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,775
both hands on her face,
like this.

331
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,779
It felt very important
not to let go.

332
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,950
I'm... I'm not certain why.

333
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,078
I believe you were initiating
a telepathic mating bond.

334
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,833
I... didn't know
it could happen that way.

335
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:28,506
I wanted to bond with her.
That much I remember clearly.

336
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,174
Apparently, you succeeded.

337
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,093
Lieutenant Torres has been
displaying unusual behavior,

338
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,890
very much like
the early stages of<i> Pon farr.</i>

339
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,519
How is that possible?

340
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,855
She's not Vulcan.

341
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,398
There have
been instances

342
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,817
of Vulcans mating
with members of other races.

343
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,446
But she rejected me,
forcefully.

344
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,114
Even a brief moment of bonding

345
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,450
may have been enough
to disrupt her self-control,

346
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,579
as the<i> Pon farr</i> does in us.

347
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,041
In a half-Klingon, the effects
may be even more extreme.

348
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,501
I have to go to her.

349
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,461
You cannot.

350
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,214
Lieutenant Torres
is out of contact on the planet.

351
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,050
Then I'll find her.

352
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,427
B'Elanna needs me,
and I need her.

353
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,554
It is a far more
sensible strategy

354
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,639
to get her safely
back to<i> Voyager,</i>

355
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,892
and then decide on
the proper resolution.

356
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,269
The resolution must be
that we become mates.

357
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,063
It is only logical.

358
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:29,609
Lieutenant Torres has never been
a great follower of logic.

359
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,820
You think she'll
reject me again?

360
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,655
It might be wise

361
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,867
to continue your
meditative efforts.

362
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,664
I'll do my best, sir.

363
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,050
It is difficult to estimate
how soon her condition

364
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,384
will become life-threatening.

365
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,344
Life-threatening?
She could die from this?

366
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,888
Yes.

367
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,222
And you've
gone through it

368
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,058
every seven years
of your adult life?

369
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,726
You only need
to be concerned

370
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,104
with Lieutenant Torres'
situation.

371
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,397
Right.

372
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,025
Well, it looks like
finding her won't be easy.

373
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,444
Scanning range is limited
to about 20 meters,

374
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,446
and even that's
not too reliable.

375
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,239
You said she was
going after the gallicite,

376
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,408
so we'll do the same,
and hope it leads us to her.

377
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,744
NEELIX:
I'm ready to go, Commander.

378
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,013
Let's go.

379
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,812
( grunts )

380
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,859
( yells )

381
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,848
( grunting )

382
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,861
( clattering )

383
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,324
B'Elanna.

384
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,410
Tom.

385
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,079
Come here, you've
got to see this.

386
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,914
TUVOK:
How are you feeling,
Lieutenant?

387
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,457
Fine. This is
an active power system.

388
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,251
It must have been built
by the colonists.

389
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,545
We'll send somebody down here
to study it more closely.

390
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,505
Right now, we've got to get you
back to the ship.

391
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,592
No. No. This is my discovery.
It's my mission.

392
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,427
You don't understand.

393
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,138
This is the source
of the gallicite readings.

394
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,306
These conduits are covered
with gallicite plating.

395
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,226
It's exactly what we need,
and I found it.

396
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,936
Yes, Lieutenant.

397
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,604
You've succeeded
in your mission.

398
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,647
Now you must tend to yourself.

399
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,525
You're experiencing
a condition known as<i> Pon farr.</i>

400
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,820
<i>Pon</i> what?

401
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,739
Your emotional balance
has been disrupted.

402
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:26,244
You may not be in control of
your more aggressive instincts.

403
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,914
I lost my temper for a minute.
That's all.

404
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,420
Why are you all
staring at me like that?

405
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,132
TUVOK:
Please, come back
with us to the ship.

406
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,800
Just leave me alone.

407
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,320
Who are you? What do you want?

408
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,738
My name is Chakotay.

409
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,991
I assure you we have
no hostile intent.

410
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,493
She does.
B'Elanna, please.

411
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,453
She is suffering
from a chemical imbalance

412
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,122
which is affecting her behavior.

413
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,666
An imbalance?
Is it contagious?

414
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,003
No. However, she does
need our assistance.

415
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,630
We'd be glad to take her
and leave your territory.

416
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,966
Not before you tell me
why you came here.

417
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,676
We only came to find
some gallicite.

418
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,262
We thought this planet
was uninhabited.

419
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,139
Then why are you
carrying weapons?

420
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,932
It's standard procedure
for any mission

421
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,391
into unfamiliar territory.

422
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,229
Let me see one.

423
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,324
And what is that?

424
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,575
Some sort
of scanning device?

425
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,368
Yes. It's called
a tricorder.

426
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,331
But it didn't detect
any life-forms here?

427
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,790
No, it didn't.

428
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,504
( beeping )

429
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,674
What's that?
Seismic alert.

430
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,634
That wall is unstable.

431
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,553
Be careful.

432
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,682
( rumbling )

433
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,352
Watch out.

434
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,853
( grunts )

435
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,071
B'Elanna, don't!

436
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,996
PARIS:
B'Elanna!

437
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,814
There must be
a hidden door,

438
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,566
some kind
of a passageway.

439
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,404
I'm not picking up anything
like that...

440
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,155
or any life signs.

441
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,074
Then you're
using it wrong.

442
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,952
Yeah, that must be it...

443
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,870
or else these aliens
are generating

444
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,623
some kind of interference
so we can't detect them.

445
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,920
We have to get out of here
before they come back.

446
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,463
We can't leave
Chakotay and Tuvok.

447
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,301
If you have any ideas how
to find them, I'm listening.

448
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,720
( panting )

449
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,476
We have to get
back to the ship

450
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,271
and get some help...

451
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,106
for them and for you.

452
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,442
Why does everybody
keep saying

453
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,360
there's something wrong
with me?

454
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:52,616
I'll try to explain it to you,
but we've got to get moving.

455
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,712
There. Your serotonin levels
are stabilized for the moment,

456
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,506
but I'm concerned
about these fluctuations.

457
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,968
It's becoming more difficult
to compensate.

458
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,471
I will increase
my efforts...

459
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,264
to control them, Doctor.

460
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,475
I'd like you to consider
an alternative treatment

461
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,642
I've been developing.

462
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,727
No, I will deal
with this myself.

463
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,022
Ensign, your
life is at risk.

464
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,191
You don't understand.

465
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,026
How well a Vulcan copes

466
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,528
with this experience is
a test of his character.

467
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,949
I've already humiliated
myself and Lieutenant Tuvok

468
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,703
by allowing a private matter
to become so...

469
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,622
public.

470
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,042
Give yourself
a little credit.

471
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,626
You're doing
the best you can

472
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,004
under unusually
difficult circumstances.

473
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,672
If you were back on Vulcan,

474
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,217
you'd have your family and
friends there to help you.

475
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,760
I shouldn't need any help.

476
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,137
I know that
self-sufficiency

477
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,056
is very important
to a Vulcan,

478
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,225
but there is nothing
shameful in getting

479
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,019
a little guidance
every once in a while.

480
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,022
I'd like you to consider
my alternative,

481
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,859
and then you can decide
whether or not to try it.

482
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,906
DOCTOR:
Ensign.

483
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,453
I don't understand
the purpose of coming here.

484
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,705
Trust me. Ensign Vorik,

485
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,917
I'd like you to meet T'Pera.

486
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,502
Surely you're
not suggesting

487
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,795
that she become my mate.

488
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:33,050
Well, I wouldn't recommend
a lifetime commitment, but...

489
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,468
she might be
able to help you

490
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,887
with your
immediate problem.

491
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,518
She's a hologram.

492
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,977
She isn't real.

493
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,730
Then I assume you have
the same low regard for me.

494
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,566
You're a skilled
physician, Doctor,

495
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,317
but let me point out
the limitations

496
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,653
to your own experience
with physical matters.

497
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,114
I believe
we're discussing

498
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,450
your sexual difficulties
at the moment, Ensign.

499
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,742
And this
holographic mate

500
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,286
is the best solution
I can think of.

501
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,662
She won't be the same
as a real mate.

502
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,374
The difference is
all in your mind,

503
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,876
which, if I've understood you
and Mr. Tuvok correctly,

504
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,088
is where the<i> Pon farr</i>
must ultimately be resolved.

505
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:15,675
Let your mind
convince your body that she...

506
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,929
is exactly what you
need her to be.

507
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,433
Think of this as an advanced
self-healing technique.

508
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,184
It will still require
considerable

509
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,520
mental discipline
on your part.

510
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,068
There is a certain logic
to your suggestion, Doctor.

511
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,112
I will try.

512
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,114
Good.

513
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,454
Well, then, I'll leave
the two of you alone.

514
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,588
Tuvok must be wrong
about this<i> Pon farr</i> business.

515
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,964
It doesn't make any sense.

516
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,882
It does explain how
you've been acting.

517
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,010
I don't see
what's so strange.

518
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,595
How about
starting a fight

519
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,971
with a group
of armed aliens?

520
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,390
Shouting at Neelix?
Giving me this?

521
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,892
If I remember
my Klingon customs,

522
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,894
biting someone
on the face means...

523
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,730
I know what it means.

524
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,817
( angry grunt )

525
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,152
( panting )

526
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,862
All right.

527
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,780
So, maybe I do feel...

528
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,074
something, some kind of...

529
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,202
instinct.

530
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,163
What am I supposed
to do about it?

531
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,378
When we get back to the ship,

532
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,630
the Doctor should
be able to help.

533
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,465
Or there's always Vorik.

534
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,219
I am not helping
that Vulcan<i> pahtk.</i>

535
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,472
The idea of bonding
with him...

536
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,765
it's ludicrous.

537
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,481
What's this?

538
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,068
The tremor must have
shaken the rocks loose.

539
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,487
Well, they're in the way.
No, hold it.

540
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,239
We don't know how
stable this tunnel is.

541
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,948
An energy blast
might bring the rest of it

542
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,992
down on our heads.
Let go!

543
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,578
No.

544
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:08,080
I think I should
keep this.

545
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,585
Never pick a fight
with a Klingon, Tom.

546
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,378
I'm not going to fight
with you, B'Elanna.

547
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,880
Afraid I'll break your arm?
You should be.

548
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,552
B'Elanna, stop it!
This isn't about the gun.

549
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,637
This is about sex.

550
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,932
But that's not going
to happen right now.

551
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,102
I think it is.

552
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,312
See, I've picked up
your scent, Tom.

553
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,273
I've tasted your blood.

554
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,192
No.

555
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,112
No. I'm your friend,

556
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,488
and I have to
watch out for you

557
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,115
when your judgment's
been impaired.

558
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,117
If you let these instincts
take over now,

559
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:50,080
you'll hate yourself and me too
for taking advantage of you.

560
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,626
I won't do that.

561
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,295
( panting )

562
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,677
Maybe...

563
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,805
maybe we should
continue separately.

564
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,892
No.
You don't know how strong...

565
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,563
how hard it is to fight this...

566
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,440
urge.

567
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,859
Are you telling me
that I'm impossible to resist?

568
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,821
I wouldn't go that far.

569
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,531
Good.

570
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,201
Come on.

571
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,133
I want to know about the vessel
which brought you here.

572
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,677
Your propulsion systems,

573
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:47,680
weapons, sensors,
everything.

574
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,723
( instrument beeping )

575
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,601
You have an artificial implant
in your arm.

576
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,771
Yes. It was necessary
to replace the elbow joint

577
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,692
after I was injured
in a combat simulation.

578
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,361
I also want to know
about your medical technology.

579
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,196
Scientific advances,

580
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,239
artificial
intelligence...

581
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,991
I'd be glad to tell you
all about my people

582
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,743
and learn about yours.
There's no need

583
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,161
to hold us
here for interrogation.

584
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,079
You should expect
no better treatment

585
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,748
after invading Sakari territory.

586
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,710
As I said, we didn't know
there was anyone down here.

587
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,545
Yes... so you've said.

588
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,380
TUVOK:
Your people have
clearly made

589
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,507
every effort to avoid
detection by outsiders.

590
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,883
Is it so difficult
to believe

591
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,844
that those measures were
effective in our case?

592
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,887
If they had been fully
effective, you wouldn't

593
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,390
have found anything interesting
enough to bring you here.

594
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,099
That's something
we can help you with.

595
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,810
What?

596
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,812
We can show you
how we detected the gallicite,

597
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,647
so you can disguise it better.

598
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,106
We can also help you eliminate

599
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,234
the last traces
of the ruins on the surface,

600
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,236
so no one else
will be curious about them.

601
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,613
You've seen the ruins?
Yes.

602
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,532
I assume the Sakari
once lived there.

603
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:52,202
Long ago...
before I was born.

604
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,704
What happened?

605
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,665
My people never even knew
who the invaders were

606
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,166
or why they attacked.

607
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,043
It was all over
in less than an hour.

608
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,462
Some of the colonists
were fortunate enough

609
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,423
to escape into the mines.

610
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:08,886
We've lived here ever
since, where it's safe.

611
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,221
If the invaders ever learned
of our existence here,

612
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,556
they might return.

613
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,767
I can certainly understand
your caution,

614
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,393
but let us demonstrate
our good faith

615
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,186
by helping you
protect yourselves.

616
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,273
Then we'll go
and never bother you again.

617
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,614
Agreed.

618
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,408
But you will be supervised
at all times.

619
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,201
( beeping )

620
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,620
( deep rumbling )

621
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,373
( both panting )

622
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,125
We're almost to
the next passageway.

623
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,503
Can you make it?
Not much choice.

624
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,092
( both grunting )

625
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,017
( both coughing )

626
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,608
It's all right.

627
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,652
We'll find a way out.

628
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,279
We should use that weapon. It's
worth the risk now.

629
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,990
Well, I might agree with you
if I still had it.

630
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,159
It's buried somewhere
under all that.

631
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,954
What?!
Sorry.

632
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,123
( gasping )

633
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,667
Try to stay calm.

634
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,335
I know it's hard.

635
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,962
You don't know anything!

636
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,046
I feel like I'm crawling
out of my skin!

637
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,633
I need to do something.
I can't take this!

638
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:33,011
( panting and gasping)

639
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,644
( laughing )

640
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,438
You've never been hard
to get, Tom.

641
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,774
Well, I'm making
an exception.

642
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,442
I can't let
you do this.

643
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,529
Oh?
Oh, but you wish you could.

644
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,198
All those invitations
to dinner...

645
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,368
and on the holodeck,
the way you would stare at me

646
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,704
when you thought
I wasn't looking...

647
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:02,081
and get jealous
when I'm with someone else.

648
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:06,670
You can't tell me you're
not interested in me.

649
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,674
You're right.

650
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,092
I can't.

651
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:17,472
Then don't push me away.

652
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,475
Oh, believe me, I'd like to,

653
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,270
but I know
this isn't really you.

654
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,648
You've made it clear
that you're not interested,

655
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,776
and I have to accept
that's how you feel, even now.

656
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,948
No...

657
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,075
no, it isn't.

658
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,872
I was... I was just
afraid to admit it.

659
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,418
You see, I've wanted this
for so long.

660
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,342
Just let it happen.

661
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,952
I hope someday you'll say
that to me and mean it.

662
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,623
You'd let me go insane
rather than help me?!

663
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,916
You know that's not true.

664
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,669
You just...
stay away from me!

665
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,641
( insects buzzing,
birds chirping )

666
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,693
You called, Ensign?

667
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,821
Is there a... problem?

668
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,155
Not at all.

669
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,157
You seem...

670
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,576
much improved.
Yes.

671
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,080
Your holodeck therapy
was very effective.

672
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,791
I must compliment you
on an innovative solution.

673
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,043
I'm pleased to hear that.

674
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,087
This could be a
viable alternative

675
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,755
for space-faring Vulcans.

676
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:17,134
When we get back, I'm sure
Starfleet medical will...

677
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:20,386
never hear about your
personal experiences from me.

678
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,889
Thank you, Doctor.

679
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,475
May I return to duty?
Soon enough, Ensign.

680
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,853
I'll need to run
a few more cortical scans.

681
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,563
Mr. Vorik's biochemical
readings are stabilizing.

682
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,691
They're not back
to normal yet,

683
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,734
but I believe he's gotten
through the worst of it.

684
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,569
I'm ready to release him
from Sick Bay.

685
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,322
Good work, Doctor. Will this
treatment help B'Elanna as well?

686
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,532
I don't see why not.

687
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,241
As soon as the away
team gets back,

688
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,327
I'll send her to you.
I'll get to work designing

689
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,121
the half-Klingon
version of the program.

690
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,789
There's a copious
amount of information

691
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,501
in the cultural database
about their mating practices.

692
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,171
Did you know
that fracturing a clavicle

693
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,714
on the wedding night
is actually

694
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,924
considered a blessing
on the marriage?

695
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,843
As a matter of fact, I didn't.

696
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,720
I'm planning to do
a comparative study

697
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,221
of all these mating rituals.

698
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,265
It really is fascinating...

699
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,727
from a sociobiological
point of view.

700
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,438
I'm sure B'Elanna will
appreciate your efforts, Doctor.

701
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,071
( sighing )

702
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,406
TORRES:
Mm.

703
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,204
( moaning )

704
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,166
Where are we?

705
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,752
Still stuck in
the cave, I'm afraid.

706
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,628
The caves?

707
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,423
The gallicite.
Where's my tricorder?

708
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,676
No, we're not looking for
the gallicite anymore.

709
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,970
We're trying to get back
to the ship, remember?

710
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,809
No... I don't.

711
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,062
( clattering )

712
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,404
Are you two all right?

713
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,864
B'Elanna needs help.

714
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,908
We've got to get her
out of here.

715
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,882
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

716
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,551
Please respond.

717
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,720
Still nothing.

718
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,347
What's the matter?
Why aren't they answering?

719
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,600
There must be some kind
of communications problem.

720
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,144
I'm sure they'll
clear it up soon.

721
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,728
It may not be soon enough.

722
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,898
I am concerned about the rapid
progression of her symptoms.

723
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,276
You must help her now,
Mr. Paris.

724
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:43,029
If she does not resolve
the<i> Pon farr,</i>

725
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,073
she will die.

726
00:38:56,168 --> 00:39:00,588
B'Elanna, I know this is
a pretty bizarre situation.

727
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,049
Probably not what either
one of us had in mind,

728
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,677
but it's too late
to worry about that now.

729
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,179
Tom...

730
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,888
What?

731
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,389
Be quiet.

732
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,110
So, this is the part

733
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,654
where you throw
heavy objects at me?

734
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,282
Maybe later.

735
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:33,788
I'm not sure exactly
what I'm supposed to do.

736
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,541
( throaty growl )

737
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,627
( throaty growl attempt )

738
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,133
( yells )

739
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,469
( grunting )

740
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,513
Well, what are you doing?

741
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,058
Enjoying myself?

742
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,559
Then show it.

743
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,816
( both grunting and panting )

744
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,990
You are my mate, not his!

745
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,408
What are you doing here?

746
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,202
I've come to claim you,
to fulfill our bond

747
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,413
and if necessary,
to face my rival!

748
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,124
Lieutenant Tuvok!

749
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,878
Ensign.

750
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:26,716
Sir, I declare
<i>Koon-ut kal-if-fee.</i>

751
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,176
The ritual challenge.

752
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,886
He intends to fight
to win his mate.

753
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,554
If you want a fight,
you've got one.

754
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,805
Hold on, Tom.

755
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,724
There's not going to be
any challenge.

756
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,310
Are you responsible for the ship
being out of contact?

757
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,563
It was necessary
to disable the communications,

758
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,981
transporters and shuttles.

759
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,150
No one will keep me
from my mate!

760
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,611
I am not your mate!

761
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,529
We will soon decide that!

762
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,074
If anyone is going to smash your
arrogant little face in, I will!

763
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,659
I take your challenge myself!

764
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,455
She has the right to choose
her own defender, even herself.

765
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,207
CHAKOTAY: Now just hold on.

766
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,209
Neither of you are
thinking straight right now.

767
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,877
They are following
their instincts

768
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,879
and I suggest
we allow them to do so.

769
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,299
You mean, let them fight?
It is logical.

770
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:10,260
Both must resolve their
<i>Pon farr</i> before it kills them.

771
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,095
We cannot wait
to hear from<i> Voyager.</i>

772
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,679
They'll tear each
other to pieces!

773
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,432
The risk of injury
seems preferable

774
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:18,268
to the certainty of dying
from a chemical imbalance.

775
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,812
Commander, I see no alternative

776
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,315
but to follow
Vulcan tradition.

777
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,904
All right.

778
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,614
Begin.

779
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,826
( yelling )

780
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,104
It's over, isn't it?

781
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,106
The blood fever
has been purged.

782
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,192
They will both recover.

783
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:56,574
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50541.6.</i>

784
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,659
<i>We're following through</i>
<i>with Chakotay's offer</i>

785
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,496
<i>to help the Sakari</i>
<i>improve their camouflage,</i>

786
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,830
<i>and they've agreed to supply us</i>

787
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,500
<i>with a generous quantity</i>
<i>of gallicite.</i>

788
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,801
Deck 2.

789
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:23,101
So looks like
you're feeling better.

790
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,437
Hmm.
You back on duty?

791
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:26,645
Yes.
Hmm.

792
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,982
Yes, I'm fine.
Thanks.

793
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,027
The refit
is going well.

794
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,612
We should have
new warp coils

795
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,448
by the end of the week.
Oh, good.

796
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,324
Glad to hear it.

797
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,995
Computer,
halt turbolift.

798
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,498
Look, this is ridiculous.

799
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,875
We are going to be together
on this ship for a long time.

800
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,335
You're right.
We have to pretend

801
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,254
that the whole mission
didn't happen.

802
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,256
But something did happen,
B'Elanna.

803
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,967
Look, Tom, I really
appreciate what you did--

804
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,344
what you were willing
to do for me--

805
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,597
but as far as I'm concerned,
I was under the influence

806
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,266
of some weird Vulcan
chemical imbalance,

807
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:08,771
and whatever I did,
whatever I said, it wasn't me.

808
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,689
Yeah, I know.

809
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:14,611
You're afraid that
your big, scary Klingon side

810
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,446
might have been showing.

811
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,406
Well, I saw it up close,

812
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,409
and, you know,
it wasn't so terrible.

813
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:25,204
In fact, I wouldn't mind
seeing it again someday.

814
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:35,548
Computer... resume.

815
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,348
Careful what you wish for,
Lieutenant.

816
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,684
Your call sounded urgent.

817
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,978
I think there's something
you should see, Captain.

818
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,022
We found this as we were
clearing away the ruins.

819
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:55,026
Undoubtedly, one of the invaders
who destroyed this colony.

820
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,445
JANEWAY:
The Borg.
