1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,757
MALE:
<i>Citizens of Earth,</i>
<i>your destiny is in my hands.</i>

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,344
Those of you who acquiesce
to my demands

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,930
will be treated fairly.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,643
Oppose me,
and you face a dire fate indeed

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:22,063
as my slaves in the mines
of Mercury.

6
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,942
You have one hour.

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,319
You'll never get away
with this.

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,821
Oh, but I shall.

9
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:32,199
Your once-proud country
will fall to its knees.

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,786
How ironic that I am
using your rocket ship

11
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:40,081
to lead my space force
into battle.

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,792
You're wrong, Chaotica.

13
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,335
Before you came on board,

14
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,921
someone pushed
the self-destruct button.

15
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,590
In three minutes,
we'll all be dead.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,009
No!

17
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,051
( door opens )

18
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,137
The jig is up, Your Majesty.

19
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,891
Captain Proton.

20
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,310
Spaceman First Class,
Protector of Earth

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,730
Scourge of Intergalactic Evil...

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,690
at your service.

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,901
But I saw you fall
into the fiery mouth

24
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,027
of that volcano.

25
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,862
It takes more than
a little lava

26
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,238
to stop Captain Proton.

27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:15,200
Now, I want you to call off
your invasion

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,037
and give me back
my rocket ship.

29
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,914
There is one force
in this universe

30
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,290
that even<i> you</i> cannot defeat.

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,168
( screaming )

32
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,587
The same to you.

33
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,838
Doc.

34
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,506
Mr. Paris.
I should have known

35
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,050
it was you
monopolizing the holodeck.

36
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,552
Who is this
insolent fool?

37
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,638
Uh, he's one
of our men.

38
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,766
Computer, adjust the Doctor's
spectral frequency.

39
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,100
I have no interest
in your frivolous fantasy.

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,645
I'm here to rehearse a duet
from<i> Don Carlo,</i>

41
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,898
and you've already gone
three minutes into my sched--

42
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,190
Enough!

43
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,692
Robot, attack.

44
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,320
( screams )

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,655
CHAOTICA:
Destroy them.

46
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,074
Start with him.

47
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,076
Computer, freeze program.
( computer beeps )

48
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,496
Doc, this is
the final chapter--

49
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,207
"Satan's Robot
Conquers the World."

50
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,417
We can't stop now.

51
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,294
Does the phrase
"to be continued"

52
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,754
mean anything
to you?

53
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,130
Your opera can wait.

54
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,007
This program is a waste
of photonic energy.

55
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,425
Oh, really?

56
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,760
Take a look around you.

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,971
This is how the 20th century
saw the future.

58
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,513
We are studying sociology.

59
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,808
Perhaps you can teach a course
at Starfleet Academy.

60
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,684
"Satan's Robot:
An Historical Overview."

61
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,519
( scoffs )

62
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,230
( alarm blaring )

63
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,484
Bridge to Holodeck 1.

64
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,027
What's going on down there?

65
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,779
KIM:
Oh, nothing, Commander.

66
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,530
Just a little power surge.

67
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,616
Says here the hologrid
just blew out.

68
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,326
PARIS:
We're fixing it now, sir.

69
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,828
Well, make it quick.

70
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,371
The last thing we need
is a broken holodeck.

71
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,290
Seven, I want good news.

72
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,583
That's an order.

73
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,918
Then I must disobey.

74
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,962
I have no good news
to report.

75
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,132
I've completed an astrometric
scan of the entire region.

76
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,717
There are no star systems
within 2,500 light-years.

77
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,761
Nothing?
Nothing.

78
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,763
Why can't we see any
stars beyond that?

79
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,474
There are heavy concentrations
of theta radiation.

80
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,892
It has occluded our sensors.

81
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,352
Any other ships
out there?

82
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,228
None. We are alone.

83
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,148
( sighs )

84
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,441
Every sailor's nightmare.

85
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,276
SEVEN:
Commander?

86
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,904
CHAKOTAY:
It's like being becalmed
in the middle of the ocean.

87
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,196
If it weren't for sensors,

88
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,240
we wouldn't even
know we were at warp.

89
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,743
We've only been crossing
this expanse for two months

90
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,453
and we're already feeling
the strain.

91
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,080
How do we last
another two years?

92
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,749
We will adapt.

93
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,627
Easier said than done.

94
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,672
Shall I inform
the Captain of my findings?

95
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,009
No.

96
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,053
I'll tell her.

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,143
( door opens, closes )

98
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,321
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

99
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:43,218
CHAKOTAY:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 52081.2.</i>

100
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,471
<i>It's been 53 days since we</i>
<i>entered this desolate region.</i>

101
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,515
<i>If we want to continue</i>
<i>our course toward home,</i>

102
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,976
<i>we have no choice</i>
<i>but to cross it.</i>

103
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,770
<i>We won't have an opportunity to</i>
<i>take on fresh supplies or fuel,</i>

104
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,731
<i>so I've ordered all departments</i>
<i>to create an energy reserve.</i>

105
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,943
<i>We're using power cells</i>
<i>to stockpile deuterium.</i>

106
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,945
TORRES:
This won't be much
of a briefing.

107
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,530
There's nothing new
to report.

108
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,866
Humor me.

109
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,242
All right. Let's see.

110
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,452
Warp core's at
peak efficiency,

111
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,829
just like last week

112
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,747
and the week before that.

113
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,625
And my Engineering staff
is going stir-crazy.

114
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,918
Thanks.

115
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,212
Ensign?

116
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,130
Nada.

117
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,174
Can you be more specific?

118
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,591
All systems
are operating

119
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,344
within normal
parameters.

120
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,262
Anything new on sensors?

121
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,223
I detected a sudden increase
of theta radiation

122
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,557
in the vicinity.

123
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,600
Source?
Unknown.

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,894
Could be worth a look.

125
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,687
Finally, some excitement.

126
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,731
Radiation.

127
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,233
( chuckling )

128
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,693
Next piece of business.

129
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,195
Crew morale.

130
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,487
Deteriorating...

131
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,031
obviously.

132
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,366
I have a few suggestions

133
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,617
that might boost
people's spirits.

134
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,827
Please.

135
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,913
Rotate crew assignments.

136
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,957
Add variety
to the daily routine.

137
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,876
I myself wouldn't mind
squeezing in

138
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,586
a little tactical training.

139
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,588
Noted.

140
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,090
NEELIX:
And the holodecks

141
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,674
have been in high demand.

142
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,052
I was thinking...
we could install a few emitters

143
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,387
in Cargo Bay 2...

144
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,721
turn it into a third holodeck.

145
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,847
Hear, hear.

146
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,473
CHAKOTAY:
See to it, Harry.

147
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,934
One other item, sir.

148
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,854
Point of, uh, concern
among some of the crew.

149
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,606
It's--

150
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,108
Well, it's the Captain.

151
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,984
She's been a bit
elusive lately.

152
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,903
What's your point?

153
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,821
People take comfort
in talking to her.

154
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,824
When they see that the Captain's
happy, they're happy.

155
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,286
Rumor has it she never
leaves her quarters.

156
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,246
Captain's privilege.
She'll come to the Bridge

157
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,538
if and when she's needed.

158
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,957
Spare us the protocol,
Chakotay.

159
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,499
It's pretty odd,
you've got to admit it.

160
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,585
It's her choice.
She can run this ship

161
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,297
from wherever the hell
she wants to. Understood?

162
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,300
Yeah.

163
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,968
Sure.

164
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,469
( sighs )

165
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,056
We're all feeling the pressure,
including me.

166
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,809
Listen, maybe we've got
the wrong attitude.

167
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,562
Let's think of this
as a two-year vacation.

168
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,483
Dismissed.

169
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,027
That's a great idea, Harry.

170
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,196
Wow, Harry.
You're a real genius.

171
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,449
How do you come up with
these brilliant ideas?

172
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,617
You're such an optimistic guy.

173
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,747

I replicate some curtains.

Predictable.

00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,563
Hmm?

183
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,525
The Novokovich gambit. You
always use that opening move.

184
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,735
That's because you
always fall for it.

185
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,447
( sighing ):
I feel like we've played
this match a hundred times.

186
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,783
Derada is a game of subtlety.

187
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,077
Too subtle for me.

188
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,788
Hmm. I'll bet.

189
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,374
What's that supposed to mean?

190
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,461
Well, if it doesn't involve
Klingon painsticks...

191
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,422
Good night.

192
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,298
There you go.
Just when I'm winning.

193
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,841
<i>Who's</i> predictable?

194
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,552
You don't want to start a fight
with me now.

195
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,886
Not at 3 a.m.

196
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,222
Three in the morning,
4 in the afternoon...

197
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,473
what's the difference?

198
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,933
You're angry 24 hours a day.

199
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,435
Everything is
a joke to you.

200
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,770
Good evening...
Or should I say good morning?

201
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,064
I guess you couldn't
sleep, either.

202
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,775
Oh, why sleep when we're
having<i> so much fun?</i>

203
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,777
He's joking, Neelix.
We're all supposed to laugh.

204
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,446
NEELIX:
I certainly am
laughing

205
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,948
on the inside...
Smiling, anyway.

206
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,534
Let's start a new game.
Cards?

207
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,077
A little snack?

208
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,870
No. I have a better idea.

209
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,248
Why don't we make a schedule,

210
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,541
a fight rotation?

211
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,833
We can optimize
our resources.

212
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,710
I can start one,
then you can start one...

213
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,170
Please...

214
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,797
I am really tired
of these games.

215
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,467
Well, then don't play them.
( shouts ): Stop!

216
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,802
You are senior officers!

217
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,013
You are supposed to be setting
an example for the rest--

218
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,558
( gasping ):
The rest of the crew.

219
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,892
( hyperventilating )

220
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,227
Neelix?

221
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,520
I can't breathe.

222
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,022
Paris to Sick Bay.

223
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,443
Some morale officer
I turned out to be.

224
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,236
I've given you
a mild sedative.

225
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,030
It should control
the urge to hyperventilate

226
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,907
and alleviate
some of your anxiety.

227
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,534
Anxiety?

228
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,787
Anxiety's what I feel
when I burn a pot roast.

229
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,624
This... This is more like...

230
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,209
Dizziness? Nausea?
Unspeakable dread?

231
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,544
Yes.

232
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,588
Nihiliphobia,
the fear of nothingness,

233
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,965
or in layman's terms,
the fear of...

234
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,550
nothingness.

235
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,512
If it's any consolation,
I can relate to it.

236
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,764
I go into a void every time
I'm deactivated...

237
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,891
emptiness, complete
and utter oblivion.

238
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,561
I'll admit, it was
unsettling at first...

239
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,188
The existential horror
of it all...

240
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,482
You're not helping,
Doctor.

241
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,442
Sorry.

242
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,403
My point is,
you'll get used to it.

243
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,988
I hope so.

244
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,866
( door opens )

245
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,159
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

246
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,701
( door opens )

247
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,162
SEVEN:
Commander...

248
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,080
am I disturbing you?

249
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,042
No.

250
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,878
Is the Astrometrics Lab
designated for recreational use?

251
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,754
I come here to meditate.

252
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,090
Needless to say,
the view from my quarters

253
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,260
has been less
than stellar lately.

254
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,720
Astronomical phenomena
help you to focus your mind.

255
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,685
Yes. I imagine that each star
represents a single thought.

256
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,522
Meditation...
it rejuvenates you?

257
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,772
Indeed it does.

258
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,900
I suggest you try
Borg regeneration.

259
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,318
It's much more efficient.

260
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,445
A simple cortical implant
would be required.

261
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,573
Another time, perhaps.

262
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,157
( beeping )

263
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,950
What is it?

264
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,537
Long-range sensors are detecting
more theta radiation.

265
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,829
Dangerously high levels.

266
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,665
Source?

267
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,667
Unknown.

268
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,546
It's probably nothing, just...
background theta radiation.

269
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,548
But it could mean
there's someone nearby.

270
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,798
JANEWAY:
Distance?

271
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,010
Approximately
25 light-years.

272
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,180
It's a long shot,
but alter course.

273
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,933
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,269
If that's all,
Commander...

275
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,354
Actually, I'd like
to make a request.

276
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,148
I've been saving up
my holodeck rations,

277
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,067
and I've got
three full hours coming.

278
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,861
Any chance
I might persuade you to join me

279
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,905
for a few rounds of Velocity?

280
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,990
It'll help clear
your mind.

281
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,118
My mind is perfectly clear.

282
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,663
Then what if I told you I'm
not leaving until you join me?

283
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,915
I'd say, "Have a seat.
It'll be a while."

284
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,001
Then I'll be blunt.

285
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,712
You've picked a bad time

286
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,464
to isolate yourself
from the crew.

287
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,384
This ship needs a Captain,
especially now.

288
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,762
Would you be satisfied with

289
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:27,390
"I'm just catching up
on some reading?"

290
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,143
I'm not sure
I understand it myself.

291
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,770
It started when we
entered this--

292
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,979
What does the crew call it?

293
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,230
The Void.

294
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,232
Charming.

295
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:40,069
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for a few Borg cubes about now,

296
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,530
anything for
a little distraction.

297
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,493
Strange as it sounds...

298
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,161
I almost long for the days

299
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,455
when we were under
constant attack.

300
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,914
No time to stop and think

301
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,584
about how we got stranded
in the Delta Quadrant.

302
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,544
How did we end up here,
Chakotay?

303
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,839
Answer me.

304
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,052
We were faced
with a difficult choice.

305
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,887
We had the means to get home,

306
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,932
but using it would have put
an innocent people at risk

307
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,351
so we decided to stay.

308
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,770
No... No, no.

309
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,730
<i>I</i> decided to stay.

310
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,107
I made that choice
for everyone.

311
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,609
We're alive and well,

312
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,236
and we've gathered enough
data about this Quadrant

313
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,198
to keep Starfleet scientists
busy for decades.

314
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,201
Our mission's been a success.

315
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,161
Very same words
I've been telling myself

316
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,372
for the past four years.

317
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,333
But then we hit this Void,

318
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,294
and I started to realize
how empty those words sound.

319
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,046
Kathryn...

320
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,632
I made an error in judgment,
Chakotay.

321
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,218
It was shortsighted
and it was selfish,

322
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,429
and now all of us
are paying for my mistake.

323
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,391
So if you don't mind, Commander,
I'll pass on that little game.

324
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,229
And I'll leave shipboard morale
in your capable hands.

325
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,818
If the crew asks for me,

326
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,822
tell them the Captain
sends her regards.

327
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,990
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

328
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,834
(<i> clarinet plays melody</i>
<i>in minor key</i> )

329
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,029
( door opens )

330
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,531
Sir.

331
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,783
Relax, Ensign.

332
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,200
Anything to report?

333
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,620
Not even a stray electron,

334
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,830
but I did finish
writing my concerto.

335
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,541
I call it
<i>Echoes of the Void.</i>

336
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,084
Got a minute?

337
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,669
Too many, in fact.

338
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,838
Tell me what you think.

339
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,718
( continues playing
in minor key )

340
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,310
Now, when we last saw
our heroes,

341
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,146
they had just retaken
their rocket ship.

342
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,064
Dr. Chaotica had escaped,

343
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,734
but he left behind
his trusty robot

344
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,778
to foil Captain Proton.

345
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,655
My designation?

346
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,325
Ah, right.
You're Constance Goodheart.

347
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:36,329
You're...my secretary.
Secretary?

348
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,122
Yeah. You tag along
on all the missions.

349
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,500
Now, I want you to keep
the robot occupied

350
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,835
while I save Earth.

351
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,672
Computer, run program.

352
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,174
Citizen of Earth,
surrender.

353
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,550
Do not resist.

354
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,302
I am Borg.

355
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,347
( voice slows down):
Surrender...

356
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,349
The robot has been
neutralized.

357
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,684
May I leave now?

358
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,311
Come on, Seven.

359
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,021
Give it a chance.

360
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,314
The galaxy's at stake.

361
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,693
( continues playing concerto)

362
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,785
( alarm beeping )

363
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,913
We've dropped out of warp.
We're losing power.

364
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,414
Switch to auxiliary.

365
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,958
No effect.

366
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,503
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

367
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,020
( indistinct chatter )

368
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,529
KIM:
I was hoping for
a change of pace,

369
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,741
but a blackout isn't
exactly what I had in mind.

370
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,744
I'll try tapping into
the energy reserves.

371
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,930
( panicky breathing )

372
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,685
MAN 1:
Double-check the radio relay.

373
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,228
MAN 2:
Man the lock plate.

374
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,939
MAN 3:
Yeah, I'll get on
that right away.

375
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,774
( people continue shouting
indistinctly )

376
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,575
Get inside
those plasma injectors!

377
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,827
Infuse them manually
if you have to.

378
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,621
SEVEN:
Lieutenant...

379
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,163
PARIS:
Just a second.

380
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,416
I'm not sure
how to work this thing.

381
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,633
Captain Proton
to the rescue.

382
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,218
It's not exactly
Starfleet issue.

383
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,439
( beeping )

384
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,650
Shipwide power loss?

385
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,736
Everything's off-line--
Main power, auxiliary...

386
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,948
Independent subsystems
are operational.

387
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,909
Environmental controls,
holodecks...

388
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,995
Reroute power
from this holodeck

389
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,746
to the emergency relays.

390
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,248
Yes, ma'am.

391
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,210
No luck.

392
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,088
The hologrid is frozen.

393
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,846
( panicky breathing )

394
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,430
Neelix.

395
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,266
Don't mind me.

396
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,352
There's been
a power loss.

397
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,228
Nothing to worry about.

398
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,897
Who's worried?

399
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,315
Come on.

400
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,861
Take deep breaths,
nice and slow.

401
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,320
That's it.

402
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,697
( beeping )

403
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,157
Bingo.

404
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,950
We've got
partial sensors.

405
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,623
I found the cause
of our power drain.

406
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,709
It's some kind
of dampening field.

407
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,627
The source is
off the port bow.

408
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,713
That's about
all I can tell you.

409
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,297
On screen.

410
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,633
Do we have the power

411
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,053
to launch
a photon torpedo?

412
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,013
Maybe one. Why?

413
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:25,725
Perhaps we could shed some light
on our predicament.

414
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,643
I'm reconfiguring the torpedo

415
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,063
to emit a sustained
polyluminous burst.

416
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,397
A "warp flare."

417
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,857
Precisely.

418
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,984
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

419
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,992
I need something
to pry open this hatch.

420
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,922
( growling )
( yells )

421
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,633
Computer,
disengage safety protocols!

422
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,850
I saw something!

423
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,435
Over there.

424
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,275
I'm telling you,
I saw something.

425
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,777
I may be
nihiliphobic,

426
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,653
but my eyes
work just fine.

427
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,781
(<i> suspenseful theme continues</i> )

428
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,702
( breathing nearby )

429
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,788
I can hear breathing.

430
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,546
( growls )

431
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,636
Follow me.

432
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,846
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,725
Torpedo reconfigured.

434
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,185
Away.

435
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,192
I can barely see
the injector ports.

436
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,986
How about a little light
over here?

437
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,737
We can do better than that.

438
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,697
This power cell should be enough

439
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,658
to get emergency power
back on line.

440
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,201
TORRES:
Up here!

441
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,495
We'll hook it up directly
to the EPS manifold.

442
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,208
Emergency power
just came back.

443
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,501
We've got tactical.

444
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,752
Raising shields.

445
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,088
TORRES:
The warp core's
on line.

446
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,965
Janeway to Bridge.
Report.

447
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,759
TUVOK:
<i>The dampening field</i>
<i>has been blocked, Captain.</i>

448
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,761
<i>We are surrounded</i>
<i>by three alien vessels.</i>

449
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,140
Seventeen intruders
are on board.

450
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,391
The ships aren't
responding to hails.

451
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,812
We do have
weapons on line.

452
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,898
Tuvok, target the ship
off our port bow.

453
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,026
Fire a few warning shots.

454
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,741
TUVOK:
<i>Shields down to 64 percent.</i>

455
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,118
Do we have
propulsion?

456
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,744
Not yet.

457
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,997
( groaning )

458
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,372
He was attacked
by an intruder.

459
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,791
These burns
are severe.

460
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,335
( weapon firing in distance )
( grunts )

461
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,212
I disabled the alien.
It may still be alive.

462
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,587
Bring it to Sick Bay.

463
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,298
Shields are down.

464
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,300
They're reinitializing
the dampening field.

465
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,634
We're losing power.

466
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,762
Not again.

467
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,560
They've stopped
their attack.

468
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,312
They're beaming
off the ship.

469
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,856
There's another vessel
approaching.

470
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,025
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

471
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,324
We're
being hailed.

472
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,077
On screen.

473
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,246
I'm Lieutenant Commander Tuvok
of the Federation--

474
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,664
I had to fire
13 spatial charges

475
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,333
to drive those ships off.

476
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,960
I expect to be compensated.

477
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,382
Of course.

478
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,342
Now...

479
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,261
tell me...

480
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,555
what are you doing
in the middle of nowhere?

481
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,022
( transporter beeping )

482
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,523
The bio-filters
are detecting

483
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,276
high levels of
theta radiation.

484
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,694
Compensate.

485
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,488
Welcome aboard.

486
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,949
I'm afraid we'll have
to talk here.

487
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,533
You appear to be leaking.

488
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,202
Yes, yes. My...

489
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,704
isolation suit.
Don't be alarmed.

490
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,998
We'd prefer to be
on the safe side, Mister...?

491
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,000
Emck. Controller Emck,

492
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,502
Malon export vessel,
eleventh gradient.

493
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,005
It's a pleasure to meet you,
and a relief--

494
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,924
EMCK:
I'd advise you
to turn around immediately.

495
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,717
There are more
of those creatures ahead,

496
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,052
thousands of vessels.

497
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,097
They are almost impossible
to detect.

498
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,890
You won't survive
another attack.

499
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,976
We can't go back.

500
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,104
We're crossing this
expanse to reach our home.

501
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,106
Mmm.

502
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,275
Then, uh...

503
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,193
it appears you'll
be coming with me.

504
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,070
What do you
mean?

505
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,447
There's a spatial vortex

506
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,157
a few light-years from here.

507
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,783
It leads directly to
the other side

508
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,785
of the expanse.

509
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,870
We've been using it
for years.

510
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,456
That would get us
out of the Void

511
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,625
and cut two years
off our journey home.

512
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,085
Well, thank you again.

513
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,420
I'm curious, Mr. Emck.

514
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,130
What are<i> you</i> doing here,

515
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,965
besides rescuing
starships in distress?

516
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,134
Ah. I'm on a...

517
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,469
transport mission.

518
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,511
My sensors tell me

519
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,556
that one of the creatures
is still aboard your ship.

520
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,434
It was injured
during the attack.

521
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,144
Our Doctor's treating it.
Why?

522
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,188
Enough questions.

523
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,606
Give me the creature
and I'll take you to the vortex.

524
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,026
Well, my apologies, Mr. Emck,

525
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,362
but I'd like to know
what's going on here.

526
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,071
Are you at war
with these beings?

527
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,948
None of your concern.

528
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,326
Your vessel seems
to be leaking

529
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:38,371
large amounts
of theta radiation.

530
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:41,332
What kind of transport mission
are you on, exactly?

531
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:45,336
My ship will depart
in two hours.

532
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,129
Cooperate or stay behind.

533
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,423
I won't be coming
to your rescue

534
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:53,135
when the creatures return.

535
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,845
I'm finished here.

536
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,014
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

537
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,517
( console beeps )

538
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:07,691
I think it's time we heard
the other side of the story.

539
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,779
Watch your step.

540
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,823
I've had
to lower the lights.

541
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,493
My patient is extremely
photosensitive.

542
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,453
That could explain
why they dampened our power.

543
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,497
My feelings exactly.
From what I can tell,

544
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,333
this life-form may be
indigenous to the Void.

545
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,835
His physiology has evolved to
survive in complete darkness.

546
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,128
His condition?

547
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,380
Minor injuries,

548
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,090
phaser wounds
to the chest and neck.

549
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,675
But that's the least
of his problems.

550
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,635
He's dying, Captain.

551
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,806
Every organ is degrading
at the cellular level.

552
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,101
JANEWAY:
Theta radiation poisoning.

553
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,852
DOCTOR:
The final stages.

554
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,273
My guess is he's been exposed
to it over a long period.

555
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,690
There's nothing
I can do.

556
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,317
I'd like a word with him.

557
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,491
I'm Kathryn Janeway,
Captain of this vessel.

558
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,867
You are allies

559
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,161
with the Malon.
No.

560
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,746
We're simply trying
to cross this region.

561
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,707
We never met the
Malon before today.

562
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,251
They will want me.

563
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,295
Well, I have no intention
of giving you to them.

564
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,046
You're not
a captive here.

565
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,798
( shivering grunt )

566
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,216
Doctor.

567
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,927
Are you at war
with the Malon?

568
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,178
Their ships are poison.

569
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,721
The theta radiation.

570
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,224
They're killing us.
Why? What do they want from you?

571
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,393
Nothing.

572
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,938
This will help
alleviate the pain.

573
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,690
I don't understand.

574
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,942
We were ignorant.

575
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,528
We attacked you.
Forgive us.

576
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,989
Of course,
but I need to understand.

577
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,532
You say the Malon
are killing your people,

578
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,866
but there must
be a reason.

579
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,536
They're poisoning our space.

580
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,913
We don't know why.

581
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,040
( gasping )
( medical instrument beeps )

582
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,959
He's in respiratory distress.

583
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,377
We need to get him
back to his people.

584
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,837
They might know
how to treat him.

585
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,381
I will show you how.

586
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,924
I need a workstation.

587
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,259
Route it to the helm.

588
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,594
If you enter
the coordinates,

589
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,220
my pilot will set a course.

590
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,806
I am grateful.

591
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,100
Take the Bridge.
I'll stay here.

592
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,520
We still don't have a defense
against their dampening field.

593
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,812
If they decide
to attack again--

594
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,314
I'm confident
they won't.

595
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,275
Finally something
to put in my logbook.

596
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,030
Tuvok.

597
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,164
I need your advice.

598
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,124
A first.

599
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,085
Look, I realize
we're not exactly best friends.

600
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,506
From day one, we've kept
each other at arm's length,

601
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,341
but I've always respected
your judgment,

602
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,677
and right now, I could use
a little Vulcan clarity.

603
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,679
Proceed.

604
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,389
It's the Captain.

605
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,974
As you may have noticed, she's
isolated herself from the crew.

606
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,226
She believes that she made

607
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,144
an error in judgment
four years ago,

608
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,188
that she's responsible
for stranding<i> Voyager</i>

609
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,439
in the Delta Quadrant.

610
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,691
She told you?

611
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,275
No.

612
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,737
I've been observing her behavior
for the past four years.

613
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,240
Guilt has been
her constant companion.

614
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,367
You've known her
longer than anyone.

615
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,826
Have you ever
seen her like this?

616
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,994
Only once.

617
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,829
It was during
her first year

618
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,457
as a Commander
on the USS<i> Billings.</i>

619
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,002
She sent an away team
to survey a volcanic moon.

620
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,421
Their shuttle was damaged

621
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,214
by a magma eruption,

622
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,508
and three crew members
were severely injured.

623
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,927
The next day, she returned
to the moon, alone,

624
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,429
to complete the survey.

625
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,846
She wanted the crew to know

626
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,766
that their suffering
had not been in vain.

627
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,184
She could have been killed.

628
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,936
Seeking redemption.

629
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,479
Precisely.

630
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:36,149
Captain Janeway's methods
are...unorthodox.

631
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,360
It is her strength
as a leader,

632
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,614
but, unfortunately, it is also
her greatest weakness.

633
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,616
Stubborn as a Klingon.

634
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,118
To put it mildly.

635
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,495
If she tries something
like that again,

636
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,830
I want to be ready,

637
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,626
and I'm going
to need your support.

638
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,587
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

639
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,922
( computer beeping )
We're at the coordinates.

640
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,592
All stop. Shields up.
Tuvok.

641
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,636
Nothing on sensors.

642
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,178
Bridge to Captain.

643
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,430
<i>We've arrived.</i>

644
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,056
Stand by.

645
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,558
They're here...

646
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,102
but I must tell them
you are a friend.

647
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:15,564
Your communications system?

648
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,237
( console beeping )

649
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,490
I'm picking up photonic surges.
They're all around us.

650
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,746
Captain, we've got
company. Eight ships.

651
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:31,997
<i>Twelve more approaching.</i>

652
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,416
Let's run
a full bio-scan.

653
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,626
We have lived here

654
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:39,171
for millions of years
undisturbed,

655
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,047
until the Malon came.

656
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,842
Captain, every one of them
appears to be suffering

657
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,219
from theta radiation
exposure.

658
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,888
ALIEN:
We tell them
they are killing us.

659
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,266
They won't listen.

660
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,435
We try to stop them.

661
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,270
They're too strong.

662
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,440
What about the vortex, can you
close it? Keep them out?

663
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,192
We don't know how.

664
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,405
Your ship is powerful.

665
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,158
Your people resourceful.

666
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,118
We need your help.
( comm beeps )

667
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,578
Bridge to Captain.
They're locking

668
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,121
onto the alien in Sick Bay.

669
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,331
Lower the shields.

670
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,417
Will you help us?

671
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,890
Poison.

672
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,642
The vessel is ejecting
massive quantities

673
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,976
of contaminated
antimatter.

674
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,520
Their cargo holds
are loaded with it,

675
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,897
over 90 million
isotons.

676
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,649
Hail them.

677
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,359
EMCK:
<i>Captain.</i>

678
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,737
<i>You've decided to join us.</i>
<i>Send the creature to...</i>

679
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,531
JANEWAY:
That won't be possible. We've
returned him to his people.

680
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,242
You wanted the life-form
because you were afraid

681
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,577
we'd uncover your...

682
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,911
transport mission.

683
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,038
<i>I said this was</i>
<i>none of your concern.</i>

684
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,874
Well, it is now.

685
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,834
You're using their space
as a dumping ground

686
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,503
for your
antimatter waste. Why?

687
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:05,758
<i>My civilization produces</i>
<i>over 6 billion isotons</i>

688
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:09,135
<i>of industrial byproduct</i>
<i>every day.</i>

689
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,930
<i>This region is</i>
<i>a perfect disposal site.</i>

690
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,140
How convenient...
for you.

691
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,435
A spacial vortex
to the middle of nowhere,

692
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,729
far away
from your own system.

693
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:21,064
Out of sight,
out of mind.

694
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,608
The problem is,
somebody lives here.

695
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,235
<i>One species.</i> 
JANEWAY: One's enough.

696
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,905
We didn't come here
to debate the issue.

697
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:30,240
We came here to offer
a peaceful solution.

698
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,992
<i>What kind of solution?</i>

699
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,913
My people use
antimatter as well,

700
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,331
but we found ways to
purify the reactant

701
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,834
so there's no
toxic waste.

702
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,544
We'll show you.

703
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,546
Guide us through
the vortex.

704
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,923
We can meet with
your scientists

705
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:49,134
on the other side,
exchange information.

706
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,510
<i>Show me now.</i>

707
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,600
Stand by for transport.

708
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,977
Commander, take our
guest to Engineering

709
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,562
and give him
a demonstration.

710
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,522
Let's turn our sensors
on that vortex.

711
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,858
I want to know exactly
how it works...

712
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,986
just in case
diplomacy fails.

713
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,989
Do you intend
to destroy it?

714
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,200
TORRES:
The residual antimatter's

715
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,912
then processed
in a transkinetic chamber

716
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,080
where it's broken down
on a subatomic level.

717
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,333
What about
the theta radiation?

718
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:25,128
Oh, it's absorbed by a series
of radiometric converters.

719
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,046
We recycle the energy,

720
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,299
use it to power
everything

721
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,259
from life support
to replicators.

722
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,513
We don't have this kind
of conversion technology.

723
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,848
Our scans
of your freighter

724
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,933
show that you have
plasma manifolds.

725
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,810
The engineering principles
are the same.

726
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,103
We're not saying this
won't take some effort.

727
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,105
You're looking at several
months of retrofitting,

728
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,899
depending on the size
of your fleet.

729
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,526
All the schematics
are here

730
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,027
and we'd be willing
to work with you,

731
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,487
get you started.

732
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:54,324
We can even provide you
with some converters.

733
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,786
Ingenious design.

734
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:01,623
Our engineers
would be pleased.

735
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:05,502
This would solve a lot
of problems on my world.

736
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,672
Unfortunately,

737
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,966
it would also
put me out of business.

738
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,342
Sorry?

739
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,511
Your technology would throw
the waste-export

740
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,263
industry into chaos.

741
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,350
Before long, I'd be obsolete,
heh.

742
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,312
Oh, I came here

743
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,648
hoping your claims
were exaggerated,

744
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,192
but I can see they're not.

745
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,322
You can keep your solution.

746
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,991
You lying--
B'Elanna.

747
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,659
We went through
this whole song and dance,

748
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,578
and he never had any intention
of working with us.

749
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,162
That's not important.

750
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,456
What matters is
that we're talking now.

751
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,835
We're proposing changes,
some of them difficult,

752
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,255
but progress can also bring
new opportunities.

753
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,966
Given time, this could turn
to your advantage.

754
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,175
( wheezing laugh )

755
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,511
I already have
the advantage--

756
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,888
The vortex.

757
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,599
No one knows about it
except me and my crew.

758
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,063
By ejecting my cargo here,
I cut expenses in half.

759
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,565
I won't sacrifice that.

760
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,568
I guess mass murder doesn't
factor into your profit margin.

761
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,947
You care so much
about these creatures, stay.

762
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,034
I'm sorry you won't
listen to reason,

763
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,620
but don't expect us
to walk away from this.

764
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,830
You've scanned my vessel.

765
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,041
You've seen my firepower.

766
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,127
You wouldn't survive
10 seconds

767
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,921
in a conflict with me.

768
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,214
Get him out of here.

769
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,259
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

770
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,719
Ah!

771
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,724
( sighs )

772
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,017
JANEWAY:
Options?

773
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,518
CHAKOTAY:
We fight our way past them,

774
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,145
navigate the vortex
on our own.

775
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,396
Once we're
on the other side,

776
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,856
we contact the
Malon authorities

777
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,232
and blow the
whistle on Emck.

778
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,234
We give them
the reclamation technology

779
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,694
and continue on our way home.

780
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,946
Exactly.

781
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,823
Even if we did
get through the vortex,

782
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,450
there's no guarantee the Malon
will do the right thing...

783
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,494
if Mr. Emck is
any indication.

784
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,913
As long as this vortex exists,

785
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,833
the inhabitants
of this region are at risk.

786
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,210
Any chance we could
destroy it?

787
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,588
I believe so,
but there's a catch.

788
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,966
We'll have to collapse it
from this end

789
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,885
where it's dimensional
radius is weakest.

790
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,014
We'd be closing
our shortcut out of here.

791
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,933
Two more years in the Void.

792
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,225
I can live with that.

793
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,854
But I'm not sure I can.

794
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,814
Four years ago,

795
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:34,526
I destroyed the Caretaker's
Array to protect the Ocampa.

796
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,235
That "act of compassion"

797
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,488
stranded this crew
in the Delta Quadrant.

798
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,198
I'm not about
to give that order again.

799
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,825
This situation is
a little different.

800
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,409
Oh, it's close enough.

801
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,454
I'm asking this crew
to make too big a sacrifice.

802
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,999
I won't make
that same mistake.

803
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,918
If you have another
option, I'm listening.

804
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,922
Chakotay,

805
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,633
there's no one I trust
more than you.

806
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,136
You're a fine First Officer.

807
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,849
Are you ready
to Captain this ship?

808
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,727
Yes.

809
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,979
Assemble the crew.

810
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,148
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

811
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,661
Captain on the Bridge.

812
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,747
JANEWAY:
At ease.

813
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,342
Harry, how have you been?

814
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,552
Just fine, ma'am.

815
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,179
Good.

816
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,306
We've missed you,
Captain.

817
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,558
Likewise.

818
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,060
I'll make this brief.

819
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,813
Your orders are to proceed
to the vortex.

820
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,857
Use whatever means necessary

821
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,317
to fight your way
past the Malon freighter.

822
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,820
I'll stay behind
in a shuttlecraft

823
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,447
and destroy the vortex.

824
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,200
Tuvok, I'll need
a class-2 shuttle

825
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,285
armed with photon torpedoes.

826
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,912
Tom, set a course for...

827
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,413
TORRES:
Forget it.

828
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,498
We're not going to let you
die out here.

829
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,042
Have a little faith, B'Elanna.

830
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,045
I'll have a shuttle, plenty
of rations. I'll survive.

831
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,214
Alone in the Delta Quadrant?

832
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,632
No offense, but...

833
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,800
I've made my decision.

834
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,094
What about us?
Don't we have a say?

835
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,386
He's right,
Captain.

836
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,888
I'd be willing
to brave this Void

837
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,598
if it meant
keeping you with us.

838
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,605
Tom...set a course.

839
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,818
Lieutenant,
I gave you an order.

840
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,951
I can't follow
that order, ma'am.

841
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,535
Harry, take the helm.

842
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,833
I'm sorry, Captain.

843
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,960
(<i> dramatic theme grows somber</i> )

844
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,347
I will not comply.

845
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,562
What's a hologram to do?

846
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,565
As you can see,
you're not the only one

847
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,734
who's had time
to evaluate the past.

848
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,569
Yes, I can see that.

849
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,576
You realize
you could all be hanged

850
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,786
for mutiny.

851
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,164
Looks like we need
another option.

852
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,373
We fire torpedoes

853
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,500
the instant we cross
the threshold.

854
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,918
As the vortex begins
to collapse,

855
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,337
we jump into high warp.

856
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,421
There'll be a massive
shock wave on our tail.

857
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,090
I'll reinforce
the aft shielding.

858
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,218
There's still one obstacle,
the Malon.

859
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,261
Antimatter waste has
weakened the bulkhead

860
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,721
surrounding
their cargo hold.

861
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,514
A direct phaser strike
should disable them.

862
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,765
Poetic justice.

863
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,017
Indeed.

864
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,352
You realize it will reduce

865
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,020
our chance
of getting through.

866
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,189
Chance is irrelevant.
We will succeed.

867
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:01,024
A vote of Borg confidence.

868
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,775
Who could argue with that?

869
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,819
All right.
Back to your stations.

870
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,612
Let's do it.

871
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,948
CHAKOTAY:
Red Alert. Set a course
for the vortex.

872
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,992
All hands
to battle stations.

873
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,327
You told them.

874
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,578
They knew coming in.

875
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,538
Let's just say
I wouldn't be

876
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,665
a fine First Officer
if I hadn't.

877
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,919
(<i> somber theme swells</i>
<i>dramatically</i> )

878
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,973
( crashing )

879
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,850
Return fire.

880
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,435
Hit them with
everything we've got.

881
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,817
Their shields
are holding.

882
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,069
Open a channel.

883
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,404
This is<i> Voyager.</i>

884
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,822
Stand down your weapons
and fall back.

885
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,409
( crashing )

886
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,202
I'll take that as a "no."

887
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,745
The vortex?

888
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,705
Two million kilometers
dead ahead.

889
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,873
Bridge to Engineering.

890
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,541
We're approaching
the vortex.

891
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,419
Bring the aft shielding
on line.

892
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:03,586
Acknowledged.

893
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,213
See you on
the other side.

894
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,841
Status?

895
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,551
The port nacelle's
been ruptured.

896
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,220
We're venting
plasma.

897
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,431
Can you get us out of here
on one engine, Tom?

898
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,890
I think so.

899
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,183
Torpedoes
armed and ready.

900
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,351
On my order, Tuvok.

901
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,478
We'll only get
one shot at this.

902
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,188
They're firing
spatial charges.

903
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,522
Evade them.

904
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,325
( exhales )

905
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,576
Captain Proton
to the rescue.

906
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,079
( chuckles )

907
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,538
I'll explain later.

908
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,333
TUVOK:
The vortex is in visual range.

909
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,750
JANEWAY:
Time to intercept.

910
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,211
Forty-seven seconds.
Steady as she goes.

911
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,046
Keep laying down fire.

912
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,381
( grunts )

913
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,258
Direct hit! Starboard nacelle!

914
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,592
Both engines are off-line!

915
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,011
We're riding on inertia.

916
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,054
One more hit
and we're dead in the water.

917
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,265
Without warp drive, we'll never
outrun the shock wave.

918
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,975
Tuvok, can you reinforce
the aft shields

919
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,226
with our main deflector?

920
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,270
I believe so.
JANEWAY: Do it.

921
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,814
We're going to ride
that shock wave out of here,

922
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,858
let it push us
to the other side.

923
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,067
Adjusting shield harmonics.

924
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,695
Captain...

925
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,574
...they intend to block
our path.

926
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,993
Twenty seconds.

927
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,244
CHAKOTAY:
Prepare to fire.

928
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,454
That may not be necessary.

929
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,622
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

930
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,630
The freighter is moving
to combat the aliens.

931
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,757
They're trying to distract
the Malon,

932
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,009
give us the upper hand.

933
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,511
Ten seconds.

934
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,262
The freighter's shields
are weakening.

935
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,264
Target their cargo hold.

936
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,017
Time to take out the garbage.

937
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,485
We're crossing the threshold.

938
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:51,986
Torpedoes.

939
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,036
Shock wave approaching.
600 meters.

940
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,080
Five hundred...
Four...

941
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,498
Aft shields at maximum.

942
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,917
All hands brace
for impact.

943
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,967
Pressure is building
on the outer hull.

944
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,428
Shields weakening.

945
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:17,762
( grunts )

946
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,598
( gasps )

947
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,933
We're clear.

948
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,601
The vortex
has been destroyed.

949
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,103
Are we out
of the Void?

950
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,563
Not yet.

951
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,856
That little maneuver
brought us up a bit short.

952
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,110
We're still 200,000 kilometers
from the boundary.

953
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,445
On screen.

954
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,326
Maintain course.

955
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,511
There.

956
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,762
What?

957
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,098
I saw something.

958
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,891
A star.

959
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,060
Remind me to check
your eyesight.

960
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,271
( console beeping )

961
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,014
Harry,
what do you see out there?

962
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,934
I see a densely-packed region

963
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,020
with thousands of star systems.

964
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,482
Looks pretty lively.

965
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:58,946
Full speed ahead.

966
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,115
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

967
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,038
